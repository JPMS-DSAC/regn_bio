�� (i) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of units applied for.

� (ii) The total number of units to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e., the total number of units applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category � number of units applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below :

Total number of applicants in category of 100s - 1,500

Total number of units applied for - 1,50,000

Number of times oversubscribed - 3

Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 � 1/3

= 50,000

������� Number of the units to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e., total number of units applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio.

Number of units applied for by � 100

each applicant

Number of times oversubscribed - 3

Proportionate allotment to each

successful applicant ��������� - ��������� 100 � 1/3 = 33

������������������������������������������������������� (to be rounded off to 100)

(iii) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 units per applicant, the allotment shall be made as follows:

������� *Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 units; and

(iv)� *The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of units allotted in that category is equal to the number of units worked out as per (ii) above.

� (v)� If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 units. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 units). All applicants in such categories would be allotted units arrived at after such rounding off.

(vi) If the units allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the units allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available units for allotment shall be first adjusted against the category comprising applicants applying in number of units and thereafter the remaining, if any surplus still remains, should be adjusted to next higher category and so on till the surplus is fully used.

(vii) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of 100 may result in the actual allocation being higher than the units offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e., the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the offering.

3.2 Land acquired under lease may either be against:

� Payment of (non-refundable) premium; or

� Payment of monthly or periodic lease rentals

Land acquired against payment of non-refundable premium should be accounted as a Fixed Asset and separately disclosed in the Fixed Assets schedule.

� Period of Lease

� Owner of land

� Relationship of owner with trustees and directors of CIMC

� If lease period is shorter than tenure of the Scheme, the period of lease and conditions for future renewals of lease.

3.3 Land Development Expenses

These include expenses on :

� New access roads and fencing

� Major changes in land contours

� Levelling, uprooting and terracing

� Regular upkeep and maintenance of land

Expenses of a capital nature should be added to the cost of land.

In case of leasehold land, these expenses should be written off over the period of the lease or the period of scheme, whichever is less.

Expenses of a revenue nature should be charged to the Profit and Loss Account in the year in which they are incurred.

3.4 Infrastructure and other facilities shall include :

� Roads and Fencing

� Security and Research and Development Buildings

� Drip Irrigation systems, water systems

� Agriculture Equipments and Production facilities

These should be accounted as Fixed Assets in accordance with AS-10 on �Accounting for Fixed Assets� issued by ICAI.

3.5 IAS 36 requires that impairment losses in respect of assets should be recognised. Impairment arises whenever an asset�s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. All impairment losses should be provided for.

3.6 In case such assets are taken on lease, then the amounts spent should be accounted on the same basis as mentioned in Paragraph 3.2 and the disclosure requirements mentioned therein will also apply.

4. Fixed Assets (other than land and related infrastructure facilities)

4.1 Such Fixed Assets should be accounted in accordance with AS-10 on �Accounting for Fixed Assets� issued by ICAI � Basically that the cost of a fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.

4.2 These assets should be depreciated as per Schedule XIV to the Companies Act, 1956.

4.3 Capital Subsidies received should be accounted as per Accounting Standard (�AS�) � 12 on �Accounting for Government Grants� issued by ICAI � Basically that the recognition of a grant should depend on assurance of the compliance of conditions and certainty of receipts and grants relating to specific fixed assets should be deducted from the gross value of assets in arriving at their book value.

4.4 As required by IAS 36, impairment losses in respect of assets should be recognised. Impairment arises whenever an asset�s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

4.5 In case such assets are taken on lease, then the amounts spent should be accounted on the same basis as mentioned in Paragraph 3.2 and the disclosure requirements mentioned therein will also apply.

5. Crop Development Expenses

5.1 There are generally expenses incurred for development and upkeep of crop. This includes expenses on:

� Soil Manuring.

� Sapling and crop Plantation.

� Regular maintenance and upkeep of crop.

� Lease rentals paid for land and for any other assets directly attributable to crop development.

� Amount proportionately amortised over the scheme period relating to cost of land.

� Depreciation and maintenance of fixed assets directly attributable to crop development.

� Other expenses directly attributable to crop development.

These expenses should be accounted as �Crop Development Expenses�. They should be disclosed as a separate item appearing between �Fixed Assets� and �Current Assets� in the Balance Sheet.

5.2 The total of Crop development expenses at the end of the year should be compared with Net Realisable Value (�NRV�). NRV would generally mean the amount that would be realised in the normal course, in case the standing crops are disposed of on that day. NRV can be determined on the basis of estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost to be incurred in future for bringing the crop to maturity, and the cost necessarily to be incurred to make the sale. In case the NRV is lower than the total of the crop development expenses at the year end, then a suitable provision for the difference between these two figures should be made and disclosed as follows :

Crop Development Expenses (At Cost) ��������������X

Less : Provision for diminution in value ��������������Y

����������������������������������������������������������������������� __________

����������������������������������������������������������������������� ������ X-Y

5.3 The crop development expenses and the provision for diminution will be carried forward to the next year at gross values. A similar exercise would be done at the end of each year. In case the NRV at the end of the second or subsequent year is greater than/or equal to cost in the respective year, then it will be possible to recoup the provision account by transferring it to the credit of Profit and Loss Account only to the extent such a provision was made in the past. The basic principle of valuation at lower of Cost or NRV, would still hold good every year. In case the crop is at such a stage that it is not possible to determine NRV, these expenses should be valued At Cost and a suitable disclosure to that effect should be made in the financial statements. These expenses will be set off against income arising from the sale of crops, either in stages or at the terminal point.

5.4 Considering the peculiar nature of this expenditure and the long production cycle, �Crop Development Expenses� should be separately disclosed between �Fixed Assets and Current Assets� as discussed in Paragraph 5.1 above.

6. Investments

6.1 All investments should be carried at lower of cost and fair value determined either on an individual investment basis or by category of investment, but not on an overall (or global) basis.

6.2 In respect of quoted investments, market value generally provides the best evidence of fair value.

6.3 Unquoted investments in debt instruments should be valued on a yield to maturity basis, the capitalisation factor being determined for comparable traded investments and with an appropriate discount for lower liquidity.

7. Inventory Valuation

Inventories other than Crop Development Expenses should be valued as per the basic principles laid down by AS 2 on Inventory Valuation � Inventory should be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and the Accounting Policy for valuation should be disclosed in the financial statements.

8. Revenue Recognition

8.1 Revenue should be recognized as per Accounting Standard (�AS�) � 9 on �Revenue Recognition� issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, to the extent it is applicable � Revenue should be recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty of collectibility or measurability.

8.2 Income would generally arise from the following sources:

�  Sale of Crops - the sale proceeds of crops arising at periodical intervals should be accounted during the year in which the sale has been effected. The cost allocable to such sale proceeds should be set off against the crop development expenses account and the surplus, if any, should be transferred to Profit and Loss account.

� ����Sale of Residuals and Scraps - the sales proceeds shall be accounted as income in the year of sale and credited to Profit and Loss account.

� ���Income from Investments - income arising out of investments of surplus bank balances, etc. shall be accounted on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
