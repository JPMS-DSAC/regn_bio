substantive  grade  as  well  as in the higher  grade  in which  he is officiating  and  if there

Competent  Authority.  On  each  occasion  on  which  an  employee  is  allowed  to  pass  an 
efficiency  bar  which  has  previously  been  enforced  against  him,  he  shall  be  placed  in 
the  incremental  scale  at  such  stage  as  the  authority  competent  to  remove  the  bar  may 
fix  provided  that  such  stage  shall  not  be  higher  than  that  at  which  he  would  draw  his 
pay  if  the  bar  had  not  been  enforced  against  him  and  further  that  no  increments 
granted on the removal of a bar shall have a retrospective  effect.

"Presenting  Officer"  to  present  on  its  behalf  the  case  in  support  of  the  articles  of 
charge. 

(7) The  employee  may  take  the  assistance  of  any  other  employee  but  may  not  engage

which  they have been cross  – examined,  but not on a new matter,  without  the leave  of 
the inquiry officer. 

The inquiry officer may also put such questions to the witnesses. 

(14)  Before  the  close  of  the  case,  in  support  of  the  charges,  the  Inquiry  Officer  may, 
in  its  discretion,  allow  the  Presenting  Officer  to  produce  evidence  not  included  in 
chargesheet  or may itself call for new evidence  or recall or re-examine  any witness.  In 
such   case   the   employee   shall   be   given   opportunity   to   inspect   the   documentary 
evidence  before  it is taken  on  record,  or  to  cross-examine  a  witness,  who  has  been  so 
summoned.   The   Inquiry   Officer   may   also   allow   the   employee   to   produce   new 
evidence,  if  it  is  of  opinion  that  the  production  of  such  evidence  is  necessary  in  the 
interests of justice. 

(15) When  the case in support  of the charges  is closed,  the employee  may  be required 
to  state  his  defence,  orally  or  in  writing,  as  he  may  prefer.  If  the  defence  is  made 
orally,  it  shall  be  recorded  and  the  employee  shall  be  required  to  sign  the  record.  In 
either  case  a copy  of the statement  of defence  shall be given  to the Presenting  officer, 
if any, appointed. 

(16)  The  evidence  on  behalf  of  the  employee  shall  then  be  produced.  The  employee 
may  examine  himself  in  his  own  behalf,  if  he  so  prefers.  The  witnesses  produced  by 
the employee  shall  then  be examined  by the employee  and  may  be cross-examined  by 
the  Presenting   Officer.  The  employee   shall  be  entitled  to  re-examine   any  of  his 
witnesses  on any points  on which  they  have been  cross-examined,  but not on any  new 
matter without the leave of the Inquiry Officer. 

(17) The inquiry  officer  may, after the officer  employee  closes his evidence,  and shall, 
if  the  officer  employee  has  not  got  himself  examined,  generally  question  him  on  the 
circumstances  appearing  against  him  in  the  evidence  for  the  purpose  of  enabling  the 
employee to explain any circumstances  appearing in the evidence against him. 

(18)  After  the  completion  of  the  production  of  the  evidence,  the  employee  and  the 
Presenting  Officer  may  file  written  briefs  of  their  respective  cases  within  15  days  of 
the date of completion  of the production of evidence. 

(19)  If  the  employee  does  not  submit  the  written  statement  of  defence  referred  to  in 
sub-regulation  (3) on or before  the date specified  for the purpose or does not appear  in 
person,  or  through  the  assisting  officer  or  otherwise  fails  or  refuses  to  comply  with 
any  of  the  provisions  of  these  regulations,  the  Inquiry  Officer  may  hold  the  inquiry 
ex-parte. 

(20)  Whenever  any  Inquiry  Officer,  after  having  heard  and  recorded  the  whole  or  any 
part  of  the  evidence  in  an  inquiry  ceases  to  exercise  jurisdiction   therein,  and  is 
succeeded   by   another   Inquiry   Officer   which   has,   and   which   exercises,   such 
jurisdiction,  the Inquiry  Officer  so succeeding  may  act on the evidence  so recorded  by 
its predecessor,  or partly recorded by its predecessor  and partly recorded by itself: 

Provided  that   if   the   succeeding   Inquiry   Officer   is   of   the   opinion   that   further 
examination  of  any  of  the  witnesses  whose  evidence  has  already  been  recorded  is 

necessary  in  the  interest  of  justice,  it  may  recall,  examine,  cross-examine  and  re- 
examine any such witnesses as herein before provided. 

(21)  (i)  On  the  conclusion  of  the  inquiry  the  Inquiry  Officer  shall  prepare  a  report 
which shall contain the following : 

(a)    a   gist   of   the   articles   of   charge   and   the   statement   of   the   imputations   of 

misconduct  or misbehaviour; 

(b)  a gist of the defence of the employee in respect of each article of charge; 

(c)  an assessment  of the evidence in respect of each article of charge; 

(d)  the findings on each article of charge and the reasons therefor 

Explanation  : If,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Inquiry  Officer  the  proceedings  of  the  inquiry 
establish  any  article  of  charge  different  from  the  original  article  of  charge,  it  may 
record its findings on such article of charge. 

Provided that  the  findings  on  such  article  of  charge  shall  be  recorded  unless  the 
employee  has either  admitted  the facts  on which  such  article  of charge  is based  or has 
had a reasonable opportunity  of defending himself against such article of charge. 

(ii)  The  Inquiry  Officer,  where  it  is  not  itself  the  Competent  Authority,  shall  forward 
to the Competent Authority  the records of inquiry which shall include— 

(a)  the report of the inquiry prepared by it under clause (i); 

(b)  the  written  statement  of defence,  if any,  submitted  by  the  employee  referred  to 

in sub regulation (15); 

(c)  the oral and documentary  evidence produced in the course of the inquiry; 

(d)  written briefs referred to in sub-regulation  (18), if any, and 

(e)  the orders,  if any,  made  by  the Competent  Authority  and the Inquiry  Officer  in 

regard to the inquiry. 

 

 

Action on the inquiry report 

81. (1)  The  Competent   Authority,  if  it  is  not  itself  the  Inquiry  Officer,  may,  for 
reasons to be recorded  by it in writing, remit the case to the inquiry  for fresh or further 
inquiry  and  report  and  the  Inquiry  Officer  shall  thereupon  proceed  to  hold  the  further 
inquiry according to the provisions of regulation 80 as far as may be. 

(2)  The  Competent  Authority,  shall,  if  it  disagrees  with  the  findings  of  the  Inquiry 
Officer  on  any  article  of  charge,  record  its  reasons  for  such  disagreement  and  record 
its  own  findings  on  such  charge,  if  the  evidence  on  record  is  sufficient   for  the 
purpose. 

(3)  If  the  Competent  Authority,  having  regard  to  the  findings  on  all  or  any  of  the 
articles  of charge,  is of the opinion  that  any  of the penalties  specified  in regulation  79 

should  be  imposed  on  the  employee  it  shall  notwithstanding  anything  contained  in 
regulation 82, make an order imposing such penalty. 

(4)  If  the  Competent  Authority  having  regard  to  its  findings  on  all  or  any  of  the 
articles  of  charge,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  penalty  is  called  for,  it  may  pass  an  order 
exonerating  the employee concerned. 

Procedure for imposing minor penalties 

82. (1) Where  it is proposed  to impose  any  of the  minor  penalties  specified  in clauses 
(a)  to  (e)  of  regulation  79(1),  the  employee  concerned  shall  be  informed  in  writing  of 
the  imputations  of  lapses  against  him  and  given  an  opportunity  to  submit  his  written 
statement   of   defence   within   a   specified   period   not   exceeding   15   days   or   such 
extended  period  as  may  be  granted  by  the  Competent  Authority  and  the  defence 
statement,  if  any,  submitted  by  the  employee  shall  be  taken  into  consideration  by  the 
Competent Authority  before passing orders. 

(2)  Where  however,  the  Competent  Authority  is  satisfied  that  an  inquiry  is  necessary, 
it shall  follow  the procedure  for  imposing  a major  penalty  as laid  down  in regulation 
80. 

(3) The record of the proceedings  in such cases shall include: 

(a)  A copy of the statement of imputations  of lapses furnished to the employee; 

(b)  The defence statement,  if any, of the employee;  and 

(c)  The orders of the Competent Authority  together with the reasons therefor. 

Communication  of orders 

83. Orders  made  by  the  Competent  Authority  under  regulation  81  or  regulation  82 
shall  be  communicated  to  the  employee  concerned,  who  shall  also  be  supplied  with  a 
copy of the report of inquiry, if any. 

Common Proceedings

may  make  an order  directing  that the disciplinary  proceedings  against  all of them  may 
be taken in a common proceedings. 

Special procedure in certain cases 

85. Notwithstanding   anything   contained   in   Regulation   80   or   Regulation   81   or 
Regulation  82,  the  Competent  Authority  may  impose  any  of  the  penalties  specified  in 
Regulation  79  if  the  facts  on  the  basis  of  which  action  is  to  be  taken  have  been 
established  in a Court  of Law  or  Court  Martial  or  where  the  employee  has  absconded 
or  where  it  is  for  any  other  reason  impracticable  to  communicate  with  him  or  where 
there  are  other  difficulties  in observing  the  requirements  contained  in Regulation  80, 
81  and  82  and  the  requirements  can  be  waived  without  injustice  to  the  employee.  In 
every  case  where  all  or  any  of  the  requirements  of  Regulation  80,  81  and  82  are 
waived, the reasons for so doing shall be recorded in writing. 

Suspension 

86. (1) An employee may be placed under suspension by the competent  authority :— 

(a)  Where a disciplinary  proceeding  against him is contemplated  or is pending ; or 

(b)    Where   a   case   against   him   in   respect   of   any   criminal   offence   is   under 

investigation,  inquiry or trial. 

(2)  An  employee  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  placed  under  suspension  by  an  order 
of the competent authority— 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

(a)   with  effect  from  the  date  of  his  detention,  if  he  is  detained  in  custody,  whether 

on a criminal charge or otherwise, for a period exceeding 48 hours ; 

(b)  with effect from the date of his conviction,  if, in the event of a conviction  for an 
offence,   he   is   sentenced   to   a   term   of   imprisonment   and   is   forthwith   not 
dismissed or removed or compulsorily  retired consequent  to such conviction. 

Explanation  : The  period  of  48  hours  referred  to  in  clause  (b)  of  this  sub-regulation 
shall  be  computed  from  the  commencement  of  the  imprisonment  after  the  conviction 
and  for  that  purpose,  intermittent  periods  of  imprisonment,  if  any,  shall  be  taken  into 
account. 

(3)  Where  a  penalty  of  dismissal,  removal  or  compulsory  retirement  from  service 
imposed  upon  an  employee  under  suspension  is  set  aside  in  appeal  under  these 
regulations  and  the  case  is  remitted  for  further  enquiry  or  action  or  with  any  other 
directions,  the  order  of  his  suspension  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  continued  in 
force  on  and  from  the  date  of  original  order  of  dismissal,  removal  or  compulsory 
retirement and shall remain in force until further orders. 

(4)  Where  a  penalty  of  dismissal  or  removal  or  compulsory  retirement  from  service 
imposed  upon  an employee  is a set aside  or declared  or rendered  void  in consequence 
of   or   by   a   decision   of   a   Court   of   Law   and   the   Competent   Authority,   on   a 
consideration  of a circumstances  of the case,  decides  to hold  a further  enquiry  against 
him  on  the  allegations  on  which  a  penalty  of  dismissal,  removal  or  compulsory 
retirement  was  originally  imposed,  the employee  shall be deemed  to have  been  placed 
under  suspension  by  the  Competent  Authority  from  the  date  of  the  original  order  of 
dismissal,  removal  or  compulsory  retirement  and  shall  continue  to  remain  under 
suspension  until further orders. 

Provided  that  no  such  further  enquiry  shall  be  ordered  unless  it  is  intended  to  meet  a 
situation  where  the  Court  has  passed  an  order  purely  on  technical  grounds  without 
going into the merits of the case. 

(5) An  order  of  suspension  made  or  deemed  to  have  been  made  under  this  regulation 
may  at  any  time  be  modified  or  revoked  by  the  Competent  Authority  which  made  or 
is deemed to have made the order. 

Subsistence  allowance 

(6)  During  such  suspension,  he  shall  receive  subsistence  allowance  equal  to  (i)  his 
substantive  pay  plus  fifty  percent  of  allowances  thereon,  for  the  first  six  months  of 
suspension;   and  (ii)  his  substantive   pay  plus  seventy-five   per  cent  of  allowances 
thereon for the period of suspension  beyond six months. 

Provided  that  the  enhanced  rate  of  subsistence  allowance  specified  under  sub-clause 
(ii) shall be admissible  only if the enquiry  is not delayed  for reasons  attributable  to the 
concerned employee or any of his representatives. 

Provided  further  that if no penalty  under Regulation  79 is imposed,  the employee  shall 
be  refunded  the  difference  between  the  subsistence  allowance  and  the  emoluments 
which  he  would  have  received  but  for  such  suspension,  for  the  period  he  was  under 
suspension,  and  that,  if  a  penalty  is  imposed  on  him  under  Regulation  79,  no  order 
shall   be   passed   which   shall   have   the   effect   of   compelling   him   to   refund   such 
subsistence  allowance.  The  period  during  which  an  employee  is  under  suspension 
shall,  if  he  is  not  dismissed  or  removed  or  compulsorily   retired  from  service,  be 
treated  as  period  spent  on  duty  or  leave  as  the  Competent  Authority  who  passes  the 
final order may direct. 

Vigilance cases 

87. Notwithstanding   anything   contained   in   Regulations   79   to   86   or   any   other 
Regulation,  the  following  additional  provisions  shall  apply  where  it is  alleged  that  an 
employee has been guilty of corrupt practices, namely: 

(1)  Where  it  is  alleged  that  an  employee  is  possessed  of  disproportionate  assets  or 
that  he  has  committed  an  act  of  criminal  misconduct  or  where  the  investigation 
and  proof  of  the  allegation  would  require  the  evidence  of  persons,  who  are  not 
employees  of the  Board  or where,  in the opinion  of the  competent  authority,  the 
investigation  into  the  allegations  may  with  the  approval  of  the  Chairman,  be 
entrusted  to  the  Central  Bureau  of  Investigation  or  the  Central  Vigilance 
Commission  or any other such agency as may be approved by the Chairman. 

(2)  If  after  considering  the  report  of  the  investigation,  the  competent  authority  is 
satisfied  that  there  is  a  prima  facie  case  for  instituting  disciplinary  proceedings 
against   the   employee,   it   may   send   the   investigation   report   to   the   Central 
Vigilance   Commission   or   such   other   authority   as   may   be   decided   by   the 
Chairman  from  time  to  time  in  this  behalf,  for  its  advice  whether  disciplinary 
proceedings  should be taken against the employee concerned; 

(3)  If  after  considering  the  advice  of  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  or  other 
authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  competent  authority  is  of  the  opinion  that 
disciplinary  proceedings  should  be  instituted  against  the  employee  concerned, 
then  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Regulation  80(2),  the  enquiry  under  this 
Regulation  may  be  entrusted  to  a  Commissioner  for  Departmental  Enquiries  or 
other  person  who  may  be  nominated  by  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  for 
this purpose. 

(4)  The  Inquiry  Officer  shall  submit  his  report  to  the  competent  authority  and  the 
report shall  be forwarded  by the Chairman  to the Central  Vigilance  Commission 
for  its  advice  as  to  whether  the  charge  or  charges  as  the  case  may  be,  can  be 
considered  to  have  been  established  and  the  penalty  or  penalties  to  be  imposed 
under  Regulation  79  hereof.  The  penalty  or  penalties  to  be  imposed  shall  be 
decided  by  the  competent  authority  after  considering  the  advice  of  the  Central 
Vigilance Commission. 

Explanation  : An employee  shall  be deemed  to be guilty  of corrupt  practices  if he has 
committed  an act of criminal  misconduct  as defined  in Section  13 of the Prevention  of 
Corruption  Act,  1988  or  he  has  acted  for  an  inproper  purpose  or  in  a  corrupt  manner 
or  had  exercised  or  refrained  from  exercising  his  powers  with  an  improper  or  corrupt 
motive.

enhancing,  reducing  or  setting  aside  the  penalty  or  remitting  the  case  to  the  authority 
which  imposed  the  penalty  or  to  any  other  authority  with  such  direction  as  it  may 
deem fit in the circumstances  of the case 

Provided that— 

(i)   if  the  enhanced  penalty  which  the  Appellate  Authority  proposed  to  impose  is  a 
major  penalty  specified  in  Regulation  79  (2)  and  an  inquiry  as  provided  in 
regulation  80  has  not  already  been  held  in  the  case,  the  Appellate  Authority 
shall  direct  that  such  an  inquiry  be  held  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
regulation  80  and  thereafter  consider  the  record  of  the  inquiry  and  pass  such 
orders as it may deem proper. 

(ii)  if the Appellate  Authority  decides  to enhance  the punishment  but an inquiry  has 
already  been  held  as  provided  in  regulation  80,  the  Appellate  Authority  shall 
give  a  show  cause  notice  to  the  employee  as  to  why  the  enhanced  penalty 
should  not  be  imposed  upon  him  and  shall  pass  final  order  after  taking  into 
account the representation,  if any, submitted by the employee.
