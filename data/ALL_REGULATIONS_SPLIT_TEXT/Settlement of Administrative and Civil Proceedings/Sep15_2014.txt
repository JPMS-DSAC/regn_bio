(See regulation 8) 

 

GUIDELINES FOR ARRIVING AT SETTLEMENT TERMS 

 

CHAPTER I 

 

13 

1.  The settlement amount (SA) shall comprise of  the Indicative Amount (IA) arrived at 
in  terms  of  these  guidelines  and  the  factors  provided  in  regulation  9,  wherever 
applicable. 
 

2.  Except for persons treated as name lenders, the IA shall not be less than ` 2 lakh for 

 

first time applicantsor ` 5 lakh for others, as the case may be.  
 
Explanation.-A ‗first time applicant‘ is a person who has never obtained a settlement 
order from the Board as on the date of the present application. 
 

3.  Based  on  the  stage  at  which  the  proceeding(s),  for  which  the  application  is  made, 
is/are  pending,  the  proceeding  conversion  factor  (PCF)  shall  be  applied  when 
calculating the IA.   
 

4.  In cases, where an existing business or  activity of a person is either corporatized or 
converted into an LLP or partnership or merged or taken over by a new management, 
the existing record of the erstwhile entity shall be deemed to be the record of the new 
entity. Considerations such as change of name or management or ownership shall be 
irrelevant when determining the liability of the said entity. 
 

5.  Where an entity desires to obtain the benefit of a lower PCF, in relation to any alleged 
default it may, suo motto, before the receipt of any notice to show cause, intimate the 
Board  of  such  default  hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‗intimation  defaults‘  and  co-operate 
with  SEBI  in  the  investigation,  inquiry,  inspection  or  audit.  It  may  thereafter  file  a 
settlement  application,  upon  completion  of  the  investigation,  inspection,  etc.  The 
application shall be deemed to  have been made  ‗Pre- issue of notice to  show cause’ 
for the purpose of calculating the PCF. 

6.  The  IA  is  to  be  calculated  for  each  applicant.  In  a  case  where  multiple  applicants 
make a combined application for a default arising from the same cause of action, the 
IA will be calculated for each applicant, as per the applicable formula except in cases 
related  to  defaults  under  the  Takeover  Regulations  where  the  acquirer  and  persons 
acting in concert (PAC) may be considered to have joint liability. 
 

7.  While  considering  the  application,  the  alleged  default(s)  detailed  in  the  Inspection 
Report or the Investigation Report or the Report of the Designated Authority (DA) or 
the notice to show cause, including any supplementary notice to show cause issued by 
any authority in a pending proceeding, or the facts/findings detailed in the order of the 
Designated  Member  (DM)  or  the  Whole  Time  Member  (WTM)  or  the  Adjudicating 
Officer  (AO)  or  the  Securities  Appellate  Tribunal  (SAT),  as  applicable,  may  be  the 
basis for calculating the IA.  
 
 
In  case,  the  Internal  Committee  (IC)  or  the  High  Powered  Advisory 
Committee  (HPAC)or  the  Panel  of  Whole  Time  Members  (WTMs)  are  of  the  view 
that the facts disclose a different default, the same may be taken into account.  
 

 

8.  The alleged defaults shall, wherever applicable, be categorised based on the facts and 
circumstances as major, minor, serious or miscellaneous, etc., by the IC or HPAC or 
the Panel of WTMs.  

14 

 

 

 

9.  Notwithstanding anything contained in these guidelines, the IC or HPAC or Panel of 
WTMs  shall  have  the  discretion  to  recommend  acceptance  or  rejection  or  accept  or 
reject  an  application,  to  recommend  a  amount,  lower  or  higher  than  the  amounts 
arrived at in terms of these guidelines, in accordance with the provisions of securities 
laws,  considering  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  and  the  gravity  of  the 
charges.  
 

10. In  cases  where  the  formulae  for  calculating  the  IA  are  inapplicable  or  cannot  be 
adapted due to the nature of the default or the facts and circumstances of the case or 
where the defaults detailed in the Tables in these guidelines are not covered,  the IC or 
HPAC or Panel of WTMs may arrive at the SA,  as they  deem fit. 
 

3[11. It is hereby clarified that— 

(a) 

 
(b) 

 

(c) 

  

 
  

the purpose of sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of regulation 5 is not to  prohibit the 
settlements in respect of all kinds of fraudulent and unfair trade practices. 

have market wide impact, or 
cause substantial losses to investors in securities, or 
affect  the  rights  of  investors  in  securities,  especially  retail  investors 
and small shareholders. 

clause  (b)  of  sub-regulation  (2)  of  regulation  5  disqualifies  only  the  defaults 
which are 'serious' and — 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
 
 
Thus,  in  order  to  fall  in  disqualification  of  clause  (b),  the  default  must  be 
serious and it must fall in any or all of the categories mentioned in points (i), 
(ii) and (iii) above. 
Notwithstanding  the  same,  where  both  these  criteria  are  attracted,  the 
application  may  be  considered  for  settlement,  if  the  applicant  has  made  or 
intends to make good the losses to the investors in terms of the first proviso to 
clause (b), provided he undertakes in writing that,— 

'for  the  limited  purpose  of  settling  the  administrative  and  civil  proceedings 
I/We admit the charge before the Securities and Exchange Board of India.' 

 
(d)  While considering its 'seriousness', the default shall be seen in the context of 
its specific nature and the role played by the applicant. The charges against the 
applicant in the show cause notice or the investigation report or the report of 
the  designated  authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  may  not  be  the  only  deciding 
factor in this regard. The weight and sufficiency of the evidence and the basis 
of  the  charge  levelled  against  the  applicant  or  the  extent  of  his  co-operation 
during  the  investigation  /inquiry  /  inspection,  etc.,  if  any  may  also  be  taken 
into account. 

 
(e) 

Further,  the  fact  that  the  case  has  been  referred  to  the  Serious  Frauds 
Investigation  Office  by  the  Central  Government  or  the  fraudulent  and  unfair 
trade practices, directly  or indirectly, pose a systemic risk  to the functions of 
any  banking  or  micro-finance  institution  or  a  systemically  important  non-

w.e.f. 26-8-2016. 

 

15 

banking  financial  company  or  stock  exchange  or  clearing  corporation  or  a 
depository  shall  be  relevant  factors  for  considering  the  'seriousness'  of  the 
default. 

 
(f)  Market  wide  impact:  shall  mean  the  defaults  which  have  a  bearing  on  the 
securities  market  as  a  whole  and  not  just  the  listed  security  and  its  investors 
which is under investigation/inquiry/inspection, etc. 

 
(g)  The  defaults  which  affect  the  right  of  investors:  shall  refer  to  the  qualitative 
and  quantitative  impact  on  the  rights  of  investors,  including  the  number  of 
complaints received, especially from retail investors and small shareholders. A 
qualitative impact refers to an indirect impact on the rights  of investors, such 
as  reduction  in  rating  of  a  scrip  as  a  result  of the  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade 
practices  or  an  increase  in  promoter  holdings  through  a  fraudulent  private 
placement to related parties in default of minimum public shareholding norms, 
etc. A quantitative impact refers to the quantifiable losses to investors, to the 
extent determinable.] 

 
 

4[12.]  In  case  of  an  amendment(s)  or  repeal  of  the  securities  laws,  these  guidelines  shall 
continue  to  apply  to  similar  provisions  under  the  amended  or  new  laws,  mutatis 
mutandis. 
 

INDICATIVE AMOUNT AND THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT 

CHAPTER II 

 
Indicative amount (IA) shall be calculated as follows: 
 

IA= A×B + Legal Costs# 

#Legal  costs  as  incurred  by  the  Board  shall  be  applicable  to  a  application  made  at  the  stages 
mentioned in points “d” and “e” as provided in Table I.

16 

 

 

 

 

1.  In  case,  more  than  one  proceeding  arising  from  the  same  cause  of  action  has  been 

initiated against the applicant, the IA shall be increased by 15%. 

Provided  that  where  the  AO  has  already  awarded  penalty  to  the  applicant,  then  ‗B‘ 
shall be equal to the amount calculated by these guidelines or the penalty awarded by 
the AO;  whichever is  higher.  In cases where the WTM or DM has issued directions 
debarring or suspending the applicant, the RAF shall take into account the value of Y 
as per Table III. 

2.  The amount which is finally recommended by the HPAC after taking into account the 
IA,  any  mitigating  or  aggravating  factors  etc;  and  approved  by  the  Panel  of  Whole 
Time Members is the SA.  

3.  After payment of the SA, the settlement order along with other directives, if any, shall 

be passed accordingly.

CHAPTER V 

BENCHMARK AMOUNT FOR FUTP DEFAULTS  

 
The  Benchmark  Amount  for  defaults  related  to  FUTP  i.e.  B  (FUTP),  may  be  computed  as 
detailed in this Chapter. 
 
However, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTM‘s may, in cases of serious FUTP default, take 
the  Benchmark  Amount  of  the  applicant  as  per  the  provisions  of  the  securities  laws  if  the 
amounts arrived at on the basis of the calculations are found to be low and not commensurate 
to the seriousness of the alleged default. 

 

18 

 
Notwithstanding the above, SEBI shall not settle serious fraudulent and unfair trade practices 
which, in its opinion, cause substantial losses to investors especially retail investors and small 
shareholders  or  have  or  may  have  market  wide  impact,  except  those  defaults  where  the 
applicant has made or intends to make good the losses due to the investors to the satisfaction of 
SEBI.

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FOLLOWING: 

1.  In cases, where the profit made and losses avoided both co-exist, the sum thereof shall 
be  taken  into  consideration  for  arriving  at  the  total  ill-gotten  profit  made  by  the 
applicant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  In cases of issue of fraudulent securities, fraudulent purchase of securities, including 
where  funding  is  though  circuitous  route,  etc.,  the  profit  made  and/or  loss  avoided, 
shall be calculated after taking into account the market value of the securities on the

the value of the securities or the share thereof received by the applicant. 

4.  In cases involving an intermediary, the profit made and/or loss avoided shall take into 
account the gross fees earned by the applicant in respect of the default, by whatever
