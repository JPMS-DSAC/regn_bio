PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

 
The Annual Report of the Securities and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  for  2011-12 
is  written  against  the  backdrop  of  turbulent 
global  economy.  Post  the  recession  of  2008, 
the  financial  regulatory  reforms  have  been 
the  priority  of  every  major  economy  and 
more so with the slowdown witnessed in the 
current year. The securities market regulation, 
in  particular,  is  being  revamped  globally, 
relooked  and  revised.  SEBI  Annual  Report 
for  2011-12  elaborates  on  the  policies  and 
programmes  undertaken  during  the  year,  in 
view  of  these  developments  in  the  domestic 
and world economy, while aligning them with 
the stated objectives to strengthen the Indian 
regulatory framework of capital markets. The 
report  has  been  prepared  as  per  the  format 
prescribed  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Board  of  India  (Annual  Report)  Rules,  1994. 
SEBI  continued  to  ensure  that  it  fulfills  its 
commitment to the three statutory objectives, 
namely:  (a)  protection  of  the  interests  of 
investors  in  securities,  (b)  promotion  of  the 
development of the securities market and (c) 
regulation of the securities market.
 
The  current  year  has  witnessed  SEBI 
attaining these objectives through a series of 
reforms in the existing policies and introduction 
of new initiatives as necessitated. The major 
policy issues are discussed in public domain 
through discussion papers. The decisions and 
quasi-judicial orders pursuant to a thorough 
examination are placed on the website along 
with the agenda papers of the Board.
 
In  line  with  the  stated  objectives,  this 
Report  provides  the  manner  in  which  SEBI 
discharged  its  responsibilities  and  exercised 
its powers during the year in furtherance of 
the  objectives  enshrined  in  (a)  the  Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, (b) the 
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (c) 
the Depositories Act, 1996 and (d) the relevant 
provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. It also 

1

broadly encompasses the global background 
to these developments.

1.   GENERAL  MACRO-ECONOMIC 

ENVIRONMENT
 
Against the revival in the preceding two 
years, the current year saw the global economy 
entering a turbulent phase once again. While 
US  experienced  a  sluggish  growth,  the 
sovereign debt crisis in Europe underpinned 
the  shaky  investor  confidence  across  the 
world.  Increasing  oil  prices  and  a  resultant 
slower  world  trade  growth  has  earmarked 
modest growth in emerging and developing 
countries as well.
 
The  growth-price  stability  equilibrium 
further deteriorated in 2011-12. The situation 
has  been  compounded  with  exchange  rate 
fluctuations  triggered  by  downgrading  of 
US and the monetary tightening measures to 
curb inflation at home. Concomitant effect of 
these  has  been  a  slowdown  in  capital  flows 
and a rising cost of funds which in turn have 
dampened the domestic activity. Despite the 
given scenario, it is heartening to note that by 
any peer comparison the growth rate in India 
remains ahead of most other countries.
 
After a robust growth of over 8 percent 
in the last two years, the Indian economy has 
slowed down in the year 2011-12 to a modest 
6.5  percent.  Revised  estimates  of  Central 
Statistical Organisation (CSO) estimate Gross 
Domestic  Product  (GDP)  at  factor  cost  at 
constant  (2004-05)  prices  for  FY12  is  likely 
to be ` 52,22,515 crore as against ` 48,85,954 
crore for FY11 of and the growth is expected 
to be 6.5 percent as compared to 8.4 percent in 
FY11(Table1.1).
 
Services  sector  continued  to  maintain 
its momentum with only a minor decrease in 
growth  from  9.2  percent  to  8.5  percent,  and 
is expected to boost the overall growth in the 

Annual Report 2011-12

economy.  Industry  and  agriculture  sectors, 
on  the  other  hand,  have  dampened  in  the 
current fiscal attributed to both the domestic 
and  global  factors.  The  growth  rate  for 
agriculture sector may, however, be treated in 
synchronous with the trend as it comes to 2.8

percent on a high base of 2010-11(exhibiting 7 
percent growth). Industry sector, meanwhile 
has displayed a dip in its growth with a more 
than halving of the growth rate to 2.6 percent 
from  an  earlier  6.8  percent  primarily  due  to 
demand and inflationary factors.

8.9  percent  in  2010-11.  With  manufacturing 
contributing 75 percent weightage in the IIP, 
the Industry as a whole treaded on a path to 
shrinkage. In terms of use based classification, 
only the consumer non durables have shown 
a growth when compared with the previous 
fiscal,  while  the  capital  and  intermediate 
goods have showed a negative growth. With 
the  index  showing  improvement  in  the  past 
few months, the sector is expected to pose a 
higher growth in the next fiscal.
 
Electricity has been the only sub-sector in 
the IIP, with its weight of 14 percent, the only 
one to record a higher growth of 8.2 percent in 
2011-12 as compared with the last fiscal where 
it was only 5.5 percent.
Services:
 
Services sector recorded a growth of 8.5 
percent in 2011-12 as compared to 9.2 percent 
in the corresponding period of previous year, 
as  per  the  figures  provided  by  the Advance 
Estimates of the CSO.
 
The  Community,  Social  and  Personal 
Services  sub  sector  is  expected  to  grow  at 
5.8  percent  in  the  current  year  compared 
to  4.5  percent  of  the  last  year,  on  account 
of  incremental  government  spending.  The 
Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business 
Services, meanwhile, is anticipated to show a 
9.6 percent growth than 10.4 percent exhibited 
last  year,  mostly  on  account  of  monetary 
tightening and exchange rate fluctuations.
 
and 
Communication  sub-sector  is  to  increase  its 
share  further  in  the  GDP  from  26.6  percent 
two  years  ago  to  28.1  percent  in  the  current 
year. The sector is estimated to show a growth 
of  9.9  percent  as  against  11.1  percent  last 
year. The growth is attributed to a significant 
growth 
in  civil 
aviation, stock of telephone connections and 

in  passengers  handled

Hotels, 

Agriculture:
 
A  propitious  monsoon  in  the  current 
fiscal  year  has  augmented  well  for  the 
growth  in  agricultural  output,  significantly 
contributed by an increase in rice production. 
Hence the decreased growth has to be seen in 
the light of a higher base of 7 percent, which 
in  turn  was  the  highest  in  the  six  preceding 
years. Though the sector is still prone to the 
uncertain  and  uncontainable  fluctuations, 
assuming a normal monsoon augurs well for 
the trend line to continue in next year as well.
 
From an average share of 19.4 percent in 
the GDP for 2001-10, Agriculture has moved 
to an approximate 14 percent share since the 
previous three years. But given the enormous 
size of population the sector employs as well 
as the increasing demand post 2000, the sector 
has  a  prime  importance  in  the  economy  of 
India.
Industry:
 
Industry  has  seen  a  major  setback  in 
growth with Mining and Quarrying moving 
into  the  de-growth  area.  The  sector  went 
on  from  a  5  percent  growth  in  2010-11  to 
a  deceleration  in  growth  at  0.9  percent  in 
2011-12. Heavy monsoon rainfall along with 
environmental  and  regulatory  concerns  has 
been the major reasons behind the downfall.
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP), 
 
a  parameter  to  gauge  the  industrial  growth, 
has  been  showing  fluctuating  trends  in  the 
past  year.  While  the  initial  slowdown  was  a 
result of global rub off, the resultant domestic 
weakening of demand hampered the prospects 
further. Overall growth during 2011-12 stands 
at 2.8 percent as compared to the 8.2 percent 
growth  over  the  corresponding  period  of 
previous year.
 
Manufacturing  has  witnessed  a  growth 
of  2.9  percent  in  IIP  in  2011-12  compared  to

Annual Report 2011-12

commercial  vehicles.  The  Construction  sub 
sector is to experience a contraction in growth 
on account of the higher interest rates coupled 

with higher debt levels of the sector and rising 
input costs.

Chart 1.1: Share of Components of GDP (at Factor Cost)

Savings and Investments:
 
The  latest  data  of  CSO  points  to  a 
decrease  in  India’s  Gross  Domestic  Savings 
as a percentage of GDP at market prices from 
33.8 percent in 2009-10 to 32.3 percent in 2010-
11 (Table 1.3). The decrease came primarily on 
the back of reduced Private corporate savings 
from  8.2  percent  in  2009-10  to  7.9  percent 
in  2010-11  as  also  the  Household  savings  in 
financial assets moving from 12.9 percent in 
2009-10 to 10 percent in 2010-11, which may 
be  attributed  to  the  inflationary  pressures 
that loomed over the economy for most of the 
year. The household savings in physical assets 
though increased marginally from 12.4 percent 
in  2009-10  to  12.8  percent  in  2010-11,  along 
with a substantial increase in the Public sector 

4

savings  from  0.18  percent  in  2009-10  to  1.7 
percent in 2010-11 due to fiscal consolidation. 
The  investment  too  has  seen  a  dwindling 
trend in both the private and public sector.
 
It  may  be  noted  here  that  Indian 
households have the highest savings rates in 
the world with the annual household saving 
nearly quadrupling in the last decade. While 
the  share  of  physical  assets  has  outweighed 
financial  assets  in  most  of  the  years,  it  is  to 
be  noted  that  the  fall  in  2010-11  household 
savings (as a percent of GDP at market prices) 
to 22.8 percent from 25.4 percent in 2009-10 is 
primarily  reflected  in  the  reduction  in  share 
of financial assets with the share of physical 
assets being nearly constant.
 

In  other  words,  when 

the  global 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

environment  is  turbulent,  as  also  witnessed 
during  the  slowdown  of  2008,  investments 
in  physical  assets  like  gold  and  real  estate 
remain stable or incremental while that in the 
financial assets record a slump. We may hence 
deduce  that  for  financial  savings  to  increase 
the  macro-economic  scenarios  needs  to  be 
favourable.
 
The savings-investment gap in terms of 
percent of GDP has nearly been the same at 
2.7  percent  in  2010-11  as  that  of  2.8  percent 

in 2009-10. The gap as a percent of GDP has 
though increased in recent years (1.3 percent 
in 2007-08) on account of the increased reliance 
on the foreign inflows (savings) to finance our 
investment requirements. The trend as in 2010-
11 though exhibits a slight narrowing of this 
trend. The savings- investment gap in public 
sector has moved from 9 percent in 2009-10 to 
7.1 percent in 2010-11 while in private sector 
it stands at 5.8 percent in 2010-11 as compared 
to 8.5 percent in 2009-10.

Credit Growth
 
The bank credit recorded a year on year 
increase of 17.8 percent in 2011-12  as against 
20.8  percent  in  2010-11.  Higher  government 

borrowing resulted in a shortfall in liquidity 
which  together  with  monetary  tightening 
measures  led  to  a  slowdown  in  investment 
and hence a slowdown in growth rate of bank 
credit compared to last year.

Annual Report 2011-12

and 

 
Non-food  credit  growth  at  end  of 
March  2012  stood  at  17  percent,  showing  a 
considerable  decline  from  the  20.6  percent 
recorded at the end of March 2011. The later 
part  of  the  year  saw  some  improvements 
resulting  from  a  pickup  in  credit  flow  to 
agriculture and industry as a result of easing 
in policy stance.
Liquidity
inflation 
inflationary 
 
High 
led  to  monetary  tightening 
expectations 
during  the  course  of  2011-12  which  caused 
shrinkage in liquidity in the economic system. 
The resultant higher cost of borrowing from 
banks  arising  out  of  a  rate  hike  of  13  times 
between  March  2010  and  January  2012  has 
led the corporate to meet their requirements 
through  external  commercial  borrowings. 
Consequently the FDI flows have witnessed a 
surge as compared to previous fiscal while the 
portfolio flows have been nearly stagnant on 
the back of European crisis and moderation in 
growth rate.
Liquidity injection through the Liquidity 
 
Adjustment Facility (LAF) has been to the tune 
of around ` 0.5 lakh crore in April – September 
2011,  `  1.4  lakh  crore  in  February  2012  and 
further  to  `  1.6  lakh  crore  in  March  2012. 
Further to this, the Open Market Operations 
(OMO)  have  inducted  a  liquidity  of  around 
`  1.3  lakh  crore  during  November  2011  and 
March 2012. In addition to this, there has been 
a reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio of the 
banks  by  125  basis  points  (50  basis  points 
effective January 28, 2012 and 75 basis points 
effective  March  10,  2012),  from  6  percent  to 
4.75 percent, that in turn provided a further 
` 80,000 crore worth liquidity.
Government Securities
Government  security  yield  that  had 
 
remained  nearly  stable  during  the  earlier 

part of 2011-12, hardened up later on account 
of  high  government  borrowing  and  higher 
interest  rates.  A  primary  reason  to  the 
effect  may  be  an  expectation  of  increased 
government  borrowing  in  the  next  fiscal  to 
fund the various programmes.
Inflation
  Wholesale Price Index (WPI), the central 
measure of inflation in India, showed signs of 
moderation  as  the  year  ended.  The  average 
inflation  for  2011-12  was  at  9  percent  as 
compared  to  9.6  percent  during  2010-11. 
Inflation  stood  at  6.9  percent  in  March  2012 
compared to 9 percent in March 2011.
 
Inflation  in  primary  articles  declined 
from  17.8  percent  in  FY11  to  9.7  percent  in 
FY12 while that in manufactured goods rose 
from  5.7  percent  in  FY11  to  7.2  percent  in 
FY12. The fuel group on the other hand has 
shown  a  marginal  increase  in  inflation  from 
12.3  percent  in  the  last  fiscal  in  comparison 
to 13.4 percent in the current fiscal, primarily 
on  the  account  of  high  international  crude 
prices.
 
The  overall  increase  in  the  index  has 
been  contributed  by  higher  primary  articles 
inflation  which  in  turn  is  driven  by  the 
changing  dietary  pattern  of  the  consumers 
towards protein based items, as also the high 
commodity  prices  leading  to  a  higher  raw 
material cost of manufactured goods.
Trade Balance and Balance of Payments
Cumulative exports in India, which stood 
 
at US$ 303, 718 million have registered a growth 
of 20.9 percent in 2011-12 while the growth in 
imports for the same period registered a 32.2 
percent  growth  with  a  cumulative  value  of 
US$ 488, 640 million. While the moderation in 
exports may be seen in the light of a slow global 
recovery, the import bill is rising on account of 
higher crude prices accompanied with a fall 

6

in  rupee.  The  trade  deficit  consequentially 
stands  at  being  56  percent  higher  than  the 
corresponding period of 2010-11.
 
The current account deficit is estimated to 
be at 4 percent of GDP during April- December 
2011,  mainly  on  the  heels  of  a  higher  trade 
deficit.  Under  net  capital  flows,  the  foreign 
direct  investment,  though  demonstrated  a 
considerable increase from the corresponding 
period in the previous year, it was a decrease 
in inflows of portfolio investments that led to 
a moderation in net capital inflows.
 
The  foreign  exchange  reserves  declined 
to  US$  293  billion  in  end  March  from  US$ 
304.8  billion  in  the  corresponding  period 
of  the  previous  fiscal.  The  Rupee  has  seen 
depreciation  in  the  current  fiscal  coming  as 
a result of high current account deficit and a 
weak global macro-economic environment.
Exchange Rate
 
The  exchange  rate  stood  at  `  51.16  per 
USD as on March 30, 2012, depreciating 14.6 
percent  over  March  31,  2011  when  the  rate 
stood  at  `  44.65  per  USD.  The  depreciating 
rupee has been a potential risk to the softening 
inflation.  The  global  economic  climate 
has  further  contributed  to  exchange  rate 
fluctuations with the capital inflows to India

Capital Markets
 
Indian stock markets mirrored the global 
sentiments  with  the  indices  sliding  during 
2011-12. The BSE Sensex closed at 17,404 on 
March 30, 2012 compared to the close of 19,445 
on March 31, 2011. S&P CNX Nifty,  closed at 
5,296 on March 30, 2012 compared to close of 
5,834 on March 31, 2011. The percent decrease 
in BSE Sensex recorded as on end- March 2012 
over end-March 2011 was at 10.5 percent while 
that for the S&P CNX Nifty during the same 
period stood at 9.2 percent.
 
The market capitalisation of BSE stands 
at  `  62,  14,941  crore  as  of  end-March  2012 
compared to ` 68, 39, 084 in end-March 2011, 
while  its  ratio  to  GDP  stood  at  70  percent 
for  2011-12.  The  number  of  demat  accounts 
at the two depositories has risen up sharply 
and  the  process  of  dematerialisation  is  still 
in  progress.  Simultaneously  the  number  of 
listed companies at both NSE and BSE have 
risen  steadily  acting  as  a  strong  indicator  of 
favourable market sentiments. (Table 1.4(a) &

Note : As on last trading day of  respective financial year

  With a view to increase the penetration 
of secondary markets, certain policy measures 
have also been announced in the current budget 
mainly towards the disinvestment policy and 
strengthening investment environment.

1.  REVIEW  OF  POLICIES  AND 

PROGRAMMES
 
Keeping pace with the evolution in global 
regulatory scenario as well as up keeping with 
its stated objectives, SEBI has initiated certain 
policies and programmes in FY12 which are 
presented in this Section.

The  developments  are 

 
categorised 
under ten major heads viz., primary market, 
secondary  market,  corporate  debt  market, 
mutual  funds,  portfolio  managers,  foreign 
institutional  investors,  takeovers,  buyback, 
surveillance  and 
investor  assistance  and 
education.  The  section  concludes  with 
‘Retrospect and Prospects’.
Primary Market
I. 
 
Primary market is a major and prominent 
source  of  fund  raising  for  corporates  and 
governments. A healthy and efficient primary 
market  is  crucial  to  the  capital  markets  and 

8

Part One: Policies and Programmes

mirrors the underlying strength of an economy 
that further provides a favourable investment 
opportunity to the investors. Indian primary 
market  has  seen  a  slackening  of  the  activity 
in  the  current  fiscal  year  partly  reflected  by 
the global sentiments and partly by domestic 
factors.
 
Fewer  companies  have  raised  capital 
backed  by  the  fear  of  failure  in  turbulent 
markets. A  total  of  `  12,  857  crore  of  equity 
capital has been raised during 2011-12 through 
51  issues,  compared  with  `  58,  157  crore 
raised  through  81  issues  in  2010-11.  Certain 

under 

the 

Criteria 

reforms in policies have been undertaken to 
build up the investor confidence further. The 
major policy initiatives related to the primary 
market during 2011-12 are as under:
i. 

Eligibility 
Profitability Track Record
 
The eligibility norms for issuers coming 
out with IPOs through the profitability track 
record  criteria  were  amended  to  clarify  that 
the track record of distributable profits for at 
least three out of the immediately preceding 
five years should be complied with, both on 
stand-alone as well as on consolidated basis.

Box 1.1: Disclosure of track record of the public issues managed by merchant 

bankers/investment bankers

SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009, require that the offer document shall contain 
adequate disclosures so as to enable investors to take well informed investment decisions. Further, a merchant 
banker is required to exercise due diligence and satisfy himself about all the aspects of the issue including the 
veracity and adequacy of disclosures in the offer documents. Therefore, it is necessary for investors to evaluate the 
post-issue performance of the issuer in terms of disclosures made in the offer documents. This will also enable them 
to understand the level of due diligence exercised by the merchant bankers. According to SEBI (Merchant Bankers) 
Regulations, 1992, a merchant banker (i) shall make all efforts to protect the interests of investors, (ii) shall fulfil its 
obligations in an ethical and professional manner and (iii) shall at all time exercise due diligence and independent 
professional judgement.
Therefore, it was felt that a merchant banker should consider the quality of an issue before accepting the mandate 
and must exercise due diligence in making disclosures in the offer document and also during post issue till the 
time of listing. Thus, assessing the performance of the merchant banker is important for an investor while deciding 
on making investment in the issue. Disclosure of track record would encourage appropriate disclosures by the 
issuer and adequate due diligence by the merchant banker, as the disclosures and transparency prevent any wrong 
doing. The disclosure of track record has been intended to indicate the quality of issue(s) managed by the merchant 
bankers, which includes the pricing as well as fundamentals of the issue. With the above in view, vide circular dated 
January 10, 2012, a format for disclosure of the track record of the public issues managed by merchant bankers was 
prescribed. The track record is required to be disclosed for a period of three financial years from the date of listing 
for each public issue managed by the merchant banker This will help the investors to gauge the performance of 
issues on short term, medium term and long term basis.
Contents of Track Record Disclosure
a.  Comparison of issue price with market price- The price on the day of listing, price at the end of month, quarter 
and end of year and high, low during the year for next 3 years shall be disclosed. Mere comparison of the 
market price with the issue price alone may not be the right indicator, as the market price is affected by macro 
economic factors, bull / bear conditions, etc. Therefore, comparison of the market price of the scrip against 
certain benchmark (say, the Sensex or the Nifty or the BSE 500 etc. and also the industry / sector index) serves a 
useful assessment of the performance.

b.  Grade of the issue- Grading of an issue is done with certain rationale. It will provide information on the kinds 
of issues brought out by the merchant banker. In addition, it will help investors evaluate the performance of 
issues as a function of grading.

9

Annual Report 2011-12

c.  Subscription level and if the issue was undersubscribed, how the funds were arranged- This information is 
sought to know the demand elicited by the issue from the investors. There might be cases where the scrip is 
presently trading below the issue price; however it has elicited good response from the investors at the time of 
its issue.

d.  Comparison of the following accounting ratios with the industry average and the peer group
 
 
 
 
 

i.  Earnings per share
ii.  Price- earnings ratio
iii.  Average return on networth
iv.  Net Asset value per share after issue and comparison thereof with the issue price
The above ratios are also required to be disclosed in the offer document by the issuer in support of issue price. 
The disclosure of same ratios over a period of time will indicate the quality of disclosure on issue price.

e.  Financials  of  the  issuer  company-  The  financials  of  the  issuer  company  like  turnover,  net  profit  may  be 
disclosed by merchant bankers over 3-year period after the public issue. This is to enable the investors to assess 
the performance of the company.

f.  Status  of  the  trading  in  the  scrip  of  issuer  company  (i.e.,  whether  active,  infrequently  traded,  delisted, 

suspended etc.) This is required to track the status of the issuer company pursuant to issue.

g.  QIB holdings- The interest of QIBs in a particular issue is an important factor for decision by other investors. 
This  information  will  help  to  understand  the  trading  pattern  of  the  QIBs  and  when  they  exited  from  that 
scrip.
In case of debt issues: , whether interest paid on time along with the rating of debt instrument

h. 
i.  Status  of  implementation  of  project-  The  issuer  companies  are  required  to  disclose  the  schedule  of 
implementation of the project in the offer document. The information on status of project will help the investors 
evaluate the performance of the projects they have invested in and also of the due diligence exercised by the 
merchant banker.

j.  Status of utilization of issue proceeds- This will enable investors to track the utilization of funds for the objects 

as mentioned in the offer document over a period of time.

k.  Comments of monitoring agency, if applicable, on utilization of funds- In terms of ICDR regulations, in case 
the issue size exceeds `500 crore, the issuer is required to appoint a monitoring agency to monitor the use of 
proceeds of the issue. The investors will now know if such monitoring agency has pointed out any deviation 
in the use of the proceeds from the objects stated in the offer document or has given any other reservations 
regarding the end use of funds.

Merchant bankers have to disclose the above information on their websites and a reference to this effect shall be 
given in the offer documents of the issues managed by them in the future.

ii.  Review  of  Policy  on  Allotment  to 

Anchor Investors
 
The  concept  of  Anchor  Investors  (AIs) 
was introduced by SEBI in June 2009 to evolve 
a  class  of  committed  investors  who  can  be 
relied upon to anchor an issue of capital in all 
market conditions, adverse or otherwise. With 
a view to make the concept more effective, a 
minimum  allotment  of  `  5  crore  per AI  has 

been prescribed along with a minimum and 
maximum number of AIs based on issue size.
iii.  Review  of  Bid-cum-Application  Form 

and Abridged Prospectus
The  structure,  design  and  contents  of 
  
bid-cum-application 
form  and  abridged 
prospectus  were  revised  so  as  to  provide 
material  information  to  investors  in  a  user-
friendly manner.

Box 1.2: Review of Bid-cum-Application Form and Abridged Prospectus

Market feedback indicated that the information contained in the Abridged Prospectus had become voluminous and 
unstructured, with potentially material disclosures/risk factors not getting the required priority. The Application 
Form was also considered to be unwieldy and investor un-friendly. Therefore, SEBI set up a committee, comprising 
representatives  of  investor  associations,  legal  fraternity,  merchant  banking/stock  broking  community,  industry 
chambers and market professionals and SEBI to review the adequacy and quality of disclosures in the application 
form(including Abridged Prospectus) as well as the structure, design, format, contents and order of information. 
Pursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee,  the Application  Form  and Abridged  Prospectus  has  been 
revised to ensure that materially important information is provided in a structured, logical and user-friendly manner. 
The revised Abridged Prospectus also contains company/ project specific information and highlights materially 
relevant disclosures such as peer comparison of important financial ratios, risk factors and price performance of past 
issues handled by merchant bankers. The revisions have also resulted in ease of handling the application/ abridged 
prospectus in a booklet form of A4 size, standardisation of form and single form for ASBA/ Non-ASBA, enabling 
download of the application form from the website of stock exchanges and approximately 50percent reduction in 
number of pages in the form/abridged prospectus.

iv.  Disclosure  of  Price  Information  of 

Issues handled by Lead Managers
 
In  order  to  apprise  investors  regarding 
the  performance  of  issues  brought  in  the 
past  by  Merchant  Bankers  (MBs),  it  was 
mandated that the price information of issues 
handled  by  MBs  in  the  past  be  disclosed  in 
the offer documents. The disclosures are to be 
given  for  issues  during  three  financial  years 
(current financial year and two financial years 
preceding  the  current  financial  year)  subject 
to  maximum  10  issues  (IPOs)  managed  by 
merchant banker.
v.  Disclosures  in  Offer  Document  when 
Funds  are  shown  as  Promoters  of  an 
Issuer Company
 
Considering the constraints in disclosure 
of  details  of  investee  companies  of  funds 
(such as venture capital funds, etc.) which are 
shown as one of the promoters of the issuer, 
a set of alternate disclosure requirements was 
specified in such cases in lieu of the existing 
disclosure requirements. Some of the alternate 
disclosure requirements include details of the 
fund  manager,  total  number  of  investors  in 
the fund, details of companies funded by the 
said funds, etc.

vi.  Syndicate ASBA
  With a view to enhance the role of ASBA 
in public issues and to have a wider reach of 
ASBA to investors, syndicate / sub-syndicate 
members  were  allowed  to  procure  ASBA 
forms  from  the  investors.  For  this  purpose, 
syndicate  /  sub-syndicate  members  were 
mandated  to  commence  this  facility  initially 
from  12  bidding  centers  which  account  for 
maximum  number  of  applications  in  public 
issues.
vii.  Mandatory  Usage  of  ASBA  facility  by 

Non-retail Investors
 
In  order  to  increase  the  spread  and 
enhance  the  reach  of  ASBA,  the  non-retail 
investors  i.e.  Qualified  Institutional  Buyers 
(QIBs) and Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs), 
making  application  in  public/  rights  issue 
were mandated to make use of ASBA facility.
viii. Adjustment of Eligible Discount at the 

time of Application
Investors  eligible  for  discount  in  public 
 
issues  have  been  allowed  to  make  payment 
at a price net of discount, if any, at the time 
of  bidding.  Hitherto,  the  effect  of  discount, 
if  any,  in  public  issues  to  eligible  investors 

11

Annual Report 2011-12

was  given  only  at  the  time  of  allotment  of 
shares and not at the time of application. The 
amendment  confers  certain  benefits  on  the 
investors  such  as  lower  cash  outflow  at  the 
time  of  application,  the  ability  to  apply  for 
more shares with the same cash outlay etc.
ix.  Reservation  for  Convertible  Security 

Holders in Rights/Bonus Issuances
 
On the issue of reservation to convertible 
debt holders, it was clarified that reservation 
in rights/bonus issuances shall be made only 
to  holders  of  compulsorily  convertible  debt 
securities.  Earlier,  the  regulatory  framework 
mandated  a  compulsory  reservation  in  case 
of rights/bonus issue to the entire category of 
fully or partially convertible debentures. This 
was done with an objective to curtail the twin 
benefits arising out of price resetting as well 
as reservations to such holders.
x.  Requirements in Respect of Minimum 

Public Shareholding
 
To comply with the amended rule 19(2) 
(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 
1957,  which  requires  the  listed  companies 
to  achieve  and  maintain  minimum  public 
shareholding  at  25  percent  (10  percent  for 
public sector companies), 2 additional methods 
viz. Institutional Placement Programme (IPP) 
and Offer for Sale of Shares (OFS) through the 
stock exchange mechanism were introduced. 

It  was  also  decided  to  extend  the  OFS 
through  the  stock  exchange  mechanism  to 
top 100 companies based on average market 
capitalisation for last completed quarter.
xi.  Disclosure  of  Quarterly  Financial 

Results
 
In  order  to  give  a  better  comparative 
picture  of  the  quarterly  financial  results, 
which  may  aid 
investors  while  making 
investment  decisions,  it  was  mandated  that 
companies disclose financial results in respect 
of  immediately  preceding  quarter  as  well  in 
addition to the disclosures of financial results 
pertaining  to  corresponding  periods  in  the 
previous year.
xii.  Mode of Supplying Annual Reports to 

Shareholders
 
As  a  green  initiative  to  contain  the 
environmental costs associated with printing 
and  publishing Annual  Reports,  it  has  been 
decided  that  instead  of  supplying  complete 
and full annual reports to all the shareholders, 
listed entities shall supply: soft copies of full 
annual reports to all those shareholders who 
have  registered  their  email  addresses  for 
the  purpose;  hard  copy  of  abridged  annual 
reports to others and hard copies of full annual 
reports to those shareholders, who request for 
the same.

Box 1.3: Institutional Placement Programme (IPP)

With a view to enable listed entities to meet the minimum public shareholding requirements (10percent for PSU 
and  25  percent  for  non-PSUs)  under  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957,  the  Institutional  Placement 
Programme (IPP) has been introduced. IPP may be used for complying with minimum public shareholding either 
by way of fresh issue of capital or dilution by the promoters through an oﬀ er for sale. Using this method, public 
shareholding can be increased by upto 10 percent or such lesser percentage as is required to comply with the 
minimum public shareholding requirement. In IPP, the oﬀ er is made only to Qualiﬁ ed Institutional Buyers (QIBs). 
Allotment to minimum 10 alloĴ ees is required with no single alloĴ ee to receive more than 25 percent of the issue 
size to ensure wider distribution of shares. Also, reservation of 25 percent of the issue size has been carved out for 
mutual funds and insurance companies. In IPP, issuer is required to announce a ﬂ oor price or price band atleast one 
day prior to the opening of the oﬀ er. The allotment of shares may be made on price priority basis, proportionate 
basis or on pre-speciﬁ ed criteria as disclosed in the oﬀ er document.

12

xiii.  Disclosure of Voting Results by Listed 

Entities
 
In  order  to  ensure  wider  dissemination 
of information regarding voting results, which 
gives a better picture of how the meetings are 
conducted  and  how  the  different  categories 
of  investors  have  voted  on  a  resolution, 
listed entities were mandated to disclose in a 
prescribed format, voting results/ patterns on 
their websites and to the exchanges within 48 
hours  from  the  conclusion  of  the  concerned 
shareholders’  meeting.  To  begin  with,  this 
requirement  has  been  made  applicable 
to  top  500  listed  entities  based  on  market 
capitalisation.
xiv.  Exemption from Lock-in Requirements 
to  Insurance  Companies  and  Mutual 
Funds
 
Insurance companies and mutual funds 
are  exempted  from  the  provisions  of  SEBI 
(ICDR)  Regulations  relating  to  restriction 
on  sale  and  lock-in  of  their  pre-preferential 
shareholding  in  the  issuer  company,  as  the 
insurance  companies  and  mutual  funds  are 
broad-based investment vehicles representing 
the  interests  of  the  public  at  large  and  are 
primarily engaged in trading (both buying and 
selling) of securities of numerous companies 
as part of their daily operations.
xv.  Redemption  of 

Indian  Depository 
into  Underlying  Equity 

Receipts 
Shares
 
Considering  the  fact  that  the  extant 
regulatory  framework  did  not  permit  two 
way fungibility of Indian Depository Receipts 
(IDRs), but only partial one way redemption 
and also having regard to the fact that allowing 
redemption freely in the absence of two-way 
fungibility could result in reduction in the float 
and  adversely  impact  the  liquidity  of  IDRs 
traded in India, it was clarified vide circular 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

dated  June  3,  2011  that  after  the  completion 
of  one  year  from  the  date  of  issuance  of  ID 
redemption  of  the  IDRs  shall  be  permitted 
only if the IDRs are infrequently traded on the 
stock exchanges in India.
xvi.  Regulatory Framework for Rights Issues 

of Indian Depository Receipts
In order to facilitate simultaneous rights 
 
offering by the foreign issuers (who have listed 
their IDRs in Indian stock exchanges) in their 
home jurisdiction and in India, framework for 
rights issue of IDRs was notified. To simplify 
the  requirements,  it  was  mandated  that  for 
circulation  in  India,  an  additional  wrap 
(disclosing  information  required  in  Indian 
jurisdiction and issue process relevant for the 
IDR holders) can be attached with the letter of 
offer circulated in their home jurisdiction by the 
overseas investor. Disclosure requirements for 
IDR rights issue were also made more or less in 
line with the reduced disclosure requirements 
applicable for domestic rights issues. Further, 
IDR  issuers,  who  were  in  compliance  with 
the  continuous  listing  requirements,  were 
provided  with  the  facility  of  filing  the  offer 
document on fast track basis.
xvii. Forensic Accounting Cell at SEBI
 
A  Forensic  Accounting  Cell  has  been 
set  up  to  further  enhance  the  monitoring  of 
disclosure  of  financial  information  and  to 
assist in detection of financial irregularities by 
companies.
II.  Secondary Market
 
Secondary  markets  are  often  referred 
to  as  the  barometer  to  a  nation’s  health. 
The  stock  prices  in  the  current  year  have 
fluctuated owing to its integration with global 
financial  markets  which  have  been  equally 
volatile. Some policy initiatives have though 
been  taken  to  revive  the  confidence  in  the 
stock  market  and  encourage  small  investors 

13

Annual Report 2011-12

an 

for  Filing 

to invest as well. The policy initiatives taken 
in the secondary securities market for 2011-12 
are as under:
i. 

Limitation  Period 
Arbitration Reference
 
In view of streamlining the provisions in 
the  depositories  with  reference  to  limitation 
period  for  filing  an  arbitration  reference, 
SEBI has specified that the limitation period 
for  filing  an  arbitration  reference  shall  be 
governed  by  the  Law  of  Limitation  i.e.  The 
Limitation Act , 1963.
 Review of Annual Issuers’ Charges
ii. 
SEBI has modified the methodology for 
 
calculating  the  annual  issuers’  charges.  The 
calculation for annual issuer charges shall be 
based on the average number of folios (ISIN 
positions) during the previous financial year 
instead of the total number of folios as on 31st 
March of the previous financial year.
iii.  Modification  to  Investor  Protection 
Fund  (IPF)  /Customer  Protection  Fund 
(CPF) Guidelines
 
Based  on  the  representations  received 
from  stock  exchanges,  SEBI  has  modified 
partially the IPF/CPF guidelines, which ‘inter-
alia’ states that stock exchanges shall ensure 
that the amount realised from the assets of the 
defaulter member is returned to the defaulter 
member after satisfying the claims of the stock 
exchange  and  SEBI  in  accordance  with  the 
bye-laws of the stock exchange.
iv.  Change of Name by Listed Companies

from companies and feedback received from 
the  stock  exchanges,  it  was  notified  that  the 
listed  companies  seeking  change  of  name 
shall  ‘inter-alia’  comply  with  either  of  the 
following:

14

• 

v. 

to 

suppliers 

•  At  least  50  percent  of  its  total  revenue 
in the preceding one year period should 
have  been  accounted  for  by  the  new 
activity suggested by the new name (or)
The amount invested in the new activity/
project (fixed assets + advances + works 
in progress) is at least 50 percent of the 
assets  of  the  company.  The  ‘advances’ 
shall  include  only  those  extended  to 
contractors  and 
towards 
execution  of  project,  specific  to  new 
activity as reflected in the new name.
  Call  Auction  in  Pre-open  Session  for 
Initial  Public  Offering  and  Re-listed 
Scrips
Further 

 
introducing  call  auction 
mechanism in pre-open session for the scrips 
forming  part  of  Nifty  and  Sensex,  SEBI  has 
extended the call auction mechanism to IPOs 
on  the  first  day  of  trading  and  to  re-listed 
scrips  on  the  day  of  recommencement  of 
trading. Duration of the session is set for 60 
minutes i.e. 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.
vi.  Trade  Controls  in  Normal  Trading 
Session for Initial Public Offering (IPO) 
and Re-listed Scrips
 
In  light  of  high  volatility  and  price 
movement  observed  on  first  day  of  trading 
and  recommencement  of  trading  in  case  of 
IPOs  and  re-listed  scrips,  SEBI  has  put  in 
place a framework of trade controls in normal 
trading  session.  The  normal  trading  session 
shall  commence  only  after  the  conclusion  of 
call auction session for such scrips on BSE and 
NSE.
vii.   Offer for Sale of Shares by Promoters 
Exchange 

through 
Mechanism
In order to facilitate promoters to dilute/

the 

Stock 

transparent manner with wider participation, 
SEBI has permitted the offer for sale of shares 
by  promoters  of  such  companies  through 
a  separate  window  provided  by  the  stock 
exchanges. To begin with, the facility of offer 
for  sale  of  shares  is  made  available  on  BSE

Trading  using  Wireless  Technology  (STWT), 
SEBI has issued certain guidelines for broker’s

automated  execution 
the 
guidelines 
that  stock 
exchanges  shall  put 
in  place  effective 
economic  disincentives  with  regard  to  high 
daily  order-to-trade  ratio  of  algo  orders. 
Stock  exchanges  shall  also  have  a  system  to

Box 1.5 : Policy on review of Ownership and Governance of Market Infrastructure 

Institutions and Exit of non-operational stock exchanges

A.  Policy on review of Ownership and Governance of Market Infrastructure Institutions
 

A Committee was constituted to examine the issues arising from the ownership and governance of Market 
Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs). The committee has submitted its report. The Board considered the Report of 
the committee and other related matter and took the following major decisions:
Networth and Ownership Norms for MIIs:
1.  The Stock Exchanges will have minimum networth of `100 crore and the existing Stock Exchanges will be 
given 3 years to achieve this networth of `100 crore. The minimum networth for the Clearing Corporation 
(CC) and the Depository will be ` 300 crore and `100 crore respectively. All existing clearing corporations 
shall be mandated to build up to the prescribed networth of `300 crore over a period of three years from 
the date of notification/ circular.
(i)  The Stock Exchanges will have diversified ownership and no single investor will be allowed to hold 
more than 5percent except the Stock Exchange, Depository, Insurance Company, Banking Company 
or public financial institution which may hold upto 15percent.

2. 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

(ii)  At least 51percent of the holding of the Stock Exchanges shall be held by public.
(iii)  In case of CCs at least 51percent holding will be held by Stock Exchanges. No Stock Exchange can 
hold more than 15 percent in more than one CC. To ensure diversified ownership for shareholders 
other than Stock Exchanges, the limit of 5percent and 15percent shall apply as in the case of Stock 
Exchanges.

(iv)  In case of depositories minimum 51percent holding will be held by sponsors and the existing list of 
sponsors will continue. No other entity will be allowed to hold more than 5percent of equity share 
capital. Stock Exchange can hold upto 24percent.

(v)  The shareholding limits prescribed for each category of investors shall be inclusive of all instruments 
that provide for equity or rights over equity at any future date. The voting rights of no shareholder 
shall, however, exceed the prescribed maximum shareholding limit at any point in time.

Governance structure:
1.  Autonomy of Regulatory Departments in MII will be maintained in order to avoid conflicts of interest 

between regulatory and business functions of the MII -
a.  Member
 

i)  The heads of departments of Member Regulation will directly report to an independent committee 

of the board of the Stock Exchange as well as to MD/CEO (dual reporting).

 

ii)  The long term goal would however be to set up an independent SRO at an appropriate time in 

future and provide the seed fund for the same.

b.  Listing Regulation
 

i) 

In  order  to  prevent  a  regulatory  race  to  the  bottom  SEBI  will  prescribe  the  minimum  listing 
standards to be followed by Exchanges.

 

ii)  The head of departments of Listing Regulation will directly report to an independent committee 

of the board of the Stock Exchange as well as to MD/CEO (dual reporting).

c.  Trading Regulation
 

The surveillance function will report to an independent committee of the Board of the Exchange as 
well as to the MD/CEO.
All the independent committees will have a majority of Independent directors and will be headed by 
one of them.

d.  Besides the above a Conflict Resolution Committee (CRC) will be formed by SEBI with majority 
external  and  Independent  members  to  deal  with  all  issues  concerning  conflicts  of  interest.  Issues 
of conflicts will be referred by Exchanges or may be taken up suo motu by CRC. The independent 
committee  of  Exchanges  responsible  for  regulatory  functions  shall  have  regular  interaction  with 
CRC.

e.  Separation of Risk Management to independent Clearing Corporation
 

Among the functions of the Exchange it is the Clearing Corporation (CC) or Clearing House that fully 
bears the risk of payment and delivery by providing a guaranteed settlement of all transactions on the 
Exchange. It has therefore been decided, inter alia, that the central role of the clearing function will be 
separated into an independent corporation with its own prescribed networth:
i)   Clearing  and  settlement  must  compulsorily  be  carried  out  through  a  recognised  clearing 

corporation under Regulation framed by SEBI.

ii)  To ensure effective supervision of CCs through regulations of SEBI.
iii)  CC will constitute a risk committee comprising independent members which shall report to the 

Board of the CC as well as directly to SEBI on issues and matters so identified and prescribed.

iv)  An  expert  committee  will  be  set  up  by  SEBI  to  examine  the  viability  of  introducing  a  single 

clearing corporation or interoperability between different CCs.

 

 

 
 

 

2.  The Board of Stock Exchanges/ C.C. will not have any Trading Member/Clearing Member representative. 
However, an Advisory Committee shall be constituted by the Board of Stock Exchange/CC, comprising of 
Trading Members/ Clearing Members, to take benefit of experience of such Members. All recommendations 
of the Advisory Committee shall be placed in the ensuing Board meeting for consideration and appropriate 
decision. The Public Interest Directors representation on Board of Stock Exchange shall not be lesser than 
the number of shareholder directors and in case of recognised clearing corporation will be 2/3 of the Board 
strength.

3.  Appointment of all Directors to the Board of Stock Exchanges/ CC will be subject to approval by SEBI. 

Appointment of MD/CEO of Depository will also be subject to approval by SEBI.

4.  The compensation structure for key management personnel are to be based on the principles of sound 
compensation practices issued by international fora like Financial Stability Board. The decisions in this 
regard are directed towards curbing incentives that result in excessive risk taking in the short term:

management  guidelines  of  cash  and 
derivatives market.

xiii.   Investor 

Grievance 

Redressal 

Mechanism at Stock Exchanges
 
In  order  to  facilitate  early  redressal  of 
investor grievances, SEBI has mandated that 
stock exchanges having nationwide terminals 
(such  as  NSE,  BSE,  MCX-SX  and  USEIL), 
functional  stock  exchanges  having  trading 
volumes, stock exchanges entering into MoU 
with  other  exchanges  and  stock  exchanges 
intending to recommence trading operations, 
shall constitute Investor Grievance Redressal 
Committees (IGRC) at every investor service 
centre.  Such  committee  shall  comprise  of 
a  single  person  for  claims  upto  `  25  lakh, 
whereas, for claims above ` 25 lakh, the IGRC 
shall comprise of three persons.
 
It  was,  further,  advised  that  apart  from 
the investor services centres that are currently 
operating  in  four  metro  cities  (viz.,  New 
Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata), stock 
exchanges having nationwide terminals shall 
open  investor  service  centres  in  other  large 
cities.
xiv.  Standardised lot size for SME Exchange 

/ Platform
 
SEBI  has  notified  the  standardised  lot 
sizes for SMEs in case of IPO and secondary 
market trading on SME exchange/platform.
xv.  Annual System Audit
The existing frame work of system audit 
 
has been reviewed encompassing the system 
audit processes, auditor selection norms, terms 
of reference and auditor report guidelines.

xvi.  Guidelines for Intermediaries
a)  Guidelines on Outsourcing of Activities 

by Intermediaries
Intermediaries 

by 

regulated 

 
SEBI 
outsource certain areas of their activities with 
a view to reduce costs and also for strategic 
reasons.  In  order  to  address  the  concerns 
arising  from  the  outsourcing  of  activities, 
SEBI has framed principles for outsourcing to 
be implemented by the intermediaries which 
inter alia state as under:
• 

Implementing comprehensive policy on 
outsourcing of activities;
Establishing comprehensive outsourcing 
risk  management  program  to  address 
outsourced activities and the relationship 
with the third party;
Ensuring 
outsourcing 
arrangements neither diminish the ability 
to  fulfill  the  obligation  to  customers 
and  regulators  nor  impede  effective 
supervision by the regulations;

that 

the 

• 

• 

•  Conducting appropriate due diligence in 
selecting the third party and monitoring 
of its performance;

• 

and 

•  Governing various aspects of outsourcing 
through  written  agreement  /  contracts 
containing  all  material  aspects  of  the 
outsourcing arrangement;
Establishing 
maintaining 
contingency  plans  for  disaster  recovery 
and periodic testing of back up facilities;
Taking  appropriate  steps  to  protect 
confidential information of intermediary 
and  its  customers  from  intentional  or 
inadvertent  disclosure  to  unauthorized 
persons;
Putting safeguards to avoid/ prevent co-
mingling of documents/ records/ assets 
by the outsourcing agency.

• 

• 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

 
Intermediaries  have  also  been  advised 
not to outsource their core business activities 
and  compliance  functions.  It  has  also  been 
clarified  that  in  spite  of  outsourcing,  the 
primary responsibility of compliance with the 
regulations shall lie with the intermediary. The 
above guidelines are based on the principles 
advocated by IOSCO.
b)  Review of Networth of Intermediaries
(i)  Registrars to an issue and share transfer 
agents (RTAs): The regulations governing 
RTAs,  framed  in  1993,  prescribed  a 
networth of ` 6 lakh for Category I and ` 
3 lakh for Category II RTAs respectively. 
Keeping 
the  present  day 
infrastructure  needs  for  this  business, 
vide notification dated August 16, 2011, 
the  minimum  networth  requirement 
has  been  enhanced  to  `  50  lakh  for 
Category  I  and  `  25  lakh  for  Category 
II  RTAs  respectively.  Further,  a  period 
of  three  years  has  been  granted  to  the 
existing RTAs to comply with the above 
requirement.

in  view 

(ii)  Debenture  Trustees:  Minimum  capital 
adequacy requirement of networth of ` 1 
crore was specified by SEBI for debenture 
trustees  in  2003.  Considering  the  long 
period  that  had  elapsed,  the  networth 
requirement for eligibility for registration 
as  debenture 
trustees  was  revised 
upward to ` 2 crore. In consultation with 
the debenture trustees, it was decided to 
grant  them  a  period  of  two  years  from 
the  date  of  amendment  to  Regulations 
to increase their networth. This will help 
RTAs and debenture trustees to improve 
their  infrastructure  enabling  them  to 
discharge their functions in a professional 
manner.

Annual Report 2011-12

c)  Enhanced  Level  of  Compliance  of  the 

the  Employees  of 

Intermediaries
 
  In  order  to  strengthen  the  monitoring 
mechanism  through  periodic  reporting  by 
intermediaries,  a  revised  reporting  format 
was prescribed by SEBI for debenture trustees 
(vide  circular  dated  December  19,  2011) 
and bankers to an issue (vide circular dated 
March  29,  2012).  The  revised  formats  along 
with directives issued to these intermediaries 
envisage increasing the accountability of their 
boards  in  respect  of  review  of  regulatory 
compliance on half-yearly basis and corrective 
measures  initiated  to  avoid  deficiencies  in 
future. This step taken by SEBI would improve 
the level of compliance of the intermediaries.
the  Competency  Level 
d)  Enhancing 
the  Market 

of 
Intermediaries
 
Continuing  its  efforts  to  improve  the 
competency  levels  of  the  employees  of  the 
market  intermediaries  and  with  a  view  to 
improve the quality of intermediation services 
in the securities market, SEBI on September 6, 
2011 issued broad guidelines on Continuous 
Professional Education (CPE) for revalidation 
of various certifications issued by NISM. The 
guidelines required that certifications issued 
by NISM can be revalidated for a further period 
of  three  years  by  successfully  completing 
relevant CPE program or by obtaining fresh 
certification in accordance with the provisions 
of the SEBI (Certification of Associated Persons 
in  the  Securities  Markets)  Regulations,  2007. 
These guidelines were finalised after receiving 
comments from public through a consultative 
process  wherein  the  draft  guidelines  were 
placed  on  SEBI  website  for  obtaining  public 
comments.
xvii. Credit Rating Agencies
 

Some  key  developments  that  occurred 

22

in  the  current  year  to  further  smoothen  the 
functioning  of  the  Credit  Rating  Agencies 
(CRAs) are as under mentioned:
a)  Standardisation of Rating Symbols and 

and 

symbols 

Standardised 

Definitions
 
CRAs  registered  with  SEBI  were  using 
different rating symbols and their definitions 
/ descriptions. Multiple rating symbols in the 
same  category  of  rating  products  used  by 
different  CRAs  could  confuse  the  investing 
community.  This  also  had  the  possibility  of 
unhealthy competition among the CRAs. For 
easy understanding of the rating symbols and 
their meanings by the investors and to achieve 
high  standards  of  integrity  and  fairness  in 
ratings, SEBI standardised the rating symbols 
and definitions in consultation with CRAs.
 
their 
definitions  have  been  devised  by  SEBI  for 
long-term  debt  instruments;  short-term  debt 
instruments;  long-term  structured  finance 
instruments;  short-term  structured  finance 
instruments; long-term mutual fund schemes; 
and short-term mutual fund schemes.
 
The CRAs were advised to take following 
steps for dissemination and implementation of 
the aforesaid guidelines: (i) disclose new rating 
symbols and definitions on their websites; (ii) 
update their rating lists on their websites; and 
(iii)  inform  their  clients  about  the  change  in 
the rating symbols and definitions.
 
SEBI is probably one of the first regulators 
in  the  world  to  come  up  with  this  investor 
friendly regulation.
b)  Guidelines  for  Uniform  Compliance 
Standards for Ratings by Credit Rating 
Agencies
 
The  CRAs  play  an  important  role  in 
the securities markets as investors take their 
decisions  for  investing  in  debt  instruments 
issued  by  the  companies  based  on  ratings. 

CRAs  registered  with  SEBI  also  carry  out 
rating  of  other  securities/instruments  and 
loans/facilities  provided  by  banks  which 
are  not  regulated  by  SEBI.  Such  ratings  are 
being  used  by  the  other  regulators  or  their 
regulated entities for the specified purposes. 
It  was  felt  desirable  that  in  addition  to  the 
review/accreditation  process  put  in  place  by 
the other regulators; such ratings should also 
be governed by the same stringent norms as 
applicable  for  rating  of  securities  issued  by 
way of public/rights issue.
 
In  consultation  with  CRAs  as  well  as 
other  regulators,  it  has  been  mandated  that 
CRAs shall follow the applicable requirements 
pertaining to rating process and methodology 
and its records/transparency and disclosures, 
avoidance  of  conflict  of  interest,  code  of 
conduct, as specified in the SEBI Regulations 
and  circulars  issued  by  SEBI  from  time  to 
time. These guidelines will bring about better 
governance and transparency in the operations 
of the CRAs.
xviii. Policy Initiatives for Derivatives
 
The  key  policy  developments  initiated 
for  the  derivatives  segment  during  2011-12 
are as under:
a)  Self-Clearing Member in the Currency 

Derivatives Segment
In  consultation  with  RBI,  vide  circular 
 
dated  May  13,  2011,  SEBI  permitted  a  new 
category  of  trading  member,  namely,  self-
clearing  member  in  the  currency  derivatives 
segment  having  minimum  networth  of  `  5 
crore.
b)  Liquidity  Enhancement  Schemes  for 
Illiquid Securities in Equity Derivatives 
Segment
SEBI,  vide  circular  dated  June  2,  2011 
 
permitted stock exchanges to introduce one or 
more  liquidity  enhancement  schemes  (LESs) 

23

Part One: Policies and Programmes

to  enhance  liquidity  of  illiquid  securities  in 
their equity derivatives segments.
 
NSE, with effect from September 15, 2011 
started LESs in futures and options contracts 
on S&P 500 and futures contracts in Dow Jones 
Industrial Average (DJIA). The S&P 500 Index 
has been represented as best single gauge of 
the large cap U.S. equities market. The index 
includes  500  leading  companies  in  leading 
industries of the U.S. economy, capturing 75 
percent  coverage  of  U.S.  equities.  The  DJIA 
Index is one of the oldest indices in US which 
includes 30 significant and highly liquid stocks 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 
the Nasdaq.
 
BSE, with effect from September 28, 2011 
started LESs in the illiquid equity derivatives 
segment.  Subsequently,  BSE,  in  order  to 
generate  further  liquidity,  has  introduced 
modified LESs in a phased manner on October 
26,  2011,  February  1,  2012  and  February  27, 
2012.
c)  Modification  of  Client  Codes  of  Non-
Institutional Trades executed on Stock 
Exchanges (all segments)
 With a view to protect investors’ rights 
 
interests  and 
further  safeguard 
and 
integrity  of  the  market,  SEBI  in  consultation 
with  stock  exchanges,  vide  circular  dated 
July 5, 2011, permitted modifications of client 
code of non-institutional trades only to rectify 
a genuine error in entry of client code at the 
time  of  placing/modifying  the  related  order. 
In addition, SEBI laid down stringent penalty 
structure  for  client  code  modification.  The 
circular came into force from August 1, 2011.
d)  Short-Collection/Non-Collection 
of 

to 

Client Margin (Derivative Segment)
SEBI, 

 
stock 
exchanges,  vide  circular  dated  August  10, 
2011  prescribed  stringent  penalty  structure 

in 

consultation  with 

Annual Report 2011-12

for short-collection/non-collection of margins 
from  clients  in  the  derivatives  segment.  In 
addition, it has been mandated that for wrong/
false reporting of client margin, the member 
shall  be  penalised  100  percent  of  the  falsely 
reported  amount  along  with  suspension 
of  trading  for  one  day  in  that  segment. 
The circular came into force from September 
1, 2011.
e)  Exchange Traded Interest Rate Futures 
on 2-year and 5-year Notional Coupon 
Bearing Government of India Security
 
SEBI,  vide  circular  dated  December  30, 
2011, permitted stock exchanges to introduce 
cash  settled  futures  on  2-year  and  5-year 
notional  coupon  bearing  Government  of 
India  (GoI)  security  on  currency  derivatives 
segment  of  stock  exchanges.  Exchanges  are 
yet to introduce interest rate futures contracts 
on 2-year and 5-year notional coupon bearing 
GoI security.
f)  Market Integrity Related Disclosures
 
In order to increase transparency and to 
provide greater disclosure of trading activities 
to the market, based on the recommendations 
of SMAC, SEBI has advised stock exchanges 
to  disseminate  market 
integrity  related 
disclosures  of 
the 
market. In this regard, NSE and BSE started 
disseminating  market 
related 
disclosures on their web sites since January 2, 
2012.
g) 

Introduction of derivative contracts on 
Foreign Stock Indices
 
Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 
11,  2011  on  permitting  stock  exchanges  to 
introduce  derivative  contracts  on  global 
indices, permission/approval has been granted 
to NSE for introduction of futures and options 
contracts on S&P 500 Index and FTSE 100 Index 
and  futures  contracts  on  DJIA.  In  addition, 

trading  activities 

integrity 

to 

a) 

BSE has been permitted to introduce futures 
contracts on FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index (Africa), 
Hang  Seng  Index  (Hong  Kong),  iBovespa 
Index (Brazil) and MICEX Index (Russia).
xix.  Simplification  and  Rationalisation  of 
Trading  Account  Opening  and  Know 
Your Client (KYC) Process
SEBI  had  been  getting  feedback  from 
the  investors  that  the  trading  account 
opening  process  with  the  stock  broker 
was  very  cumbersome  and  required  a 
large number of signatures on different 
documents.  SEBI  simplified  the  trading 
account opening process in consultation 
with  the  stock  exchanges  and  market 
participants. 
improved 
mechanism, all client-broker agreements 
have been replaced with the ‘Rights and 
Obligations’  documents,  which  shall  be 
mandatory  and  binding  on  all  parties. 
There is now no separate requirement for 
the client to enter into agreements with 
the stock broker. Further, the number of 
client signatures will reduce substantially 
and the cost of compliance for both clients 
and brokers will come down.

this 

In 

b)  SEBI had been getting feedback from the 
investors  that  various  SEBI  registered 
intermediaries 
follow  different  KYC 
requirements and documents. With a view 
to bring in uniformity, SEBI vide circular 
dated  October  5,  2011  standardised  the 
Know  Your  Client  (KYC)  requirements 
for  investors  while  opening  accounts 
with  the  intermediaries  in  securities 
markets.

c)  Earlier,  if  a  client  intended  to  open 
accounts  with  different  intermediaries 
for  the  purpose  of  trading  /  investment 
in  the  securities  market,  he  had  to 
undergo  the  process  of  KYC  again  and 
again.  Therefore,  to  avoid  duplication 

24

of  KYC  process  in  securities  markets,  a 
mechanism for centralisation of the KYC 
records in the securities market has been 
developed. As a result, the KYC form filled 
up by the client with an intermediary can 
be used through the centralized system 
when  the  client  approaches  another 
intermediary  registered  with  SEBI.  The 
system was made applicable for the new 
clients with effect from January 1, 2012.

xx.  More  Investor  Grievance  Redressal 
Mechanism  Centres  at  Ahmedabad, 
Hyderabad, Kanpur and Indore
 
The stock exchanges have been providing 
investor  grievance  redressal  mechanism  and 
arbitration  facility  at  the  four  metro  cities 
(Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai). With 
a view to increase investor confidence in the 
securities market and in order to make it more 
convenient to investors to file their grievances 
and arbitration cases near to their places, SEBI 
advised  NSE  and  BSE  to  step  up  investor 
grievance  redressal  mechanism  by  opening 
such  centres  at Ahmedabad  and  Hyderabad 
by March 31, 2012 and at Kanpur and Indore 
by  September  30,  2012.  The  names  of  new 
centres  were  decided  after  examining  the 
data on complaints and arbitrations filed by 
investors from various regions of the country.
xxi.  Mandated Stock Exchanges to send SMS 
and E-mail Alerts to the Investors on the 
Transactions carried out by them
 
There  had  been  complaints  from  the 
investors  against  the  stock  brokers  that 
they  executed  transactions  in  their  accounts 
without  any  instructions  by  them.  SEBI  has 
taken  certain  measures  in  the  past  to  avoid 
such complaints. As an additional measure to 
safeguard against unauthorized trading, SEBI 
vide circular dated August 2, 2011 mandated 
that the stock exchanges shall send details of 
the transactions in cash and derivative to the 

25

Part One: Policies and Programmes

investors, by the end of trading day, through 
SMS and E-mail alerts. It is anticipated that the 
number of instances of unauthorised trading 
may be reduced.
xxii. Strengthening 

the  Fund  Transfer 

Mechanism/ Pre-Funded Instruments
 
Stock brokers while receiving funds from 
clients through pre-funded instruments such 
as pay order, demand draft, banker’s cheque 
etc.  were  unable  to  maintain  an  audit  trail 
of the funds so received, as the details of the 
name of the client and bank account-number 
are  not  mentioned  on  such  instruments. 
This may result in flow of third party funds/
unidentified money affecting the integrity of 
securities  market.  Therefore,  with  a  view  to 
address these concerns and in order to ensure 
that the funds are received from their clients 
only,  SEBI  vide  circular  dated  June  9,  2011 
mandated that in case the value of pre-funded 
instruments is more than ` 50,000/- per day per 
client, the stock broker shall obtain the name 
of the bank account holder and number of the 
bank account debited and in case of electronic 
transfers, the brokers shall maintain an audit 
trail of the funds received through electronic 
fund  transfers.  This  step  would  prevent 
money-laundering in securities markets.
xxiii.  Processing  of  investor  complaints  in 

SEBI Complaints Redress System
 
SEBI  has  commenced  processing  of 
investor grievances against the intermediaries 
and  listed  companies  in  a  centralized  web-
based  complaints  redress  system,  SEBI 
Complaints  Redress  System  (SCORES).  This 
will assist the investors in easily lodging their 
complaints  as  well  as  track  their  status.  The 
salient features of this system are: Centralised 
database of all complaints; online movement 
of complaints to the concerned entities; online 
upload  of  Action  Taken  Reports  (ATRs)  by 
the concerned entities; and online tracking of 

Annual Report 2011-12

status of complaints by investors.
xxiv.   Due  Diligence  Records 

to  be 

Maintained by Merchant Bankers
 
SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations,  2009  inter 
alia  require  the  merchant  bankers  (MBs)  to 
exercise due diligence and satisfy themselves 
about  all  aspects  of  the  issue  including  the 
veracity  and  adequacy  of  disclosures  in  the 
offer  documents,  to  co-ordinate  with  other 
intermediaries  involved  in  the  issue  process 
and  to  redress  investor  grievances.  Further, 
MBs  are  required  to  submit  due  diligence 
certificates to SEBI at various stages of issue, 
based  on  examination  of  certain  records 
and  documents.  Offer  documents  that  carry 
disclosures  made  after  an  effective  due 
diligence are the basis upon which investment 
decisions are taken by investors.
 
However, during inspections by SEBI, it 
was observed that MBs were not maintaining 
adequate supporting documents and records 
in respect of due diligence exercised by them, 
making  it  difficult  for  SEBI  to  ascertain  the 
level  of  due  diligence  conducted  by  them. 
Further, SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 
1992, also did not prescribe any records to be 
maintained in relation to the important aspect 
of due diligence which is the core activity of 
merchant bankers.
 
In  view  of  the  same,  SEBI  (Merchant 
Bankers)  Regulations,  1992  were  amended 
vide  notification  dated  August  16,  2011, 
requiring  MBs  to  maintain  records  and 
documents  pertaining 
to  due  diligence 
exercised in pre-issue and post-issue activities 
of issue management, and in case of takeover, 
buyback and delisting of securities. This will 
not  only  improve  the  compliance  standards 
in  the  industry  but  also  strengthen  the 
inspections conducted by SEBI.

III.  Corporate Debt Market
Shut Period
i. 
 
To bring about uniformity in shut periods 
for corporate bonds, SEBI in June 2011 directed 
exchanges  to  do  away  with  shut  period  for 
interest  payments  or  for  part-redemptions. 
Further,  SEBI  directed  exchanges  to  ensure 
that issuers have a record date not more than 
15 days prior to book closure for all prospective 
privately placed issues of corporate bonds.
ii.  Structured Products
 
In  September  2011,  SEBI  put  in  place 
framework  for  issue  of  Structured  Products. 
Structured products are issued in India as debt 
instruments with returns linked to equity or 
other underlying assets. In view of the nature 
of  risk  profile  of  such  securities,  additional 
disclosures were specified in offer documents 
for  issue  of  structured  products  that  seek 
listing on stock exchanges. Only issuers that 
have a minimum net-worth of ` 100 crore are 
eligible to issue such instruments. Minimum 
ticket  size  for  subscribing  to  such  securities 
is ` 10 lakh. Other norms include additional 
disclosures  pertaining  to  riskiness  of  such 
instruments,  scenario  analysis  showing  its 
value  under  various  market  conditions, 
commission structure embedded therein and 
requirements  for  primary  issuance  and  sale 
of  securities  to  retail  investors.  Third  party 
valuation of such securities by a credit rating 
agency  has  been  made  mandatory  and  the 
same shall be disclosed to public.
iii.  Ban  on  Incentives  in  Public  Issue  of 

Debt
 
In December 2011, SEBI advised that in 
respect of public issues of debt securities, no 
person  connected  with  the  issue  shall  offer 
any  incentive,  whether  direct  or  indirect, 
in  any  manner,  whether  in  cash  or  kind  or 
services  or  otherwise  to  any  person  making 
an application for allotment of such securities.

making AMC responsible for due diligence of 
distributors, ensuring convenience to investors 
by  way  of  provisioning  for  consolidated 
account 
incentivizing 
distributors for mobilisation of savings from 
urban and smaller towns to the mutual fund 
industry by way of introduction of transaction 
charge.  A  detailed  description  of  initiated 
steps during 2011-12 is as follows:
i.  Option to hold Units in Demat Form
In  order  to  facilitate  investors,  mutual 
 
funds/AMCs  are  advised 
invariably 
provide  an  option  to  the  investors  in  all 
schemes  (existing/new)  to  mention  demat 
account  details  in  the  subscription  form,  in 
case they desire to hold units in demat form 
while  subscribing.  Mutual  funds/AMCs  are 
advised to obtain ISIN for each option of the 
scheme  and  quote  the  respective  ISIN  along 
with the name of the scheme, in all Statement 
of  Account/Consolidated  Account  Statement 
issued to the investors.
ii. 

Intended Portfolio Disclosure in Close 
Ended Debt Schemes
 
In  order  to  enable  investors  to  make  a 
more informed decision regarding the quality 
of securities and risk associated with different 
close  ended  debt  oriented  schemes,  mutual 
funds/AMCs were advised to make additional 
disclosures with respect to intended allocation 
for  instruments  such  as  CPs,  CDs,  NCDs, 
securitised debt, etc with floor ceiling within 
a range of five percent against each sub asset 
class/credit  rating  without  indicating  the 
portfolio or yield, directly or indirectly. This 
would  be  accompanied  by  credit  evaluation 
policy for investments in debt securities and 
list of sectors where the scheme/s would not 
be  investing.  Variations  between  intended 
portfolio  and  final  portfolio  will  not  be 
permissible.

towards 

approaches 

This  was  done  to  prevent  the  practice  of 
some  brokers/  distributors  passing  on  part 
of  their  brokerage/  commission  to  the  final 
investor(s)  for  subscription  to  such  public 
issue  of  debt  which  resulted  in  an  unfair 
advantage/bargaining  power  to  a  certain  set 
of  investors  and  distributors  while  on  the 
other hand adding to the cost of issuance for 
the company.
IV.  Mutual Funds
 
The  year  2011-12  witnessed  manifold 
regulatory 
the 
development  and  growth  of  mutual  funds 
industry  in  India.  The  developmental  goals 
were  addressed  by  providing  provisions  for 
infrastructure  debt  funds,  bringing  depth  in 
terms  of  allowing  new  class  of  investors  i.e. 
Qualified  Foreign  Investors  (QFIs)  and  new 
investment  avenues  for  fund  managers  by 
enabling repo transactions in corporate debt 
securities.
 
regulatory  approaches  were 
Other 
oriented towards giving fair treatment to all 
class of investors by providing the overarching 
and  overriding  principles  of  valuation  to 
ensure fair treatment to all investors including 
existing investors as well as investors seeking 
to purchase or redeem units of mutual funds, 
enhancing  accuracy,  fairness,  completeness 
and  unambiguity  in  AMC  communications 
and  scheme  advertisements  by  amending 
the  advertisement  code  more 
towards 
principle  based,  provisioning  disclosure  of 
intended  portfolio  for  closed  ended  debt 
schemes to enable investors to make a more 
informed  decision,  bringing  transparency 
in  performance  disclosures,  disclosure 
of  commissions  paid  to  the  distributors, 
etc.,  ensuring  higher  standards  of  investor 
servicing  by  provisioning  for  options  to  all 
investors  in  all  types  of  schemes  (existing/
new)  for  issuance  of  units  in  demat  form,

Annual Report 2011-12

iii.  Transaction Charges
 
To enable increased reach of mutual fund 
products  in  urban  areas  and  smaller  towns, 
it  was  decided  that  a  transaction  charge 
per  subscription  of  `10,000/-  and  above  be 
allowed  to  be  paid  to  the  distributors.  For 
existing investors, the transaction charge paid 
to  the  distributors  would  be  of  `100/-  and 
as  an  incentive  to  attract  new  investors,  the 
distributor may be paid `150/- as transaction 
charge for a first time investor in mutual funds. 
In  case  of  SIPs,  the  transaction  charge  shall 
be  applicable  only  if  the  total  commitment 
through SIPs amounts to `10,000/- and above. 
In  such  cases,  the  transaction  charge  shall 
be  recovered  in  3-4  installments.  However, 
there shall be no transaction charges on direct 
investments.
iv.  Commission Disclosure
 
Mutual funds / AMCs have been required 
to  disclose  on  their  respective  websites  the 
total commission and expenses paid to ‘select’ 
distributors  who  have  either  multiple  point 
of presence (more than 20 locations) or have 
AUM raised over ` 100 crore across industry 
in the non institutional category but including 
high networth individuals (HNIs) or received 
commission  of  over  `  1  crore  p.a.  across 
industry  or  a  commission  of  over  `  50  lakh 
from  a  single  AMC.  AMFI  shall  consolidate 
data on industry basis and disseminate on its 
website.
v.  Due  Diligence  on  Distributors  of 

Mutual Fund Products
 
It  was  felt  in  the  interest  of  investors, 
that AMCs, shall, undertake a due diligence 
process on select ‘large’ distributors through 
an assessment of factors like business model, 
record  of  regulatory  fines  and  penalties 
and  customer  compensations,  review  of 
business  associates  on  the  said  factors;  and 

28

organisational controls to ensure that certain 
processes 
like  customer  risk  evaluation 
and  mutual  fund  scheme  appropriateness 
evaluation  are  delinked  from  sales  and 
relationship management. In that respect, all 
customer relationship and transactions are to 
be  categorised  as  either  ‘advisory’  based  on 
principle  of  ‘appropriateness’  of  products  to 
that customer category or ‘execution’ only for 
transactions that are not booked as ‘advisory’. 
For ‘execution only’ transactions, the customer 
is not required to pay the distributor anything 
other  than  the  standard  flat  transaction 
charge.
There  shall  be  no  third  categorisation 
 
of  customer  relationship.  AMCs  shall  also 
review  defined  management  processes  for 
compliance and risk management functions of 
the distributor. Due diligence of distributors 
is  solely  the  responsibility  of  mutual  funds/
AMCs.

a  period  of  one  year  from  the  date  of 
notification of these provisions.

xi.  Resolving Conflict of Interest in Fund 

Management
 
An AMC may undertake other business 
activities under provisions of Regulation 24 of 
Mutual Funds Regulations. The scope of this 
Regulation was restructured vide notification 
dated August 30, 2011 to outline a broad based 
activity  vis-à-vis  non  broad  based  activity 
as  also  to  help  address  potential  conflicts 
of  interest  between  mutual  fund  and  other 
activities.  As  per  the  amended  provisions, 
mutual 
funds  shall  not  undertake  any 
business activities other than in the nature of 
management and advisory services provided 
to  pooled  assets.  To  maintain  Chinese  walls 
between  such  activities  and  mutual  fund, 
AMC  shall  inter  alia  ensure  segregation  of 
accounts; maintain separate capital adequacy 
requirements, appoint separate fund manager 
for each separate fund managed by it unless the 
investment objectives and assets allocations are 
the same and the portfolio is replicated across 
all the funds managed by the fund manager. 
It  was  further  clarified  that  replication  of 
minimum 70 percent of portfolio value shall 
be considered as adequate for the purpose of 
said  compliance,  provided  that AMC  has  in 
place a written policy for trade allocation and 
it ensures at all points of time that the fund 

30

manager shall not take directionally opposite 
positions in the schemes managed by him.
 
Mutual  funds  are  also  required  to 
disclose  absence  of  conflict  of  interest  and 
make  adequate  disclosures  for  unavoidable 
conflict  of  interest  situations.  AMCs  are 
required  to  disclose  all  returns  provided  by 
the said manager for all the schemes (mutual 
fund,  pension  funds,  offshore  funds  etc)  on 
a  monthly  basis.  For  portfolio  management 
activity, separate capital adequacy is required 
besides the prescribed Chinese walls.

RBI  has  issued  the  detailed  guidelines  vide 
circular dated August 09, 2011, as per which 
foreign investors (termed as QFIs) who meet

xiii.  Introduction 

Provisions 
Infrastructure Debt Fund Schemes
 
Hon’ble Finance Minister in his Budget 
Speech for 2011-12 had announced setting up 
of Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDFs) in order to 
accelerate and enhance the flow of long term 
debt  in  infrastructure  projects  for  funding 
the  Government’s  ambitious  programme  of 
infrastructure development. To operationalise 
the above, under extant SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulations,  1996,  SEBI  in  consultation  with 
the  Government,  RBI,  industry  participants, 
etc.  has  issued  the  regulatory  guidelines  for 
‘Infrastructure  Debt  Fund  Schemes’  under 
Chapter VI B of Mutual Fund Regulations vide 
notification dated August 30, 2011. As per the 
regulatory provisions an “Infrastructure debt 
fund  scheme”  would  mean  a  mutual  fund 
scheme  that  invests  minimum  90  percent  of 
scheme  assets  in  the  notified  infrastructure 
debt  securities.  The  salient  features  of  such 
scheme  would  be  either  as  close-ended 
scheme  maturing  after  more  than  five  years 
or interval scheme with lock-in of five years. 
Minimum size of a unit in such scheme shall 
be `10 lakh and minimum investment for an 
investor  `  One  crore.  Units  of  scheme  shall 
be  listed  on  a  recognized  stock  exchange, 
after being fully paid up. Such scheme shall 
have  firm  commitment  from  the  strategic 
investor’s for contribution of an amount of at 
least ` 25 crore. For diversification purposes, 
scheme  shall  have  minimum  five  investors 
and  no  single  investor  shall  hold  more  than 
50  percent  of  scheme  assets.  Assets  held  by 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

an  infrastructure  debt  fund  scheme  shall  be 
valued  “in  good  faith”  by  the  AMC  on  the 
basis of appropriate valuation methods based 
on principles approved by the trustees.
Accordingly,  the  format  for  monthly 
 
cumulative  report  (MCR)  was  modified  to 
include 
infrastructure  debt  schemes  and 
mutual funds.
xiv.  Participation of Mutual Funds in Repo 

in Corporate Debt Securities
To  widen  the  avenues  of  investment 
 
assets in debt markets, guidelines were issued 
to  enable  participation  of  mutual  funds  in 
repo of corporate debt securities with primary 
conditions that participation be only in AAA 
rated  corporate  debt  securities,  tenor  of  the 
transaction  shall  not  exceed  six  months  and 
that  gross  exposure  shall  not  be  more  than 
10 percent of assets of the concerned scheme. 
Trustees and the AMCs shall frame guidelines 
in the category of counterparty, its credit rating, 
tenor of collateral and applicable haircuts in 
context  of  these  transactions.  Details  related 
to such repos shall be disclosed on half-yearly 
basis.
xv.  Review  of  Advertisement  Code  for 

Mutual Funds
 
Focus  of  advertisement  code  has  been 
shifted  from  rule  based  approach  to  move 
more  towards  principle  based  approach.  To 
ensure  accuracy,  fairness,  transparency  etc. 
the advertisement code for mutual funds were 
amended  vide  notification  dated  February 
21,  2012.  As  per  the  amended  provisions 
“advertisement” of mutual funds or its schemes 
shall  include  all  forms  of  communication 
issued  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  AMC/mutual 
fund that may influence investment decisions 
of  any  investor/prospective  investors.  The 
advertisements  shall  be  accurate,  true,  fair, 
clear,  complete,  unambiguous  and  concise 

31

Annual Report 2011-12

and  shall  not  contain  statements  which  are 
false, misleading, biased or deceptive, based 
on  assumption/projections  and  shall  not 
contain any testimonials or any ranking based 
on any criteria. The mutual funds and/or the 
AMC  shall  be  liable  for  action  in  case  the 
advertisement issued is in contravention with 
the advertisement code.
xvi.  Review of Valuation Norms
 
The  valuation  norms  were  reviewed  to 
ensure fair treatment to all investors including 
existing investors as well as investors seeking 
to purchase or redeem units of mutual funds, 
accordingly  the  overarching  and  overriding 
principles of fair valuation have been outlined 
vide notification dated February 21, 2012 and 
the effort was to move more towards principle 
based  regulations  though  within  the  above 
overarching  principles,  the  AMCs  will  be 
required  to  follow  the  valuation  guidelines 
elaborated 
the  SEBI(Mutual  Fund) 
Regulations. The valuation of investments shall 
be based on the principles of fair valuation i.e. 
valuation shall be reflective of the realizable 
value  of  the  securities/assets.  The  valuation 
shall  be  done  in  good  faith  and  in  true  and 
fair  manner  through  appropriate  valuation 
policies  and  procedures.  These  principles 
inter alia shall include reflection of realisable 
value  of  securities/assets  and  policies  and 
procedures  approved  by  the  Board  of  the 
asset management company shall identify the 
methodologies  that  will  be  used  for  valuing 
each type of securities/assets. The AMC and 
the sponsor of the mutual fund shall be liable 
to  compensate  the  affected  investors  and/or 
the  scheme  for  any  unfair  treatment  to  any 
investor as a result of inappropriate valuation. 
The  mutual  fund  and/or  Asset  AMC  shall 
be  liable  for  action  in  case  the  valuation  of 
securities is in contravention of the principles 
of fair valuation specified in eighth schedule.

xvii.  Valuation  of  Debt  and  Money  Market 

Instruments
 
In  order  to  move  towards  valuation  of 
securities  of  all  maturities  reflective  of  the 
realisable value/ fair value, it was mandated 
that all the debt and money market securities 
across  maturity  shall  be  valued  at  the 
weighted  average  price  at  which  they  are 
traded  on  the  particular  valuation  day  and 
in  case  such  securities  are  not  traded  on  a 
particular  valuation  day  then  the  securities 
with residual maturity upto 60 days shall be 
valued  on  amortisation  basis  and  securities 
with residual maturity over 60 days shall be 
valued at benchmark yield/ matrix of spread 
over  risk  free  benchmark  yield  obtained 
from agencies entrusted for the said purpose 
by  AMFI,  provided  such  valuation  shall  be 
reflective of the realisable value/ fair value of 
the securities/assets.
To  further  enhance  transparency,  the 
 
AMCs  shall  disclose  all  details  of  debt  and 
money market securities transacted (including 
inter scheme transfers) in its schemes portfolio 
on  AMCs’  website  and  the  same  shall  be 
forwarded  to  AMFI  for  consolidation  and 
dissemination.
V.  Portfolio Managers
i.  Minimum Investment
(Portfolio 
 
Managers)  Regulations  were  amended  to 
provide  for  minimum 
limit 
per  client  as  `  Five  lakh.  Since  minimum 
investment  limit  had  not  been  revised  after 
2002,  portfolio  management  services  had 
become accessible to smaller/ retail investors, 
without  the  protection  which  is  available 
to  retail  investors  under  the  mutual  fund 
framework.
 
In  view  of  this  and  in  order  to  achieve 
objectives  proposed  in  the  concept  paper

Box 1.6: Alternative Investment Fund (AIF)

i.  Regulations for Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)
Background and Rationale
 
 
SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations (“VCF Regulations”) were framed in 1996 to encourage 
funding by entrepreneurs’ early-stage companies in India. However, over the years, it could be seen that 
the Venture Capital Funds (VCF) route was being used by several other funds including Private Equity 
(PE) funds, Real Estate funds, etc. This made it diﬃ  cult to target concessions and incentives speciﬁ c to 
VCFs without enabling other funds to avail of such incentives or concessions. Further, the investment 
restrictions placed on VCFs were sought to be relaxed by such funds registered as VCFs with SEBI. 
  Hence, on one hand, there were a set of funds like VCF which required incentives and concessions 
and were comfortable with consequent restrictions aĴ ached and on the other hand there were another 
set of funds like PE funds which did not require incentives and concessions but required investment 
ﬂ exibility.  Further, since registration of VCF was not mandatory under VCF Regulations, all players in 
the alternative funds industry were not registered with SEBI.  Hence, there was a regulatory gap which 
needs to be addressed.
Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)
 
SEBI proposed a Regulatory framework for Alternative Investment Funds on August 1, 2011 through 
the concept paper placed on SEBI website for public comments along with the draĞ  Alternative Investment 
Funds Regulations. Through this concept paper, SEBI proposed to regulate all funds established in India 
which are private pooled investment vehicles raising funds from Indian or foreign investors, excluding 
Mutual Funds and Collective Investment Schemes registered with SEBI.  Further, any such pool of funds 
which is regulated by any other regulator in India like banks, pension funds, etc. was proposed to be 
excluded from the purview of the proposed Regulations. The existing SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) 
Regulations,  1996  were  proposed  to  be  repealed  and  replaced  by  the Alternative  Investment  Funds 
Regulations.  
 
In response to the Concept paper, more than 100 comments were received from various entities 
running into more than 600 pages. The comments received from the public were analysed and based 
on  the  comments,  the  draĞ  AIF  Regulations  were  suitably  revised  for  placing  before  the  Board  for 
approval.

Investment  Funds 

(AIF) 
on  Alternative 
Regulations, the minimum investment amount 
per  client  was  increased  from  the  existing  ` 
5  lakh  to  `  25  lakh  by  amending  regulation 
15(1A) of the aforesaid regulations.
ii.  Segregation of Unlisted Securities
Regulation  16(8)  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 
 
Managers) Regulations was amended in 2008 
to  provide  for  segregation  of  securities  of 
clients  by  the  portfolio  manager  in  separate 
demat  accounts.  However,  this  requirement 
was  applicable  only  for  listed  securities. 
Hence,  pooling  was  being  done  by  portfolio 
managers  in  case  of  unlisted  securities.  In 
order to ensure that pooling of securities was 

not  done  by  portfolio  managers,  Regulation 
16(8) of SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations 
was  amended  to  provide  for  segregation  of 
securities for both listed and unlisted securities 
in  respect  of  investment  by  new  clients  and 
any fresh investments by existing clients.

VI.  Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)
i. 

Formulation  of  Qualified  Foreign 
Investors framework
 
In  line  with  the  Union  Budget  speech 
2011 and subsequent press release by GoI, it 
has  been  decided  to  allow  foreign  investors 
termed as Qualified Foreign Investors (QFI), 
who meet the prescribed KYC norms, to invest 

33

Annual Report 2011-12

in  equity  schemes  of  Indian  mutual  funds, 
permitted  Infrastructure  Debt  Fund  (IDF) 
schemes  of  mutual  funds  and  Indian  equity 
shares  subject  to  the  prescribed  terms  and 
conditions. Vide SEBI circulars dated August 
9, 2011 and January 13, 2012, the framework 
for  QFI  investment  in  mutual  funds  and 
equity shares has been prescribed.
 
The QFI framework has the objectives of 
reducing  regulatory  arbitrage  on  account  of 
different categories, increase in transparency, 
simplification  of  account  opening,  reduction 
in time taken to make investment, decrease in 
transaction cost coupled with FATF level KYC 
for  foreign  investors  to  participate  in  Indian 
capital  market  and  to  encourage  indirect 
participants  to  directly  participate  in  Indian 
capital market. All these aspects will enhance 
the  projection  of  Indian  securities  markets 
and  help  it  make  a  preferred  investment 
destination by global funds.
ii.  Revision of Debt Re-investment Policy
 
Over a period of time SEBI has been fine 
tuning the allocation methodology of FII debt 
limits. Initially, the allocation of FII debt limit 
was done on a quota basis and then on first 
come first served basis. As a result, these debt 
limits were allocated to allottees without any 
cost.  Subsequently,  the  allocation  procedure 
was  changed  to  the  open  bidding  process. 
Some of the FIIs that were active participants 
in debt since beginning and had accumulated 
investment  limits  over  a  period  of  time 
continued to have opportunity to increase their 
share in the investment pool by participating 
in the subsequent bidding processes.
The  FIIs  were  allowed  to  re-invest  sale 
 
proceeds  within  a  period  of  5/  15  days,  in 
order to hold on to their purchased investment 
limits.  This  re-investment  facility  had  the 
following unintended effects:

34

a)   Allowed FIIs to retain the debt investment 
limits till perpetuity by rolling over their 
investment  during  the  re-investment 
period window. The ability to retain limits 
till  perpetuity  made  the  phenomenon 
anti competitive.

b)   Existing allottees continued to hoard debt 
limits at relatively higher costs through 
the  stock  exchange  bidding  platforms. 
These costs could be amortised by them 
over a long period of time, in view of the 
perpetual nature of limits.

c)  The  cost  of  debt  seemed  uneconomical 
for  the  new  fund  based  FIIs  entities  to 
participate in the bidding.

d)   Tendency to invest in short-term papers.
 
Due to above factors, it was felt that there 
is no reason to continue with the facility of re-
investment window. Hence, vide SEBI circular 
dated January 3, 2012, it has been decided to 
discontinue  the  re-investment  mechanism. 
Henceforth,  for  all  new  allocations  of  debt 
limits  to  FIIs/sub-accounts,  no  re-investment 
period  shall  be  allowed  and  the  limits  shall 
come back to the pool once the investment is 
sold/  redeemed.  These  limits  shall  again  be 
allocated in subsequent bidding processes.
 
The FIIs that have already obtained the 
debt limits or invested in debt were allowed 
to continue with the re-investment facility i.e. 
they may re-invest into debt securities within 
5 to 15 business days of the sale or redemption 
of the earlier investments, until the occurrence 
of any of the following conditions:
a)   The  total  sales  made  by  an  FII  from  its 
debt portfolio reaches twice the value of 
the entire debt portfolio (i.e. the total of 
the  utilised  and  utilised  limit  available 
with the FII); or

b)   A period of two years has elapsed since 

2011 

that  once 

from the date of issue of the circular i.e. 
on January 2, 2014.
is  envisaged 
It 

 
the  re-
investment facility is withdrawn, a schedule 
of auctions calendars would also be possible 
which would enable the foreign investors to 
plan their investments based on the bidding 
session’s calendar.
VII. Takeovers
i.  Notification  of  SEBI 

(Substantial 
Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers) 
Regulations, 
(Takeover 
Regulations, 2011)
The  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of 
 
Shares  and  Takeovers  (SAST))  Regulations, 
2011 were notified on September 23, 2011 by 
repealing the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997.

(TRAC), headed by Late C. Achuthan, and the 
public comments received thereon.
The  salient  features  of  the  Takeover 
 
Regulations, 2011 include (a) initial threshold 
at 25 percent for the trigger of the mandatory 
open  offer  against  15  percent  as  existed 
earlier  (b)  minimum  offer  size  of  26  percent 
against  20  percent  as  existed  earlier  (c)  no 
provision  for  payment  of  non-compete  fee

the  parameters  for  determining  the  open 
offer  price  (g)  reduced  timelines  for  various 
activities  related  to  open  offer  process,  etc. 
Further,  a  circular  was  issued  on  September 
23,  2011  specifying  the  formats  for  reports/
disclosures  under  various  provisions  of 
the  takeover  regulations.  Frequently  asked 

35

questions on the Takeover Regulations, 2011 
were uploaded on the SEBI website to provide 
simplistic  explanation  and  clarification  of 
terms and concepts.
Buyback
i.   Review  of  Tender  Offer  Method  of 

Buyback Process
SEBI (Buyback of Securities) Regulations, 
 
1998  were  notified  on  November  14,  1998. 
Buyback  process  is  being  implemented  by 
the  companies  through  either  open  market 
purchase method or tender offer method. Over 
the years, with the advent of new technologies, 
there has been rapid development in market 
infrastructure.  Therefore,  as  a  part  of  SEBI’s 
to  align 
constant  endeavor 
regulatory 
requirements  with 
the  changing  market 
realities  as  well  as  to  enhance  efficiency  in 
the buyback process, the buyback regulations 
were  reviewed  and  consequently  amended 
vide  notification  dated  February  7,  2012  to 
introduce  certain  changes  in  tender  offer 
method of buyback.
The  major  changes  introduced  in  the 
 
procedure for acceptance of shares in buyback 
through tender offer process are introduction 
of record date for determining the entitlement 
of  shareholders,  announcement  of  ratio  of 
buyback  as  is  done  in  case  of  rights  issues, 
removal  of  restriction  of  shares  that  can  be 
tendered,  reservation  to  small  shareholders, 
removal of requirement of issuance of public 
notice  and  shortened  timelines  for  various 
activities.

X.  Retrospect and Prospects
i.  Retrospect
 
Indian  economy  after  exhibiting  strong 
growth for two preceding years treaded on a 
path to moderate growth, partly mirroring the 
global turmoil and partly the domestic issues. 
While  the  previous  two  years  saw  India’s 
GDP  at  factor  cost  growing  by  8.4  percent 
each  year,  the  current  fiscal  year  ended  at  a 
growth  rate  of  6.5  percent.  IIP  growth  has 
dropped sharply reflecting the unfavourable 
investment climate being faced by the sector

pressures 

along with the demand side factors. Services 
continued driving the growth of the economy 
while  agricultural  growth  also  remained 
moderately well.
triggered 
 
Inflationary 
monetary  tightening  which  in  turn  affected 
the  liquidity  and  investment.  Credit  growth 
from Banks and other sources increased while 
the  savings  rate  of  the  economy  declined 
marginally. The resultant fluctuating exchange 
rate  coupled  with  the  uncertainty  in  global 
markets  has  widened  the  current  account 
deficit above the tolerable limit.
 
The  securities  market  opened  on  a 
buoyant  note  with  BSE  Sensex  at  19,  445  on 
March  31,  2011,  but  as  the  year  progressed 
fading global scenario casted its effect on the 
Indian stock markets as well. The BSE Sensex 
closed  at  17,  404  on  March  30,  2012,  while 
recording a high of 19, 811 in April, 2011. On 
a point to point basis, BSE Sensex recorded a 
decline of 10.5 percent compared to a growth 
of 10.9 percent recorded in the previous year. 
Similar movements were observed in the other 
barometer  of  the  Indian  stock  market,  the 
S&P  CNX  Nifty.  It  closed  at  5,296  on  March 
30, 2012 while the figure for March 31, 2011 
was  at  5,834.  The  decline  for  Nifty  stood  at 
9.2 percent as compared to a growth of 11.1 
percent in the preceding year.
The market capitalisation of BSE Sensex 
 
shrunk  by  9.1  percent  in  2011-12  as  against 
an  increase  of  10.9  percent  recorded  in  the 
previous year. For S& P CNX Nifty , the market 
capitalisation shrunk by 9.0 percent in 2011-
12 as compared with 11.5 percent growth that 
occurred in 2010-11. The turnover in volume 
of trade at NSE recorded a negative growth of 
21.4 percent in 2011-12 as against 13.5 percent 
in 2010-11 while BSE recorded a near doubling 
in the negative growth in turnover volume of 
39.6 percent in 2011-12 as against 19.9 percent 

Annual Report 2011-12

in 2010-11.
 
The turnover and the number of contracts 
traded  at  both  NSE  and  BSE  in  equity 
derivatives  and  currency  derivative  showed 
an increasing trend in 2011-12 as compared to 
2010-11.
 
The  primary  market  slowed  down  on 
account  of  weak  investment  climate  with 
fewer companies raising capital. The number 
of  companies  which  accessed  the  primary 
market was 71 in 2011-12 compared to 91 in 
2010-11.  Amount  mobilised  in  2010-11  was 
`  58,  157  crore  registered  a  sharp  downfall 
to  `  12,  857  crore  mobilised  during  2011-
12.  The  number  of  rights  issue  has  declined 
to  16  from  23  during  the  same  period. 
Resource mobilisation through the Qualified 
Institutions’ Placement Mode (QIP) fell down 
from 49 issues raising ` 24,759 crore in 2010-11 
to 15 issues raising only ` 2,163 crore during 
2011-12.
 
Mutual  funds  saw  a  continuing  trend 
of  net  outflow  of  resources  during  2011-
12.  Private  sector  mutual  funds  contributed 
majorly to the redemption, with a net outflow 
of resources from all mutual funds at ` 22,023 
crore in 2011-12 compared to a net outflow of 
resources of ` 49, 406 crore in 2010-11. The FIIs 
stayed invested in Indian markets with their 
SEBI  registered  number  moving  up  to  1,765 
by end March 2012 compared to 1,722 by end 
March  2011.  Their  net  investment  was  `  93, 
725 crore in 2011-12 against ` 1, 46, 438 crore 
in the previous year.
ii.  Prospects
 
securities 
markets  depends  on  several  factors  such  as 
macroeconomic  environment,  trading  and 
settlement  infrastructure,  and  belief  in  the 
integrity of the markets. Among these factors, 
the latter two continue to be robust with several 

overall  health 

The 

of 

forward  looking  steps  being  taken  by  SEBI. 
The  macroeconomic  factor  has  contributed 
to slightly negative sentiment in the markets. 
It  may  however  be  emphasized  that  this  is 
more likely to be a temporary phenomenon as 
the economy shifts from a very high growth 
path  to  merely  a  high  growth  path.  Other 
factors  remaining  constant,  the  securities 
markets are expected to resume their original 
trendline.  However,  SEBI  in  its  endeavour 
to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  market  and 
promoting  seamless  trading,  clearing  and 
settlement  process  in  the  securities  market, 
has  continuously  harped  on  improving  the 
conditions of systemic factors in a persistent 
manner.
 
Keeping in view the changing scope and 
nature of the market structure, SEBI has in the 
past and in future, will continue to make rules 
and  regulations  to  preserve  and  maintain  a 
safe,  fair  and  orderly  market  to  protect  the 
interest  of  investors,  development  of  the 
securities  market  and  supervision.  Towards 
achieving  the  same,  SEBI  conducts  investor 
awareness  and  education  programme 
in 
various parts of the country to make investor 
an  informed  investor.  SEBI  is  in  constant 
upgradation  of  its  surveillance  mechanism 
and updates its system to keep pace with the 
evolving demands of a growing market.
Currently, participation of retail investors 
 
in  the  securities  market  is  insignificant.  In 
view of this, investor assistance and education 
will  continue  to  be  SEBI’s  priority  area  in 
the  future.  This  would  help  in  developing 
wide  and  deep  markets  aimed  at  increasing 
base  of  savvy  investors  and  thus  also  help 
in  achieving  financial 
inclusion  for  the 
investors in the country. Enhancing the retail 
participation in mutual funds is a challenge, 
which can contribute not only to the financial 
inclusion  and  can  play  a  balancing  role

vis-a  vis  potential  destabilising  effect  of

Introduction  of  Rajiv  Gandhi  Equity  Saving 
Scheme proposed in the Union Budget 2012-
13  is  expected  to  enhance  the  retail  investor 
participation  directly  and  through  mutual 
funds.
 
SEBI  has  revamped  the  consent  order 
framework,  notified  AIF  regulations  and 
the  exit  route  for  unviable  MIIs.  Setting  up 
of  unified  filing  and  dissemination  platform 
called  SEBI  Unified  Platform  for  Electronic 
Reporting  -  Dissemination  (SUPER-D) 
is 
under  progress  and  is  expected  to  enhance 
the disclosures to investors and stakeholders. 
Implementation  of  budget  proposal 
for 
mandatory issue in electronic form of IPOs of 
Rupees ten crore and above through nation-
wide broker network of stock exchanges would 
further improve the investor participation in 
primary  markets.  The  KYC  process  and  the 
KRA put into operation is being strengthened 
and  is  contemplated  to  be  applied  for  the 
entire  financial  sector  in  co-operation  with 
other financial regulators.

Latest budget announcement of allowing 
Qualified  Foreign  Investors  (QFIs)  to  access 
corporate bond market apart from investments 
in  Indian  mutual  fund  schemes  and  equity 
market  directly  is  expected  to  augment  the 
much required flow of foreign capital into the 
country. It is in this regard; Govt. of India has 
announced a separate sub-limit of USD One 
billion for QFIs investment in corporate bonds 
and mutual fund debt schemes.
 
In the international forums like IOSCO, 
SEBI  is  assuming  a  larger  role  as  it  heads 
APRC,  and  is  also  member  of  various  other 
committees. This will enhance the knowledge 
sharing and co-operation in resolving complex 
cross-border trading issues.
 
It is, however, to be emphasised that in 
a dynamic market like securities market, the 
robustness of the markets is to be preserved 
through  constant  endeavour.  SEBI  will 
continue  to  ensure  that  the  markets  remain 
vibrant, fair and safe. Emerging trends such 
as  relative  dominance  of  derivatives  market 
segment  over  the  cash  market  segment  will 
require effort and attention on the part of the 
regulator.

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

the  domestic  scene. 

 
Indian equity markets were impacted by 
developments  in  the  global  macroeconomic 
space  during  2011-12.  The  unfolding  of 
Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, unprecedented 
event  like  US  downgrade,  the  impasse  over 
fiscal and debt problems in the USA, high oil 
and  commodity  prices,  earthquake  in  Japan 
and Middle-east crisis derailed global growth 
prospects  and  undermined  business  and 
consumer confidence. Indian equity markets 
were sluggish and bearish trend prevailed for 
major part of the year. Intensifying concerns 
over  the  fragile  global  economy  and  its 
possible transmissions to the domestic front, 
elevated  levels  of  inflation  and  depreciation 
dominated 
India’s 
investment  cycle,  which  was  on  an  upturn 
since 2003-04, moderated to a soft patch. Anti-
inflationary  monetary  stance  by  the  central 
bank through monetary tightening measures 
and resultant firming up of interest rates and 
growth  moderating  effects  of  a  persistently 
high inflation impacted business sentiments. 
Reflecting  the  same,  business  confidence 
reached a lower level and coupled with wealth 
effect of correction in equity prices overthrew 
the 
investment  and  expansion  plans  of 
corporates.
 
The primary market for equity issuances 
was  largely  restrained  in  2011-12  from  both 
demand and supply side. On the demand side, 
there was a tepid response from investors to 
issues due to low risk appetite emanating from 
poor  returns  of  previously  listed  IPOs  and 
volatile  secondary  market.  From  the  supply 
perspective, corporates exhibited cautiousness 
and abstained from resource mobilisation with 
the signs of slowdown in global and domestic 
economy.  The  amount  raised  through  IPOs 
and  FPOs  was  substantially  lower  during 
2011-12 compared to previous years.  However, 
the number of and amount mobilised through 

public  debt  issues  outstripped  those  of  the 
earlier years.

 
Concomitant with the dampened equity 
investment  climate  was  the  moderation  in 
foreign  institutional  inflows  into  India  on 
the  backdrop  of  adverse  external  economic 
environment  and  depreciation  of  Indian 
rupee.  Notwithstanding  these,  the  FII  flows 
were  positive  in  both  the  equity  and  debt 
segments.

Commensurate  with 

 
the  secondary 
market downtrend, the mutual fund segment 
faced  redemptions  pushing  the  net  resource 
mobilisation to the negative zone. Except for 
the  gold  exchange  traded  funds,  balanced 
schemes and equity schemes other than ELSS, 
all  other  schemes  faced  huge  redemptions. 
Nonetheless,  there  lies  a  respite  to  the 
segment  as  the  unit  holding  pattern  data  of 
mutual funds for 2011-12 shows considerable 
improvement in the share of retail investors in 
the net assets of mutual funds.

1.  PRIMARY MARKET

investment 

 
The  primary  market  activities  were 
subdued  during  2011-12.  Weak  macro- 
economic  and 
environment 
slackened  expansion  plans  of  corporates. 
This was exacerbated by the negative returns 
from the previously listed IPOs and declining 
trend in equity markets. In consonance with 
dampened  returns,  the  lukewarm  investor 
response  for  the  existing  primary  market 
issues  adversely  affected 
investor  and 
promoter  sentiments.  Resource  mobilisation 
by  companies  through  IPOs  and  FPOs  was 
substantially lower in 2011-12 compared to the 
previous years. The year was dominated by the 
non-convertible debenture issues of the public 
financial and infrastructure institutions.

I.  Resource Mobilisation
During  2011-12,  71  companies  accessed 
 
the primary market and raised ` 48,468 crore 
through public (55) and rights issues (16) as 
against  91  companies  which  raised  `  67,609 
crore in 2010-11 through public (68) and rights 
issues  (23)  (Table  2.1).  The  weak  investment 
climate led to fall in the number of IPOs and 
amount raised from new issues market. There 
were  34  IPOs  during  2011-12  as  against  53 
during  2010-11.  The  amount  raised  through 
IPOs during 2011-12 was considerably lower 
at ` 5,904 crore as compared to ` 35,559 crore 
during 2010-11. Of the amount raised through 
IPOs  and  FPOs,  `  2,054  crore  was  through 

offer  for  sale  by  existing  shareholders  and 
five  issues  used  this  mechanism  to  raise 
resources. The share of public issues in the total 
resource mobilisation increased to 95.1 percent 
during  2011-12  from  85.9  percent  in  2010-11 
whereas share of rights issues declined from 
14.1 percent in 2010-11 to 4.9 percent in 2011-
12 (Chart 2.1). Of the public issues, the share 
of debt issues was the largest at 73.5 percent 
during  2011-12,  which  is  one  of  the  highest 
in  the  history  of  Indian  securities  market. 
This is a positive sign for the corporate bond 
markets  as  firms  are  increasingly  resorting 
to  public  issue  of  debentures  for  raising 
resources.

Annual Report 2011-12

Chart 2.1: Share of Broad Category of Issues in Resource Mobilisation (%)

 
Chart  2.1  represents  the  relative  share 
of  the  four  modes  of  resource  mobilisation 
namely, IPOs, FPOs, bonds and rights issues 
since  2005-06.  It  is  observed  that  the  share 
of  IPOs  has  ranged  from  12.2  percent  to 
85.1 percent; FPOs from zero percent to 45.1 
percent,  bonds  from  zero  percent  to  73.5 
percent and rights issues from 4.9 percent to 
77.9 percent.

To facilitate quicker resource mobilisation 
by  companies  from  institutional  investors 
in  the  domestic  market,  listed  companies 
resort  to  Qualified  Institutions’  Placement 
(QIP). Since its introduction, a large number 
of  companies  have  utilized  QIP  for  raising 
the much needed funds as is evident in Table 
2.2.  Securities  which  can  be  issued  through 
QIP are equity shares or any securities other

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

 
The  amended  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation)  Rules  1957  require  the  listed 
companies to achieve and maintain minimum 
public shareholding, at 25 percent (10 percent 
for PSUs) by June 2013. SEBI introduced two 
new avenues for listed companies to increase 
their  level  of  public  shareholding  to  the 
specified  minimum  level  viz.,  Institutional 
Placement  Program  (IPP)  and  Offer  for  Sale 
by promoters through stock exchanges. Data 
for  QIP  also  includes  one  issue  through  IPP 
for 2011-12.

than warrants, which are convertible into or 
exchangeable with equity shares.
 
Fewer  corporates  mobilised  resources 
through  QIP  during  2011-12  compared  to 
earlier  years  (Table  2.2).  During  2011-12, 
issuers  raised  `  2,163  crore  through  16  QIP 
issues  (including  one  IPP  issue  that  raised 
`  470.74  crore)  compared  to  `  25,850  crore 
raised through 59 issues during 2010-11. The 
decline  in  resource  mobilisation  through 
QIP  was  a  reflection  of  the  subdued  state 
of  primary  markets  and  postponement  of 
expansion plans of corporates.

II.  Sector-wise Resource Mobilisation
 
Sector-wise  classification  reveals  that 
60  private  sector  and  11  public  sector  issues 
mobilised resources through primary market 
during  2011-12  as  compared  to  77  private 
sector  issues  and  14  public  sector  issues  in 
2010-11. Even though the private sector issues 
were  more  in  number,  the  amount  raised 
by  them  was  substantially  smaller  (`14,293 
crore)  compared  to  the  public  sector  issues 
(Table  2.3).  The  share  of  private  sector  in 
total  resource  mobilisation  was  29.5  percent 
in  2011-12  compared  to  43.5  percent  in 
2010-11  (Chart  2.2).  The  amount  raised 
through public sector issues was 70.5 percent 
of the total resource mobilisation. This is the 
third  consecutive  financial  year  wherein  the 
public  sector  issues  garnered  a  larger  share 
of  the  resource  mobilisation  in  the  primary 
market.
III.  Size-wise Resource Mobilisation
 
Large  issues  dominated  the  primary 
market  resource  mobilisation  in  2011-12  as 

Table 2.4: Size-wise Resource Mobilisation 

about  89.7  percent  of  resource  mobilisation 
was through issues above  ` 500 crore (Table 
2.4).  However,  the  number  of  issues  under 
category of issues having size of  `  500 crore 
or above declined to 19 in 2011-12 from 26 in 
2010-11. The average size of the issue declined 
to ` 683 crore in 2011-12 from ` 743 crore in 
2010-11.
 
There were 22 mega issues in 2011-12 as 
compared to 36 mega issues in 2010-11 (Table 
2.5). The mega issues mobilised ` 44,852 crore 
which  amounts  to  92.5  percent  of  `  48,468 
crore  total  resource  mobilisation  during  the 
year.
 
The  largest  issue  during  2011-12  was 
that  of  the  debt  issues  of  National  Highway 
Authority  of  India  (`  10,000  crore)  which 
was  followed  by  Indian  Railways  Finance 
Corporation  Ltd.  (`  6,269  crore)  and  Hudco 
Ltd (` 4,685 crore). Power Finance Corporation 
with its FPO and debt issues garnered more 
than ` 8,600 crore during 2011-12.

2.  SECONDARY MARKET
Equity Market in India
I. 
 
The  equity  markets  continued  their 
declining  trend  fuelled  by  the  global  crisis 
spillovers  and  weak  macro-economic  trends 
and  forecasts.  Investment  climate  in  India 
remained  dampened  due  to  a  confluence  of 
worsening cyclical and global factors, as well 
as by concerns about structural impediments. 
Inflation  remained  at  an  elevated  level  for 
major  part  of  the  year.  RBI  has  raised  its 
policy  rates  on  13  occasions  since  March 
2010  amounting  to  an  increase  of  350  basis 
points.  As  a  result,  inflation  has  moderated 

significantly  since  January  2012.  The  anti-
inflationary  monetary  policy  stance  has  had 
a  dampening  effect  on  investment  demand 
as well as on interest-sensitive components of 
private  consumption.  Hardening  of  interest 
rates  and  the  sharp  depreciation  of  rupee 
heavily  impacted  the  corporates.  Rupee  was  
one of the most depreciated currencies among 
major Asian currencies in 2011, partly due to 
India’s  current  account  deficit.  In  addition, 
capital  flows  moderated  and  turned  more 
volatile  fuelled  by  risk  aversion  and  sharp 
shifts in risk appetite.

 

Even though Indian equity markets faced 

46

severe pressures during 2011-12, it closed on 
a  positive  note.  There  was  a  strong  pickup 
in the last quarter led by the rebound in the 
global equity markets, sustained FII inflows, 
fall in inflation and softening interest rates.
 
During 2011-12, the BSE Sensex and S&P 
CNX  Nifty  declined  by  10.5  percent  and  9.2 
percent,  respectively,  over  March  31,  2011 
(Chart 2.3). The BSE Sensex declined by 2014 
points  to  close  at  17,404  on  March  30,  2012 
compared  to  19,445  on  March  31,  2011.  The 
S&P  CNX  Nifty  also  declined  538  points  to 
close  at  5296  at  the  end  of  March  2012  over 
5834 at the end of March 2011.
 
BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty reached 
their  maximum  on  April  6,  2011,  when  the 
indices touched the levels of 19811 and 5944 
respectively. The lowest level for the financial 
year was reached on December 20, 2011 when 
BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty touched 15136 
and 4531, respectively.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

 
In  tandem  with  the  decline  in  stock 
prices  in  2011-12,  there  was  a  significant 
decline in turnover and market capitalisation 
across  the  board.  In  the  cash  segment,  the 
turnover  at  BSE  and  NSE  declined  by  39.6 
percent and 21.4 percent respectively during 
2011-12 as compared to a rise of 0.5 percent 
and  30  percent,  increase  during  2010-11. 
While  derivatives  turnover  at  BSE  showed 
an exponential rise as compared to previous 
year  but  NSE  gained  by  7.2  percent  over 
the  previous  year.  During  2011-12,  market 
capitalisation at BSE witnessed a decline of 9.1 
percent and that at NSE witnessed a decline 
of 9.0 percent. Although there was a decline in 
P/E ratios over the past year, they still reigned 
high  in  comparison  with  other  emerging 
markets.  In  spite  of  the  bearish  trend  in  the 
stock  markets  and  the  comparatively  high 
PE  ratios,  FIIs  were  bullish  on  Indian  stock 
markets.  Volatility,  measured  by  annualised

Japan, unrest in the Middle East oil producing 
countries,  high  oil  and  commodity  prices 
and downgrading of USA by S&P. Yet again, 
the  year  was  unprecedented  as  it  entered  a 
dangerous phase. Intensifying concerns on the 
deteriorating  Euro  crisis  transmitted  market 
stress  across  the  world  posing  severe  threat 
to  financial  stability.  Slowdown  in  global 
growth, in particular of advanced economies 
portended, the onset of an imminent recession

flows  intensified  the  risks  for  the  emerging 
markets.  However,  owing  to  a  vast  set  of 
collective  policy  actions  in  the  Euro  area, 
fiscal  adjustments  plans,  and  infusion  of 
fiscal discipline, outlook has improved since 
the  beginning  of  2012.  The  recent  growth

rebound  in  the  equity  markets  towards  the

Among the emerging markets the annual 
return  on  a  point-to-point  basis  was  the 
highest  in  Thailand  (12.4  percent),  followed 
by  Indonesia  (11.9  percent)  and  Mexico  (5.5 
percent). India’s stock return was negative as 
BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  registered 
a  decline  of  10.5  percent  and  9.2  percent 
respectively (Chart 2.4).

IV.  Market  Capitalisation
 
Market capitalisation is a major indicator 
that  indicates  size  of  the  stock  market.  A 
higher market capitalisation reflects growing 
stock market activities and an upward trend 
in  stock  markets.  The  market  capitalisation 
of  BSE  has  been  higher  than  that  of  NSE  in 
India reflecting large number of shares being 
listed in BSE. The market capitalisation of BSE 

54

declined  by  9.1  percent  to  `  62,14,941  crore 
in  2011-12  from  `  68,39,084  crore  at  the  end 
of  March  2011.  On  the  other  hand,  at  NSE 
market capitalisation declined by 9.0 percent 
to ` 60,96,518 crore in 2011-12 from ` 67,02,616 
crore  at  the  end  of  March  2011.  Reflecting 
fall in stock prices, the market capitalisation 
of  BSE  witnessed  downturn  in  every  month 
except in April 2011, November 2011, January 
2012 and February 2012, when there was an 
increase  over  the  previous  month.  At  NSE, 
market  capitalisation  increased  during  the 
months  of April  2011,  June  2011,  November 
2011, January 2012 and February 2012.
During 2011-12, market capilatisation of 
 
BSE Sensex declined by 6.2 percent whereas 

Table 2.13: Market Capitalisation at BSE 

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

Market  capitalisation  of 

that  of  BSE  Teck,  BSE  Bankex  and  BSE 
PSU  declined  by  6.9,  10.7  and  17.7  percent 
respectively (Table 2.13).
 
the  shares 
included  in  S&P  CNX  Nifty  declined  by  7.0 
percent  during  the  financial  year.  At  NSE, 
market  capitalisation  of  Nifty  (except  CNX 
Midcap), declined  during 2011-12 compared 
to the previous year. The market capitalisation 
of CNX Midcap rose by 1.9 percent in 2011-12 
on top of a decline of 1.5 percent in the previous 
year. At NSE, among sectoral indices, decline 
in  market  capitalisation  was  the  highest  for 
CNX Bank (10.9 percent) followed by CNX IT 
(8.4 percent) (Table 2.14).

V.   Stock Market Indicators
 
The  market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio 
is  an  important  parameter  for  evaluation  of 
stock  markets.  The  liquidity  of  the  market 
can be measured by the traded value to GDP 
i.e., ratio of value of the shares traded to GDP 
at  current  market  prices.  The  all-India  cash 
turnover to GDP ratio declined to 39.1 percent 
in 2011-12 from 61.1 percent in 2010-11. In the 
derivative segment also, there was a marginal 

decline in the turnover-GDP ratio from 381.1 
percent  in  2010-11  to  358.7  percent  in  2011-
12.  The  market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio 
has declined for the second consecutive year 
in  2011-12.  The  BSE  market  capitalisation  to 
GDP ratio has declined from 89.1 percent in 
2010-11 to 70.2 percent in 2011-12. Similarly, 
at NSE also the ratio has declined from 87.3 
percent to 68.8 percent over the same period 
(Table 2.15).

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

Nevertheless,  CNX  IT  had  the  highest  P/E 
ratio compared to other sectoral and mid-cap 
indices.
 
A global comparison of the indices shows 
that India’s PE ratio was moderately low among 
the  emerging  markets.  The  Nikkei  index  of 
Japan, IPSA index of Chile, NASDAQ of USA, 
KOSPI index of Korea, JCI index of Indonesia, 
TWSE index of Taiwan and MEXBOL index of 
Mexico had higher P/E ratios in 2011-12 than 
that of Indian benchmark indices.

 
The valuation of the shares can be gauged 
from the price-earning ratio. In contrast to the 
trend in the previous two years, the P/E ratios 
of the major indices scaled downward in 2011-
12 (Table 2.16). At the end of March 2012, the 
P/E ratio of BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty 
were 17.8 and 18.7 respectively as compared 
to 21.2 and 22.1 respectively as on March 31, 
2011. Month-wise data indicate P/E ratios of 
benchmark  indices  was  lowest  in  December 
2011. During 2011-12, there was a fall in the 
P/E ratios of all the indices, except CNX PSE.

VI.  Volatility in Stock Markets
 
Intermittent  corrections  in  the  stock 
prices throughout the year marked the stock 
market trend during 2011-12. The annualised 
volatility of BSE Sensex, measured by standard 
deviation of log returns, declined to 20.2 percent 
in 2011-12 from 21.1 percent in the previous 
year. Similar trend was also observed for S&P 
CNX Nifty which declined to 20.4 percent from 
21.4 percent during the same period. Month-
wise,  volatility  in  the  benchmark  indices 
and  the  large-cap  index,  S&P  CNX  500,  was 
the highest in September 2011, October 2011 
and August 2011, coinciding with significant 
correction of indices during the months (Table 
2.18). The lowest volatility in the benchmark 
indices  was  noticed  during    June  2011  and 
July 2011. In case of the BSE Mid-cap and BSE 
Small-cap, the highest volatility was observed 

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

in  August  2011  and  September  2011.  The 
volatility was high in BSE Small cap index in 
February 2012 also.

An international comparison of volatility 
in stock returns indicates that stock prices in 
emerging markets were generally more volatile 
than those in developed markets during 2011-
12  (Table  2.19  and  Chart  2.8).  Among  the 
emerging markets, Russia depicted the highest 
volatility (36.6 percent), followed by Hungary 
(28.2  percent)  and  Argentina  (26.2  percent). 
Compared 
to  other  emerging  markets, 
India’s stock price volatility was considerably 
lower during 2011-12. Among the developed 
markets, the annualised volatility was high in 
Germany (29.3 percent) followed by the Euro 
region  (29.2  percent),  France  (29.1  percent) 
and Hong Kong (25.5 percent).

During 2011-12, the all India turnover at 
the stock exchanges declined by 25.6 percent 
over the previous year. The number of shares 
traded  and  delivered  and  value  of  shares 
delivered decreased at BSE, NSE, and Calcutta 
stock exchange. Of the total quantity of shares 
traded, NSE had a lion’s share of 71.0 percent, 
followed  by  BSE  (28.9  percent).  NSE  had  a 
share of 63.3 percent in the quantity of shares 
delivered  followed  by  BSE  (36.5  percent).  In 
the  total  value  of  shares  delivered,  share  of 
NSE was 80.9 percent, followed by BSE at 18.7 
percent.
 
As many of the RSEs are dormant, their 
activities  are  mainly  routed  through  the 
subsidiaries  which  have  taken  up  trading 
membership  of  BSE  and  NSE.  During  2011-
12, all the subsidiaries recorded decline in the 
volume of transactions except DSE Financial 
Services  Ltd.,  the  subsidiary  of  Delhi  Stock 
Exchange  Association  Limited.  The  total 

Dematerialisation  of  securities 

turnover  of  all  the  subsidiaries  recorded  a 
decline  of  19.6  percent  to  `  2,06,472  crore 
during  2011-12  from  `  2,56,893  crore  during 
the previous year.
IX.  Dematerialisation
 
is  a 
significant  milestone  which  has  transformed 
the market microstructure of Indian securities 
markets.  There  are  two  depositories 
in 
India  viz.,  National  Securities  Depository 
Limited  (NSDL)  and  Central  Depository 
Services  Limited  (CDSL).  The  depositories 
have  set  up  nation-wide  network  with 
proper infrastructure to handle the securities 
deposited  or  settled  in  dematerialised  mode 
in the Indian stock markets.
 
As on March 30, 2012, 9,741 companies 
have  signed  up  for  dematerialisation  at 
NSDL  and  8,329  at  CDSL  (Table  2.24).  At 
NSDL,  quantity  of  dematerialised  securities 
increased by 23.0 percent to 57,98,010 lakh in

3.  TRENDS IN THE BOND MARKET
I.   Corporate Bond Market
 
Debt  Markets  are  a  vital  component 
of  the  financial  markets  particularly  for  a 
developing  economy  like  India.  Indian  debt 
markets  are  dominated  by  the  government 
securities  markets.  The  scope  for  corporate 
bond market in India is tremendous as they 
can  act  as  effective  buffers  vis-a  vis  banks 
financing in infrastructure and power projects. 
Since  2007,  SEBI  has  taken  concerted  efforts 
to revive and develop the hitherto moribund 
state of the corporate bond markets.

viz.,  OTC  trades  and  trades  reported  on  the 
exchanges  are  shown  in  Table  2.37.  While 
FIMMDA  is  the  reporting  platform  for  the 
OTC deals in the corporate bond market, BSE 
and NSE serve as both trading and reporting 
platform.  During  2011-12,  the  total  value  of 
the corporate bond trades at BSE rose by 25.9 
percent to ` 49,842 crore from ` 39,581 crore 
in  2010-11.  In  NSE,  the  value  of  trades  for 
2011-12 rose by 24.0 percent to ` 1,93,435 crore 
from ` 1,55,951 crore in 2010-11. While the total 
number  of  trades  reported  at  FIMMDA  has 
risen in 2011-12 to 33,136, the value of trades 
reported declined by 14.5 percent to ` 3,50,506 

crore over the previous financial year.
  With  effect  from  December  1,  2009,  it 
has  been  made  mandatory  for  all  trades  in 
corporate bonds between mutual funds, FIIs/
sub-accounts,  venture  capital  funds,  foreign 
venture capital investors, portfolio managers, 
and RBI regulated entities as specified by RBI 
to be cleared and settled through the exchange 
clearing corporations, NSCCL or ICCL. IRDA 
has also issued similar directions. The value 
of corporate bond trades settled through the 
clearing  corporations  has  declined  by  10.7 
percent  to  `  4,01,811  crore  in  2011-12  from 
` 4,50,123 crore in 2010-11(Table 2.38).

The  private  placement  of  corporate 
bonds reported at the exchanges is presented 
in table 2.39. The issuers have raised ` 2,61,283 
crore  through  private  placement  during 
2011-12 which is 19.4 percent higher compared 
to  `  2,18,785  crore  in  2010-11.  Although  the 
year  has  seen  a  number  of  public  issues, 
private placements have also remained as one 
of the preferred modes of raising debt funds. 
The  rise  in  funds  mobilised  could  also  be 
possibly  attributed  to  issuers  preferring  the 
domestic debt markets as a primary source of 
corporate debt.

However,  the  net  outflow  was  larger  from 
private  sector  mutual  funds  compared  to 
UTI  mutual  fund  and  public  sector  mutual 
fund. Nonetheless, net outflows were smaller 
compared to the previous financial year. The 
net outflow from private sector mutual funds 
during  2011-12  at  `  15,446  crore  as  against 
a  net  outflow  of  `  19,215  crore  in  2010-11 
(Table 2.44). UTI mutual fund recorded a net 
outflow of ` 3,184 crore in 2011-12 compared 
to net outflow of ` 16,636 crore in 2010-11. Net 
outflows  recorded  by  public  sector  mutual 
funds in 2011-12 was ` 3,394 crore compared 
to  ` 13,555 crore in the previous year. While 
all  the  open-ended  and  interval  schemes  of 
mutual funds recorded net outflows, the close-
ended  schemes  of  public  and  private  sector 
mutual  funds  witnessed  net  inflows  during 
the financial year.
 
Gross  mobilisation  of  resources  under 
open-ended  schemes  during  2011-12  was 
` 66,70,526 crore, of which, about 83.4 percent 
was raised by the private sector mutual funds 
followed by public sector funds (8.9 percent) 
and UTI mutual fund (7.7 percent). Similarly, 
gross resources mobilised under close-ended 

schemes stood at ` 1,35,513 crore in 2011-12, 
of  which  private  sector  accounted  for  84.9 
percent followed by public sector funds (11.6 
percent) and UTI mutual fund (3.5 percent).
Scheme-wise  pattern  reveals  that  there 
 
were  huge  redemptions  from  income/debt 
oriented schemes during 2011-12 (Table 2.45). 
But the net redemptions from these schemes 
was  lesser  than  the  previous  financial  year. 
Among  the  income/debt  oriented  schemes, 
redemptions were highest from debt schemes, 
followed  by  money  market  schemes  and 
gilt  schemes.  Net  resources  mobilised  were 
positive for exchange traded funds, balanced 
funds,  fund  of  funds  and  equity  schemes 
other than ELSS. Notwithstanding the market 
downturn,  growth/equity  oriented  schemes 
witnessed  net  inflows  of  `  121  crore  during 
2011-12. In the previous financial year, there 
was  a  net  redemption  of  `13,138  crore  from 
these schemes. GETFs witnessed a net increase 
of  62.1  percent  to  `  3,646  crore  in  2011-12 
from ` 2,249 crore in 2010-11. Fund of funds 
investing  overseas  mobilised  a  net  amount 
of `102 crore during 2011-12 as against a net 
redemption of ` 907 crore during 2010-11.

Despite  a  long  history,  penetration  of 
mutual  funds  in  Indian  financial  markets 
is  quite  low.  Assets  of  mutual  funds  in 
India  constitute  6.6  percent  of  GDP  which 
is  relatively  low  in  comparison  with  other 
emerging  market  economies.  Their 
low 
presence in financial portfolios of households 
other than metro cities is a cause for concern 
from the financial inclusion perspective.
 
Table 2.48 shows unit holding pattern of 
all mutual funds as on March 30, 2012. There 
was  significant  improvement  in  the  holding 
by retail investors in the net assets of mutual 

funds.  Individual  investors  accounted  for 
94.5 percent of the total number of investors’ 
accounts and contributed 48.2 percent to total 
net assets compared to 23.4 percent of total net 
assets a year ago. Corporates and institutions 
which  formed  only  3.6  percent  of  the  total 
number  of  investors  accounts  in  the  mutual 
fund  industry,  contributed  a  sizeable  44.9 
percent  of  the  total  net  assets  in  the  mutual 
funds  industry.  NRIs  and  FIIs  constituted  a 
very  small  percentage  of  investors’  accounts 
(1.9  percent)  and  contributed  6.9  percent  to 
net assets.

increase in corporate restructuring by Indian 
companies to adapt to the evolving competitive 
landscape. This can be seen from the Table no.

PART THREE: REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKET

This part of the Report delineates the functions of SEBI as specified in 

Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992

INTERMEDIARIES

1. 
I.   Streamlining the Process of Registration 

/Renewal of Intermediaries
The  process 

for 

streamlining 

 
the 
registration  and  approvals  by  enhancing 
the  transparency  continued  during  the  year 
2011-12.  The  response  was  sent  to  the 
applicants  within  30  days.  The  status  of 
registration  /  renewal  of  applications  were 
displayed on SEBI website on a monthly basis. 
With a view to ensure higher level of corporate 
governance, it has also been mentioned on the 
website that in case any application remained 
unattended, the applicant should not hesitate 
to  approach  the  concerned  Division  Chief 
or  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Market 
Intermediaries  Regulations  and  Supervision 
Department.  The  respective  e-mail  IDs  of 
concerned officials are also displayed.
 
The practice of seeking details of corrective 
measures  taken  by  the  applicant  where 
administrative and quasi-judicial actions have 
been initiated by SEBI, at the time of processing 
the  registration  /  renewal  applications,  has 
greatly  improved  the  compliance  culture 
among the intermediaries.
 
Further,  with  a  view  to  simplify  the 
regulatory  approvals  for  change  in  status 
and  constitution,  SEBI  has  taken  following 
measures:
i.  Notification 

of  Amendments 

in 
Regulation  for  Dispensing  with  Prior 
Approval (except Change in Control)
SEBI  Board  had  earlier  approved  the 
 
proposal  to  do  away  with  the  requirement 
from  SEBI 
of  obtaining  prior  approval 
in  status 
by 
or 
suitable 

intermediaries 
for  change 
constitution.  Accordingly, 

amendments were carried out in regulations 
for  intermediaries  vide  notification  dated 
April 19, 2011.
ii.  Single Window Procedure for Seeking 
Prior  Approval  for  Change  in  Control 
from SEBI

  With  a  view  to  expedite  and  simplify 
the  process  of  granting  prior  approval  for 
change  in  control  of  intermediaries,  it  has 
been  decided  to  adopt  a  ‘single  window 
clearance  at  SEBI’,  for  the  intermediaries  in 
case  of  their  having  multiple  registrations 
with  SEBI.  Accordingly  vide  circular  dated 
August  2,  2011  SEBI  prescribed  that  an 
applicant  who  holds  multiple  registrations 
with SEBI shall make only one application to 
SEBI accompanied by prescribed information 
about  itself,  the  acquirer  and  the  directors/
partners  of  the  acquirer.  This  has  reduced 
the  time  and  paperwork  for  intermediaries 
applying for prior approvals in case of multiple 
registrations.
II.  Registered  Intermediaries  Other  than 

Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers
Prior to the amendment dated July 5, 2011 
 
to  the  regulations  governing  intermediaries 
other  than  stock  brokers  and  sub-brokers, 
intermediaries were granted registration for a 
period of three to five years. Before the expiry 
of  their  registration,  if  they  so  desire,  may 
apply  for  renewal  in  order  to  continue  their 
business.
 
As  per  the  amendment  dated  July  5, 
2011  to  the  Regulations,  intermediaries  are 
granted  initial  registration  for  a  period  of 
five  years.  Before  the  expiry  of  their  initial 
registration, if they so desire, may apply for 
permanent  registration  in  order  to  continue 
their business.

to 

the 

Pursuant 

 
above-mentioned 
amendment,  29  merchant  bankers,  seven 
registrars to an issue and share transfer agents, 
37 depository participants (DPs), three credit 
rating  agencies  and  two  debenture  trustees 
were granted permanent renewal/ registration. 
Overall  59  new  entities  were  granted  initial 
registration whereas 78 existing entities either 
renewed  their  registration  or  got  permanent

registration (Details in Table 3.1a). The details 
of applications of intermediaries in the process 
of registration are provided in Table 3.1a.
 
During  2011-12,  the  highest  increase  in 
absolute  terms  for  registered  intermediaries 
was  observed  in  case  of  DPs  of  CDSL  (33) 
followed by DPs of NSDL (12) and merchant 
bankers (8) (Table 3.1).

Box 3.1 Investment Advisors

Section 11 (2)(b) of SEBI Act empowers SEBI to register and regulate working of Investment Advisors and such other 
intermediaries who may be associated with securities market in any other manner. Sec. 12(1) of SEBI Act, provides 
that investment adviser and such other intermediaries who may be associated with the securities market shall buy, 
sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the condition of a certiﬁ cate of registration obtained 
from SEBI in accordance with regulations made under SEBI Act.
As  decided  by  SEBI  Board  in  its  meeting  dated  March  22,  2007,  SEBI  had  posted  a  consultative  paper  on  the 
“Regulation of Investment Advisors” on its website inviting public comments. Based on public comments received 
on  the  consultative  paper  as  also  the  USAID  (Fire  Project),  a  memorandum  was  placed  before  the  SEBI  Board 
proposing a regulatory approach for Investment Advisers. It was proposed that the Regulations shall be implemented 
through SRO. As Investment Advisors oﬀ er products across asset classes, it was felt that the respective regulators 
may take a view and formulate similar norms and code of conduct. Accordingly a reference was made to the HLCC 
on Financial and Capital Markets.
HLCCFM in its meeting held on December 22, 2008 set up the D. Swarup CommiĴ ee to re-examine the issue. The 
commiĴ ee submiĴ ed its report to government in December 2009 which was discussed in the HLCCFM meeting in 
March 2010. Subsequently, regulatory issues relating to Wealth Management and / Private Banking undertaken by 
banks were discussed by the FSDC Sub-CommiĴ ee in its meeting on March 4, 2011.
Pursuant to the discussions, SEBI released a Concept Paper on regulation of Investment Advisors on September 26, 
2011 and invited Public Comments on the same. The concept paper envisaged regulating those entities/individuals 
who are involved in the act of providing advice through SRO mechanism. It was proposed that the Regulations 
would  cover  the  act  of  giving  advice  on  all  ﬁ nancial  products  across  regulators.  SEBI  received  approximately 
270 comments on the same. Based on comments and responses from other regulators, the scope of the proposed 
regulations is being discussed and issues raised are being resolved at various levels to arrive at an appropriate 
framework for regulating investment advisors.

III.  Registration of Stock Brokers
 
During  2011-12,  256  new  stock  brokers 
were  registered  with  SEBI  in  cash  segment 
whereas there were 184 cases of cancellation/ 
surrender of brokership during the year 2011-
12 as compared to 531 and 100, respectively in 

Table 3.2: Registered Stock Brokers

2010-11. The total number of registered stock 
brokers as on March 31, 2012, increased to 9,307

IV.  Registration of Sub-brokers
 
The  number  of  registered  sub-brokers 
has declined by 8.1 percent from 83,952 as on 
March 31, 2011 to 77,165 as on March 31, 2012. 
However, the number of Authorised Persons 
(APs)  as  approved  by  the  stock  exchanges 
in  accordance  with  SEBI  Guidelines,  has 
increased  substantially  (76.5  percent)  during 
the year (from 55,818 as on March 31, 2011 to 

98,533  as  on  March  31,  2012).  Stock  brokers 
were  allowed  to  provide  market  access  to 
clients  through  APs,  in  addition  to  sub-
brokers, with a view to expand the reach of the 
markets  for  exchange  traded  products,  vide 
SEBI circular dated November 6, 2009. Thus, 
while number of sub-brokers has come down, 
the increased presence of APs has ensured the 
increase in reach of the markets for exchange 
traded products as intended.

Additionally, 

 
stock  brokers/clearing 
members are required to carry out complete 
internal  audit  on  a  half  yearly  basis  by 
independent  auditors.  By  and  large,  all  the 

active stock brokers/clearing members of the 
four  major  stock  exchanges  (NSE,  BSE,  USE 
and  MCX-SX)  have  submitted  the  internal 
audit  report  for  the  half  year  ended  March

Annual Report 2011-12

31,  2011  and  September  30,  2011,  to  the 
respective  stock  exchanges.  These  initiatives 
have improved the compliance level of stock 
brokers  as  they  would  not  like  to  attract 
penalties  again  and  again  following  internal 
audit  by  outside  professionals  and  annual 
inspections by the stock exchanges.
Inspection of Other Intermediaries
ii. 
 
During  the  year  2010-11,  SEBI  carried 
out  inspection  of  certain  merchant  bankers, 
to  ascertain  pre-issue  and  post-issue  due 
diligence  exercised  by  them  in  respect  of 
issue management. During these inspections, 
it  was  observed  that  merchant  bankers 
were  not  maintaining  adequate  supporting 
documents and records in respect of the due 
diligence exercised by them. To strengthen the 
inspections conducted by SEBI and to improve 
the  compliance  culture  in  the  industry,  SEBI 
(Merchant  Bankers)  Regulations,  1992  were 
amended, vide notification dated August 16, 
2011, requiring merchant bankers to maintain 
records  and  documents  pertaining  to  due 
diligence  exercised  in  pre-issue  and  post-
issue activities. Subsequent to the notification, 
SEBI  has  started  carrying  out  inspection  of 
the  merchant  bankers,  after  completion  of 
every public issue, to check the due diligence 
exercised  in  respect  of  pre-issue  and  post-
issue  activities,  and  registrars  to  an  issue  to 
check  the  allotment  process  followed.  This 
will  help  the  intermediaries  involved  in  the 
issue process to rectify the deficiencies, if any, 
immediately and avoid any kind of violation 
in future.
 
During 2011-12, regular inspections were 
completed  for  13  depository  participants, 
seven  merchant  bankers,  five  credit  rating 
agencies,  three  debenture  trustees  and  two 
RTI & STA (Table 3.17).

4.   SURVEILLANCE
I.  Mechanism of Market Surveillance
 
Surveillance  of  the  markets  is  one  of 
the  prime  requirements  for  well  functioning 
securities market. The primary responsibility 
of  safe-guarding  the  integrity  of  the  market 
and  ensuring  that  the  market  is  performing 
in  accordance  with  the  stipulated  norms 
and  practice,  has  been  entrusted  to  stock 
exchanges, which act as first-level regulators. 
The  exchanges,  as  part  of  their  surveillance 
mechanism keep a watch on scrip’s price and 
analyze their trading pattern and appropriate 
actions  are  initiated  by  them  in  case  of  any 
discrepancies.  Any  suspicious  incident  or 
price  movements  are  reported  to  SEBI  for 
further examination.
 
The Integrated Surveillance Department 
(ISD)  of  SEBI  is  in  charge  of  overall  market 
surveillance  and  scope  of 
its  activities 
includes monitoring market movements and 
detecting  potential  breaches  of  regulations, 
analysing the trading in scrip’s and initiation 
of  appropriate  action  wherever  warranted. 
While  primary  inputs  are  received  through 
examination  reports  from  stock  exchanges, 
ISD also receives inputs viz., complaints from 
investors, references from other departments 
of  SEBI,  regulatory  bodies,  and  other  govt. 
agencies as also reports in the media.
 
In addition, to enhance the efficacy of the 
surveillance function, ISD has put in place a 
comprehensive Integrated Market Surveillance 
System (IMSS) which generates alerts arising 
out of unusual market movements. SEBI has 
also  implemented  a  Data  Warehousing  and 
Business Intelligence System (DWBIS) which 
support  multi-dimensional  historical  data, 
have  the  capability  for  pattern  recognition 
to  quickly 
identify  abnormal  situations/ 
transactions,  and  provide  an  analytic

In  addition  to  this,  during  the  financial 
year  2011-12,  compliance  inspections  were 
carried out at the following stock exchanges:-
1)  Pune Stock Exchange Ltd.
2) 

Inter connected Stock Exchange of India 
Ltd.

3)  Cochin Stock Exchange Ltd.
4)  Ludhiana Stock Exchange Ltd.
5)  The Gauhati Stock Exchange Ltd.

7)  The Calcutta Stock Exchange Ltd.
 
The compliance inspections for the first 
six exchanges were carried out for the purpose 
of renewal of recognition of stock exchanges.
 
In  addition  to  above  a  special  purpose 
inspection  of  Pune  Stock  Exchange  Ltd. 
was  also  carried  out  in  line  with  Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) (Manner of Increasing 
and  Maintaining  Public  Shareholding 
in 
Recognised  Stock  Exchanges),  Regulations 
2006.
III.   Follow-up Inspection Reports
 
Based on findings of inspection, the stock 
exchanges  and  depositories  submit  periodic 
compliance report to SEBI on periodic basis. 
These compliance reports are analysed and all 
unimplemented observations are followed up 
for compliance.

environment  that  accelerates  investigation 
functions.
ISD  also  keeps  an  oversight  on  the 
 
the  stock  exchanges  and 
activities  of 
to  promote 
effective 
depositories 
surveillance mechanism. ISD also has regular 
meetings with the exchanges and depositories 
to  monitor  their  surveillance  activities  and 
market movements.
II.  Data  Warehousing 

and  Business 

an 

Intelligence System
 
During  the  year,  DWBIS  -  Phase  I  was 
released  to  intended  users  after  successful 
completion  of  User  Acceptance  Test  (UAT). 
Currently, Phase I is fully operational and is 
released  to  Investigation  and  Surveillance 
Department, thereby helping in swift decision 
making. Also, under DWBIS - Phase II, several 
pattern  recognition  modules  and  predictive 
modeling scenarios are being developed. Some 
parts  of  DWBIS  –  Phase  III  is  also  complete 
and has been released for UAT.
 
Further,  to  leverage  benefits  of  DWBIS 
warehouse capabilities, a pattern identifying 
software  was  developed  by  SEBI 
in 
collaboration  with  NISM.  This  software  has 
been  integrated  with  DWBIS  and  has  been 
released  to  users.  Similar  initiatives  of  joint 
development in text analytics are also under 
consideration. The technologies used for such 
developments  are  evolving  and  SEBI  has 
sought collaboration with technical institutes 
like IITs. To take advantage of the capabilities 
of  DWBIS  and  provide  useful  information 
to  SEBI  as  a  whole,  implementation  of 
knowledge  management  practices  has  also 
been initiated.
III.  Significant Market Movements during 

2011-12
The  top  market  movements  in  terms  of 

 
percentage change are given below:

106

i.  On September 22, 2011, the Sensex went 
down by 704 points (from previous day’s 
closing of 17,065.15) and Nifty declined 
by  209.60  points  (from  previous  day’s 
closing  of  5,133.25).  Sensex  and  Nifty 
closed  at  16,361.15  (-4.1  percent)  and 
4,923.65(-4.1 percent) respectively.

ii.  On  August  29,  2011,  the  Sensex  rose 
by  567.50  points  (from  previous  day’s 
closing  of  15,848.83)  and  Nifty  rose  by 
171.80 points (from previous day’s closing 
of  4,747.80).  Sensex  and  Nifty  closed  at 
16,416.33 (+3.6 percent) and 4919.60 (+3.6 
percent) respectively.

iii.  On  December  21,  2011,  the  Sensex  rose 
by  510.13  points  (from  previous  day’s 
closing  of  15,175.08)  and  Nifty  rose  by 
148.95 points (from previous day’s closing 
of  4,544.20).  Sensex  and  Nifty  closed  at 
15,685.21 (+3.4 percent) and 4,693.15 (+3.3 
percent) respectively.
IV.  Surveillance Actions
 
Stock  exchanges  act  as  the  first-level 
regulators  for  surveillance  to  the  market 
and  during  the  year  2011-12,  NSE  initiated 
preliminary  examination  and  investigation 
in  116  cases  and  BSE  initiated  preliminary 
examination and investigation in 914 cases.
 
Further, as surveillance measure, during 
the  year,  NSE  shifted  311  scrips  to  trade-to-
trade (T to T) segment and BSE shifted 1053 
scrips to trade-to-trade segment. On shifting 
the  scrips  into  trade-to-trade  segment,  both 
legs of the transaction i.e. purchase/sale have 
to be settled separately on a gross basis. This 
leads to reduction in the amount of speculation 
as  only  those  who  can  deliver  the  securities 
can  enter  into  sale  transactions  and  thereby 
day trading is reduced. Further, with a view 
to  dampen  the  amplitude  of  prices,  scrips 
shifted  to  T  to  T  segment  attract  applicable 

circuit filters. NSE reduced circuit filter in 613 
instances and BSE in 1,360 instances. Further, 
NSE and BSE verified 104 and 115 rumours, 
respectively (Table 3.18).

V.  Surveillance Measures
SEBI  conducts  meetings  at  regular 
 
intervals with stock exchanges and depositories 
to  monitor  their  surveillance  activities  and 
market  movements.  In  consultation  with 
the  stock  exchanges  and  depositories,  the 
following  surveillance  measures  have  been 
taken:
a) 

SEBI  has  mandated  that  when  market 
value of a stock is quoting less than the 
face value of that stock, then there shall 
be no stock split in those shares. Also, it 
was decided that subsequent to any split/
consolidation, a cooling off period of three 
years  is  mandatory  before  any  further 
split/consolidation can be undertaken.

b)  SEBI  has  stipulated  that  when  there  is 
substantial change in shareholding of an 
entity  which  would  require  disclosures 
under  the  various  provisions  of  SEBI 
Act  and  Regulations,  the  depositories 
would  provide  such  information  to  the 
stock  exchanges.  The  stock  exchanges 
would  then  verify  whether  disclosures 
as required have been made and in the 
event  of  any  irregularities,  report  the 

107

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

same  to  SEBI.  It  has  also  been  decided 
that depositories shall display ISIN-wise 
information pertaining to pledged shares 
on their websites.
SEBI has advised the exchanges that a list 
 
of companies which are non-compliant with 
the  Listing  Agreement  be  displayed  on  the 
websites of BSE and NSE after notice has been 
sent to the companies for non-compliance of 
Listing Agreement.
 
SEBI  has  decided  that  trading  shall  be 
suspended in partly paid shares of companies 
whose issue size is less than  `500 crore and 
wherein  the  partly  paid  shares  have  been 
in  existence  for  more  than  12  months.  The 
companies  having  issue  size  greater  than 
`500  crore  shall  be  required  to  include  the 
information about partly paid shares and fully 
paid  shares  in  their  secretarial  audit  report 
that is submitted to stock exchanges. Failure 
to do so shall attract appropriate action by the 
stock exchanges. In addition to the above, all 
instruments issued by a company other than 
debentures  and  which  are  linked  to  equity 
shares  of  the  company  or  have  equity  like 
features (warrants, etc), shall attract uniform 
surveillance action.
For  exchange  traded  funds,  SEBI  has 
 
advised  the  stock  exchanges  to  apply  price 
bands on the NAV of two days before trading 
day of exchange traded funds.
VI.  Enforcement Actions
 
During  2011-12,  SEBI  passed  many 
orders  in  its  enforcement  capacity.  Some  of 
the important orders are given below:

trading  and  off  market 
transfers  in  few  scrips  like  M/s.  IKF 
Technologies Ltd, M/s. Avon Corporation 
Ltd,  M/s.  Cat  Technologies  Ltd,  M/s. 
Asahi Infrastructure Ltd. and M/s. K Sera 
Sera Ltd. Examination revealed that these 
Indian  companies  were  raising  capital 
from overseas market via issuing GDRs 
which  were  converted  into  equity  and 
sold in Indian markets in a short span of 
time  after  the  issue.  The  lead  manager 
in  all  of  these  issues  was  found  to  be 
common viz., M/s. Pan Asia Advisors Ltd. 
(PAAL), an entity registered in UK. Mr. 
Arun Panchariya (AP) is the founder and 
director  of  PAAL.  Further  investigation 
revealed the following:-
•  All the above issues were subscribed 

by same set of subscribers.

•  A few of the subscribers are connected 

with AP.

•  GDRs were being purchased by FIIs 
or Sub-accounts to FIIs overseas, and 
were converted into equity and then 
sold in the Indian market.

•  One  such  FII  which  was  actively 
converting  these  GDRs  and  selling 
it in India was India Focus Cardinal 
Fund (IFCF), managed by AP.

•  The counterparties to sale carried out 

by FIIs were also connected to AP.

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  in  order  to 
protect  the  interest  of  investors  and 
integrity  of  securities  market,  an  ad 
interim  ex  parte  order  under  Section 
11(1), 11(4) and 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 was 
passed  issuing  directions  against  seven 
listed  companies,  four  sub-accounts,

Interim Order in the scrip of M/s. Bodal 
Chemicals Ltd
BSE, on Aug 27, 2011, received a fax from 
Bodal Chemicals Ltd. on a letterhead of 
the company informing that the meeting 
of the Board of Director of the company 
will  be  held  on  August  29,  2011  to 
consider  and  approve  bonus  issue  and 
also  enclosed  an  undated  press  release 
issued by the company which, inter alia, 
stated about the disinvestments plans of 
the company, etc.
This  news  was  disseminated  on  BSE 
website on Aug 29, 2011, at 8:13 hrs and 
8:18 hrs. Further, through a clarification 
submitted  to  BSE,  the  company  denied 
making  the  above  disclosures  to  the 
Exchange.  Amid  the  above  disclosures 
followed by the denial, it was observed 
that the price of the scrip fluctuated with 
spurt  in  volumes,  Exchanges  (BSE  and 
NSE) were asked to analyse the trading 
pattern in the scrip of the Company and 
submit a report.
On analysis, it was seen that Hemaliben 
Mehta, Charuben Mehta and Bhavanaben 
Vaghasiya were the top sellers during the 
crucial  period  of  trading,  which  is  pre-
denial  period  when  the  investors  were 
taking  decisions  on  basis  of  incorrect 
positive  news  about 
the  company. 
Since  there  was  a  suspicion  of  fraud, 
investigation  was  initiated.  Pending  its 
completion,  following  directions  were 
issued through an interim order:
•  Direction to BSE and NSE to withhold 
the pay-out of securities and funds for 
the trading done on their respective 
Exchanges  on  August  29,  2011  to 
ensure 
the  securities/funds 
are  not  disposed  off  by  the  alleged 
perpetrators of manipulation, if any.

any  manner  whatsoever,  till  further 
directions.

 

c)  Adjudication  Order  in  the  matter  of 

 

India  Ltd. 

M/s. Passport India Ltd.
During the course of SEBI investigation 
it  was  revealed  that  Mr.  Kanaiyalal 
Baldevbhai  Patel  (KB)  had  placed  and 
executed  orders  before  the  orders  of 
Passport 
(Passport)  and 
subsequently  squared  off  his  positions 
when the orders of Passport were placed 
in  the  market.  It  was  alleged  that  the 
activity was conducted in such a manner 
that  KB  had  managed  to  generate  ill 
gotten  profits  for  himself  by  the  price 
movement  of  scrips  that  happened  on 
account  of  the  large  buy/sell  orders  of 
Passport.  KB  has  earned  a  total  profit 
of  `1,56,32,364.01  from 
the  alleged 
trading. It was observed from the details 
submitted by the stock brokers who had 
executed  orders  on  behalf  of  Passport 
that  Mr.  Dipak  Patel  (DP)  was  the 
portfolio  manager  for  India  of  Passport 
and  served  as  the  point  of  contact 
between the stock brokers and Passport. 
Mr. Anandkumar Baldevbhai Patel (AB) 
is one of the relative of KB and DP and 
is also a recipient of ill gotten gains due 
to activity of KB and DP. It was alleged 
that the DP provided information to KB 
and AB with regard to the forthcoming 
trading activity of Passport and KB took 
advantage of the same and indulged in 
front running i.e. he placed and executed 
orders before the orders of Passport and 
subsequently  squared  off  his  positions

when the orders of Passport were placed 
in the market.
Adjudication  order  was  passed  against 
Anandkumar  Baldevbhai  Patel  (AB), 
Kanaiyalal  Baldevbhai  Patel  (KB)  and 
Dipak Patel (DP) in the matter of Passport 
India  Ltd.  (Passport)  on  September  30, 
2011 , wherein a penalty of `11,00,00,000/- 
was levied on these three entities.

d)  Adjudication  Order  in  the  matter  of 

M/s. Sarang Chemicals Ltd. (SCL)
SEBI  examined  the  trading  activity  of 
M/s.  Atlanta  Share  Shopee  Limited,  a 
member  broker  of  the  BSE  Ltd.  in  the 
scrip of M/s. Sarang Chemicals Limited. 
From  the  shareholding  pattern  of  the 
company  available  on  the  website  of 
the  stock  exchanges,  it  was  observed 
that M/s. Atlanta Share Shopee Limited 
was holding 98,03,802 shares of SCL (5.6 
percent of the issued share capital/voting 
rights of SCL) during the quarter ending 
June  30,  2009.  In  view  of  the  above,  it 
was alleged that the entity had acquired 
and was holding more than five percent 
shares/voting rights in SCL. However, it 
failed to make the required disclosures in 
terms of the provisions of Regulation 7(1) 
of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997 and 
Regulation 13(1) of the SEBI (Prohibition 
of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  1992. 
Further,  as  it  is  not  a  normal  business 
practice of stock brokers to keep shares 
of  its  clients  in  their  own  beneficiary 
account for such a long period, therefore, 
the entity has also violated the provisions 
of the code of conduct for stock brokers 
specified 
in  Schedule  II  read  with 
regulation  7  of  the  SEBI  (Stock  Brokers 
and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992.

of  Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading  (PIT) 
regulations.  Accordingly,  adjudication

Against  Five  Entities  w.r.t  Their 
Dealings in the Scrip of M/s. AV Cottex 
Ltd
From

into  the  dealings  in  the  scrip  of  M/s. 
AV  Cottex  Ltd,  wherein 
the 
analysis  of  the  company’s  submissions 
regarding the acquisition by its erstwhile 
promoter entities during April 1, 2006 to 
November 30, 2006, and from the details 
provided by the company regarding top 
shareholders at the end of each quarter 
during March 2006 to December 2006, it

was observed that several entities had not 
made  disclosures  related  to  the  change 
in their shareholding as required under 
SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)

 Prevention of Money Laundering:
iii) 
 
Money laundering is globally recognised 
as  one  of  the  largest  threats  posed  to  the 
financial  system  of  a  country.  The  fight 
against  terrorist  financing  is  another  such 
emerging  threat  with  grave  consequences 
for both the political and economic standing 
of  a  jurisdiction.  Rapid  developments  and 
greater  integration  of  the  financial  markets 
together  with  improvements  in  technology 
and  communication  channels  continue  to 
pose  serious  challenges  to  the  authorities, 
and  institutions  dealing  with  anti-money 
laundering  and  combating 
financing  of 
terrorism (AML and CFT).
 
The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering 
Act  ,  2002  (PMLA)  and  Rules  framed  there 
under brought into force with effect from July 
1,  2005  has  been  a  significant  step  towards 
India  joining  the  global  war  against  money 
laundering and financing of terrorism.

During  2011-12,  SEBI  continued 

 
its 
focused  efforts  to  bolster  the  regulatory 
framework and minimise the risk emanating 
from  money 
terrorist 
financing. Following are the further measures 
and steps taken in this regard:
• 

laundering  and 

SEBI had issued circulars on August 22, 
2011  and  October  5,  2011  to  strengthen 
the KYC related guidelines. As a result, 
the  requirements  prescribed  for  KYC 
including the documentary requirements 
have  been  made  uniform  for  investors 
while  opening  accounts  with 
the 
intermediaries in securities markets.
SEBI had conducted 35 specific purpose 
inspections of stock brokers to check their 
KYC process, the extent of due-diligence 
and  compliance 
level  with  current 
regulatory  and  statutory  framework  in 
this regard. Action with regard to these 
cases is in progress.
Stock  exchanges  and  depositories  have 
their 
also  conducted 
members/participants 
to 
verify  compliance  with  the  AML/CFT 
framework  and  took  actions  where 
AML/CFT 
violations/discrepancies 
were  observed.  The  tables  given  below 
provide data on the number of members/
participants  against  whom  action  for 
AML/CFT discrepancies have been taken 
by the exchanges and depositories :

market.  SEBI  is  therefore  constantly  striving 
to upgrade its investigative skills by making 
use  of  Information  Technology.  Importance 
of effective and credible use of investigation 
has  also  been  underscored  by  IOSCO  in  its 
“Principles for the Enforcement of Securities 
Regulation”.
 
the  above  objectives  and 
Keeping 
principles  of  securities  regulations  in  view, 
SEBI initiates investigation to examine alleged 
or suspected violations of laws and obligations 
relating  to  securities  market.  The  possible 
violations  may  include  price  manipulation, 
creation  of  artificial  market,  insider  trading, 
capital  issue  related  irregularities,  takeover 
related 
of 
disclosure  requirements  and  any  other 
misconduct in the securities markets.
Initiation of Investigation
I. 
 
There are various sources of information 
for  initiation  of  investigation.  SEBI  initiates 
investigation  based  on  reference  received 
from sources such as stock exchanges, internal 
surveillance  department,  other  government 
departments, 
submitted  by 
market  participants  and  complainants.  In 
appropriate  cases,  investigation  may  also  be 
initiated suo moto, where there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that investors’ interests are 
being adversely affected or there is a suspected 
violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  securities 
laws.
II.  Process of Investigation
 
The steps involved during investigation 
process  include  an  analysis  of  market  data 
(order  and  trade  log,  transaction  statements 
etc.) and static data (KYC documents obtained 
from  brokers,  depository  participants  etc., 
bank records, financial results, events around 
major  corporate  developments  etc.)  The 

violations, 

information 

• 

Stock  exchanges  and  depositories  also 
conducted  trainings/seminars  for  their 
members  to  sensitize  them  towards  the 
significance of AML/CFT framework and 
the need to ensure continuous compliance 
with it.
 
SEBI has consistently been in touch with 
the global bodies and other Indian regulators 
in its attempt to keep regulatory framework 
for  AML  robust  in  the  Indian  securities 
markets.  SEBI  officials  as  part  of  the  Indian 
Government  delegation  participated  in  the 
plenary and working group meetings of FATF 
and  ‘Eurasian  Group  on  Combating  Money 
Laundering  and  Terrorist  Financing  (EAG)’, 
which  is  a  FATF-style  regional  body  (FSRB) 
with  a  view  to  set  standards  and  promote 
effective implementation of legal, regulatory 
and  operational  measures  for  combating 
money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and 
other  related  threats  to  the  integrity  of  the 
international financial system.
 
The Eurasian Group (EAG) had instituted 
a typology research project on topic “Money 
Laundering  through  the  Securities  Market” 
and  India  was  assigned  leadership  of  this 
project  in  March  2011.  SEBI  has  initiated 
work for preparation of report on the research 
project. In this regard, SEBI had presented the 
preliminary findings of the project in the EAG 
plenary held on November 23, 2011.

INVESTIGATION
5. 
 
Timely completion of investigation cases 
and  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive 
action  in  case  of  violations  of  established 
securities  laws  is  important  for  protection 
of 
interest  and  ensuring  fair, 
transparent  and  orderly  functioning  of  the 
market.  It  is  also  vital  for  improving  the 
confidence  in  the  integrity  of  the  securities 

investors’ 

113

Annual Report 2011-12

purpose  of  such  investigation  is  to  gather 
evidence  and  to  identify  persons/  entities 
behind  irregularities  and  violations  so  that 
appropriate  and  suitable  regulatory  action 
can  be  taken,  wherever  required.  Outcome 
of  investigation  in  the  form  of  enforcement 
action is a clear signal to the market players to 
comply with the law and expected standards 
of conduct in the market.
III.  Trends in Investigation Cases
Since  1992-93,  SEBI  has  undertaken 
 
1,617 
investigation  cases.  In  1,420  cases 
investigations  have  been  completed.  Apart 
from  enforcement  action,  an 
important 
attendant  benefit 
such 
investigations  is  contribution  to  the  policy 
changes with a view to further strengthen the 
regulatory and enforcement environment.
 
During  2011-12,  154  new  cases  were 
taken up for investigation and 74 cases were 
completed (Table 3.20 and Chart 3.3).

Cases 

Up
During 2011-12, about 47 percent of the 
cases  taken  up  for  investigation  pertain  to 
market  manipulation  and  price  rigging,  as 
against about 54 percent of such cases in the 
previous year. Other cases pertain to insider 
trading,  takeover  violations,  irregularities  in 
capital issues, and other violations of securities 
laws. Since, several investigation cases involve 
multiple allegations of violations, water-tight 
classification under specific category becomes 
difficult.  Therefore,  cases  were  classified  on 
the basis of main charge / violations.

During  2011-12,  about  50  percent 
of  the  cases  completed  pertain  to  market

about 62 percent of such cases in the previous 
year. Other cases in which investigation was 
completed  pertain  to  capital  issue  related 
manipulation, insider trading, takeovers etc.

Box 3.2: SEBI Investigations in recent Initial Public Oﬀ ers (2011)

 
SEBI had initiated preliminary investigations into certain Initial Public Oﬀ ers (IPOs) that raised funds during 
the  year  2011  wherein  it  was  prima  facie  found  that,  many  of  the  prospectus  /  RHPs  (Red  herring  prospectus) 
did not contain certain material, true and adequate disclosures so as to enable the applicants to take an informed 
investment decision. However, the directors and other signatories had wrongly certiﬁ ed in the RHP that all the 
disclosures made in the oﬀ er document were true and correct. The Merchant Bankers Companies and respective 
directors had apparently colluded with the issuers or had failed to exercise the required level of due diligence. It 
was also observed that in some cases, the issuer companies did not make prompt, true and fair disclosure of all the 
material developments that took place between the date of the RHP and the date of allotment of securities through 
public notices, as required. Further, in some cases, funds raised by the companies had reached some traders through 
various layers and these traders had traded signiﬁ cantly on the day of listing or around that time, in manipulative 
paĴ erns.
 
Based on the preliminary ﬁ ndings/observations, Shri Prashant Saran, Whole Time Member, SEBI, passed ad 
interim, ex-parte orders under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A and 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 against 208 entities inter-alia 
including the 7 issuer companies, their directors, 5 Merchant bankers, on December 28, 2011. The salient directions 
issued to these entities included;
1.  Prohibition on issuer companies from raising any further capital from the securities market, in any manner 
whatsoever, till further directions. The issuer companies, directors and other signatories who signed the RHP 
were prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in the securities market in any manner whatsoever, till further 
directions.

2.  The companies were directed to call back the money invested in ICDs and all amounts transferred / paid out 
of IPO proceeds to their directors or relatives of their directors or HUFs belonging to any of the directors or 
associate or subsidiaries or group companies and to deposit these amounts together with all of the IPO proceeds 
that were still lying unutilized with the companies across all their bank / deposit accounts or any investments 
including in mutual funds, in an interest bearing escrow account with a scheduled commercial bank, till further 
orders.

3.  The Book Running Lead Managers and their CEOs and Heads of Merchant Bankers were prohibited from 
taking up any new assignment or involvement in any new issue of capital including IPO, follow-on issue etc. 
from the securities market in any manner whatsoever, till further directions.
In some cases, stock brokers were prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in any securities, in any manner 
whatsoever, in their proprietary accounts, and were also prohibited from entering into any fresh agreements 
with new clients in their operations as stock broker till further orders. In one of the case, brokers and their 
directors  were  prohibited  from  buying,  selling  or  dealing  in  any  securities,  in  any  manner  whatsoever,  till 
further orders.

5.  Some entities who were identiﬁ ed to have traded on the listing day and had received money through routing 
of IPO proceeds directly or indirectly through related entities, were prohibited from buying, selling or dealing 
in any securities, in any manner whatsoever, till any further orders.

IV.  Regulatory Action
investigation, 
 
further  penal  action  is  initiated  as  per  the 
recommendations  made  in  the  investigation 
reports  and  as  approved  by  the  competent 
authority.  Action 
is  decided  based  on 
the  principles  of  objectivity,  consistency, 
materiality and quality of evidence available, 
after  thorough  analysis  and  appreciation  of 
facts.
The  action  included  issuing  warning 
 
enquiry  proceedings 
letters, 
for 
initiating 
adjudication proceedings for levy of monetary 
penalties, passing directions under Section 11 
of  SEBI Act,  1992  and  initiating  prosecution 
and  referring  matter  to  other  regulatory 
agencies.  As  a  matter  of  policy,  SEBI  has 
continued to lay greater emphasis on issuance 
of  prohibitive  directions  under  Section  11 
of  the  SEBI Act,  1992.  These  directions  have 
the  strong  and  salutary  effect  of  deterrence 
and also act as an effective tool to deal with 
emergent  situations 
timely 
and  faster  response.  SEBI  issued  487  such 
directions during 2011-12. A detailed break up 
of all regulatory actions is given in Table 3.22 
and Chart 3.6.

V.  Follow-up of Investigations
 
After  completion  of  investigation,  the 
Investigation  Department  is  also  actively 
involved  in  post-investigation  enforcement 
actions  and  quasi-judicial  proceedings.  Such 
actions  include  issuing  show  cause  notices 
to 
their  replies, 
organising and participating in the hearings of 
the entities before the Whole Time Members 
of  SEBI,  co-ordination  with  Enforcement

passed  by  Adjudicating  Officers,  initiating 
prosecution  for  non-payment  of  penalties, 
processing  of  consent  proposals  filed  by  the 
entities, etc. Timely and qualitative completion 
of such actions is also important for ensuring 
the effectiveness of regulatory measures taken 
by SEBI.

6.   ENFORCEMENT OF

IV.  Regulatory Actions against CISs
iv.  Reference to MCA
 
SEBI  made  a  reference  to  Ministry  of 
Corporate Affairs (MCA) regarding the names 
the CIS entities and their directors who have 
carried out CIS operations in violation of the 
SEBI  (CIS)  Regulations,  1999  with  a  request 
to  circulate  the  same  as  a  caution  list  of 
entities and directors among all RoCs so as to 
prevent such entities and directors from being 
associated with any new company.
v.  Regulatory  Action  against  CIS  entity, 

M/s. Sun-Plant Agro Limited
 
The entity claimed to be involved in the 
sale of trees to investors whereas in reality it 
was having Collective investment schemes in 
the guise of this business. An interim ex-parte 
order of SEBI under Section 11B was passed 
on  October  21,  2010  against  the  company. 
After  personal  hearing,  a  final  order  was 
passed  against  M/s.  Sun-Plant  on  May  3,

Delhi
A criminal complaint was filed by SEBI 
against  M/s  Bright  Forests  Ltd.  and  its 
directors alleging violation of Section 12 
(1B)  of  SEBI Act  read  with  Regulations 
5(1),  68(1),68(2),  73  (1)  and  74,  of  the 
SEBI (CIS) Regulation, 1999, constituting

the  complaint  in  question  there  is  an 
averment that since the company did not 
register  the  scheme  by  March  31,2000. 
On  December  7,2000,  SEBI  directed  the 
company to refund the money collected 
under the scheme to the investors within

by the company is not that it did not get

e)  Mr. Varinder Bharti vs. SEBI( Criminal 
M.C. 858/2010) – Before the High Court 
of Delhi
This  petition  is  filed  by  Mr.  Varinder 
Bharti  under  Section  482  of  the  Code 
of  Criminal  Procedure  for  quashing  of 
criminal  complaint  filed  by  respondent 
i.e.  SEBI  against  M/s  Janraksha  Green 
Forests  Ltd.  and  Others  ,  including  the 
petitioner under Section 24(1) and 27 of 
SEBI Act  for  the  violation  of  Section  12 
(1B)  of  SEBI Act  read  with  Regulations 
5(1),  68(1),68(2),  73  (1)  and  74,  of  the 
SEBI  (CIS)  Regulation,  1999  .  Quashing 
has  been  primarily  on  the  ground  that 
petitioner  was  neither  a  director  nor  a 
person in -charge of and responsible to 
the  Company  Janraksha  Green  Forests 
Ltd. for conduct of its business nor did 
he have any connection whatsoever with

he was neither a director nor he had any 
association  with  the  accused  company, 
namely  Janraksha  Green  Forests  Ltd.

strength of certain communications sent 
by accused company and the petitioner”. 

 

128

held that the plea raised by the petitioner 
is  a  question  of  fact,  which  can  be 
determined only on the basis of evidence, 
which is the subject matter of trial. Thus 
the  Hon’ble  Court  concluded  that  no 
reason  to  invoke  section  482  Cr.P.C  to

f)  M/s.  Jas  One  Securities  Pvt.  Ltd.  and 
Others  vs.  SEBI  (Misc  Cri.  Appln 
1185/2008) – Before the Addl. Sessions 
Judge, Mumbai
M/s.  Jas  One  Securities  Pvt.  Ltd.  (A1) 
and Mr. Jaswant A. Parikh (A2) were the 
applicant in Criminal case No. 115/s/2003 
before  Additional  Chief  Metropolitan 
Magistarte  47th  Court,  at  Esplanade 
Mumbai.  The  Magistrate  passed  the 
order for issue of summons against the 
accused for the charge of section 193 of 
the  India  Penal  Code.  The  applicants 
claimed  aggrieved  by  the  order  of  the 
Magistrate.  The  applicants  presented 
criminal revision application to the Addl. 
Session  Court  on  July  18,  2008  along 
with delay condonation application. The 
Sessions Court allowed the  application 
in  favour  of  the  applicants.  The  said 
order  was  challenged  by  SEBI  by  filing 
the  criminal  writ  petition  no.2126/2009 
before  Hon’ble  High  court  of  Mumbai.    
The  Hon’ble  High  Court    by  an  order 
dated September 22, 2011  set aside the 
order passed by the Addl. Sessions Court 
with a direction to rehear the application 
afresh.  Consequently, the matter came up  
before the Addl. Sessions Court, Mumbai 
for fresh hearing on delay condonation.
The Court of Additional Sessions Judge, 
Mumbai  has  held  that  the  court  would 
take  liberal  approach  in  the  matter  of 
delay condonation, particularly for filing 

 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

of  criminal  rev.  application  in  case  the 
facts of the case indicating that accused 
need  not  be  dragged  for  years  on  the 
allegations  of  prosecution.  Here  the 
situations are different. The accused have 
dragged respondent no.1(SEBI) for about 
eight  /nine  years  to  fight  out  different 
litigations  before  different  court  at  the 
stage of process only. Further, the Court 
held that specific schedule is given in the 
Limitation Act for knocking the doors of 
the court by the aggrieved party against 
his opponent. In such cases 90 days was 
the period recognised by the law under 
limitation  act,  1963  for  challenging  the 
order  of  issuance  process  within  the 
scope  of  section  397(1)  of  the  Code  of 
Criminal  Procedure  but  the  applicants 
rushed  to  the  court  after  lapse  of  four 
years.  The  Ld.  Court  has  also  observed 
that trial proceeding has to be disposed 
of  by 
the  court  within  reasonable 
period of six months but due to conduct 
and  approach  of  the  applicants  the 
proceeding  is  at  the  stage  of  process 
even after lapses of four years. This is not 
expected in the administration of justice 
particularly  under  the  Limitation  Act. 
Accordingly,  the  Addl.  Sessions  Court 
vide its order dated 02/03/2012 dismissed 
the  miscellaneous  criminal  application 
for delay condonation.

10.   Investor Assistance and Education
I.  Redressal of Investor Grievances
 
SEBI has been taking various measures to 
expedite the redressal of investor grievances. 
The grievances lodged by investors are taken 
up  with  the  respective  listed  company  and 
are continuously monitored. The company is 
required  to  respond  in  prescribed  format  in 
the form of Action Taken Report (ATR). Upon 
the  receipt  of  ATR,  the  status  of  grievances 
is  updated.  If  the  response  of  the  company 
is insufficient / inadequate, follow up action 
is  initiated.  Grievances  pertaining  to  stock 
brokers  and  depository  participants  are 
taken up with concerned stock exchange and 
depository for redressal and monitored by the 
concerned department through periodic report 
obtained from them. Grievances pertaining to 
other intermediaries are taken up with them 
directly  for  redressal  and  are  continuously 
monitored  by  concerned  department  of 
SEBI.  SEBI  takes  appropriate  enforcement 
actions (adjudication, directions, prosecution 
etc)  as  provided  under  the 
law  where 
progress  in  redressal  of  investor  grievances 
is not satisfactory. The following paragraphs 
highlight  SEBI’s  performance  and  measures 
taken  in  the  year  2011-12  for  expediting  the 
redressal of investor grievances.

II.  SEBI Complaints Redress System:
During  2011-12,  SEBI  commenced  a 
 
new web-based centralised grievance redress 
system  called  as  SEBI  Complaints  Redress 
System (SCORES) on June 8, 2011. In the new 
system, all the activities starting from lodging 
of a complaint till its closure by SEBI would 
be online in an automated environment and 
the status of every complaint can be viewed 
online  in  the  above  website  at  any  time. An 
investor,  who  is  not  familiar  with  SCORES 
or does not have access to SCORES, can also 
lodge  complaints  in  physical  form.  Such 
complaints  are  scanned  and  uploaded  in 
SCORES for processing. In view of above, all 
grievances received will be in electronic mode 
with facility for online updation of ATRs by 
the users.
 
SEBI  has  received  46,548  complaints 
for  2011-12  and  resolved  53,841  complaints 
as  compared  to  56,670  grievances  received 
and  66,552  grievances  resolved  in  the  year 
2010-11.  As  on  March  31,  2012,  there  were 
23,725  complaints  pending  resolution  as 
compared to 28,653 pending grievances as on 
March 31, 2011.
 
The status of investor grievances received 
and redressed for the past four years is given

Adjudication  proceedings  have  been 
 
initiated  against  five  companies  for  levying

public  issue  of  securities  are  required  to 
deposit one percent of the issue amount with 
the designated stock exchange. This deposit is 
released by the stock exchange only after SEBI 
issues a No-objection Certificate (NoC). SEBI 
issues  NoC  to  companies  after  satisfactory 
redressal  of  complaints  received  by  SEBI 
against the company.
 
During 2011-12, NoCs were issued to 85 
applicant companies. NoCs to 47 companies 
were  not  issued  as  the  applications  were 
incomplete or due to unsatisfactory redressal 
of investor grievances.

VII. Financial Education

 
Financial  education  of  general  public  is 
the  key  to  financial  growth  of  any  country. 
Financial  education  means  “the  process  by 
which financial consumers/ investors improve

concepts and risks and, through information, 
instruction and/ or objective advice, develop 
the  skills  and  confidence  to  become  more 
aware of financial risks and opportunities, to 
make informed choices, to know where to go 
for help, and to take other effective actions to 
improve  their  financial  well  being.”  (OECD 
definition).  SEBI  has  taken  the  following 
programs  to  spread  financial  literacy  across 
the country

SEBI-  OECD 

SEBI  OECD  International  Conference 
on Investor Education
The 

 
International 
Conference on Investor Education, “Towards 
a more inclusive and secure financial world”, 
was  held  in  Goa  on  3-4  February  2012, 
co-organised  by  Organisation  for  Economic 
Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  and 
SEBI.
 
The  two  day  conference  started  with 
opening  remarks  by  Mr.  Prashant  Saran, 
Whole  Time  Member,  SEBI  welcoming  an 
international  audience  of  almost  200  experts 
from 45 countries. Mr. U. K. Sinha, Chairman 
SEBI  gave  the  keynote  address  and  Mr. 
Richard  Boucher,  Deputy  Secretary-  General 
of  OECD  giving  the 
inaugural  address. 
Mr.  Rajeev  Kumar  Agarwal,  Whole  Time 
Member,  SEBI  offered  the  vote  of  thanks. 
Mr.  Pranab  Mukherjee,  Honourable  Finance 
Minister,  Government  of  India,  could  not 
attend  the  event  as  planned,  but  addressed 
the participants with a formal message which 
was read at the conference.
 
There  were  various  sessions  with 
experts from different countries representing 
Government, 
intermediaries, 
NGOs, IAs and other stakeholders of investor 
education.  The  feedback  received  from  the 
participants has been that it was an extremely 
successful  conference  and  the  same  would 
result  in  likely  creation  of  a  subgroup  for 
investor education in the framework of INFE 
in  2012-13  for  more  focused  and  detailed 
study in future.
 
It  was  also  another  milestone  in  the 
co-operation  between  India  and  the  OECD. 
It  will  pave  the  way  for  more  structured 
collaboration in the future.

make  the  Takeover  practices  in  India  more 
clear,  fair,  equitable  and  transparent.  Some 
of the significant changes made through the 
regulations include:
a. 

Initial  trigger  threshold  increased  to  25 
percent from the existing 15 percent.

b.  There shall be no separate provision for 
non-compete  fees  and  all  shareholders

the same process again when he approaches 
another  intermediary.  Main  features  of  the 
KRA Regulations include the following:
•  KRA  to  be  wholly  owned  subsidiary 
of  any  of  the  stock  exchanges  having 
nationwide terminals, depositories, SROs 
or intermediaries.
Identification  of 
the  customer  and 
collection  of  initial  KYC  documents 
shall be carried by KRA through Points 
of  Service  (PoS)  which  will  be  SEBI 
registered intermediaries.

PRONOUNCEMENTS

I.  Supreme Court
  M/s. Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange 
Ltd.  vs.  SEBI  (Civil  Appeal  No(s).  5498  of 
2008)
 
M/s.  Saurashtra  Kutch  Stock  Exchange 
Ltd  is  in  appeal  under  Section  22F  of  the 

152

Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956 
(for short, ‘the 1956 Act’) against the judgment 
and order dated July 13, 2007 passed by the 
Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) whereby 
its appeal was dismissed. The said SAT appeal 
was  filed  by  the  appellant  challenging  the 
Order dated July 5, 2007 passed by the Whole 
Time  Member  (WTM)  of  SEBI,  withdrawing 
the recognition of the appellant.
 
The  appellant  challenged  the  order 
dated  July  13,  2007  passed  by  the Appellate 
Tribunal  as  well  as  the  order  dated  July  5, 
2007 passed by the WTM of SEBI by filing a 
Special Civil Application under Article 226 of 
the  Constitution  of  India  before  the  Gujarat 
High Court. Diverse grounds were raised in 
challenging these orders. The appellant took 
up  the  position  before  the  High  Court  that 
the remedy of appeal against the order dated 
July 5, 2007 cannot be said to be appropriate 
redressal  of  the  grievances  of  the  appellant 
and  the  matter  should  be  considered  by  the 
High  Court.  Inter-alia,  a  specific  plea  was 
raised by the appellant before the High Court 
that the WTM of SEBI had no jurisdiction to 
cancel or withdraw recognition granted to it 
and withdrawal of recognition under Section 
5  of  the  1956 Act  by  the  WTM  of  SEBI  was 
unjust, arbitrary and de hors the provisions of 
the statute.
 
The  High  Court  dismissed  the  Special 
Civil Application vide order dated November 
11,  2007 
the 
Central  Government  notification  dated  13th 
September,  1994  issued  in  exercise  of  power 
under Section 29A of the SCR Act of 1956, read 
with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 would 
mean that the Board may in writing delegate 
its  power  to  any  member  of  the  Board  and, 
therefore,  the  power  exercised  by  the  WTM 
of  the  Board  under  Section  11  of  the  SEBI 
Act, 1992, or even withdrawal of recognition 
under Section 5 of the SCR Act of 1956, cannot

be said to be unjust or arbitrary or de hors the 
provisions  of  the  statute  and,  therefore,  the 
contention of the appellant that no remedy of 
appeal is available to the petitioner cannot be 
accepted.”
 
Not satisfied with the order of the High 
Court, the appellant preferred Special Leave 
Petition which came to be dismissed by this 
Court on March 10, 2008. After the dismissal 
of  the  Special  Leave  Petition,  the  appellant 
preferred  the  present  civil  appeal  under 
Section 22F of the 1956 Act against the order 
dated  July  13,  2007  passed  by  the Appellate 
Tribunal.
 
question of law has been framed:-
 
“Whether  the  WTM  of  SEBI  has  no 
jurisdiction to cancel or withdraw recognition 
granted to a Stock Exchange on the principle 
that  Delegate  cannot  further  delegate  its 
power, and whether the order under challenge 
is without jurisdiction?”
 
The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  vide  the 
Order dated March 14, 2012 observed that it is 
not necessary to go into the above question as 
it finds that this very question was raised by 
the appellant before the High Court in extra-
ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India.
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court dismissing 
the said appeal observed that the High Court, 
as noted above, in its order dated November 19, 
2007 held that the withdrawal of recognition 
under Section 5 of the 1956 Act by the WTM 
of SEBI under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992 
cannot be said to be de hors the provisions of 
the Act  and  the  Special  Leave  Petition  from 
the above order of the High Court came to be 
dismissed  by  this  Court  on  March  10,  2008. 
The same question cannot be allowed to be re-
opened in the present Appeal.

II.  High Courts
A.  M/s. Chanchal Jain & Ors. vs. SEBI (LPA 
No. 507/2009) - before the High Court of 
Delhi
 
The captioned writ petition was filed in the 
Delhi High Court challenging the Single Judge 
Order dated July 24, 2009 passed in respect of 
an earlier Writ Petition (C) No.10390/2009 that 
was filed challenging the SEBI circular SEBI/
IMD/CIR No. 4/168230/09 (impugned circular) 
dated June 30, 2009 waiving the imposition of 
entry load on investors.
 
The  Hon’ble  Delhi  High  Court,  upheld 
the  vires  of  the  impugned  circular  inter-alia 
on  the  ground  that  the  impugned  circular 
did not prohibit commission to be charged by 
distributors. Accordingly, the Hon’ble Bench 
was pleased to dismiss the appeal.
B.  MCX-  SX  vs.  SEBI  (Writ  Petition  No. 
213 of 2011) - before the High Court at 
Mumbai
 
SEBI,  vide  order  dated  September  23, 
2011  (Impugned  Order)  disposed  of  the 
application  dated  April  7,  2010  filed  by  the 
petitioner,  MCX-SX,  seeking  permission  to 
deal in interest rate derivatives, equity, futures 
and  options  on  equity  and  wholesale  debt 
segments permitted to the BSE and the NSE. 
The Impugned Order, inter alia, sets out the 
following grounds for rejecting the aforesaid 
application-
• 

the  MIMPs 

Full  Compliance  with 
Regulations-
Promoters of MCX-SX as PACs
The Applicant as Fit and Proper Person
Buy-back Arrangements  by  MCX-SX  in 
violation of the SCRA

• 
• 
• 

•  Concentration  of  Economic  Interest  of 

the Promoters.

154

 
The  Bombay  High  Court,  with  respect 
to the first ground held that it was not possible 
to  accept  the  finding  that  the  issuance  of 
warrants to the two promoters was a device 
which  would  result  in  a  restoration  of  their 
holding  beyond  the  limit  prescribed  by  the 
MIMPS  Regulations.  A  mere  possibility  of 
what  may  happen  is  hypothetical,  as  the 
Supreme  Court  has  held,  and  cannot  result 
in  the  invalidation  of  a  transaction  which  is 
otherwise lawful.
 
On the second ground that the promoters 
of MCX-SX were PACs, the Court concluded 
that  the  evidence  given  was  not  sufficient 
to  establish  this  ground  raised  by  SEBI. 
However, the Court noted that the promoters 
had  undertaken  to  bring  down  the  joint 
shareholding to five percent in MCX-SX.
  With respect to SEBI’s contention on buy-
back arrangements entered into by MCX-SX, 
the Court held that there was no contract for 
the sale and purchase of shares. A contract for 
the purchase or sale of the shares would come 
into being only at a future point of time in the 
eventuality of the party which is granted an 
option  exercising  the  option  in  future.  Once 
such an option is exercised, the contract would 
be completed only by means of spot delivery 
or by a mode which is considered lawful.
  With  regard  to  SEBI’s  contention  on 
non-disclosure  and  illegality  of  buy-back 
arrangements that lead to the fit and proper 
criteria  not  being  fulfilled  by  MCS-SX,  the 
Court  observed  that  the  relationship  of  a 
stock  exchange  with  SEBI  must  be  founded 
on  utmost  good  faith.  Thus,  the  existence 
of  the  buy-back  agreements  was  a  relevant 
consideration  in  enabling  SEBI  to  determine 
as to whether there was a genuine divesting 
of shares held by the promoters in excess of 
the  limit.  Compliance  with  the  provisions 
of the MIMPS Regulations by the promoters 

of  the  stock  exchange  cannot  be  cloaked  in 
secrecy qua SEBI as a regulator. However, the 
Court held that it would not be justifiable to 
reject the application merely on that ground. 
Further  that  once  the  buyback  agreement  is 
held  not  to  be  a  forward  contract,  then  the 
alleged illegality of the agreement as a ground 
for holding that the petitioner is not a fit and 
proper person necessarily ceases to exist.
  With respect to the last ground raised by 
SEBI, the Court opined that if the requirements 
of the MIMPS Regulations are fulfilled, then 
independent  of  them,  there  would  be  no 
further  norm  referable  to  the  concentration 
of economic interest on which the Petitioner 
would fail in its application.
 
In view of the above, the Court set aside 
the  Impugned  Order  vide  an  Order  dated 
March  14,  2012  with  a  direction  that  the 
application filed by the Petitioner on 7 April 
2010 shall be reconsidered afresh in terms of 
the  observations  contained  in  the  judgment. 
The Court further directed that upon remand, 
a  fresh  decision  shall  be  arrived  at  after 
furnishing  the  Petitioner  an  opportunity  of 
being  heard  within  a  period  of  one  month 
from  the  date  of  the  Order  of  the  Bombay 
High Court.
C.  Mr. A.K. Muthuswamy vs. SEBI (WP No 

21751 of 2011) – Chennai High Court
 
The Writ Petition was filed by an investor 
Mr.  A.K.  Muthuswamy  in  M/s.  Osian’s  Art 
Fund for non-action by SEBI on a complaint 
submitted  by  him  with  respect  to  the  non-
redemption  of  his  investments  in  the  fund, 
which  was  stated  to  be  a  CIS  regulated  by 
SEBI.  SEBI  filed  its  counter-affidavit  stating 
inter  alia  that  necessary  action  pursuant  to 
the petitioner’s complaint was taken by SEBI. 
The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition as 
premature.

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

D.  M/s.  Shilpa  Stock  Brokers  Pvt.  Ltd.  & 
ors  vs.  SEBI  (W.P.  2120/2011)  -before 
Hon’ble High Court of Bombay
 
The order of the SEBI dated December 30, 
2005 suspending the certificate of registration 
of  the  petitioner  for  a  period  of  one  month 
was  challenged  before 
the  SAT  which 
modified  the  order  of  SEBI  to  that  of  a 
monetary  penalty  of  `  1,00,000/-.  SEBI 
preferred  an  appeal  before  the  Supreme 
Court  which  vide  its  order  dated  April  21, 
2009  set  aside  the  order  of  the  Tribunal  and 
restored  SEBI’s  order  dated  December  30, 
2005.  The  petitioner  filed  a  Review  petition 
and  pending  the  same  also  filed  a  consent 
application in February 2010. However, before 
the case could be finalised under the consent 
scheme, the Review Petition was dismissed by 
the Supreme Court on the ground of delay as 
well as on merits in March 2010.
the  petitioner  filed  W.P. 
 
2120 of 2011 before the Bombay High Court 
praying, inter alia, to:
• 

Thereafter, 

Issue  an  appropriate  writ  /  direction, 
striking  the  requirement  of  pendency 
of  court  proceedings  /  adjudication 
contained in clauses 8, 11 and 17 of the 
SEBI  circular  dated  April  20,  2007  as 
being arbitrary and in violation of Article 
14 of the Constitution of India, or
Issue a writ of mandamus directing the 
respondent  to  read  the  requirement  of 
pendency  in  the  impugned  provisions 
to  mean  and 
include,  “pendency 
of 
enforcement  proceedings  post 
adjudication”;

• 

the  petition, 

  While  dismissing 
the 
Bombay  High  Court  vide  its  order  dated 
January 17, 2012 held as follows:-
in  so  far  as  they 
 
mandate that proceedings should either be in 

“The  Guidelines 

Annual Report 2011-12

contemplation or be pending before they can 
be  resolved,  are  based  on  a  valid  rationale. 
The  whole  purpose  of  the  Guidelines  is  to 
ensure that the time and effort of the regulator 
is devoted to cases which duly merit trial and 
enforcement.  The  Guidelines  thus  recognise 
an enabling power in SEBI to resolve certain 
cases which in the view of SEBI can be set at 
rest  without  compromising  either  an  issue 
of  principle  or  public  interest.  We  have, 
therefore,  come  to  the  conclusion  that  (i) 
The  Guidelines  do  not  confer  a  vested  right 
in any person to insist on the acceptance of a 
proposed settlement; (ii) In the present case, 
the adjudication which was initiated by SEBI 
had  attained  finality  before  the  Supreme 
Court;  and  (iii)  A  proceeding  which  has 
attained finality, cannot be reopened and the 
attempt  to  enforce  terms  of  consent  would 
result in nullifying the effect of the order of 
the Supreme Court which is impermissible. In 
the circumstances, we do not find any merit in 
the Petition.”
The Court further observed as follows:-
 
“Clause  7  of  the  Guidelines  states  that 
 
where  a  criminal  complaint  has  not  yet 
been filed but is envisaged, the process for a 
consent order will be followed. According to 
the petitioners, the expression envisage refers 
to what lies within the powers of SEBI even 
though SEBI (as in this case) does not propose 
to launch criminal proceedings. Even if such 
a  broad  meaning  were  to  be  ascribed  to  the 
provisions  of  Regulation  7,  as  is  contended, 
even  so  it  is  impossible  to  accept  that  a 
proceeding  which  is  no  longer  pending  but 
which has attained finality upon a judgment 
of the Supreme Court can be reopened merely 
on the ground that a criminal complaint has 
not yet been filed but could hypothetically still 
be filed. Where a criminal complaint has not 
yet  been  filed,  a  person  who  has  reasonable 
ground  to  believe  that  criminal  proceedings 

156

the  relevant 

may  be  instituted,  may  submit  a  proposal 
for  consent.  Where  a  civil  adjudication  has 
attained  finality,  the  terms  of  consent  (if 
agreed to by SEBI) can only be that a criminal 
proceeding may not be instituted.

and Anr (Writ Petition No. 1899 of 2011) 
Talluri Srenivas Vs. SEBI and Anr (Writ 
Petition  No.  1900  of  2011)  -  Before  the 
Hon’ble Bombay High Court
 
The petitioners are the statutory auditors 
who  had  signed 
financial 
statements  which  were  the  basis  of  the 
Satyam  scam.  The  grounds  raised  by  the 
petitioners was that continuance of the SEBI 
proceedings will amount to self incrimination 
which is protected under Article 20 (3) of the 
Constitution seeking stay of the proceedings 
initiated against them under sections 11, 11 (4) 
and 11 B of SEBI Act, 1992 till the conclusion of 
CBI trial pending before ACMM, Hyderabad.
 
The  petitioners  relied  mainly  on  the 
decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  M.  Paul 
Antony  Vs.  Bharat  Gold  Mines  Ltd  (1993)  3 
SCC 679.
 
The  argument  of  the  SEBI  was  that  as 
per  the  settled  legal  position,  pendency  of 
the  criminal  trial  is  no  bar  to  disciplinary 
proceedings  being  heard  by  the  disciplinary 
authorities  or  regulator  bodies,  like  SEBI.  It 
was also submitted that as per the scheme of 
the  SEBI Act,  1992  such  proceedings  should 
be completed expeditiously and effectively. If 
these proceedings were to result in debarring 
the petitioner from undertaking the audit of 
listed companies in the interest of investors, 
this  ought  to  be  done  expeditiously  so  that 
investors  do  not  suffer  any  further  from 
the  audit  of  the  petitioner.  Keeping  these 
proceedings 
in  abeyance,  would  cause 
continued suffering of investors and thereby 
defeat  the  statutory  purpose.  It  was  also 

submitted  that  SEBI  cannot  have  control 
over  the  conclusion  of  criminal  proceedings 
and, therefore, the law does not contemplate 
holding section 11 and 11B proceedings under 
the SEBI Act in abeyance till the completion of 
criminal  trials.  It  was  vehemently  submitted 
that  the  proceedings  initiated  by  SEBI  are 
really in the nature of remedial or preventive 
measures,  therefore,  need  not  be  postponed 
till the conclusion of criminal trials.
 
Upon  hearing  the  arguments  of  the 
parties  the  Bombay  High  Court  disposed  of 
the petitions and vide orders dated February 
27,  2012  keeping  the  questions  of  law  open 
inter alia issued the following directions:
commence 
a)  The 

the 
proceedings against the petitioners from 
the week commencing from 7th May, 2012 
provided the dates do not clash with the 
dates fixed by the trial Court.
In  the  meanwhile,  the  petitioners,  were 
prohibited from

listed 
compliance  of  obligations  of 
companies and intermediaries registered 
with  SEBI  and  requirements  of  those 
made under securities laws;

ii.) accessing the securities market to buy, sell 
or deal in the securities of Satyam (SCSL) 
and its associate listed companies in any 
manner whatsoever; and

iii.) accessing the securities market except for 
the purpose of disposing of the share in a 
company other than SCSL.

III.  Securities Appellate Tribunal
A.  Mr. Manmohan Shetty vs. SEBI (Appeal 
No. 132 of 2010, date of order: May 27,

The  appellant  challenged  the  order 
dated June 9, 2010 passed by the Adjudicating

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

Officer  holding  him  guilty  of  violating  the 
provisions of the code of conduct prescribed 
under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) 
Regulations,  1992  &  imposing  a  monetary 
penalty  of  Rs.  1,00,00,000  (Rupees  one  crore 
only) under section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992. 
While considering whether the violation of the 
code of conduct formulated by the company 
in  terms  of  the  Regulations  amounted  to  a 
violation of the Regulations, the SAT vide its 
order dated May 27, 2011 upheld the order of 
SEBI but reduced the quantum of penalty to 
Rs. 25 lakh.
B.  M/s. SRM Energy Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal 
No.34/2011, date of order: June 06, 2011)
 
The  appellant  company  (M/s.  SRM 
Energy Ltd.) had come out with a rights issue 
to  raise  funds  for  the  implementation  of  a 
power project. In connection with this rights 
issue,  the  company  had  submitted  an  offer 
document  with  SEBI.  SEBI,  while  offering 
observations on the said offer document, vide 
letter dated February 08, 2011, stated that the 
unsecured loans, previously advanced by the 
promoter group to the company, should not 
be adjusted against allotment of shares in lieu 
of  their  right  entitlements  and  also  against 
shares  to  be  allotted  to  them  as  a  result  of 
renunciation  or  unsubscribed  portion  of  the 
issue. The same was challenged in the appeal.
 
The  question  for  consideration  before 
Hon’ble  SAT  was  whether  the  unsecured 
loans advanced by the promoter group to the 
appellant company could be adjusted against 
allotment of shares to them in the said rights 
issue.
the 
 
applicability of sections 81(1), 81(1A) and 81(3) 
of the Companies Act to the present case, vide 
order  dated  June  06,  2011,  observed  that  a 
reading of section 81(3) makes it clear that cases 
which  fall  under  this  provision  shall  not  be 

Hon’ble  SAT  while  examining 

Annual Report 2011-12

governed by section 81(1) and section 81(1A). 
Hon’ble SAT concluded that the methodology 
of  adjustment  of  loans  against  allotment  of 
shares  was  only  a  mode  of  payment  for  the 
shares received in the rights issue and since 
all  the  necessary  disclosures  in  that  regard 
had been made by the appellant in the offer 
document(s), only section 81(1) is applicable 
in  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  It  was  also 
held that such adjustment of unsecured loans 
(which were payable on demand) in the strict 
sense of the term is not a conversion of a loan 
into equity.

Poojary  vs.  MD  of  M/s.  Bajaj  Allianz

The  complainant’s  deceased  husband, 
Mr  Dinesh  S.  Poojary,  took  a  Unit  Linked 
Endowment  Plan  of  Bajaj  Allianz  Life 
Insurance  Ltd.  The 
insurance  company 
repudiated the claim by citing the reasons that 

the deceased was hospitalised and diagnosed 
of  some  critical  medical  ailments  and  was 
alcoholic  since  9  years.  SEBI  was  impleaded 
as  opposite  party  but  no  relief  was  claimed 
against  SEBI.  The  complaint  was  allowed 
against  the  insurance  company  and  was 
dismissed against SEBI.
B.  The District Consumer Forum, Guntur: 
Tavva  Srinivasa  Rao  vs.  M/s.  Reliance 
Power Ltd & ors
Tavva Srinivasa Rao purchased demand 
 
draft in order to purchase shares of Reliance 
Power in the process of IPO and applied for 
the  subscription  of  the  shares  that  IPO.  The 
complainant approached the forum since the 
shares were not allotted to him. However, it 
was found that no money was realized from the 
Demand Draft and the amount in the demand 
draft was refunded back to the complainant. 
The complaint was dismissed with the finding 
that the complainant is not covered under the 
purview of Consumer Protection Act. It was 
also  held  that  SEBI  is  not  at  all  proper  and 
necessary party.

3.  ORGANISATIONAL 

RESTRUCTURING
During the year 2011-12, SEBI decided to 
explore the scope of strengthening its regional 
offices,  decentralisation  of  work  to  regional 
offices and opening of offices at new places. 
This  exercise  was  carried  out  keeping  the 
following factors in mind:
a.  There  was  a  need  for  investors  to  get 
the services of SEBI at their doorsteps to 
promote a balanced, pan India securities 
market.

b.  Physical  proximity  of  SEBI  office  to 
investors  and 
intermediaries  would 
promote  deepening  and  broadening  of 
securities market.
Accordingly, it was felt that:

 
a.  There is a need to strengthen the regional 
offices  by  delegating  the  additional 
activities/works to them, and

160

b.  There  is  a  need  to  open  local  offices 
in  various  state  capitals  to  service  the 
investors in the locality.
Keeping  in  view  the  above  factors  and 
need, SEBI has decided to open local offices 
at  Bangalore,  Bhubaneshwar,  Chandigarh, 
Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Kochi, 
Lucknow and Patna.

During  2011-12,  SEBI  felt  the  need  to 
revisit its organisational capabilities to ensure 
that these are relevant in the dynamic market 
environment. Accordingly, it was decided to 
engage an independent reputed consultant to 
study and make appropriate recommendations 
in  the  areas  of  a)  Organisational  Structure, 
b)  Human  Resources,  c)  Re-prioritise  areas 
of  focus,  d)  Technological  Requirements,  e) 
Sharing of regulation and oversight with Self 
Regulatory Organisations, and f) Co-operation 
with external agencies to meet the emerging 
challenges  and  priorities.  The  process  for 
selection of consultant has begun.
