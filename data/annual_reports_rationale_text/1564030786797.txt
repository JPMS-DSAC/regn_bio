CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT

With  the 
implementation  of  different  regulations 
prescribed by SEBI, access to information has increased, 
leading  to  more  transparency  for  informed  decision 
making  by 
investors  and  overall  governance  has 
become  conducive  for  the  protection  of  investors’ 
interests  and  overall  development  of  the  securities 
market  in  India.  The  main  thrust  of  various  policy 
measures undertaken during the year has been aimed 
towards  improving  corporate  governance,  revisiting 
the  procedures  followed 
in  the  primary  market, 
reviewing  the  risk  management  framework  for  equity 
derivatives,  developing  the  mutual  funds  industry, 
integrating  commodity  derivatives  and  securities 
markets, promoting ease of doing business and financial 
education  and  strengthening  the  supervision  of  the 
intermediaries. 

Ease of doing business in the Indian securities market 
is  an  important  area  of  focus  for  SEBI  which  is  in  line 
with  the  overall  national  agenda.  SEBI  took  several 
important measures during the year. Towards this end 
and for further increasing ease of transactions, SEBI has 
taken several initiatives such as introduction of UPI for 
blocking funds in public issues and distribution of cash 
benefits  through  depositories.  In  a  similar  vein,  SEBI 
recognised the difficulties faced by start-ups in getting 
listed due to their peculiar circumstances and thereby 
created a specialised platform to address their concerns. 

One of the major tasks of the securities market is to help 
raise investible resources for the industry. Measures such 
as a framework for compression in post-issue timelines 
and the consequent early listing and trading of shares 
to as little as three days from the existing six days has 
been brought in. The ultimate aim is to enhance the role 
of  Indian  securities  market  in  channelizing  long  term 
finance  by  facilitating  resource  mobilisation  through 
various fund raising avenues - the primary market both 
equity  and  corporate  bonds,  alternative  investment 

The year 2018-19, was a somewhat muted one for the 
global  economy.  The  hitherto  accelerating  economic 
activity  of  2017-18,  started  displaying  signs  of 
slowdown, in almost all regions of the World. This was 
more pronounced, especially during the second half of 
2018. The emerging economies were also witness to this 
global slowdown and displayed receding growth rates. 
The  overarching  flavor,  therefore,  across  most  of  the 
world economies was that of negative to modest positive 
growth rates. Despite this backdrop, the Indian economy 
still holds the potential to register strong growth rates, 
as  the  latter  is  projected  to  pick  up  to  7.0  per  cent  in 
2019-20. This is expected to be supported by continued 
recovery of investment and robust consumption, amid a 
more expansionary stance of monetary policy.

Since its inception, it has been the endeavor of SEBI to 
ensure that Indian securities market develops in terms 
of  products,  technology,  participants,  surveillance 
and  enforcement,  in  sync  with  global  best  practices 
and  standards.  SEBI  has 
incessantly  strived  for  a 
well  regulated  modern  securities  market  in  India  by 
adopting  various  global  standards  and  international 
best practices on the one hand and innovative custom 
solutions for our markets on the other. The year 2018-
19 was also a year of significant accomplishments across 
all  the  functional  areas  under  SEBI  and,  as  always,  the 
mandate of protection of interests of investors, market 
development  and  regulation  guided  all  our  policy 
initiatives during the year. 

funds,  REITs, 
InVITs  and  municipal  bonds.  Policy 
refinements for expanding the geographical spread of 
the securities market across the length and breadth of 
the country will also continue.

Some  of  the  other  major  focus  areas  of  SEBI  during 
this  year  were  guided  towards  enhancing  the  ease  of 
transaction in primary equity market, corporate bonds 
and AIFs, ease of investment by FPIs and strengthening 
the commodity derivatives market so as to make it more 
relevant for different stakeholders as well as increasing 
its  depth  by  enabling  more  participants  and  more 
products. 

Amidst this dynamic and evolving financial landscape, 
SEBI  also  has  the  difficult  and  complex  task  of 
maintaining  market  integrity  and  investor  protection 
while being uncompromising in its path to embrace new 
market  developments.  Apart  from  enhancing  investor 
awareness and improving access to the securities market, 
SEBI  will  continue  to  strengthen  market  supervision 
through  various  steps  such  as  technology  solutions 
being built to achieve the objective of identifying non-
compliances  and  assisting  investigations.  Deterring, 
effective and timely enforcement actions against errant 
entities will also be taken to maintain discipline and the 
overall integrity of the market. 

investors 

While  protecting 
in  securities  market, 
SEBI  is  also  committed  to  its  objective  of  promoting 
awareness  about  financial  markets,  making  investors 
aware of financial planning and about their rights and 
obligations regarding investments. SEBI will continue to  
expand  financial 
investor  awareness 

literacy  and 

programmes  and  activities  directly  and  in  partnership 
with  other  stakeholders  especially  in  the  emerging 
commodity derivatives sphere. Based on the feedback 
received 
from  the  market  participants,  SEBI  has 
broadened  the  scope  of  SCORES,  its  online  investor 
complaints  portal.  In  the  coming  year,  SEBI  shall 
continue to pursue its mandate and provide an orderly 
market  while  simultaneously  tackling  the  issues  that 
have been the root cause of investor grievances in some 
segments of the market.

To  effectively  regulate  these  markets,  regulators  and 
policymakers also need to be proactive, keep themselves 
updated  and  upgraded.  Over  the  years,  SEBI  has 
strengthened both its regulatory purview and internal 
capacity to ensure that the interests of the investors are 
well protected. Steps were also taken to augment SEBI’s 
human resources towards the goal of improved working 
and functioning of the organization. 

Going  ahead,  SEBI  endeavors  to  deploy  data  analytics 
and  new  generation  technologies  to  understand  and 
handle  various  challenges  in  the  market.  SEBI  would 
encourage adoption and usage of financial technology 
(‘FinTech’) to further develop and maintain an efficient, 
fair and transparent securities market ecosystem which 
also  promotes  innovation  in  the  securities  market. 
Efforts  are  under  way  to  deepen  the  corporate  bonds 
market, widen the penetration of mutual funds across 
the country and strengthen the commodity derivatives 
market. SEBI is all geared up to face newer challenges 
and evolve with the times and I am sure that with the 
combined  efforts  of  all  the  stakeholders  in  the  Indian 
ecosystem  including  Government  and  policymakers, 
the Indian financial market will ascend to newer heights.

Part One:
Policies And Programmes

The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board 

of  India  Act,  1992  (SEBI  Act,  1992) 
established  Securities  and  Exchange 
Board  of  India  (SEBI)  primarily  to  protect  the 
interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote 
the  development  of,  and  to  regulate,  the  securities 
market. Section 18 (2) of the SEBI Act, 1992 requires 
SEBI to submit to the Government of India, within 
ninety  days  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year, 
a  report  as  per  the  format  prescribed  by  the  SEBI 
(Annual Report) Rules, 1994, giving a true and full 
account  of  its  activities,  policies  and  programmes 
during the previous financial year. 

SEBI  Annual  Report  2018–19,  giving  a  true 
and  full  account  of  the  activities,  policies  and 
programmes during 2018 – 19 (April 01, 2018 – March 
31, 2019), has been prepared in conformity with the 
SEBI (Annual Report) Rules, 1994 and narrates the 
manner in which SEBI performed its functions and 
exercised  its  powers  in  terms  of  (i)  the  SEBI  Act, 

1992;  (ii)  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation) Act, 
1956 (SC(R)A, 1956); (iii) the Depositories Act, 1996; 
and  (iv)  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Companies 
Act, 2013. 

2018-19  proved  to  be  an  extremely  eventful 
year.  The  global  growth  as  well  as  trade  slowed 
down,  volatility  made  a  comeback  in  the  financial 
markets  and  monetary  policy  normalization 
paused  midway  in  its  stated  course.  The  Indian 
economy continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate, 
inflation turned benign, while the financial markets 
underwent a course correction. 

Part  One  of 

the  SEBI  Annual  Report 
2018 – 19 starts off with a brief overview of the general 
economic  environment  and 
investment  climate 
and  then  describes  the  policies  and  programmes 
adopted by SEBI during the year in that context. The 
Part concludes with an overall assessment of Indian 
securities market and prospects thereof.

1.    REVIEW OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE INVESTMENT 

CLIMATE
GLOBAL ECONOMY

I. 

The  growth  in  the  global  output  moderated 
in  2018  to  3.6  per  cent  from  3.8  per  cent  in  2017. 
The  growth  in  the  advanced  economies  slowed 
to  2.2  per  cent  in  2018  from  2.4  per  cent  in  2017, 
while that in the emerging market and developing 
economies trickled to 4.5 per cent in 2018 from 4.8 
per  cent  in  2017.  The  pace  of  growth  seemed  to 
have  peaked  in  many  economies  during  the  first 
half  of  2018.  Broadly,  worsening  financial  market 
sentiments,  idiosyncratic  factors,  increasing  trade 
tensions  between  the  United  States  and  its  trading 
partners, higher policy uncertainties contributed to 
the deceleration in the growth rate.

Among 

the 

advanced 

economies, 

the 
momentum  remained  robust  in  the  United  States 
(2.9  per  cent  in  2018  compared  to  2.2  per  cent  in 
2017), though both the euro area and Japan slowed 
down  in  2018.  Among  the  emerging  market  and 
developing economies, growth slowed in all regions 
except  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States 
and Sub-Saharan Africa. 

Inflation  remained  well  below  the  targets  in 
the  case  of  most  advanced  economies  and  many 
emerging  market  economies.  The  growth  in  the 
global trade declined from the peaks seen in 2017. 
Consequent to all these developments, the monetary 
policy  normalization  got  a  pause  at  first  and  the 
stance  shifted  to  accommodative  later  for  many 
central banks. The details are presented in Table 1.1.

INDIAN ECONOMY

India’s  gross  domestic  product  for  2018  –  19 
(at  constant  prices)  is  estimated  to  be  `  1,40,776 
billion  (`  1,31,799  billion  for  2017  –  18).  The  rate 

of  economic  growth  slowed  to  6.8  per  cent  for 
2018  –  19  from  7.2  per  cent  for  2017  –  18.  Indian 
economy, the fastest growing major economy, grew 
by 8.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2018 – 19, while 
registering  a  moderation  in  the  rate  of  growth  in

the quarters thereafter. While agriculture and allied 
activities  slowed  down  in  the  second  quarter  and 
third quarter, growth in industry sharply increased 
on  the  back  of  strong  manufacturing,  construction 
and utilities. The growth in the services sector during 
2018 – 19 was the lowest in the last seven years.

The headline retail inflation declined steadily 
from the second quarter, aided by muted food prices. 
However, core inflation remained high. The Reserve 
Bank  of  India  (RBI)  reduced  the  key  policy  rates 
by 75 basis points during 2018 – 19.  The RBI also 
indicated a change in the monetary policy stance to 
neutral, under which the key policy rates could be 
hereafter changed in either direction.    

The gross saving during 2017 – 18 is estimated 
to  be  `  52,160  billion,  amounting  to  30.1  per  cent 
of  the  gross  national  disposable  income  (GNDI) 
(` 46,484 billion or 29.9 per cent of the GNDI during 
2016 – 17). The households contributed 56.3 per cent 
of  the  gross  saving  during  2017  –  18.  Remarkably,

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

there has been a 30.0 per cent growth in the gross 
financial  saving  of  the  households  during  the 
year.  The gross capital formation at current prices 
during 2017 – 18 is estimated at ` 55,269 billion or
32.3  per  cent  of  GDP,  up  from  `  47,414  billion  or
30.9 per cent of GDP during 2016 – 17.  

The  fiscal  deficit  has  been  contained  at 
3.4  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2018  –  19  in  spite  of  the 
announcement  of  an  income  support  scheme  for 
the  farmers  and  the  fact  that  tax  revenues  are  yet 
to stabilize after the introduction of the Goods and 
Services Tax. The Government of India has pegged 
the fiscal deficit for 2019 – 20 also at 3.4 per cent of 
GDP.  

The  current  account  deficit  worsened  during 
the year (April – December, 2018) to 2.6 per cent of 
GDP from 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2017 – 18, on account 
of a widening trade deficit. Along with net outflows 
recorded in portfolio investment, this resulted in a 
depletion of India’s foreign exchange reserves. The 
details are presented in Table 1.2.

During the year, the Indian Rupee exhibited a 
depreciating trend in the first half followed by some 
appreciation in the second half. The Indian Rupee, 
which had traded against the US Dollar at ` 64.9 on 
April 09, 2018, touched an all-time low of ` 74.4 to 
the US Dollar on October 11, 2018, though it ended 
the year at ` 69.2 to the US Dollar on March 29, 2019. 

A globally strengthening US Dollar, the withdrawals 
by the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in most of 
the months, etc. were among the contributory factors. 
The annualized volatility of the exchange rate of the 
Indian Rupee against the US Dollar during the year 
stood at 6.8 per cent.

 The structural reforms of the yesteryears seem 
to  be  now  bearing  the  fruit.  2018  –  19  saw  India’s 
quantum  jump  in  the  global  pecking  order.  For 
instance, in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report 
2019,  India  has  recorded  a  jump  of  23  positions 
against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 
77th rank among 190 countries assessed by the World 
Bank. In the Transparency International’s Corruption 
Perceptions Index, India rose by three positions to 78 
in the list of 180 countries in the world. 

The Union Budget 2019 – 20, presented in the 
Parliament  of  India  on  February  01,  2019,  has  laid 
down  the  measures  to  realize  the  vision  to  make 
India a “Five Trillion Dollar Economy” in the next 
five years and a “Ten Trillion Dollar Economy” in the 
next eight years thereafter. 

III.   GLOBAL SECURITIES MARKETS

Overall, the primary market activity was lower 
in 2018 compared to 2017. Both the number of IPOs 
and  the  resources  raised  through  IPOs  declined  in 
2018. The number of IPOs fell by 14.5 per cent to 1,610, 
while the resources raised through IPOs declined by 
12.1 per cent to USD 182 billion. In both instances, 
the  Asia-Pacific  and  the  EMEA  regions  witnessed 
declines, while the Americas region reported robust 
growth.   

The number of FPOs and the resources raised 
through  FPOs  also  fell  in  2018  by  23.3  per  cent 
and  27.5  per  cent,  respectively.  The  number  of 
FPOs declined only in the EMEA region, while the 
resources  raised  through  FPOs  declined  in  all  the 
regions. 

The  global  financial  markets 

remained 
significantly volatile in 2018. The global stock market 
capitalization stood at USD 74,432 billion as at end-
2018.  2018  marked  the  first  year  since  2014  when 
the  global  stock  market  capitalization  registered 
an annual decline (a fall of 14.9 per cent compared 
to  USD  87,446  billion  as  at  end-2017)  on  account 
of  declines  across  all  the  regions  –  the  Americas 
(6.3 per cent), the Asia-Pacific (23.8 per cent) and the 
EMEA (16.5 per cent) regions.   

The  turnover  on  the  stock  exchanges  (equity 
cash segment) registered robust growth in 2018. The 
volume of trades grew by 11.5 per cent to 22 billion 
in 2018 and the value of trades by 15.4 per cent to 
USD 97,319 billion. While volume of trades rose in 
all  the  three  regions,  the  value  of  trades  increased 
in  regions  except  Asia-Pacific,  which  saw  volume 
traded  go  down  by  3.6  per  cent.  The  details  are 
presented in Table 1.3.

The 

increased  policy  uncertainties,  along 
with elevated volatility, resulted in higher volumes 
in  nearly  all  exchange  traded  derivatives.  Overall 
volumes  touched  a  record  level  of  30.1  billion 
contracts in 2018, up 20.9 per cent over 24.9 billion 
in 2017, driven by growth in volumes across all three 
regions. 

All the types of equity derivatives experienced 
growth in overall volumes, against the backdrop of 
volatility and increased turnover in the underlying 
market.  Single  stock  options,  stock  index  options 
and stock index futures registered growth in all the 
three  regions,  while  only  single  stock  futures  saw 
declining volumes only in the Americas region. 

The uncertainty surrounding the course of the 
monetary  policy  in  both  the  advanced  economies 
and  the  emerging  market  economies  drove  the 
overall volumes of interest rate derivatives in 2018.

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

The volumes of interest rate futures traded in 2018 
increased  in  all  the  three  regions,  while  only  the 
Asia-Pacific region reported a decline in the volumes 
of  interest  rate  options  traded.  A  volatile  foreign 
exchange  market  fuelled  the  volumes  in  currency 
derivatives  in  2018.  Both  currency  options  and 
currency futures reported robust growth in volumes. 
Only  the  Americas  region  reported  a  marginal 
decline in the volume traded of currency options and 
the EMEA region of currency futures. 

The  commodity  derivatives  recorded  only 
a marginal growth in 2018. The volumes traded of 
the  most  popular  among  all  the  exchange  traded 
derivatives – commodity futures – grew by only 0.3 
per cent in 2018. The volumes traded in commodity 
futures  declined  only  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  in 
2018,  while  only  the  Americas  region  registered  a 
decline in the volumes traded in commodity options.

Aided  by  USD  12.7  trillion  net  sales  over  a 
decade, the total net assets of worldwide regulated 
open-end funds, numbering 1,18,978, stood at USD 
46,700 billion as at end-2018, down 5.3 per cent from 
USD 49,303 billion as at end-2017. A sharp decline 
in global stock prices and depreciation of currencies 

like  the  Euro,  the  Australian  Dollar,  the  Chinese 
Renminbi,  etc.  against  the  US  Dollar  contributed 
to  the  decline  in  the  total  net  assets  of  worldwide 
regulated  open-end  funds  in  2018.  The  details  are

2.   REVIEW OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

With  a  view  to  keep  the  Indian  securities 
market integrated with the global regulatory  regime,  
incessant  developments  are   essential   while   in   
harmony   with   the   objectives  enshrined  in  the  
SEBI  Act,  1992.  Alike every year, 2018-19 as well 
witnessed various policy reforms initiated by SEBI 
which are presented in this section.

The policies and programmes are categorized 
under  eight  major  heads:  Primary  Securities 
Market,  Secondary  Securities  Market,  Commodity 
Derivatives  Market,  Mutual  Funds,  Intermediaries 
associated  with  the  Securities  Market,  Foreign 
Portfolio  Investors,  Corporate  Debt  Market  and 
Other Policies and Programmes.

I. 

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

The primary market is the avenue for resource 
mobilization  and  capital  formation  in  the  country 
as  it  brings  together  investors  seeking  investment 
opportunities  and 
issuers  seeking  to  mobilize 
resources  to  finance  their  investments.  A    well-
developed  primary  market  is  fundamental  for  an  
economy  to  prosper.  In  order  to  further  refine  
the    primary    market    design  and  boost  investor 
confidence, various measures  have  been  undertaken  
by  SEBI  in  2018-19. This section throws light on the 
policy measures initiated during the financial year.

A.  New Buy-back Regulations 

The SEBI (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 
2018  (Buyback  Regulations)  have  been  notified  in 
September  2018  in  lieu  of  the  SEBI  (Buy-back  of 
Securities) Regulations, 1998. The relevant provisions 
outlined under Sections 68 and 70 of the Companies 
Act,  2013  have  been  incorporated  in  the  Buyback 
Regulations to make it self-contained.

Box Item 1.1 : New SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018

SEBI (ICDR) Regulations were notified in the year 2009. Numerous amendments have been made to the ICDR 
Regulations since then. Different types of offerings to raise funds in the primary market have been introduced. 
SEBI  has  also  issued  various  informal  guidance/  interpretative  letters  regarding  interpretation  of  various 
provisions of the ICDR Regulations. Further, there have been changes in market practices and regulatory 
environment over a period of time. A need was thus felt to review and realign the ICDR Regulations with 
these developments and to ensure that they reflect the best practices adopted globally. The ICDR Regulations 
have been thoroughly revamped with policy changes. The new Regulations were notified on September 11, 
2018. The new Regulations came into force on November 10, 2018.
The salient features of the new SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018 are as follows:

a.  All  the  chapters  have  been  categorized  on  the  basis  of  the  type  of  offering  so    that    all    relevant  
information  pertaining  to  regulations  relating  to  a particular type of offering are available at one 
place.

b.  The procedural requirements have been specified through schedules to the draft regulations.
c.  The provisions have been rearranged based on their sequence in the public issue process and relevance.
d.  The    provisions    of    Companies    Act, 1956    (wherever    applicable),  Companies    Act,  2013, 
Takeover regulations, SEBI  (Share  Based  Employee  Benefits)  Regulations, 2014  have  been  suitably 
incorporated.

e.  Various   informal   guidance   /interpretative letters/   FAQs/ circulars regarding interpretation of 
various provisions of the regulations issued by SEBI   from   time   to   time   have   been   suitably 
incorporated.

n. 

o. 

p.  Merging of the provisions of IIP with those of QIP.

C.  Transfer  of  shares  only  in  dematerialized 

D.  Re-classification of promoter / public

form

SEBI  has  decided  that  transfer  of  securities 
only  in  dematerialized  form  will  improve  ease, 
convenience and safety of transactions for investors 
In this regard, SEBI has mandated that with effective 
from April 01, 2019, transfer of listed securities (except 
in case of transmission or transposition of securities), 
shall not be processed unless the securities are held 
in dematerialized form with a depository. 

SEBI  has  streamlined  the  process  for  re-
classification  as  promoter/public  in  a  listed  entity 
and  brought  greater  clarity  in  the  framework.  The 
revised provisions enable reclassification of persons 
classified  as  promoters/  part  of  promoter  group  to 
public subject to certain conditions and processes to 
be followed, inter-alia, including the following: 

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

a. 

The  promoter(s)  seeking  re-classification  and 
persons related to them should not hold more 
than 10 per cent of the total voting power or 
exercise control over the listed entity or have 
special rights in the company be represented 
on the board of the listed entity or act as key

for  reclassification  by  the  promoter  seeking, 
review by the company’s Board and approval 
by  the  shareholders,  with  exiting  promoters 
and related persons not allowed to vote.

Box Item 1.2 : Reducing the Time Period for Listing of Issues

SEBI has introduced the use of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) with facility of blocking Funds (ASBA facility), 
as a new payment mechanism for retail investor applications submitted through intermediaries. 

This is a significant process reform aimed at reducing the time period for listing of issues from T+6 days to 
T+3 days. The compression in post-issue timelines and the consequent early listing and trading of shares will 
benefit both issuers as well as investors Issuers will have faster access to the capital raised thereby enhancing 
the ease of doing business and the investors will have early liquidity. Under the new process, there will be no 
physical movement of retail investor application forms from intermediaries to self-Certified syndicate Banks 
(SCSBs). 

SEBI has issued a circular dated November 1, 2018 in this regard applicable for public issues opening after 
January 01, 2019. Considering the time required for making necessary changes to the systems and to ensure 
complete and smooth transition to UPI payment mechanism the alternate payment mechanism and consequent 
reduction in timelines will be introduced in a phased manner.

E. 

Corporate Debt Restructuring

In   the   context   of   corporate   debt   restructuring 
implemented  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines 
specified by the Reserve Bank of India, exemptions

provided in SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018  and  from  
the obligation of making an open offer provided in 
SEBI (SAST) Regulations have been restricted to all

Under  the  SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations,  2018, 
in  case  of  any  increase  or  decrease  in  estimated 
issue size by more than 20 per cent, fresh filing of 
the offer document with the Board is required.  At 
present,  such  requirement  is  for  both  fresh  issues 
and  OFS.  In  case  of  an  OFS  (excluding  fresh  issue 
component),  SEBI  has  prescribed  that  fresh  filing 
of offer document with the board will be required, 
when there is a change in either the number of shares 
offered for sale or the estimated issue size, by more 
than 50 per cent.

a. 

b. 

c. 

It is more comprehensive and covers a wide gamut of LODR Regulations such as the requirements 
pertaining to composition of the listed company’s Board and its committees, submission of corporate 
governance  compliance  report,  financial  results  and  voting  results,  etc.  Non-compliance  of  these 
regulations will lead to imposition of fines by stock exchanges.
It also empowers the stock exchanges to freeze the entire shareholding of the promoter and promoter 
group in such non-compliant entity as well as their shareholding in other securities.
If non-compliance persists, it will lead to suspension and initiation of process of compulsory delisting 
of such non-compliant listed entities.

The revised framework is expected to promote a better compliance culture apart from putting in place an 
appropriate system for effective enforcement of continuous compliance of requirements by listed entities and 
their promoter/ promoter group.

when BSE benchmark Sensex managed to achieve its 
best annual gain of 17.3 per cent since 2014-15. NSE’s 
Nifty  rose  by  14.9  per  cent  during  the  year.    The 
secondary  markets  are  often  referred  to  as  the  
barometer  to  a  nation’s  health and as a result they 
require  continuous 
technological  advancements 
accompanied by a review of the existing guidelines 
so  as  to  maintain  a  competitive  edge.  The  policy 
initiatives  taken  by  SEBI  relating  to  the  secondary 
securities market during 2018-19 are as under:

A.  Guidelines for functioning and development

of  banks  and  liquid  schemes  of  debt  mutual 
funds, subject to a limit of 10 per cent of the 
total  investible  resources,  excluding  funds 
lying in core settlement guarantee fund of the 
clearing corporation.

Interoperability 
Corporations

among 

Clearing 

for 

to  consolidate 

Interoperability  provides 

linking  of 
multiple  clearing  corporations  and  allows  market 
participants 
their  clearing  and 
settlement functions at a single clearing corporation, 
irrespective of the stock exchange on which the trade 
is executed. It is envisaged that the interoperability 
would  lead  to  efficient  allocation  of  capital  for  the 
market participants, thereby saving on cost as well 
as  provide  better  execution  of  trades. Accordingly, 
amendments have been carried out in the Securities 
Contracts 
(Stock  Exchanges  and 
Clearing  Corporations)  Regulations,  2018.  Further, 
SEBI  vide  circular  dated  November  27,  2018  has

(MPOR)  in  greater  conformity  with  the  principles 
for financial market infrastructures (PFMI), the Risk 
Management  Review  Committee  (RMRC)  of  SEBI

inter alia decided that the stock exchanges/clearing 
corporations shall estimate the appropriate MPOR, 
subject to a minimum of two days, for each equity 
derivative  product  based  on  liquidity  therein  and 
scale up the applicable margins accordingly. Further, 
with a view to make the risk management framework 
more  robust,  it  was  decided  that  the  payment  of 

MTM margin shall mandatorily be made by all the 
members  before  start  of  trading  on  the  next  day. 
The short option minimum charge for index option 
contracts was also revised to five per cent from three 
per cent.

E. 

Revision in  haircut  on central government 
securities (G-sec) accepted  as collateral from 
clearing members by clearing corporations

Clearing corporations were earlier permitted to 
accept G-sec as collateral with an applicable haircut 
of 10 per cent. Based on the feedback received from 
market participants regarding the need for haircuts 
based on liquidity and the recommendations made 
by RMRC of SEBI thereupon, SEBI vide circular dated 
February  21,  2019  inter  alia  revised  the  minimum 
haircut  applicable  to  the  G-sec  deposited  by  the 
clearing members with the clearing corporations, as

as is the case for stock exchanges;

Concept of sponsor has been removed in case 
of  depository,  with  existing  sponsor  entities 
allowed upto five years to reduce shareholding 
to 15 per cent;

b.  Given  the  special  role  of  Public  Interest 
Directors  (PIDs)  and  Managing  Directors

c. 

The  composition  of  the  governing  board 
and  regulatory  committees  of  MIIs  has  been

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

The number of PIDs, on the governing board 
and  the  committees  of  the  MIIs  (with  an 
exception  to  (investor  grievance  redressal 
committee  and  advisory  committee),  should 
be at least equal to the number of shareholder 
directors (including the MD) and in case of an 
equality of votes, the chairperson of the board 
(who is a PID), shall have a second or casting 
vote.

The above composition shall also be applicable 
with regard to quorum in the meetings of the 
governing board and the committees. 

In  order  to  enhance  the  transparency  in  the 
utilization of resources, a MII should disclose 
the  resources  committed  towards  regulatory 
functions  and  towards  ensuring  regulatory 
compliance,  backed  by  an  activity  based 
accounting. Also, the charges and fees levied 
by a MII shall be placed for review before the 
oversight committee of the MII.

It has been decided that activities in the nature 
of  treasury  investment  may  be  as  per  the 
investment policy approved by the governing 
board  of  a  MII.  Any  other  activity  whether 
involving  deployment  of  funds  or  otherwise 
would need prior permission of the regulator.

h. 

Considering that the scope of work of some of 
the existing committees of MIIs is inter-related 
and  overlapping,  the  various  committees  of 
MIIs have been merged / restructured, reducing 
the number of committee from existing 15 to 
seven.

Functional  Committees,  comprising  of  three 
committees, viz. member selection committee, 
investor  grievance  redressal  committee,  and 
nomination and remuneration committee; and 

Oversight  Committees,  comprising  of  four 
committees,  viz.  standing  committee  on 
technology,  advisory  committee,  regulatory 
oversight  committee  and  risk  management 
committee.

In order to adequately capture the risks faced 
by a clearing corporation, it has been decided 
to  adopt  a  risk  based  approach  towards 
computation  of  net-worth  of  a  clearing 
corporation. Instead of a higher minimum net 
worth of ` 300 crore, the clearing corporations 
are  required  to  maintain,  at  all  times,  a 
minimum  net  worth  of  either  `  100  crore  or 
such other amount to cover the various risks 
(operational, market, credit etc.), whichever is 
higher.

G.  Committees at MIIs

The 

functions,  composition  and  quorum 
requirement have been provided for the revised seven 
statutory committees to be constituted by MIIs, as per

stock 

recognised 
corporation

recognition can commence trading operations with a 

minimum of 25 trading members, in place of earlier 
requirement  of  minimum  of  50  trading  members.

As  per  SEBI  (Depositories  and  Participants) 
2018 
Securities  Contracts 
Regulations,

policy for PIDs which shall include scope for both 
internal  evaluation  as  well  as  external  evaluation, 
both  having  equal  weightage.  The  criteria  for 
performance  review  of  PIDs  shall  be  developed 
taking 
consideration  guiding  principles 
provided by SEBI. Also, in the circular, it was clarified 
that minimum of two names shall be submitted by 
MIIs at the time of making request for appointment 
of  PID  and  extension  of  the  term  of  existing  PID,

retail  individual  investors,  it  has  been  decided  to 
introduce  separate  BSDA  limit  for  debt  securities 
(as  defined  in  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt 
Securities) Regulation, 2008) held in demat account. 
In this regard, in addition to the existing structure 
of charges for securities other than debt securities, it 
has been decided to relax the structure of charges for 
debt securities held in demat accounts. Accordingly, 
no  annual  maintenance  charges  shall  be  levied  by 
depository participants in case the value of holdings 
of debt securities is up to one lakh and a maximum 
of  `  100  shall  be  levied  if  the  value  of  holdings  of 
debt securities is between ` 1,00,001 and ` 2,00,000.

L. 

Change in name of the Beneficial Owner (BO) 
account with depositories

One of the documents required for change in 
name of BO account with depositories, on account 
of  reasons  other  than  marriage,  is  the  document 
related  to  publication  of  name  change  in  official 
gazette.    However,  for  investors  residing  in  the 
state of Karnataka and Punjab, the name change is 
published in the official gazette only for Government 
employees.  Therefore,  in  case  of  change  of  name 
of  an  individual  in  these  states  for  reasons  other 
than  marriage,  the  requirement  of  the  publication 
in official gazette has been relaxed and some other 
document has been prescribed for investor in such 
state.

N.  Guidelines  for  Business  Continuity  Plan 

(BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) of MIIs

In the year 2012, SEBI had issued guidelines for 
BCP and DR for MIIs. Based on the recommendation 
of  the  technical  advisory  committee  of  SEBI,  the 
framework has been modified. Under the modified 
framework,  MIIs  have,  inter  alia,  been  advised 
to  decide  the  definition  of  ‘disaster’  depending 
upon their line of business. MIIs have further been 
advised  to  compute  recovery  time  objective  from 
the  occurrence  of  the  disaster,  to  set  up  DR  site  in 
different seismic zones, etc. 

O.  Review of framework for stocks in derivatives 

segment

In line with the recommendations made by the 
L.C  Gupta  committee,  physical  settlement  of  stock 
derivatives had been made mandatory in a phased/
calibrated  manner  vide  SEBI  circular  dated  April 
11, 2018. Further, measures have also been taken in 
connection  with  the  eligibility  criteria,  exit  criteria 
and  settlement  of  stock  derivatives, 
including 
enhanced eligibility criteria for introduction of stocks 
in derivatives segment. Pursuant to the said circular, 
only those stocks which meet the enhanced eligibility 
criteria  shall  remain  in  derivatives  segment  after  a 
period of one year from the date of the circular.

Subsequently,  SEBI  vide  circular  dated 
December 31, 2018 has specified phased movement 
of  then  cash  settled  stock  derivatives  to  physical 
settlement  (for  April  2019  expiry,  July  2019  expiry 

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

and  October  2019  expiry)  on  the  basis  of  average 
daily market capitalisation of the stocks. It was also 
specified that derivatives introduced on new stocks, 
meeting  the  enhanced  eligibility  criteria  (specified 
vide circular dated April 11, 2018) after the date of 
this circular, shall also be physically settled.

In  addition  to  the  above  schedule,  SEBI  vide 
circular dated February 08, 2019 has further directed 
for shifting of stock derivatives to physical settlement 
from  new  expiry  cycle  on  the  basis  of  intra-day 
movement  or  volatility  in  such  stock.  Shifting  of 
such stock to physical settlement is expected to help 
reduce  speculation  and  hence  excessive  intra-day 
movement / volatility in such stock.

reviewed 

The  OFS  mechanism  was 

to 
expand  the  universe  of  companies  to  whom  OFS 
mechanism  is  available,  from  top  200  companies 
by market capitalization, to companies with market 
capitalization  of  `  1000  crore  and  above,  with  the 
threshold of market capitalization computed as the 
average  daily  market  capitalization  for  six  months 
prior to the month in which the OFS is being made,

U.  Cyber Security

Taking  cognizance  of  the  threat  imposed  by 
technological  developments  in  the  Indian  capital 
markets and the rise of cyber threats in the financial 
domain  across  the  globe,  SEBI  had  laid  down  a 
detailed  framework  with  regard  to  cyber  security 
and  cyber  resilience  that  stock  exchanges,  clearing 
corporations and depositories are required to adopt.  
Additionally, SEBI has constituted a high  powered  
steering  committee  on  cyber  security  chaired  by  
a    WTM  of  SEBI  and  created  a  cyber-security  cell 
to actively address the cyber security issues. In FY 
2018-19, SEBI issued two circulars and one advisory 
relating to cyber security.

SEBI  had  mandated  the  MIIs  to  conduct  a 
detailed review/ audit of the implementation of the 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

SEBI  circular  and  advisories  issued  by  SEBI  from 
time to time w.r.t. cyber security as per the framework 
prescribed by SEBI. The framework includes:

a.  Auditor Selection Norms

b. 

c. 

d. 

Scope of Review/ Audit for Cyber Security of 
MIIs

Format of Review / Audit Report

Standardized Observation Reporting Format. 

The  MIIs  were  advised  to  conduct  the 
comprehensive  review/audit  at  least  two  times  a 
year. The review broadly aims to check the level and 
adequacy of the controls put in place by the MII to 
comply with the various circulars, advisories issued 
by SEBI pertaining to cyber security along with the 
safeguards  put  in  place  by  the  MII  to  mitigate  the 
cyber  threat  vectors  and  cyber-attack  scenarios. 
During the financial year 2018-19, the first round of 
comprehensive  cyber  security  review  of  all  the  12 
MIIs was completed. 

A  cyber  security  operation  center  (C-SOC) 
is  a  facility  that  houses  an  information  security 
team  responsible  for  monitoring  and  analysing  an 
organization’s security posture on an ongoing basis. 
The SOC team’s goal is to detect, analyse and respond 
to  cyber  security  incidents  using  a  combination  of 
technology solutions and a strong set of processes. 
SEBI  issued  the  circular  on  December  07,  2018 
mandating  all  MIIs,  i.e.,  stock  exchanges,  clearing 
corporations and depositories to have a C-SOC that 
would  be  a  24x7x365  set-up  manned  by  dedicated 
security analysts to detect, analyse, respond, report, 
and prevent cyber security incidents.

With  a  view  to  strengthen  cyber  security 
in  securities  market  the  cyber  security  and  cyber 
resilience  framework  has  been  extended  to  stock 
brokers/ depository participants and mutual  funds/
AMCs  vide  circular  dated  December  03,  2018 
and  circular  dated  January  10,  2019  respectively.

Compliance with the cyber security guidelines may 
be onerous for smaller intermediaries because of the 
lack of knowledge and also the cost factor involved 
in setting up own SOC. In view of the above, SEBI 
vide  circular  dated  December  14,  2018  provided 
for market SOC. The intermediaries may utilize the 
services of market SOC which is proposed to be set 
up  by  MIIs  with  the  objective  of  providing  cyber 
security solution to intermediaries. The market SOC 
shall  be  set  up  as  a  separate  entity  and  MIIs  shall 
have at least 51 per cent stake in the new entity. If 
an intermediary is subscribed to market SOC, audit 
report  submitted  by  intermediary  through  the 
market SOC would be deemed compliant.

Committee  on  Financial  and  Regulatory 
Technologies (CFRT)

Set  up  in  August  2017,  CFRT  under  the 
Chairmanship of Shri T.V. Mohandas Pai, Chairman, 
Manipal  Global  Education  is  advising  SEBI  on  an 
ongoing basis on the recent  and  medium  term  trends  
(within next five years)  in  FinTech  developments  
in securities market worldwide, opportunities  and  
challenges    from    new    FinTech    solutions    and  
its  impact  on  Indian securities market, create an 
approach  framework  for  regulatory  sandbox  in  
Indian  market  conditions  to  facilitate adoption of 
FinTech and promote financial innovations, assessing 
technological      solutions  for  regulatory  functions 
of    SEBI  viz.  information  management  and  data 
mining, risk management including cyber security, 
intermediary supervision, consumer protection, etc. 
through application of new technological solutions 
like application of distributed ledger  technology, big 
data,  data  analytics,  artificial  intelligence,  machine 
Learning etc. It also advises cyber security at system 
level  for  the  securities  market  and  suggesting  the 
creation of cyber security standards.

SEBI feels that there is a need to have a deeper 
understanding of various FinTech products and their 
benefits  and  limitations  with  respect  to  the  capital 
market before regulating this space. With a view to 
enhancing  its  regulatory  approach  to  facilitate  the 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

development  and  adoption  of  innovative  FinTech 
solutions,  SEBI,  under  the  guidance  of  the  CFRT, 
plans  to  introduce  separate  frameworks  for  an 
Innovation  sandbox  and  a  Regulatory  Sandbox. 
Under  both  these  sandbox  frameworks,  financial 
institutions  regulated  by  SEBI  shall  be  granted 
certain  facilities  and  flexibilities  to  experiment 
with  FinTech  solutions  in  a  live  or  simulated  test 
environment  (depending  on  the  case  and  sandbox 
framework).  These  features  will  be  fortified  with 
necessary safeguards for investor protection and risk 
mitigation.

III.  COMMODITY DERIVATIVES MARKET 

The development of the commodity derivatives 
market is one of the SEBI’s main agendas. In 2018-19 
as well, SEBI took various measures for integration 
and harmonious development of this segment with 
an aim to build a regulatory ecosystem as advanced 
as  the  securities  market.  To  further  broaden  the 
commodity  derivatives  market,  SEBI  has  opened 
up  to  domestic  as  well  as  foreign  institutional 
participants in a phased manner. Following were the 
major policy initiatives taken by SEBI relating to this 
segment during 2018-19:

A. 

Participation  of  eligible  foreign  entities 
(EFEs) in the commodity derivatives market

to 

recommendations 

of 

Pursuant 

feedback  received 

the 
Commodity  Derivatives  Advisory  Committee 
(CDAC)  and 
from  market 
participants,  SEBI  vide  its  circular  dated  October 
09,  2018  permitted  foreign  entities  having  actual 
exposure  to  Indian  commodity  markets,  known  as 
EFEs,  to  participate  in  the  commodity  derivatives 
market  and  laid  down  the  requisite  regulatory 
framework for the same.

Box 1.4 : Foreign Participation in Commodity Derivatives Market

Earlier,  foreign  entities  or  firms  who  do  not  have  presence  in  India  but  are  engaged  in  import/export  of 
commodities from/to India were not allowed to hedge their risks on Indian exchanges without establishing a 
subsidiary entity. This may not be feasible for small entities. These entities by virtue of their actual exposure 
to various commodities in Indian market are valuable stakeholders in the value chain of such commodities 
and are exposed to price uncertainty of Indian commodity markets. 

Taking cognizance of the fact that participation by foreign participants would be conducive for the overall 
development  of  the  commodity  derivatives  market  and  pave  way,  in  the  long  run,  for  Indian  markets  to 
become price setters for some of the global commodities, SEBI decided to allow the EFEs to participate in the 
commodity derivatives market subject to certain conditions.

B.  Custodial Services in Commodity Derivatives 

Market

In  order 

to  enable 

the  participation  of 
institutional  investors  in  commodity  derivatives 
market, SEBI Board in its meeting held on December 
12,  2018  approved  the  proposal  for  allowing 
custodians  to  provide  custodial  services  in  goods 
underlying 
contracts. 
Pursuant  to  the  above,  amendments  to  relevant 
provisions in the SEBI (Custodian) Regulations, 1996 
have been notified.

C.  Universal Exchanges

to 

Pursuant 

the  goal  of 

integration  of 
commodity  derivatives  market  with  rest  of  the 
securities  market,  necessary  amendments 
to 
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  (Stock  Exchanges 

and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 were 
carried out to permit universal exchanges (enabling 
trading  of  commodity  derivatives  and  other 
segments  of  securities  market  on  single  exchange)  
with  effect  from  October  01,  2018.  Subsequently, 
two exchanges namely NSE and BSE have launched 
Commodity  derivatives  segment  and  thus  are 
universal exchanges offering trading in all segments.

H. 

In 

the 

commodity  derivatives  market, 
differential “trading lot size” and “delivery lot size” 
of  some  commodity  derivatives  contract,  at  times, 
puts  participants  in  disadvantageous  positions. 
Based on the recommendation of CDAC, SEBI vide 
its circular dated January 23, 2019 directed that the 
exchanges shall follow the policy of having uniform 
trading  and  delivery  lot  size  for  the  commodity 
derivatives  contracts  and  provided  for  exemption 
from  the  same  only  on  stock  exchange  submitting 
detailed  rationale  for  keeping  different  lot  size  for 
trading and delivery with respect to any contract.

F. 

Framework for utilisation of Regulatory Fee 
Foregone by SEBI 

To  encourage  the  participation  by  Farmers 
/  Farmer  Producer  Organizations  in  agricultural 
commodity  derivatives  market,  SEBI    has  reduced  
the  regulatory  fee  on  Stock  Exchanges  with  respect  
to  turnover  in agricultural commodity derivatives. 

Vide circular dated March 20, 2019, SEBI has 
specified that exchanges shall create an earmarked 
fund out of the regulatory fee foregone by SEBI and 
has given guiding principles for exchanges to follow 
for the purpose of utilisation of the fund.

G.  Disclosures  by  Stock  Exchanges 

for 

Commodity Derivatives 

SEBI  vide  circular  dated  September  27,  2016 
had prescribed certain norms regarding disclosures 
by Stock Exchanges on their website for commodity 
derivatives. In order to further enhance transparency 
to  the  public  in  commodity  derivatives  market,  on 
recommendation of the CDAC, SEBI vide its circular 
dated  January  04,  2019  has  directed  all  recognized 
stock  exchanges  to  make  additional  disclosures 
on  their  website  regarding  commodity  wise  and 
category wise open interest and turnover.

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

Framework  for  utilisation  of  Financial 
Security  Deposit 
(FSD)  available  with 
clearing  corporations  and  Warehousing 
Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA)

Warehouse  Service  Providers  (WSPs)  were 
required to maintain FSD with WDRA (as per WDRA 
norms) as well as with clearing corporations (as per 
norms specified by SEBI). Thus, on the same goods, 
security  deposits  were  required  to  be  maintained 
with both WDRA and clearing corporations, putting 
additional financial burden on WSPs.

In  order  to  rationalize  security  deposit  and 
after  consultation  with  WDRA  &  exchanges/ 
clearing  corporations,  SEBI  vide  its  circular  dated 
February 11, 2019 specified a framework wherein the 
deposits placed by WSPs with WDRA for exchange/
clearing corporation specific outstanding electronic 
negotiable  warehousing  receipts  (eNWRs)  shall  be 
considered by clearing corporations in the calculation 
of available FSD of the WSP towards required FSD 
under SEBI norms. The framework also provides for 
such deposits with WDRA to be made available to 
Clearing  Corporation  in  case  the  deposits  of  WSP 
available  with  clearing  corporation  are  insufficient 
to compensate for the loss to clients from any action 
or inaction of WSP or its warehouses.

I. 

Uniformity  in  the  procedure  for  obtaining 
samples of  goods at  the Exchange accredited 
warehouses 

In  order  to  bring uniformity in the  procedure  
adopted  by  the  exchanges,  in obtaining samples  
for  the  purpose  of assaying of goods at exchange 
accredited  warehouses  and  to  resolve  potential 
quality  related  disputes,  SEBI  vide  circular  dated 
October 16, 2018 directed exchanges to ensure that 
adequate samples of goods are collected and retained 
and also specified the minimum number of samples 
to be taken.

Physical 
Derivatives Contracts 

Settlement 

In  2017-18,  SEBI  had 

issued  guidelines 
for  deciding  appropriate  settlement  mode  for 
commodity  derivatives  contracts  stating  that  first 
choice of settlement mode for any commodity future 
shall  be  compulsory  physical  delivery.  Keeping  in 
spirit  with  the  provisions  of  the  circular,  SEBI  has 
directed exchanges to convert, as far as possible, all 
commodity futures contracts to compulsory physical 
delivery.  Only  those  commodities  where  physical 
delivery  is  not  possible  because  of  infrastructure 
or  other  constraints  have  been  allowed  to  retain 
other  settlement  mode.  Accordingly,  all  base 
metal  contracts  are  phase-wise  being  converted  to 
compulsory physical delivery.

M.  Consultative Approach

Policy decisions and reform measures taken by 
SEBI generally emanate after extensive consultative 
processes  through  various  advisory  committees. 
While  evolving  policy  changes,  SEBI  endeavours 
to  seek  valuable  comments  from  the  investing 
public and stakeholders at large through the public 
comments process.

i. 

a.  Advisory Committee

 

During this financial year 2018-19, CDAC had 
three meetings on May 21, 2018; November 01, 
2018 and February 26, 2019. CDAC proposed 
that  the  three  sub-groups  formed  in  the  first 
meeting of CDAC be reorganized in two sub-

groups,  viz:    “Developmental  group”  and 
“Regulatory  group”  who  can  be  assigned 
various  developmental  and  regulatory  issues 
for deliberation and examination from time to 
time  so  as  to  assist  CDAC  to  advise  SEBI  on 
various  important  policy  matters  in  a  better 
way.

Developmental Sub-Group: This group shall

IV.  MUTUAL FUNDS

The  Indian  mutual  fund  industry  is  one 
of  the  fastest  growing  segments  of  the  financial 
sector.    Buoyed    by    robust    capital    inflows    and  
strong  participation  of retail  investors,  the  asset  
base    of      the    mutual    fund    industry    stood  at 
`  23,79,584  crore  as  on  March  31,  2019.  The 
description of steps initiated during the year aiming 
at  re-energising  growth,  development,  regulation 
and investor protection in an effective manner is as 
follows:

A.  Change in Disclosure of Total Expense Ratio 

(TER)

It  was  observed  that  there  are  frequent 
changes  carried  out  in  TER  and  such  changes  are 
not  prominently  disclosed  to  investors.  To  bring 
uniformity  in  disclosure  of  actual  TER  charged  to 
mutual fund schemes and to enable the investor to 
take informed decision, the following is laid down:

a.  AMCs  shall  prominently  disclose  on  a 
daily  basis,  the  TER  of  all  schemes  except 
infrastructure debt fund (IDF) schemes under a 
separate head –“Total Expense Ratio of Mutual 
Fund Schemes” on their website and on AMFI’s 
website in downloadable spreadsheet format.

b.  Any change in the base TER in comparison to 
previous  base  TER  charged  to  any      scheme   
shall   be communicated  to  investors  of  the  
scheme  through  notice  via  email or SMS at 
least three working days prior to effecting such 
change. Further, the notice of such change shall 
be updated in the aforesaid section of website 
at  least  three  working  days  prior  to  effecting 
such change. Any increase or decrease in TER

in  a  mutual  fund  scheme  due  to  change  in 
AUM  and  any  decrease  in  TER  in  a  mutual 
fund  scheme  due 
to  various  regulatory 
requirements,  would  not  require  issuance  of 
any prior notice to the investors.

Further,  the  formats  for  scheme  information 
document and placement memorandum have 
been  modified  to  mandate  mutual  funds  to 
disclose  the  current  expense  ratios  on  the 
website  at  least  three  working  days  prior  to 
the effective date of the change, instead of the 
earlier  requirement  of  updating  the  current 
expense  ratios  on  the  website  within  two 
working  days  from  the  effective  date  of  the 
change.

SEBI,  vide  amendment  to  Regulation  52(6A) 
reduced  the  additional  expenses  that  AMCs 
are permitted to charge its investors from 0.2 
per  cent  of  daily  net  assets  of  the  scheme  to 
0.05 per cent.

d. 

B.  Go Green Initiative in Mutual Fund

 

In order to bring cost effectiveness in disclosing 
and providing information to unitholders and 
as  a  green  initiative  measure,  the  following 
was prescribed:

a.  Mutual  Funds  shall  prominently  disclose  the 
NAVs of all schemes under a separate head on 
the websites and on AMFI’s website.

b.  Mutual Funds shall extend facility of sending 
latest NAV to unitholders through SMS, upon 
receiving a specific request in this regard

c.  Mutual  Funds  shall  provide  the  scheme 
annual  reports  to  the  investors  through  their 
websites, AMFI’s website and on email ids of 
the investors. Investors shall be given sufficient 
opportunity to opt in or opt out of the facility 
to receive physical copies of the annual report 
or its abridged summary.

d.  Mutual  Funds  shall  disclose  their  portfolios 
as on the last day of the month / half-year for 
all  their  schemes  on  their  websites,  AMFI’s 
website and email ids of the investors.

e.  Mutual Funds shall provide a physical copy of 
the statement of its scheme portfolio, without 
charging any cost, on specific request received 
from a unitholder.

 

SEBI  Mutual  fund  Regulations  were  also 
accordingly modified.

C.  Total Expense Ratio (TER) and Performance

Disclosure for Mutual Funds

Transparency in TER

In  order  to  bring  transparency  in  expenses, 
reduce  portfolio  churning  and  mis-selling 
in  mutual  fund  schemes,  mutual  funds  are 
directed to adhere to the following:

a.  All  scheme      related      expenses      including   
commission   paid   to   distributors,   by whatever 
name it may be called and in whatever manner 
it may be paid, shall necessarily  be  paid  from  
the  scheme  only within  the  regulatory  limits 
and    not  from    the  books    of  the AMCs,    its  
associate, sponsor, trustee or any other entity 
through any route.

 Provided  the  expenses  that  are  very  small  in 
value but high in volume may be paid out of 
AMC’s books. Such expenses can be paid out 
of  AMC’s  books  at  actuals  or  not  exceeding 
two bps of respective scheme AUM, whichever 
is lower. Such  expenses  incurred  by  AMC  
should  be  properly  recorded  and audited in 
the books of account of AMC at year end.

b.  MFs/AMCs  shall  adopt  full  trail  model  of  
commission  in  all schemes, without payment  
of  any  upfront  commission  or  up-fronting  
of  any  trail  commission, directly or indirectly,

in cash or kind, through sponsorships, or any 
other route.

However, up-fronting of trail commission will 
be  allowed  only  in  case  of  inflows  through 
Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)

In  respect  of  inflows  through  SIPs  into  MF 
schemes,  a  carve  out  has  been considered 
only for new investors to the MF industry (to 
be identified based on PAN). The up-fronting 
of  trail  commissions,  based  on  SIP  inflows, 
shall  be  up  to  one  per  cent  payable  yearly   
in   advance, for a maximum period of   three   
year The payment of upfront trail commission 
would be subject to the following:

The  upfronting  of  trail  commission  may  be 
for  total  SIP  of  upto  `  3,000  per  month,  per 
scheme, for an investor who is investing for the 
first time in mutual fund schemes

For  a  new  investor,  as  identified  above,  only 
the first SIP(s) purchased by the investor shall 
be  eligible  for  up-fronting.  In  this  regard,  if 
multiple  SIP(s)  are  purchased  on  different 
dates,  the  SIP(s)  in  respect  of  which  the 
installment starts on the earliest date shall be 
considered for up-fronting.

iii.  The  upfront  trail  commission  shall  be  paid 

from AMC’s books.

iv. 

v. 

The said commission shall be amortized on daily 
basis to the scheme over the period for which 
the payment has been made. A complete audit 
trail  of  the  up-fronting  of  trail  commissions 
from  the  AMC’s  books  and  amortization  of 
the same to scheme(s) thereafter shall be made 
available for inspection.

The  said  commission  should  be  charged  to 
the scheme as ‘commissions’ and should also 
account  for  computing  the  TER  differential 
between  regular  and  direct  plans  in  each 
scheme.

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

vi.  The  commission  paid  shall  be  recovered  on 
pro-rata basis from the distributors, if the SIP 
is not continued for the period for which the 
commission is paid.

d.  All  fees  and  expenses charged  in  a  direct  
plan  (in    percentage  terms)  under  various  
heads including  the investment  and  advisory  
fee    shall    not    exceed  the  fees  and  expenses 
charged under such heads in a regular plan

e.  No pass back, either directly or indirectly, shall 
be  given  by  MFs/  AMCs/  distributors  to  the 
investors.

f. 

Training sessions and programmes conducted 
for  distributors  should  continue  and  should  
not  be  misused  for  providing  any  reward  
or non-cash  incentive to the distributors. 

2.  Additional TER of 30 bps for penetration in 

B-30 cities

Additional TER shall be based on inflows from 
retail investors from B-30 cities and not from inflows 
from  corporates  and  institutions.  Accordingly,  the 
term ‘retail investor’ has been defined, and inflows 
of  amount  upto  `  2,00,000/-  per  transaction,  by 
individual investors shall be considered as inflows 
from “retail investor”. 

3.  Disclosure of expenses

In  addition  to  the  existing  requirements, 
mutual funds shall be required to further disclose the 
breakup  of  the  Total  expense  ratio  in  consolidated 
account statement given as under:

The  scheme’s  average  TER  (in  percentage 
terms) along with the break up between Investment 
and advisory fees, commission paid to the distributor 
and other expenses for the period for each scheme’s 
applicable plan (regular or direct or both) where the 
concerned investor has actually invested in.

4.  Disclosure of scheme performance

AMCs  shall  disclose  the  performance  of  all 
schemes  on  the  website  of AMFI  for  all  plans  and 
shall be updated daily based on previous day NAV 
along with scheme AUM and previous day NAV.
5.  No Entry Load on SIPs

Vide circular dated June 30, 2009, SEBI, inter 
alia, mandated that there shall be no entry load on 
investments  in  mutual  fund  schemes  (including 
additional purchases and switch in to a scheme from 
other schemes) made after August 1, 2009.  For SIPs, 
the  above  provision  was  made  applicable  to  SIPs 
registered on or after August 1, 2009. 

It has now been decided to make the provisions 
of the above mentioned circular applicable to all SIPs 
including SIPs registered prior to August 1, 2009
6. 

Borrowing Cost
With  regard  to  the  cost  of  borrowings  in 

terms  of  Regulation  44(2)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds) 
Regulations,  1996,  it  has  been  decided  that  for  a 
given scheme, the same shall be adjusted against the 
portfolio yield of the scheme and borrowing costs in 
excess of portfolio yield, if any, shall be borne by the 
AMC.
D.  Definition of equity oriented scheme for the 
purpose of limits of TER as specified in the 
Mutual Fund Regulations
Sub -Regulation 5 A was inserted in Regulation 

52 the mutual fund regulations.

Regulation  52  (5A):  In  case  of  a  scheme 
other  than  an  index  fund  scheme  or  an  exchange 
traded fund, where, as per the scheme information 
document, the scheme will invest a minimum of 65 
per cent of its net assets in equity and equity related 
instruments, the scheme will be considered as equity 
oriented  scheme  for  the  purpose  of  limits  of  total 
expense ratio as specified in these regulation.

Box 1.5 : Rationalisation of permissible TER of Mutual Fund Schemes

The AUM of the mutual fund industry had grown from ` 90,587 crore in March, 2001 to ` 21,36,036 crore as 
on March, 2018 i.e. CAGR of more than 20 per cent since March, 2001 and more than 21 times. The growth in 
scale of business operations brings economies of scale. In mutual fund industry also, the scale of operations 
had brought down the cost of managing per unit AUM. Since the costs of mutual fund operations had come 
down, it was felt that the permissible TER on the mutual fund schemes be brought down and the benefits of 
economies of scale be passed to the end mutual fund investors. 
Accordingly, Regulation 52 (6) of the mutual fund regulations was revised. The previous AUM slabs and the 
revised slabs for applicability of TER in Open ended schemes are placed in the table below:

essential  facilities  and  services  and perform critical 
functions in securities market

Based on the recommendation of SEBI’s High 
Powered Steering Committee - cyber  security,  it  has  
been  decided  that  the  framework  prescribed  vide 
SEBI circular dated July 06, 2015 on cyber security 
and cyber resilience also be made applicable to all 
mutual funds/AMC. Accordingly, all mutual  funds / 
AMCs  shall  comply  with  the  provisions  of  cyber  
security    and  cyber  resilience,  provided  through 
SEBI circular dated January 10, 2019.

Box 1.6 : Creation of Segregated Portfolio in Mutual Fund Schemes

In order to ensure fair treatment to all investors in case of a credit event and to deal with liquidity risk, SEBI 
permitted creation of segregated portfolio of debt and money market instruments by mutual funds schemes 
subject to certain safeguards. 

Creation of segregated portfolio is a mechanism to separate distressed, illiquid assets from other more liquid 
assets in a mutual fund portfolio to deal with a situation arising due to a credit event. With a segregated 
portfolio, investors who take the hit when the credit event happens shall get the upside of future recovery, if 
any.

Creation of segregated portfolio shall be optional and at the discretion of the AMC but with the prior approval 
of trustees.

F.  Norms  for  investment  and  disclosure  by 

mutual funds in derivatives

The  mutual    fund    schemes    are    permitted  
to    undertake    transactions    in    equity  derivatives  
in  accordance  with  the  exposure  limits and shall  
not  write  options  or  purchase  instruments  with  
embedded written options

However, based  on  the  suggestions  of  market  
participants  and  recommendations  of  Mutual  Fund  
Advisory  Committee  (MFAC),  it  was decided  to  
permit mutual  funds  to  write  call  options  under  a  
covered call  strategy  as  prescribed below: 

b. 

c. 

1.  Writing of Covered Call Options by Mutual 

Fund Schemes

a. 

The  mutual      fund      schemes  (except    index  
Funds  and  ETFs)  may  write  call  options  

only    under    a    covered  call    strategy    for  
constituent  stocks  of  NIFTY  50  and  BSE  
SENSEX  subject various restrictions based on 
value of total equity shares held in the scheme, 
total  number  of  unencumbered  shares  of 
underlying scrip held  in the scheme, existing 
derivative position in the scheme on the same 
underlying etc.

For  schemes  intending  to  use  covered  call 
strategy,  the  risks  and  benefit  of  the  same, 
must be disclosed in the SID. 

For  existing  schemes,  writing  of  call  options  
shall    be    permitted    subject    to  appropriate  
disclosure  and  compliance  with  Regulation

The following has been prescribed in respect of 
filling of advertisements vide circular dated March 
8, 2019

a. 

Regulation  30  of  SEBI 
(Mutual  Funds) 
Regulations,  1996  on  advertisement  material, 
requires   mutual   funds   to   submit   to   SEBI,   
the  advertisements  issued  by  them,  within  7 
days from the date of issue.

b. 

In  continuation  to  the  various  go  green 
initiatives in mutual funds, the mutual funds 

are  now  advised  to  submit  links  to  access 
the  advertisements  to  be  filed  under  the    
regulations  by  sending  through  an  e-mail  to 
SEBI. 

c.  Mutual Funds shall however, maintain copy of 

advertisements for future references.

d.  While    sending  an    e-mail,    the    compliance  
officer    of    respective    mutual    fund  shall  
expressly  confirm  that  the  advertisement  is  
in  compliance  with  the advertisement code 
specified  in  the  sixth  schedule  of  the  mutual 
fund regulations.

Box 1.7 : Valuation of Money Market and Debt Securities by Mutual Funds

Proper valuation of securities is important to ensure investor confidence in mutual funds as a reliable and 
robust investment vehicle and for investor protection. If the assets of the mutual fund schemes are valued at a 
price which is not reflective of its fair or market value, the investors unfairly pay more upon purchase of units 
or receive less upon redemption of the units or vice versa. Incorrect valuation may also encourage first-mover 
advantage associated with redeeming at the onset of market volatility, at the cost of the remaining investors. 
It is thus crucial to ensure that mutual funds’ assets are valued fairly and properly, such that the interests of 
incoming, outgoing and continuing investors are protected.
Considering the critical nature of valuation, the practices of mutual funds for valuation of money market and 
debt securities of residual maturity upto 60 days and for securities which have been downgraded to below 
investment grade were recently reviewed and the following measures were implemented:
a. 

In  order  to  make  the  existing  valuation  practices  for  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 
maturity upto 60 days, more reflective of the realizable value, SEBI mandated that:

i.  The residual maturity limit for amortization based valuation by mutual funds shall be reduced from 60 

days to 30 days.

ii.  The amortized price shall be compared with the reference price which shall be the average of the security 
level price of such security as provided by the valuation agencies appointed by AMFI for said purpose. 
The amortized price shall be used for valuation only if it is within a threshold of ±0.025 per cent of the 
reference price. In case of deviation beyond this threshold, the price shall be adjusted to bring it within the 
threshold of ±0.025 per cent of the reference price.

b.  In order to bring uniformity and consistency across the mutual fund industry on valuation of money 
market and debt securities rated below investment grade, SEBI mandated that the valuation agencies 
appointed by AMFI shall provide valuation of money market and debt securities rated below investment 
grade.

merger of schemes

Pursuant  to  merger  of  schemes,  there  was 
no  specific  guidelines  governing  the  depiction  of 
performance  of  the  surviving  scheme  and  merged 
schemes.  Further,  various  mutual  funds  were 
following different practices in this regard. In order 
to  standardize  the  disclosure  of  performance  of 
schemes  post-merger,  the  said  circular  envisages 
different scenarios and accordingly modalities have 
been prescribed for disclosure of performance.

Portfolio  concentration  norms  for  equity 
ETFs and index funds

ETFs  and  index  funds  replicate  underlying 
benchmark  indices.  In  order  to  address  the  risk 
related to portfolio concentration in equity ETFs and 
index funds, SEBI prescribed the norms on portfolio 
concentration.  Any  ETF/  index  fund  that  seeks  to 
replicate  a  particular  index,  shall  ensure  that  such 
index  complies  with  the  concentration  norms  on  a 
quarterly basis. 

K.  Advisory  Committee  on  Mutual  Funds 

(MFAC)

MFAC comprises of industry representatives, 
investor  associations,  government  representatives 
and  other  stakeholders.  The  committee  provides  a 
platform for interaction and deliberations on issues 
related to the MF industry. It acts as a platform for 
SEBI  to  place  its  various  regulatory  development 
activities  and  at  the  same time  the  industry  places

its  agenda  before  SEBI  for  further  consideration. 
During financial year 2018-19, the committee chaired 
by Ms. Arundhati Bhattacharya, met five times and 
gave its recommendations on various policy issues 
encompassing the MF industry.

The  committee  was  consulted  on  matters 
related  to  TER  and  performance  disclosure  for 
mutual  funds,  creation  of  segregated  portfolio  in 
mutual  fund  schemes,  norms  for  investment  and 
disclosure  by  mutual  funds  in  derivatives  and 
valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  by

INTERMEDIARIES  ASSOCIATED  WITH 
THE SECURITIES MARKET

issuers  and 

Market  intermediaries,  being  a  vital  link 
between  the  regulators, 
investors, 
constitute as one of the various components of the 
financial market. They play a very important role in 
development  of  the  market  by  providing  a  variety 
of services. SEBI is responsible for the registration, 
supervision, compliance monitoring and inspections 
of all market intermediaries in respect of all segments 
of the markets viz. equity, equity derivatives, currency 
derivatives,  debt  and  debt  related  derivatives  and 
commodity  derivatives.  In  order  to  continuously 
evaluate the performance of intermediaries and also 
at the same time facilitate ease of doing business, the 
following steps were taken in 2018-19: 

A. 

Strengthening  the  guidelines  and  raising 
industry standards for RTA, issuer companies 
and banker to an issue

SEBI  issued  a  circular  dated  April  20,  2018 
wherein various measures were stipulated in order 
to  streamline  and  strengthen  the  procedures  and 
processes with regard to handling and maintenance 
of  records,  transfer  of  securities  and  payment  of

VI.  FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTOR

Sustained capital inflows play a major role for 
any economy and in particular for emerging markets 
as these markets get influenced more by global than 
domestic  forces.  Despite  heavy  capital  infusion  by 
FPIs  in  last  two  months,  the  Indian  capital  market 
suffered a net outflow to the tune of ` 38,930 crore 
in  2018-19  as  macroeconomic  headwinds  weighed 
on investor sentiment through the year. In order to 
further  develop  the  Indian  securities  market  as  an 
avenue  for  fund  raising,  eligibility  norms  for  FPIs 
were relaxed and data privacy concerns of FPIs were 
addressed.  This  section  throws  light  on  the  policy 
measures initiated during the financial year:

A.  Relaxation of Eligibility norms for FPIs

In  April  2018,  the  eligibility  norms  for 
Category  I  FPIs  were  relaxed.  Now,  the  applicant 
falling under Category I FPI, shall also be considered 
as eligible for registration, if the applicant is resident 
in a country as may be approved by the Government 
of  India.  The  broad  based  criteria  for  FPIs  was 
relaxed by including the following provisions:

a. 

b. 

If  an  FPI  is  a  bank,  sovereign  wealth  fund, 
insurance/ reinsurance company or a pension 
fund as its institutional investor, then such an 
applicant shall be deemed to be broad based 
subject to the condition that such institutional 
investor(s)  shall,  jointly  or  separately,  hold 
more than 50 per cent of the shares or units of 
the fund in the applicant fund at all times. 

Exit  of  some  investors  from  a  broad  based 
fund  will  not  result  in  immediate  loss  of 
Category  II  status  of  such  fund.  Such  fund 
may regain broad based status within a period 
of  90  days,  failing  which,  the  fund  shall  be 
appropriately re-categorised.

The eligibility requirements for Category I and 
II FPIs were eased by removing the requirement to 
provide the following supporting documents:

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

The  applicant  is  legally  permitted  to  invest 
in  securities  outside 
its 
incorporation  or  establishment  or  place  of 
business;

the  country  of 

The applicant is authorized by its memorandum 
of  association  and  articles  of  association  or 
equivalent  document(s)  or  the  agreement  to 
invest  on  its  own  behalf  or  on  behalf  of  its 
clients;

The applicant has sufficient experience, good 
track  record,  is  professionally  competent, 
financially  sound  and  has  a  generally  good 
reputation of fairness and integrity;

The grant of certificate to the applicant is in the 
interest  of  the  development  of  the  securities 
market.

List  of  categories  eligible  for  Category  II 
registration was expanded to include appropriately 
regulated entities such as broker dealers and swap 
dealers.

B.  Monitoring of foreign investment limits

In  April  2018,  SEBI,  in  consultation  with 
RBI,  specified  a  system  housed  at  the  depositories 
(NSDL and CDSL) to monitor the foreign investment 
limits. This system would facilitate the listed Indian 
companies  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  various 
foreign investment limits.

C.  Debt investment by FPIs

a.  Government Debt

i. 

ii. 

In  June  2018,  SEBI,  in  consultation  with  RBI, 
withdrew  the  minimum  residual  maturity 
restriction  of  three  years  for  investment  by 
FPIs  in  G-secs  and  state  development  loans 
(SDLs). 

The auction process of debt limits in G-sec which 
was carried out by BSE/NSE was discontinued 
from June 2018. Further, the responsibility of 
overall monitoring of G-sec/ SDLs was shifted 
to CCIL from the depositories.

categories  under  the  category  of  corporate 
bonds were discontinued resulting in a single 
limit for FPI investment in all types of corporate 
bonds.

by any FPI or investor group shall not exceed 
50 per cent of any issue of a corporate bond. 

In  June  2018,  FPIs  were  restricted  to  have  a 
maximum  exposure  of  20  per  cent  of  their 
corporate bond portfolio to a single corporate. 
However, in February 2019 after consultation 
with RBI this restriction was removed.

Implementation of interim recommendations 
of the SEBI working group

SEBI had constituted a working group under 
the Chairmanship of Shri. Harun R. Khan, Deputy 
Governor (Retired), RBI to review the SEBI (Foreign 
Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014. The Working 
Group  submitted  its  interim  report  in  September 
2018  and  it  was  circulated  for  public  comments. 
Thereafter,  the  following  changes/  clarifications 
were made:

a. 

 

Eligibility conditions for FPIs regarding NRI/
OCI/RI

The  following  eligibility  norms  were  put  in 
place:

NRIs/  OCIs/  Resident  Indians  (RIs)  were 
allowed  to  be  constituents  of  FPIs  including 
NRI/ OCI/ RI controlled investment managers 
(IMs),  subject  to  the  conditions  that  the 
contributions should be below 25 per cent from 
a single NRI/ OCI/ RI and in aggregate should 
be  below  50  per  cent  to  corpus  of  FPI.  NRI/ 
OCI/ RI should not be in control of FPI. This 
restriction  is  not  applicable  to  FPIs  investing 
only in mutual funds in India. 

FPIs  can  be  controlled  by  IMs  which  are 
controlled and/ or owned by NRI/ OCI/ RI with 
the conditions that either IM is appropriately 
regulated in its home jurisdiction and registers 
itself with SEBI as non-investing FPI or IM is 
incorporated or setup under Indian laws and 
appropriately registered with SEBI.

ii. 

iii.  A  non-investing  FPI  may  be  directly  or 
indirectly fully owned and/ or controlled by a 
NRI/ OCI/ RI.

Clubbing  will  be  on  the  basis  of  common 
ownership of more than 50 per cent or based 
on common control. 

Public  retail  funds  like  mutual  funds  or  unit 
trusts, insurance companies and pension funds 
were  exempted  from  clubbing  requirement 
under certain conditions. 

Investment by foreign government/ its related 
entities from provinces/ states of countries with 
federal  structure  shall  not  be  clubbed  if  the 
said foreign entities have different ownership 
and control.

Strengthening of KYC Requirements

In September 2018, KYC and BO requirements 
were  strengthened  in  line  with  Indian  AML 
laws in the following way:

BOs  are  to  be  identified  in  accordance  with 
Rule 9 of the Prevention of Money laundering 
(Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005.

In  respect  of  FPIs  coming  from  “high  risk 
jurisdictions”  as  referred  in  SEBI  Master 
circular dated  July  04,  2018, the intermediaries  
may  apply  lower  materiality  threshold  of  10 
per  cent    for    identification    of    BO  and  also 
ensure  KYC  documentation  as  applicable  for 
category III FPIs.

 ODI issuing FPIs shall also identify and verify 
the BOs in the subscriber entities.

The  KYC  review  (including  change  in  BOs/ 
their holdings) should be done based on risk 
categorization  of  FPIs.  In  case  of  Category 
III  and  Category  II  FPIs  from  high  risk 
jurisdictions, KYC review should be done on 
a yearly basis and for all other clients it should 
be conducted at the time of continuance of FPI 
registration.

The  Custodian  should  maintain  the  KYC 
records  in  original  for  a  minimum  period  of 
five  years  from  the  date  of  cessation  of  the 
transactions with the said FPI.

vi.  Category  II  and  III  FPIs  registered  prior 
to  September  21,  2018  were  required  to 
provide  the  list  of  BOs  and  applicable  KYC 
documentation  latest  by  March  20,  2019.  If 
an  existing  FPI  failed  to  comply  with  the 
applicable  KYC  requirements  by  the  given 
deadline, 
the  concerned  custodian  shall 
block  such  FPI  to  make  fresh  purchases  till 
the  time  KYC  documentary  requirements, 
as  applicable,  are  complied  with.  However, 
such  FPI  are  allowed  to  continue  to  sell  the 
securities already purchased by it for a period 
of 180 days after the deadline

d.  Addressing data privacy concerns of FPIs

 

In September 2018, a provision (similar to OTP) 
was introduced, wherein, an intermediary can 
access information regarding beneficial owner 
including  senior  managing  official  of  an  FPI 
only  after  confirmation  from  the  FPI  or  its 
global custodian.

e.  Other aspects

 

i. 

ii. 

In December 2018, the SEBI (FPI) Regulations 
2014 were amended to include the following:

The  definition  of  opaque  structure  was 
widened  to  include  those  structures  where 
the  applicant  or  its  investor(s)  identified  on 
the basis of threshold for identification of BO 
have issued any bearer shares or maintain any 
outstanding bearer shares.

The  underlying  investors  having  economic 
ownership/ control of 25 per cent or more in the 
applicant/ FPI, shall not be persons mentioned 
in  the  Sanctions  List  notified  from  time  to 
time  by  the  United  Nations  Security  Council

and  shall  not  be  from  a  jurisdiction  which  is 
identified in the public statement of the FATF 
as: 

`  36,679  crore  in  2018-19,  depicting  a  manifold 
increase from the previous year. Following were the 
slew of measures undertaken by SEBI in 2018-19:

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

• 

• 

A 
jurisdiction  having  a  strategic  AML 
or  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism 
deficiencies to which counter measures apply; 
or 

A  jurisdiction  that  has  not  made  sufficient 
progress in addressing the deficiencies or has 
not  committed  to  an  action  plan  developed 
with the FATF to address the deficiencies.

iii.  Clarification  was  given  regarding  the  term 
foreign government agency. It was defined as 
an  entity  in  which  more  than  75  per  cent  of 
ownership or control is held by the Government 
of a foreign country.

F. 

Transparency in FPI registration

 In October 2018, SEBI directed the designated 
depository participants (DDPs) to submit data 
regarding the average time taken by the DDPs 
in  processing  FPI  registration  applications. 
This  would  provide  transparency  in  the  FPI 
registration process. In this regard, a monthly 
report is being published on the SEBI website.

VII.  THE CORPORATE DEBT MARKET

A  well-developed  corporate  bond  market 
supports economic development and is likely to be 
more beneficial for business having longer term cash 
flows. It has witnessed a marked shift in recent years 
and now the industry is gradually expanding its reach 
towards the corporate bond market and reducing its 
reliance on bank credit. While proactive policies and 
benign interest rate cycle contributed to growth, the 
market in India remains small, accounting for nearly 
17  per  cent  of  GDP.  The    current    year    witnessed  
` 6,10,318  crore  raised  through  2,358  issues  by  
the  way  of  private  placement listed at BSE and 
NSE  while  there  were  25  public  debt  issues  worth

VIII. OTHER  POLICIES  AND  PROGRAMMES 
HAVING A BEARING ON THE WORKING 
OF THE SECURITIES MARKET

Alike  ever  year,  in  2018-19  as  well  SEBI 
continued  its  journey  on  the  path  of  building  a 
stronger  and  more  vibrant  Indian  capital  market 
while  giving  paramount  importance  to  upholding 
investor  protection.  In  line  with  the  nationwide 
objective  of  facilitating  ease  of  doing  business, 
at  SEBI  also  this  was  an  important  area  of  focus. 
Reforms are a continuous process as the huge capital 
needs of India are a compelling force. Accordingly, 
following  favourable  policy  developments  were 
taken this year:

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

SEBI vide circular dated June 29, 2018 specified 
the format and time period of filing the term-
sheet with SEBI, by funds registered as angel 
funds under Category I- AIF-VCF.

SEBI  vide  circular  dated 
July  3,  2018, 
enhanced  the  limit  for  overseas  investment 
by  AIFs  and  VCFs  to  USD  750  million.  The 
circular  also  prescribed  the  reporting  norms 
for  such  overseas  investment  through  SEBI 
intermediary portal.  

To facilitate the presence of AIFs in IFSC, SEBI 
issued operating guidelines on November 26, 
2018 specifying the registration requirements, 
compliances, reporting etc. for AIFs including 
angel funds, to be set-up in IFSC. The relaxation 
provided under these guidelines includes the

may act as sponsor/ manager of an AIF set up 
in IFSC.

iii.  Overseas  investments  by  AIF  set-up  in  IFSC 
will not be subject to the approval of SEBI and 
outside the limit of USD 750 million specified 
by RBI.

B. 

Investor Grievance Redressal Mechanism:

SEBI  has  been  taking  various  regulatory 
measures  to  expedite  the  redressal  of  investor 
grievances.  The  grievances  lodged  by  investors 
are  taken  up  with  the  respective  listed  company 
or 
intermediary  and  continuously  monitored. 
Grievances  pertaining 
to  stock  brokers  and 
depository participants are taken up with concerned 
stock  exchange  and  depository  for  redressal  and 
monitored  by  the  concerned  department  through 

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

45

periodic  report  obtained  from  them.  Grievances 
pertaining  to  other  intermediaries  are  taken  up 
with  them  directly  for  redressal  and  continuously 
monitored by concerned department of SEBI.

The  company/intermediary  is  required  to 
respond in prescribed format in the form of action 
taken  report  (ATR).  Upon  the  receipt  of  ATR,  the 
status of grievances is updated. If the response of the 
company/intermediary  is  insufficient  /  inadequate, 
follow up action is initiated. SEBI takes appropriate 
enforcement  actions  (adjudication,  11B  directions, 
prosecution, etc) as provided under the law where 
progress  in  redressal  of  investor  grievances  is  not 
satisfactory.

SEBI Complaints Redressal System (SCORES) 
has helped the investors in real time knowledge of 
status of their grievance since investors can log onto 
SCORES at any time and from anywhere and check 
the  status  of  the  grievance  with  the  help  of  user-
name and password provided to them at the time of 
lodging  grievance.  Alternatively,  investor  can  also 
call the SEBI Toll Free Helpline to check the status of 
the grievance.

Since SCORES has made receipt of grievance 
online  it  helps  SEBI  to  take  up  issues  very  fast, 
including  those  that  may  require  a  policy  change. 
Further,  since  companies  are  required  to  file ATRs 
within  30  days  of  receipt  of  complaint,  in  case  of 
any such failure SEBI can initiate action against the 
company  depending  on  the  merit  of  the  case.  The 
following  section  highlights  measures  taken  in  the 
year 2018-19 for expediting the redressal of investor 
grievances.

a.  New initiatives in SCORES

 

SEBI  vide  circular  dated  March  26,  2018  had 
introduced the following new measures which 
were 
implemented  during  financial  year 
2018-19:

i. 

  Direct Complaints

 

from 

inputs 

received 

SEBI  had 
listed 
companies  and  intermediaries  that  investor 
grievances  can    be    resolved    faster    if    the  
grievance  were  taken  up  directly  with  the  
entity  at  the  first instance. Accordingly, with 
effect  from  August  01,  2018,  with  a  view  to 
provide an online platform to lodge grievances 
directly  to  the  entity  and  speedy  redressal 
of  the  same,  SEBI  provided  the  facility  of 
lodging  ’direct  complaint’  in  SCORES.  Under 
this mechanism, the SCORES platform can be 
utilized by investors to lodge their complaint 
directly  to  the  listed  company/  registered 
intermediary. The complaint will be addressed 
by the concerned entity and the response will 
come to the investor without any interference 
of  SEBI  officials.  In  case,  the  listed  company 
or registered intermediary fails to redress the 
complaint  to  the  investor’s  satisfaction,  the 
investor may file a complaint in SCORES.

ii. 

  Limitation Period

 

SEBI had introduced limitation period within 
which complaints can be accepted in SCORES. 
The circular inter alia stated that 

  “…in order to enhance ease, speed &accuracy in 
redressal of investor grievance, the investor may lodge a 
complaint on SCORES within three years from the date of 
cause of complaint, where;

 

Investor  has  approached  the  listed  company  or 
registered intermediary for redressal of the complaint and,

  The  concerned  listed  company  or  registered 

intermediary rejected the complaint 

or,

  The 

complainant  does  not 

any 
communication from the listed company or intermediary 
concerned or,

receive

	 The		complainant		is		not	satisfied		with		the		reply		
given  to  him  or  redressal  action taken by the listed 
company or an intermediary”

With  effect  from  August  01,  2018  the  above 
provision has been implemented in order to enhance 
ease,  speed  &accuracy  in  redressal  of  investor 
grievances.

iii.    Mandatory 

requirements 

for 

lodging 

grievances on SCORES

 

Effective  from  August  01,  2018,  SEBI  has 
made  it  mandatory  for  investors  to  register 
themselves  on  SCORES  in  order  to  lodge 
a  complaint.  While  filing  the  registration 
form,  details  like  name  of  the  investor,  PAN, 
contact details, email id, aadhaar card number 
(optional),  CKYC  ID  (optional)  etc.  may  be 
provided  for  effective  communication  and 
speedy  redressal  of  the  grievances.  Upon  
successful  registration, a  unique  user  id  and  
a    password    shall    be  communicated  to  the 
investor through an acknowledgement email / 
SMS.

iv. 

  Complaints  against  companies  placed  on 

dissemination board

 

 

Companies which were listed on the erstwhile 
non-operational  regional  stock  exchanges 
were  shifted  to  dissemination  boards  of  BSE 
and NSE if such companies failed to, either list 
on main boards of BSE and NSE or provide exit 
to the investors SEBI was receiving complaints 
against such companies.

With  a  view  to  provide  quick  recourse  to 
investors  and  also  update 
the  SCORES 
database,  a  mechanism  was  developed 
whereby: 

i. 

  SCORES status of companies on dissemination 
board was appropriately changed from ‘listed’ 
to ‘placed on dissemination board’

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

ii. 

v. 

 

  Complaints against such companies were sent 
to stock exchange. If the complaint pertained 
to valuation of securities then stock exchange 
would provide an appropriate response. If the 
complaint  pertained  to  any  other  matter,  the 
investor will be guided to take it up with the 
appropriate authority.

  Complaints  against  companies  placed  on 
subsequently 

dissemination  board  but 
removed

Many  companies,  which  were  placed  on 
dissemination board, after complying with the 
extant norms on exiting from the dissemination 
board,  have  duly  exited  the  dissemination 
board.  Complaints  against  such  companies 
are  no-longer  within  the  purview  of  SEBI. 
However, SEBI has been receiving complaints 
against such companies. With a view to provide 
quick recourse to investors, the status of such 
exited  companies  on  SCORES  is  adequately 
updated  as  ‘no  longer  listed’  and  investors 
are guided to take up the complaint with the 
appropriate authority. 

vi.    Complaints against vanishing companies

 

 

A  co-ordination  and  monitoring  committee 
(CMC)  under  aegis  of  MCA,  periodically 
comes out with a list of ‘vanishing companies’. 
Complaints  against  such  companies  are  no-
longer within the purview of SEBI. However, 
SEBI  has  been  receiving  complaints  against 
such companies. 

With  a  view  to  provide  quick  recourse  to 
investors, 
the  status  of  such  companies 
were  changed  from  ‘listed’  to  ‘vanishing’  on 
SCORES.  Investors  were  guided  that  such 
companies  do  not  fall  within  the  purview  of 
SEBI and they could approach the appropriate 
authority for their grievances.

IX.  ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS

A.   Assessment

The global economy started 2018 on an upbeat 
note, buoyed by a pickup in global manufacturing 
and trade through 2017. As investors’ confidence in 
the global economic outlook lost steam, so did the 
upswing. The global economic activity slowed down 
notably in the second half of 2018-19, led mainly by 
common factors affecting major advanced economies 
(AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs).

Despite  increasing  headwinds,  developing 
Asia posted strong growth in 2018, albeit moderating 
from 2017. According to ADB’s Asian Development 
Outlook April 2019, growth in the region is projected 
to soften to 5.7 per cent in 2019 and 5.6 per cent in 
2020.  The  growth  in  Indian  economy  slowed  from 
7.2  per  cent  in  2017-18  to  6.8  per  cent  in  2018-19, 
with  weaker  agricultural  output  and  consumption 
growth  curtailed  by  higher  global  oil  prices  and 
lower  government  expenditure.  Nevertheless,  as 
projected the growth in India is expected to rebound 
to  7.2  per  cent  in  2019  and  7.3  per  cent  in  2020  as 
policy  rates  are  cut  and  farmers  receive  income 
support, bolstering domestic demand.

The  Index  of  Industrial  Production  (IIP) 
statistics decelerated to  a three-year  low of 3.6 per 
cent in the 2018-19 fiscal as against 4.4 per cent in the 
previous fiscal. Manufacturing IIP lost pace due to a 
slowdown in production of motor vehicles, trailers 
and tractors, chemical and chemical products, rubber 
and plastics, coke and refinery products, textiles and 
beverages.  While  the  previous  year  witnessed  all 
the three sectors (services, agriculture and industry) 
maintaining  their  momentum,  the  current  year 
bore a testimony to the revival in industrial activity. 
While Services sector registered a reasonable growth 
as  compared  to  2017-18,  the  agriculture  activity 
recorded a significant fall in this financial year.

The  global  economic  growth  is  forecast  to 
decelerate to 3.3 per cent in 2019 before recovering to 
3.6 per cent in 2020. Though the advanced economies 
are  forecast  to  register  consecutive  slower  growth 
in both 2019 (1.8 per cent) and 2020 (1.7 per cent), 
the  emerging  market  and  developing  economies 
are forecast to register a marginal dip in the growth 
rate in 2019 (4.4 per cent) and then bounce back in 
2020  (4.8  per  cent).    The  forecasts  are  driven  by  a 
combination of waning cyclical forces and a return 
to  tepid  potential  growth  in  advanced  economies, 
a  precarious  recovery  in  emerging  and  developing 
market  economies  and  the  complex  factors  that 
shape the prospects for potential growth in both the 
groups.  

Various forecasts by multilateral organizations 
are  unanimous  in  the  outlook  for  India.  The  IMF 
forecasts India to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2019 and 7.5 
per cent in 2020. The ADB charted a similar course, 
projecting  the  Indian  economy  to  grow  at  7.2  per 
cent in 2019 and 7.3 per cent in 2020.  The RBI also 
expects the real GDP growth to recover in 2019 – 20 
to 7.2 per cent in 2019 – 20 (with growth accelerating 
consecutively in every quarter) and 7.4 per cent in 
2020 – 21.  Inflation is expected to remain below the 
target of 4.0 per cent. 

Amidst  the  external  headwinds,  the  Indian 
equity  market,  which  was  buoyant  till  first  half 
of  2018-19,  witnessed  two-way  movements  in  the 
second  half  of  the  financial  year.  Nonetheless,  the 
benchmark  indices  rallied  sharply  in  the  month  of 
March  2019  leading  to  India  outperforming  most 
of  its  peers  among  major  EMEs  and  some  AEs. 
While, Sensex registered a growth of 17.3 per cent, 
Nifty 50 recorded a growth of 14.9 per cent in 2018-
19  on  easing  of  concerns  over  liquidity  tightness, 
waning  inflation  pressures  and  improvement  in 
India’s  ranking  in  the  World  Bank’s  ease  of  doing 
business  index.  Apart  from  the  large  volumes 
attained  in  equity  markets,  the  Indian  derivative 

48

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

market  continued  to  reflect  commendable  growth. 
The  equity  derivatives  segment  has  become  the 
most traded segment in India with a total volume of 
` 2,376 lakh crore in 2018-19. 

As  good  as  every  year,  in  2018-19  also  SEBI 
maintained  its  journey  on  the  path  of  building  a 
stronger  and  more  vibrant  Indian  capital  market 
while  giving  paramount  importance  to  upholding 
investor  protection. An  efficient  and  fair  securities 
market facilitates the channelization of both domestic 
and international flows into investments and capital 
formation.  This  in  turn  translates  into  growth  for 
the economy. The Indian securities market has kept 
good  pace  with  the  reassuring  macroeconomic 
environment in the country. All the policy initiatives 
taken  in  2018-19  endeavoured  to  fulfill  the  prime 
objective of existence of SEBI viz. investor protection, 
market development and effective regulation. 

SEBI  believes  in  the  value  of  consultations 
with  all  the  stakeholders  and  has  set  up  advisory 
committees  in  all  major  areas  of  work  to  advice 
proactively  on  the  development  and  regulation  of 
securities markets. In order to ensure transparency, 
efficiency,  fairness,  safety  and  integrity  of  the 
securities  market,  policy  decisions  are 
taken 
after  consultations  with  the  stakeholders  and  by 
disseminating  policy  papers  for  public  comments. 
Further, agenda papers submitted to the board and 
their decisions are also placed on the website. During 
the year, consultation papers on areas like ‘revisiting 
the  public  issue  process’,  ‘issuance  of  shares  with 
differential voting rights’, ‘review of framework for 
ITP’ and the likes were placed on the SEBI website 
for public comments. 

On  the  other  hand,  new  policy  measures 
were  implemented  to  further  reshape  and  refine 
commodity 
regulations, 
strengthening  its  risk  management  framework, 
aligning  existing  market  participants  to  a  uniform 

derivatives  market 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

regulatory  framework,  boosting  the  surveillance 
mechanisms  at  exchanges  and  at  SEBI  to  better 
monitor  the  markets  and  instil  confidence  among 
all  stakeholders.  In  order  to  enable  a  conducive 
environment for this segment, and pave way, in the 
long run, for Indian markets to become price setters 
for some of the global commodities, Eligible Foreign 
Entities (EFEs) were permitted to participate in the 
commodity derivatives market.

A  healthy  and  efficient  primary  market  is 
reflective  of  the  economic  stability  that  further 
accentuates the investor’s confidence in the markets. 
Measures such as introduction of Unified Payment 
Interface (UPI) for blocking funds, reducing the time 
period for listing of issues, setting up of Innovators 
Growth  Platform,  distribution  of  cash  benefits 
through  depositories  and 
improved  corporate 
governance standards endeavor to further refine the 
primary market design and boost investor confidence. 
Total funds raised from the capital market through 
various  channels  like  public  issues,  right  issues, 
QIPs, preferential issues, private placements of debt 
and  funds  raised  by  AIFs  has  increased  manifold, 
depicting  that  India  is  increasingly  becoming  a 
preferred 
investment  destination  within  Asia, 
given  the  country’s  strengthening  macroeconomic 
environment,  increasingly  facilitative  policies  and 
significant positive growth rates.

In  order  to  facilitate  ease  of  doing  business 
and to keep up the momentum of its growth, SEBI 
reviewed  the  norms  for  proper  functioning  and 
development of securities market in IFSC. BSE’s India 
INX  exchange,  where  equity  derivatives,  currency 
derivatives  and  commodity  derivatives  segments 
are  available  for  trading,  emerged  as  the  largest 
player and recorded a total turnover of USD 196,934 
million in 2018-19, while NSE’s IFSC recorded gross 
turnover of USD 81,372 million. This financial year 
also saw the setting up of interoperable framework 
amongst the clearing corporations leading to efficient

allocation of capital for the market participants. Even 
while FPI net investments exhibited some volatility, 
investments  in  mutual  funds  have  consistently 
increased in recent years, which in turn have been 
invested by mutual funds in equities and debt. This 
acted  as  an  effective  force  in  containing  market 
volatility even when the FPIs were divesting.

Market integrity is key for investor protection 
and  the  overall  fairness  of  the  market.  SEBI 
took  some  important  steps  during  the  year  to 
further  this  objective  which,  inter-alia,  included, 
enhanced  standards  for  CRAs,  strengthening  of 
KYC  requirements  of  FPIs,  monitoring  of  foreign 
investment  limits,  early  warning  mechanism  to 
prevent  diversion  of  client  securities  and  cyber 
security  and  cyber  resilience  framework  for  stock 
brokers/depository participants.

While  investor  interests  are  ensured  through 
various policies, checks and balances, the expeditious 
redressal  of  their  grievances  is  a  pre-requisite  for 
retaining their confidence in markets and regulation 
and  for  potential  investors  as  well.  Based  on  the 
feedback  received  from  the  market  participants, 
SEBI has broadened the scope of its online investor 
complaints portal viz. SCORES. In order to help in 
achieving  financial  inclusion  and  to  enhance  the 
investor’s confidence and awareness, SEBI continues 
to  evolve  various 
like  conducting 
workshops, visit to SEBI etc. Moreover NISM, which 
is SEBI’s academic and educational arm, is dedicated 
towards  enhancing  the  quality  of  participation 
in  securities  market  capacity  building  activities 
by  way  of  designing  and  delivering  high-quality 
academic and training programmes, presenting and 
publishing research papers and imparting investor 
education and financial literacy.

initiatives 

The  main  idea  behind  the  policy  directions 
issued by SEBI has always been towards enhancing 
market  trust,  increasing  the  penetration  of  the 

securities  market,  enhancing  investor  education 
and  awareness,  enhancing  governance  norms, 
strengthening enforcement, facilitating fund raising 
by corporates and aligning the development of the 
securities  market  with  the  needs  of  the  economy. 
While the market fundamentals have started showing 
strengthening  signs,  steadfast  policy  measures 
encompassing  all  spheres  of  market  activity  shall 
further embolden the regulatory infrastructure and 
the investor confidence.

B. 

Prospects

SEBI is convinced that with the roadmap now 
laid for the ambitious growth of the Indian economy, 
the  Indian  securities  market  is  bound  to  witness 
a  quantum  jump  in  terms  of  its  size  and  relative 
importance,  the  number  of  products  and  players, 
etc.  in  the  coming  years.  This  calls  for  treating 
development,  regulation  and  protection  measures 
as  continuous  work  in  progress,  while  revisiting 
all  the  existing  activities,  keeping  abreast  with  the 
developments in the global arena, while tapping to 
our advantage globally recognized India’s expertise 
in  the  field  of  information  technology.    A  brief 
overview of the thrust areas for 2019-20 is provided 
below.  

Commodity  Derivatives:  The  commodity 
derivatives  market  segment  has  now  been  fully 
integrated to the overall securities market in a phased 
manner. In last three years, SEBI has taken several 
steps  to  widen  both  products  and  participants  in 
this segment so as to make it as robust as the other 
segments of the market. The proposals to introduce 
options 
in  goods,  derivatives  on  commodity 
indices  and  weather  derivatives  are  under  active 
consideration of SEBI. 

New Initiatives: In view of the evolving start-
up  ecosystem,  the  concept  of  accredited  investors 
will be operationalized for the purpose of Innovators 
Growth Platform. Under this framework an investor

Annual Report : 2018-19

having a demat account will make an application to 
exchange/depository  for  accreditation  that  will  be 
valid for a period of three years. It is also proposed 
to  tap  the  digital  channels  more  for  every  market 
segment  and  to  deploy  technology  for  most  of  the 
activities.  Further,  proposal  to  permit  issuance  of 
dual-class shares is underway.

Capacity Building: SEBI will require the stock 
exchanges  to  enhance  their  analytical  capabilities 
so  as  to  improve  the  analysis  of  filings  done  by 
the  listed  companies  in  XBRL  format.  A  cyber 
capability  index  will  be  developed  to  assess  the 
cyber  security  preparedness  and  resilience  of  the 
market  infrastructure  institutions.  This  index  shall 
not  only  improve  the  oversight  of  cyber  security 
implementations,  but  will  also  help  to  gauge  the 
level of implementation of the guidelines issued by 
SEBI from time to time. In order to strengthen the 
cyber  security  preparedness  resilience,  SEBI  has 
envisaged three tier structure in securities market to 
monitor cyber security related events and take action 
as deemed necessary in the interest of the securities 
market.  Further,  a  cyber-security  and  compliance 
reporting  system  for  the  regulated  entities 
is 
proposed  to  be  set  up,  so  as  to  collaborate  with 
Government  and  other  national  and  international 
regulators  to  tackle  emerging  cyber  threats  and 
vulnerabilities.

A  smooth  and  uninterrupted  functioning  of 
operations of the MIIs is essential for ensuring the 
continuity  of  the  securities  market.  It  is  therefore 
very crucial for the MIIs to constantly monitor the 
performance  of  its  systems  and  upgrade/  enhance 
its  systems  to  avoid  any  possibility  of  technical 
glitch. Towards this end, based on experience from 
the  technical  glitch  incidents  at  MIIs  in  the  past,  a 
framework  for  timely  and  adequate  reporting  of 
incidents, as well as a penalty mechanism to act as 
deterrence, is proposed to be prescribed. 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

Application of technology in financial markets 
is  changing  the  way  these  markets  functioned 
traditionally.  With  technology  driven  evolution 
of  financial  markets,  regulators  are  faced  with 
both  challenges  and  opportunities  to  evolve  their 
own  functioning  to  be  more  effective  through  the 
adoption of new technology solutions. On these lines, 
a project is currently underway to ingest data from 
various  intermediaries  into  the  SEBI  database  and 
develop algorithms in order to generate instances of 
breaches of regulatory guidelines along-with alerts 
on possible non-compliances. SEBI aims to develop 
a technology based inspection methodology for the 
regulation of various intermediaries in the securities 
market.

The recently drawn up four year IT roadmap 
of SEBI envisages to build a private cloud in order 
to cater to the infrastructure needs of SEBI; build a 
progressive data lake solution to leverage advanced 
algorithms  and  artificial  intelligence  to  address 
critical challenges in data analytics faced on account 
of the processing of vast amount of data; enterprise 
wide  security  and  network  operations  monitoring 
solution;  building  automated  work-flow  systems; 
regulatory  collaboration 
for  data;  permitting 
regulatory/innovation  sandbox  and 
facilitating 
usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning 
in the Indian securities market.

At  NISM,  it  is  proposed  to  develop  the 
capacity  building  in  emerging  areas  such  as  data 
science  applications  and  fintech  applications  in 
financial markets through short term and long term 
academic programmes. Further, curriculum for the 
existing  certification  and  continuing  professional 
education  (CPE)  programmes  for  intermediaries 
will  be  revised,  while  new  certifications  at  higher 
levels  will  also  be  introduced.  The  curriculum  for 
its  existing  academic  programmes  will  be  revised 
and new academic programmes shall be introduced.

Nevertheless,  the  designing  and  developing  of 
executive education programmes for all the financial 
market participants and even international securities 
market related organisations is underway.  

New  Players:  A  framework,  enabling  SEBI 
regulated entities to carry-out activity of aggregation 
of financial information (assets and liability related 
information regulated by any of the financial sector 
regulators) of an investor, shall be put in place. It is 
necessary that a MoU is signed by financial sectors 
regulators  enabling  information  sharing  between 
their regulated entities and entity performing such 
aggregation activity.

Ease of Doing Business: The time period for 
listing of the issues will be reduced to three working 
days  from  the  close  of  the  offer.  The  timeline  of 
the right issue process will be revisited, which will 
address the issue of risk spread over longer period 
due  to  time  taken  in  current  process.  In  order  to 
achieve dual objectives of cost reduction and process 
simplification  related  to  public  issuances  of  debt 
securities, introduction of “on tap” issuance facility 
is under consideration. As a result, the issuer would 
have  the  flexibility  of  issuing  debt  securities  and 
raising funds through multiple and smaller tranches 
on  a  continuous  basis  without  having  to  file  the 
prospectus at every stage of issuance.

The overall disclosure norms are being made 
more  investor-friendly  and  in  line  with  the  global 
norms. Many of the Regulations framed by SEBI are 
being  reviewed,  inter  alia,  to  facilitate  the  process 
of doing business in the Indian securities market as 
well  as  to  enable  seamless  compliance. A  common 
application form (CAF) shall be introduced for the 
FPIs for the purpose of registration, opening of bank 
and demat accounts and application for PAN. 

In  order  to  enable  ease  of  transactions  for 
investors and use of technology to enhance investor 
experience and penetration of MFs, a working group, 

drawing members from the MF industry, distributors, 
stock  exchanges,  MF  platforms  and 
investor 
association,  has  been  formed  to  inter-alia  provide 
recommendations  on 
simplifying  on-boarding 
process  for 
investors,  measures  for  enhancing 
the  effectiveness  of  investor  grievance  resolution 
mechanism  and  for  recommending  measures  to 
enhance MF penetration. SEBI in consultation with 
stock exchanges and depositories would take further 
measures  to  enhance  ease  of  doing  business  for 
investors through digital channels.

Corporate  Governance:  Effective  governance 
is  a  necessary  and  important  tool  for  protecting 
the  interests  of  various  stakeholders,  particularly 
small  investors,  in  the  market.  This  has  been  and 
will  always  remain  an  important  area  of  focus  for 
SEBI. In order to ease the process of casting e-voting 
thereby facilitating greater participation of the retail 
investors, the designing of a common mobile app for 
e-voting is in progress. Further, to facilitate investors 
to take informed decisions on the proposals of the 
listed entities, the option of providing relevant links 
to  the  recommendations  of  SEBI  registered  proxy 
advisors  is  also  under  consideration.  The  Indian 
investors  will  soon  be  provided  with  the  facility 
to  hold  securities  issued  overseas  in  their  demat 
accounts in India. 

Continuing  with  the 

to  strengthen 

initiatives  taken 
the  norms 

in 
previous  years 
for 
governance in the Indian securities market, in 2019-20, 
SEBI shall review the existing disclosure framework 
pertaining to environmental, social and governance 
based  disclosures  in  India  relating  to  business 
responsibility  report  and  integrated  reporting.  The 
framework  of  Ombudsman  Regulations  will  be 
perused in order to make it adaptive to the present 
needs of the securities market.  

Risk  Management:  Robust  risk  management 
practices are sine-qua-non to winning the confidence 
of the market participants. A framework to govern 

52

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

the  orderly  winding  down  of  the  depositories 
operations shall be put in place.  The risk management 
framework  for  liquid  schemes  of  mutual  funds 
will  be  further  strengthened.  The  review  of  extant 
surveillance  systems  has  already  been  initiated  by 
monitoring intra-day volatility and identifying new 
criteria for preventive surveillance measures.

To  further  strengthen  the  systems,  the  scope 
of surveillance activities shall be expanded by way 
of  introduction  of  new  alerts  and  modification  of 
existing  alerts  for  all  segments  of  the  market.  The 
surveillance  measures  in  the  form  of  additional 
margins may be explored further to mitigate overall 
risk  to  the  system.  In  order  to  make  the  existing 
guidelines on valuation of money market and debt 
securities  more  reflective  of  the  market  dynamics 
and increase the robustness of valuation, the present 
guidelines will be examined. To further strengthen 
the  supervision  over  stock  brokers,  additional 
measures to prevent misuse of clients’ securities will 
be stipulated.

Investor  Awareness  and  Education:  The 
investors are the bedrock of the securities market and 
the Indian securities market has immense potential 
as  regards  the  growth  of  the  investor  population 
is concerned.  It is proposed to increase the spread 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

of  investor  education  programs  and  activities  in 
securities  market  including  commodity  derivatives 
market under one umbrella of SEBI. The plan is to 
further accelerate partnering with the industry bodies 
viz.  recognized  investors’  associations,  commodity 
derivative trainers in spreading investor awareness 
and  education  and  more  reliance  will  be  placed 
on  the  tools  of  information  and  communication 
technology in the effort.

Overall  Development:  Markets 

have 
increasingly  integrated  globally  and  are  getting 
more and more complex with the emergence of new 
products and processes. In this scenario, regulators 
need to upgrade their skills as per the requirements 
of their regulated space to be effective. To supplement 
its  recovery  process,  SEBI  signed  a  MoU  with  the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India wherein 
both  organisations  intend  to  co-operate  with  each 
other  for  effective  integration  and  implementation 
of  Securities  laws  and  Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy 
Code. The policies for governing the proxy advisors 
will be reviewed. SEBI is determined to have a well-
considered and balanced approach in its endeavours 
to  meet  its  mandated  objectives  of  regulating 
and  developing  the  Indian  securities  market  and 
protecting investor interests in securities.

Trends And Operations In The Securities Market

 

1.  PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET 

The  Initial  Public  Offering  (IPO)  market 

witnessed  reduced  activity  during 
the  
2018-19. Fundraising through IPOs plunged 
as  companies  turned  cautious  due  to  market 
volatility. The liquidity crisis at the NBFCs, escalating 
trade war fears, higher crude prices, a weaker Rupee 
and several macro-economic factors led to volatility 
in equities that kept the primary market dull during 
the year.

2.  SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

PART TWO: Trends And Operations

I. 

EQUITY MARKETS 

 
Despite several challenges, including liquidity 
crises  in  domestic  non-banking  finance  companies 
(NBFCs),  the  delay  in  Brexit  and  global  trade 
tensions,  Indian  equity  markets  fared  well  during 
the year 2018-19. During the year, the mutual fund 
assets under the management rose by 11.4 per cent 
on account of strong participation of retail investors 
despite volatile markets. However, after two years of 
good foreign funds inflow, foreign inflows witnessed 
reversal  in  the  trend  during  2018-19.  The  foreign 
investors  net  sold  `  88  crore  in  2018-19  compared 
to  net  inflow  of  `  25,635  crore  in  2017-18  and 
` 55,705 crore in 2016-17, mainly on account of rising 
uncertainty  over  US-China  trade  war  and  capital 
outflows from emerging markets due to interest rate 
hike by US Federal Reserve.

India’s benchmark blue chip indices S&P BSE 
 
Sensex (henceforth referred to as Sensex) and Nifty 
50  (henceforth  referred  to  as  Nifty)  continued  its 
growth momentum in 2018-19, as Sensex and Nifty 
gained 17.3 per cent and 14.9 per cent respectively 
during the year (Figure 2.2). Both the indices have 
been normalised to 100. The Sensex closed at 38,673 
on March 29, 2019 up by 5,704 points as compared 
to  the  level  at  the  close  of  previous  financial  year. 
The Nifty closed at 11,624 on March 29, 2019 up by 
1,510 points as compared to the level at the close of 
previous financial year.

 
Both Sensex and Nifty reached their respective 
all-time  highs  of  38,897  and  11,739  on  August  28, 
2018.  The  lowest  level  attained  by  the  Sensex  was 
33,019 on April 04, 2018 while the Nifty recorded its 
lowest level of 10,030 on October 26, 2018.

IX.  DEMATERIALISATION

 
In  the  past  few  decades,  the  Indian  capital 
market has undergone a phenomenal growth in terms 
of  listed  companies,  number  of  stock  exchanges, 
trade  volumes  of  scrips,  and  investor  population. 
This astounding growth of the capital market in India 
has  been  primarily  due  to  the  introduction  of  the 
dematerialisation.  Demat  accounts  eliminate  many 
problems that investors have to face while dealing 

with physical securities. They minimise paperwork 
that  is  involved  with  the  ownership,  trading,  and 
transfer of securities. It facilitates faster transactions 
and makes trading in securities extremely convenient 
and safe.

 
At the end of March 2019, there were 185 lakh 
demat accounts at the National Securities Depository 
Limited  (NSDL)  and  174  lakh  demat  accounts  at 
the  Central  Depository  Services  (India)  Limited

At  CDSL,  the  quantity  of  dematerialised  securities 

increased by 27.5 per cent to 0.36 lakh crore as at end 
2018-19 from 0.28 lakh crore as at end 2017-18. The ratio 
of  dematerialised  equity  shares  to  total  outstanding

Trends in the Currency Derivatives Market

 
Through  trading  in  currency  derivatives  the 
stakeholders  can  hedge  against  foreign  exchange 
risk  and  benefit  from  the  Rupee’s  movements 
against  major  foreign  currencies.  There  has  been 
significant increase in volumes of trading in currency 
derivatives over the years. The Euro, Japanese Yen, 
British Pound and US Dollar are the major currencies 
for which currency derivatives are paired with the 
Rupee. Also, cross currency pairs are now allowed 
to be traded. Presently in Indian markets, currency 
derivatives are traded on BSE, NSE, and MSEI. 

The  aggregate  turnover 

 
in  the  currency 
derivatives  segment  at  the  exchanges  increased 
by  66.1  per  cent  to  `  159.2  lakh  crore  during 
2018-19  from  `  95.8  lakh  crore  in  the  previous 
year.  The  turnover  of  BSE  and  NSE  grew  by  65.7  
per  cent  and  69.4  per  cent,  respectively  during  
2018-19, while that of MSEI declined by 59.2 per cent. 
During 2018-19, the total turnover was the highest at 
NSE (` 85.2 lakh crore), followed by BSE (` 73.5 lakh 
crore) and MSEI (` 0.47 lakh crore). NSE accounted 
for 53.5 per cent of the total turnover in the currency 
segment followed by BSE (46.2 per cent) and MSEI 
(0.3 per cent) (Table 2.33).

C.  Trends in Interest Rates Derivatives

 
Interest-rate derivatives are often used to hedge 
risk by institutional investors, banks, companies and 

individuals to protect themselves against changes in 
interest rates and they can also be used to increase or 
refine the holder’s risk profile. The trends observed 

72

in  turnover  and  open  interest  in  the  interest  rate 
derivatives  at  NSE,  BSE  and  MSEI  are  given  in  
Table 2.35. 

 
During 2018-19, the aggregate turnover in the 
interest  rate  derivatives  (IRD)  segment  across  all 
exchanges declined by 34.6 per cent. Gross turnover 

in IRD segment of BSE declined by 50.3 per cent, to  
`  1,  11,222  crore  in  2018-19  as  compared  to 
`  2, 23,881 crore in 2017-18. Gross turnover in IRD 
segment of NSE also fell by 23.6 per cent. However, 
there  was  no  trading  activity  reported  in  the  IRD 
segment of MSEI during 2018-19. (Table 2.35)

D.  Trends in the VIX Futures Segment

 
NSE launched trading in futures contracts on 
India VIX in the futures and options segment w.e.f. 
February  26,  2014.  India  VIX  is  a  volatility  index 
based on NIFTY’s index options prices. India VIX is 
computed using the best bid and ask quotes of the out-
of-the-money  near  and  mid-month  NIFTY  options 

contracts which are traded on the F&O segment at 
NSE.  India  VIX  indicates  investors’  perceptions  of 
the  market’s  volatility  in  the  near  term.  However, 
the trading activity in VIX contracts thinned down 
subsequent to the launch in 2014-15. No trading was 
reported in VIX contracts during 2018-19.

3.  THE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES MARKET

I. 

 AN  OVERVIEW  OF  THE 
COMMODITY DERIVATIVES MARKET

INDIAN 

 
During  2018-19,  Government  of  India  raised 
the  Minimum  Support  Price  (MSP)  to  provide  
50  per  cent  return  over  the  cost  of  production.  To 
support  the  agricultural  sector,  Government  also 
launched PM-KISAN scheme during the year, which 
aims to provide direct monetary support to farmers. 
At regulatory front, SEBI permitted eligible foreign 
entities having actual exposure to Indian commodity 
markets  to  hedge  their  price  risk  by  participating 
in  commodity  derivatives  trading.  Market  was 
further  broadened  by  permitting  mutual  funds  to  
participate 
in  commodity  derivatives  market. 
Further,  in  a  move  towards  recalibration  of  fee 
charged  to  various 
intermediaries,  the  broker 
turnover  fees  for  agri-commodity  derivatives  was 
reduced  by  93.3  per  cent  to  Rupee  One  per  crore 
turnover from ` 15 per crore turnover. The reduced 
cost of trading is expected to boost the participation 
in agri-commodity derivatives in India.

 
During  the  year,  the  universal  exchange 
principle  was  operationalized  when  BSE  and  NSE 
commenced  their  commodity  derivatives  trading 
platform.  On  the  other  hand,  NMCE  which  had 
a  presence  in  agricultural  space,  was  merged  with 
ICEX  on  September  24,  2018.  Another  notable 
development  was  introduction  of  new  products, 
viz., Steel long (ICEX) and Oman Crude Oil (BSE).

The  exchanges  recorded  increased  trading 
 
activity  in  commodity  derivatives  in  2018-19  as 
compared  to  previous  year.  While  the  aggregate 
turnover  increased  in  Metals,  Bullions  and  Energy 
segment, it declined in Agricultural segment. With 
falling  turnover,  the  share  of Agricultural  segment 
declined  (to  8.8  per  cent  from  12.3  per  cent)  in 
aggregate  turnover  of  all  exchanges,  on  the  other 
hand, it increased significantly for Energy segment 
(to 33.7 per cent from 29.8 per cent) during the year. 
Among  commodities  traded  at  exchange  platform, 

Crude  oil  was  the  highest  traded  commodity  in 
terms  of  both  volume  and  value.  The  crude  oil 
futures accounted for 29.2 per cent of the aggregate 
traded value of all commodity exchanges. 

 
According to provisional estimates of National 
Income released by CSO, the growth in Gross Value 
Added  (GVA)  for  agriculture  and  allied  sectors  is 
estimated to slowdown to 2.9 per cent in 2018-19 as 
against 5.0 per cent in 2017-18. Due to low monsoon 
and post-monsoon rains, the foodgrain production in 
India is projected to decrease in 2018-19.  As per the 
third  advance  estimates  of  foodgrain  productions, 
foodgrain  output  declined  by  0.6  per  cent  to  
283.4  million  tonnes  in  2018-19,  as  compared  with 
the final estimates of production for 2017-18. 

 
The  decline  in  output  is  attributed  to  lower 
pulses  production  during  the  year.  Among  the 
commodities 
traded  at  commodity  exchanges, 
production  of  Castor  Seed,  Cotton,  Chana,  Barley, 
Maize  and  Jute  is  estimated  to  decline  in  2018-19, 
on  the  other  hand,  Soybean,  Rape/Mustard  seed 
and Wheat are estimated to witness an increase in 
production.

The  benchmark  commodity  indices  -  MCX 
 
(earlier  known 
COMDEX  and  NKrishi  Index 
as  Dhaanya 
in  
2018-19.  MCX  COMDEX,  which  is  a  composite

segment,  increased  by  2.1  per  cent,  while,  the 
NKrishi - the agri commodity index, moved up by  
12.4 per cent during the year. An increase in MCX 
COMDEX was driven by rise in MCX Metal (3.4 per cent) 
and MCX Agri (2.0 per cent) sub-indices, which was 
partially offset by decline in MCX Energy sub-index  
(0.2 per cent). During 2018-19, NKishi Index increased 
as  seven  out  of  10  constituent  commodities,  viz., 
Chana, Guar Seed, Castor Seed, Cotton Seed Oilcake,

INTERNATIONAL SCENARIO

 
In 2018-19, majority of agricultural, metal and 
minerals prices recorded declining trends in global 
markets.  While  the  price  of  food  and  agricultural 
segment fell consistently, energy segment was highly 
volatile  during  the  year.  The  volatility  in  energy 
segment  was  driven  mainly  by  crude  oil,  whose 
prices have been affected by an array of geopolitical 
and macroeconomic factors during the year. During 
the  first  three  quarters  of  2018,  the  oil  prices  were 
supported  by  production  cuts  by  OPEC  countries, 
US  sanction  on  Iran  and  supply  disruptions  in 
Venezuela.  However,  the  prices  fell  sharply  in  last 
quarter of 2018 after the US announced temporary 
exemptions to its sanctions on Iran for eight countries 
(including  India  and  China).  The  downtrend  was 
further  boosted  by  stronger  than  expected  US  oil 
output. The crude oil prices recovered in first quarter 

of  2019  on  subsequent  production  cuts  by  OPEC. 
Movement  of  World  Bank  Commodity  indices  in 
2018-19 is represented in Figure 2.10.

During  the  year  weakness  in  metal  and 
 
agricultural commodities mainly reflected concerns 
on  slower  world  economic  growth,  U.S-  China 
trade 
tensions  and  other  commodity  specific 
fundamentals. After witnessing a declining trend in 
2018,  metal  segment  recovered  the  losses  partially 
in the first quarter of 2019 on account of improved 
growth  prospects  in  China  –  the  major  consumer 
state and supply constraints in Chile, Brazil, China 
and Indonesia affecting the supply of Copper, Iron 
Ore, Nickel, Lead, Zinc and Tin in the world market. 
Agricultural commodities prices were supported by 
lower soybean production in U.S. and higher input 
costs, viz., fuel and fertilizer.

2018-19,  as  compared  to  a  decline  of  8.2  per  cent 
in  previous  year.  The  rise  was  driven  by  higher 
turnover  at  energy  (36.7  per  cent)  and  metal 
segment (19.6 per cent). On the other hand, futures 
turnover at NCDEX witnessed a fall of 9.9 per cent to  
`  5,31,414  crore  during  the  year,  as  compared  to 
a  decline  of  1.2  per  cent  in  2017-18.  The  fall  in 
turnover  at  NCDEX  is  attributed  to  lower  trading 
volumes in major agri commodities viz., Guar Seed  
(13.2  per  cent),  Soybean  (19.1  per  cent),  Guargum 
(15.2  per  cent),  Chana  (5.8  per  cent)  and  Soy  Oil  
(19.7 per cent) during the year.

 
During the year, the futures turnover at ICEX 
increased  11  times  to  `  24,061  crore  due  to  higher 
trading volumes in Diamond futures, in addition of 
Steel long futures in metal segment and migration of 
agri commodities traded at NMCE to ICEX platform. 
During  April  –September  (till  its  merger  with  
ICEX)  2018,  NMCE  had  recorded  a  turnover  of  
` 13,675 crore. 

 
Since  commencement  of  commodity  trading  
in  October  2018,  BSE  recorded  a  turnover  of  
`  32,804  crore,  while  NSE’s  turnover  stood  at 
` 3,444 crore. 

 
At the end of March 2019, the aggregate futures 
Open Interest (OI) at MCX was 27.1 per cent up at

4.  MUTUAL FUNDS

The  strength  of  an  economy  can  be  gauged 
 
from  the  performance  of  a  good  financial  market, 
which helps to channelize the savings of the people 
into diverse investment opportunities. In India, the 
mutual funds are playing a major role by bringing 
stability  to  the  financial  markets  and  through 
efficient resource mobilisation from various sectors. 
In the last two decades, the mutual fund industry is 
growing in a notable way by an increase in number 
of folios and Asset under Management (AUM). As 
compared  to  the  previous  year,  the  AUM  of  the 
mutual funds have witnessed a growth of 11.4 per 
cent in 2018-19.

I.

investment.  Portfolio  management

during 2018-19.

 
The  total AUM  of  the  portfolio  management 
industry  increased  by  9.5  per  cent  to  `  16.1  lakh 
crore  at  the  end  of  March  2019  from  `  14.7  lakh 
crore  at  the  end  of  March  2018.  The  AUM  of 
discretionary  services  rose  by  13.1  per  cent  in  
2018-19 from ` 11.5 lakh crore as at end March 2018 
to ` 13.0 lakh crore as at end-March 2019. The AUM 
of  non-discretionary  services  rose  by  21.4  per  cent

III.  ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS

 
Alternative  investments  are  defined  as  asset 
classes  that  fall  outside  of  traditional  investments, 
such as stocks, bonds and cash. Real estate, private 
equity,  managed  futures,  hedge  funds,  etc.  are  all 
examples  of  alternative 
investments.  Although 
the  characteristics  of  each  of  these  assets  differ 
from the other, all tend to share the ability to offer 
diversification  for  a  traditional  portfolio  through 
enhanced  returns,  reduced  risk  and/or  improved 
risk-adjusted performance.

 
The  commitments  raised  by  AIFs,  so  far, 
increased from ` 1,65,095 crore at the end of March 
2018  to  `  2,82,148  crore  at  the  end  of  March  2019. 
By  the  end  of  March  2019,  the  cumulative  net 
investment  made  by  AIFs  rose  to  `  1,09,781  crore 
from  `  61,402  crore  as  at  the  end  of  March  2018. 
The  cumulative  amount  mobilised  by  AIFs  as  on 
March 31, 2019 is given in Table 2.51. At the end of 
2018-19, 
investment  made  by  
Category  II  AIF,  Category  III  AIF  and  Category  I  
AIF  stood  at  `  68,086  crore,  `  30,802  crore  and

Venture Capital is an important source of seed 
capital funding for start-up ventures and technology 
projects.  It  is  a  type  of  funding  which  is  different 
from  traditional  sources  of  financing  as,  unlike 
traditional  sources  of  funding,  venture  capitalists 
finance  innovation  and  ideas  which  have  potential 
for high growth with inherent uncertainties. With a 
view to promote innovation, it is very important to 
promote venture capital activity in India. 

The  cumulative  net 

 
investment  of  VCFs 
decreased by 12.7 per cent to  `  18,919 crore at the 
end  of  March  2019  as  compared  to  `  21,679  crore 
at  the  end  of  March  2018.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
cumulative  net  investment  by  FVCIs  increased  by 
26.5 per cent to `  44,158 crore at the end of March 
2019, compared to ` 34,906 crore at the end of March 
2018.  The  combined  cumulative  net  investment  of 
VCFs  and  FVCIs  increased  by  11.5  per  cent  at  the 
end of this financial year. (Table 2.52).

V.  REITs AND InvITs 

 
Real  estate  investment  trust  (REITs)  and 
Infrastructure  investment  trust  (InvITs)  are  the 
innovative  investment  vehicles  that  help  to  attract 
private  funds  to  the  real  estate  and  infrastructure 
sectors. REITs provide a  platform for the  investors 
(even  those  who  with  small  budget)  to  make  safe 
and  rewarding  investment  into  the  operational 
functioning or ownership of real estate and related 
assets  without  actually  buying  the  assets.  It  helps 
the investors in portfolio diversification and, thereby 
long  term  capital  appreciation.  In  2014,  to  make 
a  platform  for  the  financing  and  refinancing  the 
infrastructure  projects  in  India,  the  infrastructure 
investment  trust  (InvITs)  were 
launched.  The 
InvITs can pool small sums of money from various

investors over a period of time so as to enable them 
to participate in the growth of infrastructure sector.

REITs and InvITs. As on March 31, 2019 there were

company can return money to its shareholders. SEBI 
started regulating this activity with respect to listed 
entities from 1998 and accordingly framed the SEBI 
(Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 1998. Recently, 
SEBI (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 have 
been notified in September 2018 in lieu of the SEBI 
(Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 1998.

 
63  buyback  offers  were  received  during

 NATION-WIDE  AWARENESS  CAMPAIGN 
FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES 
(SMES)

 
SEBI  has  initiated  awareness  programs,  in 
coordination  with  Stock  Exchanges,  to  interact 
with  SMEs  from  different  clusters  and  familiarize 
them  with  the  platform  being  offered  by  the 
stock  exchanges  for  the  benefits  of  SMEs.  During 
2018-19  SME  meets  were  held  at  Bhubaneshwar, 
Shimla,  Varanasi  and  Lucknow.  There  was  active 
participation by the respective State Government too 
in these programs.

 

During  these  programs,  technical  sessions 

were  held,  wherein  stock  exchanges  interacted 
with  SMEs  in  small  groups,  apprised  them  about 
the regulatory framework for SMEs and addressed 
their  queries  and  apprehensions.  The  technical 
sessions were followed by the main event wherein 
the senior management of SEBI, functionaries from 
the respective State Government and representatives 
of stock exchanges addressed the representatives of 
SMEs. The data with regard to SME listing is given in 
Table 2.66. The market capitalisation of companies 
listed  in  SME  Exchange  and  capital  raised  by 
companies on SME exchanges are given in Table 2.67

INVESTOR GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL 

 
SEBI  has  been  taking  various  regulatory 
measures  to  expedite  the  redressal  of  investors 
grievances.  The  grievances  lodged  by  investors 
are  taken  up  with  the  respective  listed  company 
intermediary  and  continuously  monitored. 
or 
Grievances  pertaining 
to  stock  brokers  and 

depository participants are taken up with concerned 
stock  exchange  and  depository  for  redressal  and 
monitored  by  the  concerned  Department  through 
periodic  report  obtained  from  them.  Grievances 
pertaining  to  other  intermediaries  are  taken  up 
with  them  directly  for  redressal  and  continuously 
monitored by concerned Departments of SEBI.

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

 
The  company/intermediary  is  required  to 
respond in prescribed format in the form of Action 
Taken  Report  (ATR).  Upon  the  receipt  of ATR,  the 
status of grievances is updated. If the response of the 
company/intermediary  is  insufficient  /  inadequate, 
follow up action is initiated. SEBI takes appropriate 
enforcement  actions  (Adjudication,  11B  Directions, 
Prosecution, etc) as provided under the law where 
progress in redressal of investors grievances is not 
satisfactory.

 
SEBI Complaints Redressal System (SCORES) 
has helped the investors in real time knowledge of 
status of their grievances since investors can log onto 
SCORES at any time and from anywhere and check 
the  status  of  the  grievances  with  the  help  of  user-
name and password provided to them at the time of 
lodging grievances. Alternatively, investor can also 
call the SEBI Toll Free Helpline to check the status of 
the grievance.

PART TWO: Trends And Operations

 
Since SCORES has made receipt of grievance 
online  it  helps  SEBI  to  take  up  issues  very  fast, 
including  those  that  may  require  a  policy  change. 
Further, since companies are required to file Action 
Taken Reports within 30 days of receipt of complaint, 
in  case  of  any  such  failure  SEBI  can  initiate  action 
against the company depending on the merit of the 
case. 

The  following  paragraphs  highlight  SEBI’s 
 
performance taken in the year 2018-19 for expediting 
the redressal of investor grievances.

A. 

 Investor Grievances Received And Redressed

 REGULATION  OF  BUSINESS  IN  STOCK  EXCHANGES  AND  CLEARING 
CORPORATIONS

A  stock exchange is a platform for facilitating 

price  discovery  and  risk  management  of 
various  instruments  available  for  trading. 
Stock exchanges play an important role in the efficient 
allocation of resources in any economy as the prices 
discovered provide a signal for efficient allocation of 
financial resources across corporations. Apart from 
providing  platforms  for  trading,  stock  exchanges 
have  also  been  entrusted  with  various  regulatory 
responsibilities for ensuring market integrity and for 
protecting investor’s interests. The stock exchanges’ 
regulatory  functions  include  issuer  regulations, 
member  regulations,  trading  regulations,  investor 
protection,  maintaining  investor  protection  funds 
(IPFs)  and  product  design.  They  also  undertake  a 
wide  array  of  support  functions  like  training  and 
education, information/data services and technology 
solutions.

During  2016  SEBI  provided  options  to  the

“Exclusively  Listed  Companies”  refer  to  those 
companies  whose  equity  shares  were  exclusively 
listed at a recognized stock exchange at the time of 
exit of such exchange and were subsequently moved 
to  the  dissemination  board  of  NSE  and  BSE  and 
whose  shares  are  available  for  buying  and  selling 
on  dissemination  board.  An  exit  mechanism  for 
investors in such ELCs was also specified. Further, 
ELCs were required to furnish the plan of action by 
January 09, 2017 to the designated stock exchanges 
(DSEs), which was subsequently extended till June 
30, 2017.

the exit from the DB.

Freezing of shares of the promoters/directors.

compliant with the directions of SEBI issued in 2016 
and the ELCs that have not submitted plan of action

transfer, by way of sale, pledge, etc., of any of 
the  equity  shares  and  the  corporate  benefits 
such as dividend, rights, bonus shares, split, etc. 
shall be frozen, for all the equity shares, held 
by the promoters or directors of noncompliant 
exclusively listed companies till the promoters 
of  such  non-compliant  exclusively 
listed 
companies provide an exit option to the public 
shareholders  in  compliance  with  directions 
issued  by  SEBI  in  2016,  as  certified  by  the 
concerned designated stock exchanges;

it  is  necessary  that  all  the  intermediaries  maintain 
high standards of integrity and fairness and also act 
with due skill, care and diligence in conducting their 
business with high levels of compliance. The various 
intermediaries’  regulations  have  been 
framed 
under the SEBI Act, 1992 and the Depositories Act, 
1996  for  registration  and  regulation  of  all  market

retail investors is one of the routes used for price / 
volume manipulation in few scrips. The promoters 
/  directors  /  connected  entities  of  the  company 
circulate  unsolicited  bulk  SMSs  recommending  to 
buy the shares of the company thereby fraudulently 
inducing investors to buy the shares of the company.

i) 

ii) 

 In one case, certain connected entities belonging 
to  a  group  first  manipulated  the  scrip  price 
and  thereby  increased  the  price  of  the  scrip. 
Around  the  same  time,  certain  promoters 
of  the  company  transferred  shares  to  other 
connected  entities  through  off  market  route. 
Subsequently,  one  of  the  connected  entities 
(connected  with  promoters  of  the  company) 
circulated  bulk  SMS  containing  unsolicited 
advice that recommended purchase of shares 
of  the  company  and  lured  gullible  investors 
to buy the shares of the company. Pursuant to 
sending such bulk SMS, connected entities and 
their promoters sold their shares at exchanges 
and thereby cheated the gullible investors.

 In  another  case,  Promoters-Directors  of  a 
company had devised a scheme to dump their 
shares.  They  sent  unsolicited  bulk  SMS  to 
investors that recommended purchase of shares 
of  the  company  and  thereby  fraudulently 

induced  investors  to  buy  the  shares  of  the 
company. In this matter, two ex-parte interim 
orders  were  passed  and  certain  entities  were 
debarred  from  trading  in  securities  market 
till  further  directions,  pending  investigation. 
Further,  detailed  investigation  found  that 
certain entities had acted in concert and were 
part  of  the  scheme  to  plant  unsolicited  and 
misleading advice to induce gullible investors 
to  purchase  shares  of  the  company.  These 
entities  had  also  manipulated  the  scrip  price 
during the investigation period and created a 
misleading appearance of trading in the scrip. 
Promoters-Directors of the company offloaded 
large number of shares in the secondary market 
pursuant to such misleading recommendation.

 A company came out with a buy buyback offer 
in April 2016 and delisting offer in December 
2016.  On  investigation,  it  was  observed  that, 
entities connected to promoters of the company, 
funded  purchase  of  shares  of  company 
by  certain  entities,  the  bulk  of  which  was 
subsequently sold under the buyback offer of 
the company and contributed towards making 
the  buyback  offer  successful.  Thereafter, 
these  entities  returned  money  received  from 
selling shares in buyback offer to the entities 
connected to promoters.

 Subsequently,  another  set  of  entities  funded 
by  promoter  connected  entities,  purchased 
shares  of  the  company  at  high  prices  and 
thereafter,  bid  under  the  delisting  offer  at  a 
price  substantially  lower  than  the  prevailing 
market price. It was further observed that by 
placing  orders  for  large  quantities  at  prices 
substantially  lower  than  prevailing  market 
price, 
towards 
depressing  the  cutoff  price  for  the  delisting 
offer in a manipulative manner. Further, one of 
these entities repeatedly sold shares at low price 

these  entities  contributed

in the market to trigger sharp decline in price 
of the scrip during the period in which auction 
for delisting offer was conducted. In this way, 
by  their  manipulative  scheme,  these  entities 
depressed  cutoff  price  in  delisting  and  made 
the delisting offer successful.

 Complaints were received by SEBI and BSE in 
the  matter  inter  alia  alleging  that,  promoters 
of company were trying to delist its shares at 
a  low  price  and  that  book  building  process 
was successful due to bidding by  promoter / 
company  connected  entities.  The  matter  was 
investigated and it was observed that, during 
investigation 
the  promoters  of  company 
along  with  connected  and  /or  related  entities 
fraudulently  made  the  trading  as  frequently 
traded  in  order  to  avoid  using  book  value 
to  determine  floor  price  for  the  purpose  of 
delisting. Further, promoter indirectly through 
his relative bought one private limited company 
which  got  shares  of  the  company  from  other 
promoter group companies which were shown 
as  public  shareholders  through  a  scheme  of 
amalgamation.  Subsequently, 
these  shares 
were  offered  during  book  building  process 
at  low  price  to  make  delisting  successful.  It 
was also observed that, the company had not 
complied with minimum public shareholding 
requirements.

 As  part  of  ongoing  surveillance,  SEBI  came 
across certain instances / internal alerts wherein 
some  entities  had  consistently  incurred  loss 
by trading in BSE’s Stock Options segment by 
repeatedly  reversing  their  transactions.  On 
detailed  investigation,  it  was  observed  that 
certain entities were involved in generation of 
artificial  volume  by  executing  non-genuine  / 
reversal trades in stock options segment. The 
percentage  of  reversal  /  non-genuine  trades 
was  81.38  per  cent  of  total  number  of  trades

INVESTOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF INTERMEDIARIES

A. 

i. 

Section  11(2)  (f)  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992, 
 
mandates SEBI to promote investors’ education and 
foster  training  for  intermediaries  in  the  securities 
market. Along with investor awareness and financial 
literacy activities, SEBI also actively pursues investor 
grievance redressal in securities market with a view 
to  protecting  investor  interests  and  enhancing  the 
confidence of and participation of investors.

Office of Investor Assistance and Education (OIAE) 
undertakes 
financial  education  and 
investor 
awareness activities mentioned as below:

I. 

INVESTOR AWARENESS

 
For its mandate of investor protection, during 
2018-19, SEBI’s major thrust was on undertaking more 
investor  education  and  awareness  programmes, 
reaching out to more investors / potential investors 
for this purpose. Investor education and awareness 
along with grievance redressal were also the thrust 
areas for capacity building and for making investors 
confident and aware while investing in the securities 
market. With the aim of spreading investor education 
and awareness, SEBI has been undertaking following 
activities across the country:

 SEBI  Financial  Education  Resource  Persons 
Program

resource 

education 

 SEBI  has  been  implementing  an  innovative 
model  of  financial  education,  the  “SEBI 
financial 
persons 
program”, since June 2010. The main objective 
of  the  programme  has  been  to  familiarize 
the public with basic concepts relating to the 
financial sectors of banking, insurance, capital 
market,  and  pension  funds  and  also  to  make 
them  aware  of  the  illegal  Ponzi  schemes  etc. 
The  participants  are  also  made  aware  of 
various  government  schemes  like  Pradhan 
Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal 
Bima  Yojana,  Atal  Pension  Yojana,  Sukanya 
Samruddhi  Yojana  etc.  For  this  purpose, 
SEBI  has  adopted  the  model  of  empanelling 
individuals as SEBI Resource Persons (RPs) to 
spread financial education by targeting various 
identified target groups in districts across the 
country.

iii. 

iv. 

 The  eligible  individuals  are  selected  as  RPs 
who are then trained by SEBI so that they have 
a  good  understanding  of  various  aspects  of 
finance  and  financial  markets.  The  Resource 
Persons,  in  turn,  organise  free  workshops  on 
financial  literacy  in  the  local  language  of  the 
particular area/ district. The financial education 
booklets  are  also  distributed  to  participants 
attending the programmes.

 The  National  Centre  for  Financial  Education 
(NCFE) has been set up as a Section 8 company 
promoted by financial sector regulators namely 
SEBI,  RBI,  IRDAI  and  PFRDA.  Since,  NCFE 
has  been  mandated  to  take  efforts  to  include 
financial  education  in  the  school  curriculum, 
it  was  felt  that  SEBI  RP  programs  may  focus 
on the target groups other than school children 
and students. Thus, the RP programs are now 
conducted  for  five  target  groups  viz.  home 
makers,  self-help  groups,  executives,  middle 
income groups and retired personnel.

 As  of  March  31,  2019,  there  are  1,235  SEBI 
empanelled  Resource  Persons  covering  468 
districts in 29 states and four union territories. 
Since  the  inception  of  the  program,  SEBI 
empanelled Resource Persons have conducted 

83,426 financial education workshops covering 
48,33,629  participants, 
in  more  than  570 
districts of 28 states and six union territories.

v. 

 During  2018-19,  the  Resource  Persons  have 
conducted  17,929  programmes 
covering 
6,23,410 participants (Table 3.22).

 It is seen that there is an increase of 22.7 per cent 
in the number of financial education programs 
conducted by RPs in 2018-19 as compared to 
that of 2017-18. This increase may be attributed 
to the initiatives taken by SEBI in helping the 
RPs to conduct financial education programs 
by streamlining the procedures and making it 
easier  for  conducting  programs.  Further,  the 
refresher training programs for RPs conducted 
by senior SEBI officials have also contributed 
to encourage RPs to undertake large number 
of programs.

the objective of simplifying and standardising 
the financial education material to be provided 
to  the  participants  of  RP  Programmes,  a 
common  financial  education  booklet  for  all 
the  target  groups  of  RP  Programmes  has 
been  developed.  Further,  information  related 
to  basic  concepts  about  securities  market, 
commodities  derivative  markets,  various 
government  schemes  in  the  financial  sector 
were  added  /  updated.  Do’s  and  Don’ts 
pertaining  to  investment  in  financial  sector 
were also included in the new booklet.

	Refresher  Training  Program  of  RPs  -  With 
the  objective  to  update  and  enhance  the 
knowledge  base  of  RPs,  SEBI  had  conducted 
refresher  training  programs  for  RPs  in  2018-
19  across  different  zones  and  regions.  Senior 
SEBI officials have taken sessions in the above 
mentioned  training  programs  and  interacted 
with the RPs.

Education 

	Financial 
Certification 
Examination - SEBI, in coordination with NISM 
had  initiated  the  development  of  “Financial 
Education Certification Examination” through 
which an individual may assess their financial 
awareness  and  understanding  of  various 
aspects of personal finances. This certification 
examination would also be useful for RPs who 

•	

desire to enhance and update their knowledge 
on  financial  awareness.  This  certification 
examination  is  planned  to  be  launched  from 
2019-20.

	On-tap  empanelment  of  RPs  -  Presently, 
SEBI  empanels  RPs  based  on  the  demands 
of  a  particular  area/  district.  In  order  to 
further  develop  an  easier,  flexible  and  less 
time  consuming  empanelment  process, 
it 
was  proposed  to  initiate  a  scheme  of  On-Tap 
empanelment  of  RPs  wherein  RPs  could  be 
empaneled on an ongoing basis and based on 
the need of a particular area/ region. Any eligible 
individual,  who  desires  to  be  empaneled  as 
a  SEBI  RP,  shall  have  to  clear  the  “Financial 
Education  Certification  Examination”.  The 
process  of  On-Tap  empanelment  of  RPs  is 
planned to be launched in FY 2019-20.

B. 

TYPE OF INSIDER TRADING PRACTICES

 A  company  informed  BSE  and  NSE  ‘that 
a  dispute  has  arisen  between  one  of  the 
Company’s subsidiary & its client in the APAC 
region which may result in claims and counter 
claims.  The  Company  also  informed  that  it 
is  exploring  various  options  to  resolve  the 
dispute.  However,  in  terms  of  its  accounting 
policy, the company shall be providing up to a 
value of US$ 10mn, towards unbilled revenue, 
during the current quarter’. It was seen that the 
total  impact  of  the  above  mentioned  dispute 
was 3.47 per cent of the consolidated revenue 
of the company for the F.Y. 2014-15, which was 
considered  to  be  a  significant  change  in  the 
operation of the company. Further, the price of 
the scrip of the company had fallen by around 
6 per cent the next day of the announcement, 
making  it  a  price  sensitive  information.  On 
analyzing the trading pattern, it was observed 
that  the  CFO,  Group  Financial  Advisor, 
President  of  the  company  had  sold  shares  of 
the company during the UPSI period.

 A listed company informed the stock exchanges 
that  the  Board  of  Directors  had  approved 
a  buyback  of  equity  shares.  The  Executive 
Director  of  the  company  was  in  possession 
of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information 
(UPSI) concerning the proposed buyback. The 
suspected entities - the mother-in-law and the 
sister-in-law  of  the  Executive  Director  had 
traded  in  the  shares  of  the  company  during 
the UPSI period, while in possession of UPSI. 
The orders used to be received on behalf of the 
suspected entities from the Executive Director 
and from entities who are all family members of 
the Executive Director. It was observed that the

funds for trading in the scrip of the company 
were provided to the suspected entities by the 
Executive  Director.  An  Ad-Interim  Ex-Parte 
order had been passed against the said entities 
for impounding alleged unlawful gains.

 A listed company informed the stock exchanges 
that  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  (WOS)  has 
signed a definitive agreement to sell its 100 per 
cent shareholding in its WOS (target company) 
to a WOS of another listed company. At first, 
target  company  approached  buyer  company 
with  a  proposal  seeking  loan  facility  against 
securities.  The  said  proposal  ultimately 
culminated in sale of target company. Certain 
entities,  who  were  privy  to  the  unpublished 
price sensitive information (UPSI) concerning 
the  sale  of  a  subsidiary,  traded  in  the  shares 
of the company during UPSI period. Further, 
the  Non-Executive  Director  of  the  company 
and  immediate  relative  of  the  Non-Executive 
Director  had  traded  in  the  shares  of  the 
company  during  the  UPSI  period,  when  in 
possession  of  UPSI.  The  company  had  not 
closed  trading  window  with  respect  to  the 
UPSI. An Ad-Interim Ex-Parte order had been 
passed  against  the  Non-Executive  Director 
of  the  company  and  immediate  relative  of 
the  Non-Executive  Director  for  impounding 
alleged wrongful gains.

 INFORMATION CALLED FROM, INSPECTIONS UNDERTAKEN, INQUIRIES 
AND  AUDITS  OF  STOCK  EXCHANGES  AND  INTERMEDIARIES  AND  
SELF- REGULATING ORGANIZATIONS CONDUCTED BY SEBI

 
Supervision of intermediaries through on-site 
and off-site inspections, enquiries and adjudications 
in  case  of  violation  of  rules  and  regulations  and 
administrative  and  statutory  actions  are  essential 
features  of  effective  enforcement  by  SEBI.  The 
basic objective of prudential supervision of market 
intermediaries  is  to  safeguard  the  stability  of  the 
financial  system;  protecting  client  interests  from 
undue  risks  of  losses  that  may  arise  from  failure, 
fraud  or  any  opportunist  behaviour  on  the  part 
of 
the  efficient 
performance  of  intermediaries  and  markets;  and 
ensuring compliance by market intermediaries. SEBI 
conducts  inspections  directly  as  well  as  through 
organizations like stock exchanges and depositories. 
Inspections were also conducted during the year to 
verify intermediaries’ compliance levels.

With  the  objective  of  having  oversight  on 
the activities carried out by the MIIs, such as stock 
exchanges,  clearing  corporations  and  depositories, 
SEBI has conducted inspections, periodic compliance 
analysis  and  annual  system  audits  of  various  MIIs 
over the period of years.

A.  Oversight of Stock Exchanges

During  the  oversight  of  stock  exchanges,  a 
 
review of market operations, organizational structure 
and  administrative  control  of  a  stock  exchange  is 
conducted  through  inspections  to  ascertain  as  to 
whether:

a) 

 It provides a fair, equitable , transparent and 
growing market to investors,

b) 

c) 

d) 

 Its  organization  system  and  practices  are  in 
accordance with the SC(R) Act , 1956 and the 
rules framed thereunder,

 It has implemented the directions, guidelines 
and  instructions  issued  by  SEBI/Government 
of India (GoI) from time to time, and

 It  has  complied  with  the  conditions,  if  any, 
imposed on it at the time of renewal/ grant of 
its  recognition  under  Section  4  of  the  SC(R) 
Act, 1956/grant of its recognition under Section 
4 of the SC(R) Act, 1956.

During  2018-19,  comprehensive 
inspection  of 
Metropolitan  Stock  Exchange  of  India  Limited 
(MSEI),  National  Stock  Exchange  of  India  Limited 
(NSE), India International Exchange (IFSC) Limited 
and NSE IFSC Limited were carried out by Market 
Regulation  Department  of  SEBI.  Inspection  of  BSE 
Ltd. has started from March 01, 2019 and the same 
is in progress.

B.  Oversight of Clearing Corporations (CCs)

 
During 2018-19, comprehensive inspections of 
the NSE Clearing Limited (NCL) (formerly known as 
National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  Limited), 
the  Indian  Clearing  Corporation  Limited  (ICCL) 
the Metropolitan Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. 
(MCCIL),  India  International  Clearing  Corporation 
(IFSC) Limited and NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation

Annual  System  Audit  of  MIIs  such  as  Stock

have  been  formulated  in  consultation  with  SEBI-

The number of inspections conducted during 
 
the financial year 2018-19 stands at 273. Selection of 
intermediaries for carrying out inspections is based 
on factors such as risk assessment of the intermediary, 
complaints 
intermediary, 
whether  the  intermediary  has  made  submissions 
in  compliance  with  circulars  etc.  Special  purpose 
inspections  based  on  specific  inputs  received  were 
also conducted from time to time.

intermediaries, 
intermediaries  were  specifically  advised  about  the 
areas  where  improvement  was  required  by  them. 
Intermediaries  were  also  required  to  report  to 
SEBI about the corrective steps taken by them and 
also  place  the  same  before  their  board/  partners/ 
proprietor, as the case may be. These steps taken by 
SEBI have improved the level of compliance among 
the intermediaries. Administrative and quasi-judicial 
actions  were  initiated  based  on  the  deficiencies 
and  seriousness  of  the  violations  committed  by 
the  intermediaries.  Observations  pertaining  to  non 
– compliance of market intermediaries with Anti – 
Money  Laundering  norms  are  being  shared  with 
FIU – IND.

 
During  the  financial  year  2018-19,  159  stock 
brokers  have  been  inspected.  The  focus  of  the 
inspections included themes such as compliance of 
norms  regarding  Investor  Redressal  Mechanism, 
Handling of funds and securities of clients, Settlement 
of accounts of clients on timely basis, Segregation of 
clients  and  proprietary  funds/  securities,  Pledging 
of  securities  by  the  broker,  KYC  norms,  Clearing 
operations,  etc..  During  this  financial  year,  apart 
from  specific  purpose  inspections,  the  focus  has 
been  on  comprehensive  and  combined  inspections 
of  stock  brokers  and  depository  participants. 
These  inspections  were  conducted  jointly  with  the 
respective  Stock  Exchanges  and  Depositories  for 
ensuring  that  all  aspects  of  the  functioning  of  the 
entity  are  looked  into  by  Exchanges/  Depositories 
and  SEBI  simultaneously,  resulting  in  conduct 
of  comprehensive  inspections  in  true  sense.  This 
initiative  of 
inspections  also  minimized 
multiple  inspections  of  the  same  entity  by  SEBI/ 
Stock  Exchanges/  Depositories  during  the  year, 
thereby 
regulatory  burden  on 
intermediaries in relation to their inspection. During 
inspections, the compliance of specific provisions of 
SEBI regulations/ circulars was verified.

SEBI  Board  in  its  meeting  held  on  June  21,

an  intermediary  to  be  registered  with  SEBI.  Vide 
circular dated August 3, 2018, it was informed to the 
market that no fresh registration would be granted 
to  sub  –  brokers  and  sub  –  brokers  were  advised 
to migrate to act as an Authorized Person/ trading 
member by March 31, 2019, failing which they shall 
be deemed to have surrendered their registration as 
a sub – broker with SEBI. Consequently, inspection 
of Sub – brokers was discontinued from the financial 
year  2018  –  19.  The  details  of  inspection  of  stock 
brokers  and  sub-brokers  carried  out  are  given  in

The  stock  exchanges  carried  out  inspections 
as per policy adopted by them in consultation with 
SEBI. Additionally, stock brokers/ clearing members 
are required to carry out complete internal audit on 
a  half  yearly  basis  by  independent  auditors.  Stock 
exchanges are levying penalties for delay in filing the 
internal audit reports by stock brokers.

The system of internal audits of stock brokers 
 
by  outside  professionals, 
inspections  by  stock 
exchanges and by SEBI has improved the compliance 
level of stock brokers.

Inspection of Other Intermediaries

Risk  based  and  special  focus  inspections  of 
 
intermediaries are undertaken by SEBI to ascertain 
the  extent  of  compliance  on  specific  issues.  SEBI 
has  been  carrying  out  comprehensive/  thematic 

inspections of debenture trustees, merchant bankers, 
credit  rating  agencies  and  debenture  trustees  to 
check the due diligence exercised by them.

 
During  2018-19,  inspections  were  conducted 
for 82 depository participants, 16 merchant bankers, 
3  debenture  trustees,  2  credit  rating  agencies  and 
11 registrars to issue & share transfer agent (RTIs &

A  risk  based  inspection  policy  has  been 
adopted by SEBI for inspection of Mutual Funds. The 
inspection is undertaken on the basis of various risk 
parameters such as liquidity risk, credit risk, financial 
risk, market risk, technological risk, operation risk etc. 
and impact parameters such as AUM (Assets Under 
Management) of the Mutual fund, Retail AUM, etc. 
During  2018-19,  comprehensive  inspection  of  22 
Mutual Funds were initiated. Further, a theme based 
inspection  of  6  Mutual  Funds  was  initiated  during

Automation of inspection and surveillance of MFs : 
A project is currently underway to ingest MF related 
data  in  SEBI  database  and  develop  algorithms  in 
order to generate instances of breaches of regulatory 
guidelines  by  MFs  along-with  alerts  on  possible 
non-compliances.  This  project  will  enable  SEBI  to 
leverage technology to move towards automation of 
inspections of Mutual Funds.

11.  SURVEILLANCE

Effective surveillance of the securities market is a  
 
pre-requisite  for  maintaining  market  integrity  to 
enhance  investor  confidence.  The  stock  exchanges 
are on the frontline as far as real time surveillance 
of  the  market  segments  that  they  operate  in  are 
concerned.  SEBI  is  responsible  for  the  surveillance 
of  all  the  segments  of  the  Indian  securities  market 
across  the  exchanges.  Over  the  years,  various 
amendments to the SEBI Act, 1992 have empowered 
SEBI to undertake credible surveillance action.

 
Complementing the surveillance infrastructure 
of  the  stock  exchanges,  SEBI  has  robust  in-house 
systems  in  place  to  monitor  activities  across  all 
market segments and exchanges and to check unfair 
trade  practices  like  market  manipulation,  front 
running  and  insider  trading.  The  Joint  Fund-Bank 
Financial  Sector  Assessment  Programme  of  India 
noted  that  building  a  robust  market  surveillance 

system,  among  others,  allowed  SEBI  to  build  a 
reputation of being a credible enforcement agency.

I. 

SURVEILLANCE ACTIONS

 
SEBI  and  the  stock  exchanges  have  robust 
surveillance  mechanisms  in  place  to  track  the 
activities  on  the  stock  exchange  platform  and  to 
generate  alerts  based  on  dynamic,  system-based 
parameters.  The  stock  exchanges  apprise  SEBI  of 
surveillance  concerns  and  actions  at  the  regular 
surveillance meetings. The stock exchanges initiate 
surveillance measures, like the periodic price bands, 
shifting to Trade-for-Trade (TfT), tightening the price 
bands, etc., on the basis of the alerts and the analysis 
of  trading  in  the  scrips.  The  stock  exchanges  also 
take  punitive  actions  (suspension  of  the  trading  in 
the scrips, debarment of the suspected entities, etc.). 
Details  of  actions  taken  by  the  Stock  Exchanges  is 
given in Table 3.43:

SURVEILLANCE MEASURES :

	Surveillance Measures in Futures & Options 
(F&O) segment

 Surveillance Measures taken from a Systemic 
Stability perspective

 

Over  the  years,  there  has  been  a  significant 

segment  with  no 

increase  in  open  interest  and  turnover  in  the 
derivatives 
corresponding 
increase in the turnover, delivery volumes and net 
funds  pay-in  obligation  in  the  underlying  Cash 
Market.  Derivatives  market  has  been  growing 
disproportionately as compared to the cash market 
which may pose systemic risk to market. Considering 

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

149

this and the adequacy of minimum margins, it was 
decided  in  consultation  with  the  stock  exchanges, 
to  put  in  place  following  Additional  Surveillance 
Margin (ASM) on all gross open positions on futures 
contracts and on short positions in options contracts:

 
In  previous  financial  year,  ASM  was  levied 
based on hypothetical scenario of market fall by 20 
per cent. In addition, to address the systemic risks 
associated with market rise, ASM based on a scenario 
of market rise by 17.74 per cent was levied to recover 
50 per cent losses of top loss making clients.

 
Further, it was decided to increase the margin 
across  markets  instead  of  client  specific  margins. 
Hence, the total minimum initial margin on the index 
derivatives  was  increased  by  2  per  cent  in  case  of 
index futures (i.e., from 8 per cent to 10 per cent) and 
by 4 per cent in case of index options (i.e., from 6 per 
cent to 10 per cent). In the case of stock derivatives it 
was increased by 5 per cent (i.e., from 12 per cent to 
17 per cent). The additional surveillance margin was 
an interim measure which was subsequently taken 
as a policy input by Market Regulation Department 
(MRD) and necessary circular was issued.

2. 

 Deep  In  the  money  (ITM)  and  deep  out  of 
money (OTM) contracts

 
Positions  in  deep  ITM  and  OTM  illiquid 
derivative  contracts  can  be  misutilised  for  the 
purpose  of  financing  transactions  and  profit/loss 
transfer,  etc.  through  exchange  platform.  In  a  very 
basic financing transaction that may be executed on 
the exchange platform, lender and borrower would 
enter  into  illiquid  index/stock  option  transactions 
wherein  the  borrower  would  write  illiquid  option 
contracts  (such  as  NIFTY  option  contracts  with 
strike  price  of  5000  and  June  /  December  expiry) 
and the lender would buy such option contracts by 
paying  the  premium.  Thus,  the  borrower  receives 
the  amount  in  form  of  option  premium  from  the 
lender. Clearing corporations, as a risk management 

measure, block Net Option Value from collateral of 
the option writer.

 
Therefore, to curtail such transactions, it was 
decided  that  net  option  value  of  contracts  having 
strike price away from closing value of index/stock 
derivatives shall be payable only in the form of cash.

B.	

	Additional  Surveillance  Measures  in  Cash 
segment

 
Additional Surveillance Measures (ASM) in the 
cash market were introduced by SEBI as preventive 
measures  in  March  2018  to  achieve  the  following 
objectives:

•	

•	

•	

•	

investors  before 

	Cautioning 
in 
certain  stocks  that  have  seen  unusual  price 
movements.

investing 

	Reducing scope for manipulation by restricting 
price movements

	Reducing excessive leverage in such stocks by 
mandating 100 per cent upfront margin

	Reducing excessive speculation by increasing 
delivery-based trades

The  parameters  of  ASM  framework  are 
 
based  on  surveillance  concerns,  viz.,  price/volume 
variation  and  client  concentration,  etc.  The  stocks 
across various market capitalizations, i.e., Low/Mid/
High cap, are covered under ASM framework. The 
entry/exit  parameters  along  with  thresholds  have 
been made available in the public domain.

 
Considering the trends in the broader market 
and  to  have  a  dynamic  surveillance  approach,  the 
ASM  framework  has  been  regularly  reviewed.  A 
working group was constituted to review the ASM 
framework  and  based  on  the  recommendations 
of  the  working  group,  the  ASM  framework  was 
rationalized.

The  revised 

 
two-
pronged  approach  to  take  timely  surveillance 

framework 

follows  a

action  on  the  surveillance  concerns  in  the  short-
term  (~  5  and  15  trading  days)  and  long-term 
(~  3  months  to  1  year)  period.  Therefore,  under 
the  revised  framework,  stocks  are  shortlisted  for 
immediate  short  term  surveillance  actions  as  well 
as  long  term  surveillance  actions  based  on  the 
short  term/long  term  surveillance  concerns.  The 
surveillance  actions  under  the  revised  framework 
follow a stage-wise approach. At each stage, actions 
become  more  stringent  in  terms  of  higher  margin, 
client specific margins, lower price bands and Trade 
for Trade settlement.

C.	

	Additional  Margins 
levied  by  Stock 
Exchanges and Clearing Corporations based 
on intra-day price movements: Cash market 
and F&O market

 
In light of volatility observed in the market on 
September 21, 2018, Stock Exchanges and Clearing 
Corporations  were  advised  to 
levy  minimum 
margin (i.e., VaR + Extreme Loss Margin + additional 
margin) that shall not be less than the highest intra-
day  price  movement  in  last  1/6  calendar  month(s). 
Such  margin  is  applicable  on  stocks  which  have 
witnessed  more  than  10  per  cent  movements  on 
any 3/10 trading days in last 1/6 calendar month(s). 
This  minimum  margin  is  applicable  in  both  Cash 
and F&O segment and is continued for a minimum 
period of 3/12 months on rolling basis ending with 
the  expiry  of  the  respective  month.  Also,  Stock 
Exchanges and Clearing Corporations were advised 
to  take  additional  suitable  measures,  as  deemed 
appropriate, to mitigate risk arising from intra-day 
volatility in stock prices.

Following  surveillance  measures  have  been 

 
taken during 2018-19:

A.   Revised  Commodity  Watch  System  (CWS): 
SEBI  has  prescribed  a  Commodity  Watch 

152

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

System  (CWS) 
to  Commodity  Derivative 
Exchanges  which  contains  base  surveillance 
alerts  and  monitoring  requirements.  During 
2018-19, in order to strengthen the indicators 
for the detection of potential illegal or improper 
activity,  new  alerts  and  surveillance  reports 
have been added in the revised CWS.
 Review  of  Concentration  Margin  Policy: 
As  per  SEBI  circular,  Commodity  Derivative 
Exchanges  are  required  to  have  a  policy  to 
impose  the  concentration  margins  (only  on 
concentrated  positions)  to  cover  the  risk  of 
longer  period  required  for  liquidation  of 
concentrated  positions  in  any  commodity 
derivative  contract.  During  2018-19,  a  review 
of the policy was undertaken by the exchanges 
to  factor  in  the  nature  of  the  commodity  i.e. 
agricultural and non-agricultural. The further 
classification  of  Agricultural  Commodities 
has been done as per the SEBI guidelines viz., 
Broad,  Narrow  and  Sensitive  Commodities; 
and  a  higher  percentage  of  concentration 
margin  has  been  prescribed  for  Sensitive 
and  Narrow  Commodities  at  the  client  level. 
Further,  hedgers  have  been  exempted  from 
levy  of  concentration  margins  for  positions 
held in hedge code.
 Surveillance  Meetings  with  Exchanges: 
SEBI conducts monthly surveillance meetings 
with  the  senior  officials  of  the  exchanges  to 
monitor  the  trading  activities  at  Commodity 
Derivative Exchanges. The meetings are aimed 
at  discussing  various  recent  developments 
in the market and surveillance concerns; and 
required  actions  to  address  the  surveillance 
concerns.
 Warehouse  Inspections:  On  the  basis  of  past 
experiences, warehouse inspections have been 
conducted  in  the  major  commodities  by  the 

B.

D. 

Exchanges in order to monitor the functioning 
and operations of the warehouses. In addition, 
SEBI has conducted surprise visits to some of 
these exchange accredited warehouses during 
2018-19; and arising out of these visits, various 
suggestions have been made to the exchanges 
about record keeping, infrastructure, etc.
 Policy 
for  Depositors  of  Commodities 
having  high  percentage  of  rejection:  In 
order  to  encourage  commodity  deposits  at 
exchange  accredited  warehouses  which  meet 
the  exchange 
specifications,  Commodity 
Derivative  Exchanges/Clearing  Corporations 
have  framed  a  policy  to  warn  the  depositors 
who  frequently  bring  commodities  which  do 
not  meet  exchange  specifications.  Exchanges 
identify such depositors and initiate actions on 
depositors with repeated instances.
 Revision of penalty for non-genuine trades: 
In  order  to  address  the  issue  of  non-genuine 
trades  emerging  from  reversal  of  trades,  the 
penalty norms were revised to 100 per cent of 
the profit made / loss incurred / transferred as 
a result of such trades.
 Market  Intelligence:  SEBI  has  initiated  the 
process  of  gathering  market  intelligence  by 
visiting the physical markets of Commodities 
traded  at  exchange  platforms.  During  the 
year,  based  on  the  feedback  received  from 
the  physical  market  participants,  derivative 
contracts of Mentha Oil at MCX and Turmeric 
at  NCDEX  were  reviewed  and  suitably 
modified.
 Major  Govt.  announcements  at  Exchanges’ 
websites:  Pursuant  to  the  discussions  in 
the  Surveillance  meetings,  the  Commodity 
Derivative Exchanges have started displaying 
commodity  wise 
significant  government 
announcements  on  their  websites  for  ease  of 
reference by investors.

/  Special  margins 
payable on buy and sell positions: During the 
financial year 2018-19, the prices of commodity

to  be  volatile  in  comparison  with  their  spot 
prices. In order to deal with the high volatility 

in  derivative  contracts  and  to  maintain  the 
integrity of the market, Commodity Derivative 
Exchanges  have  taken  regulatory  measures

12.  INVESTIGATION

Investigation  is  at  the  forefront  of  the  various 
regulatory functions. SEBI undertakes investigation 
in  the  fulfilment  of  one  of  its  core  objectives  of 
protecting  investors’  interests  and  ensuring  fair, 
transparent and orderly functioning of the securities 
market.  Investigation  should  serve  as  a  potent 
means in dealing with various irregularities thereby 
strengthening  the  confidence  of  the  investors  in 
the  integrity  of  the  securities  market.  Importance 
of  effective  and  credible  use  of  investigation  has 
also been underscored by IOSCO in its “Principles 
for  the  Enforcement  of  Securities  Regulation”. 
SEBI,  therefore,  constantly  strives  to  upgrade  its 
investigative  skills  by  making  use  of  Information 
Technology  (IT)  /  automation  and  other  latest 
investigative  tools.  SEBI  performs  its  role  with  the 
objective of timely completion of investigation cases, 
causing  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive 
action in cases of violations of securities laws.

A. 

B. 

 Initiation  of  Investigations:  SEBI  initiates 
investigation based on reference received from 
sources such as SEBI’s integrated surveillance 
department,  other  operational  departments 
within  SEBI,  and  external  government

involve 
multiple  allegations  of  violations,  water-tight 
classification  under  specific  category  becomes 
difficult. Therefore, cases were classified on the basis 
of main charge / violations.

I. 

ENFORCEMENT FUNCTION

 
Effective  enforcement  lies  at  the  heart  of 
ensuring  integrity,  transparency  and  fairness  in 
the market. It not only leads to a better compliance 
culture  but  also  underscores  the  point  that  market 
misconduct  and  abuse  will  not  go  unpunished. 
A  credible  enforcement  strategy  underpins  the 
importance  of  consistent,  timely  and  transparent 
regulatory  outcomes  which  are  proportionate, 
dissuasive  and  effective.  Under  the  SEBI  Act, 
1992;  SCRA,  1956;  and  the  Depositories  Act,  1996 
SEBI  broadly  pursues  two  streams  of  enforcement 
action,  that  is,  administrative/civil  or  criminal. 
Administrative/civil 
issuing 
directions such as remedial orders, cease and desist 
orders,  suspension  or  cancellation  of  certificates  of 
registration  and  imposition  of  monetary  penalties 
under respective statutes. Proceedings of a criminal 
nature  involve  initiating  prosecution  proceedings 
against violators by filing criminal complaints before 
a competent court.

PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

Box 3.1: Extraterritorial recovery through Federal Court of Australia in the matter of PACL

SEBI vide its order dated August 22, 2014 inter alia, directed PACL to wind up the existing schemes and 
1.  
refund ` 49,100 crore collected by it along with returns due to the investors as per the terms of the schemes. 
Upon PACL’s failure to comply with the aforesaid direction, recovery proceedings were initiated wherein 
Recovery Officer, SEBI had issued Certificate No. 832 of 2015 dated December 11, 2015 against PACL and its 
promoters/directors for recovery of a sum of ` 49,100 crore along with promised returns, further interest, all 
costs, charges and expenses, etc. In furtherance of the same, SEBI filed a claim petition before Federal Court 
of Australia (FCA) for claiming the assets acquired out of the money mobilized by PACL and diverted to 
Australia (Hotel Sheraton Mirage situated at Gold Coast and two properties at Sanctuary Cove, Australia) 
upon  rejection  of  its  intervention  application  in  a  proceeding  filed  by  Janlok  Pratisthan  Sanghatana,  an 
investor group (Janlok). Trial of claim petition filed by SEBI and petition filed by Janlok before the FCA in the 
matter was concluded in April 2018. SEBI had claimed that the assets under litigation or their sale proceeds 
are  to  be  held  on  trust  for  the  Indian  investors  in  PACL  and  be  released  to  SEBI.  The  FCA  pronounced 
judgment in the matter on July 20, 2018, inter alia, holding as under:

(i). 

  that SEBI conducted the proceedings with commendable efficiency;

(ii). 

  that  FCA  adopted  the  report  submitted  by  Justice  Ian  Callinan,  former  judge  of  High  Court  of 
Australia, who was appointed as a Referee by the FCA to opine on the issue of SEBI’s locus standi in 
the matter as a question of foreign law. The report observed that SEBI has full right, interest, power 
and authority to seek a relief in Australia;

(iii).    that after analysing the scheme pursuant to which PACL collected funds from Indian investors and 
relying on the report of Justice Ian Callinan, FCA concluded that the scheme operated by PACL is 
indeed a “collective investment scheme” and that the monies received by PACL from Indian investors 
are on trust for those investors;

(iv).    that the monies mobilised from the investors was transferred by PACL to Pearls Infrastructure Projects 
Ltd. (PIPL) and other entities and ultimately to Australia and that such transfers were in breach of 
trust;

(v). 

  that the trust monies were received by MiiResorts and MiiGroup and could be traced to the properties 
under litigation in Australia. Therefore, the investors would have a claim over such assets. Accordingly, 
the  balance  proceeds  held  in  the  bank  account  of  McCullough  Robertson  is  held  on  trust  for  the 
Indian investors;

(vi).    that  FCA  proposed  to  adopt  a  refund  scheme  with  maximum  efficiency  and  minimum  cost  of 
distribution. Since Janlok had submitted an alternate scheme of refund to be administered in Australia, 
the matter was adjourned for further discussion in the case management hearing to be held on July 23, 
2018.

2. 
Pursuant to pronouncing the judgment, during the case management hearing on July 23, 2018, SEBI 
and Janlok made submissions on the appropriate form of reliefs that could be granted by FCA. SEBI sought 
release of the money to it for distribution based on the facts such as commencement of refund process by 
the  Supreme  Court  of  India  appointed  Committee,  logical  advantage  over  any  other  possible  scheme  of 
distribution, cost effectiveness, etc. Hence, Janlok’s alternate scheme of distribution to be administered in 
Australia was abandoned during the hearing. Issues such as appointment of receiver for the Sanctuary Cove 
properties, determination of costs payable to SEBI and Janlok, etc. were also argued during the hearing.
3. 
the following directions:
(i). 

After considering the submissions of SEBI and Janlok, FCA passed order dated July 23, 2018 issuing 

The balance money held in the trust account (remaining after pay-out to the Australian Taxation Office 
and MiiResorts) and the Sanctuary Cove properties are held on trust for all investors of PACL, who are 
not refunded in full;

(ii).  Mr. Steven Staatz was appointed as a receiver for the sale of Sanctuary Cove properties and deposit of 

proceeds to the trust account;

(iii).  For the purpose of deciding the amount that may be paid out of the trust account to SEBI and Janlok 
towards costs incurred for protecting the properties under litigation, Ms Janet Claire McDonald was 
appointed as a Referee for conducting an inquiry for ascertaining the amount properly and reasonably 
incurred by Janlok and SEBI in relation to the proceedings;

(iv).  To ensure that the funds currently held on trust are ultimately distributed to investors with as little 
deduction for SEBI’s procuring and administering costs as possible, SEBI was directed to file a report 
in relation to the proposed distribution scheme.

4.  
In line with the aforesaid judgment, out of sale of properties at Australia so far, an amount of AUD 
72.24 million is available in the trust account after deductions of levies, council rates, stamp duty and other 
expenses.

5. 
The property in Mont Albert, Victoria was not a part of the earlier proceedings. Therefore, the same 
remained to be the subject of a separate tracing exercise as to whether sufficient evidence could be obtained 
for tracing the funds purportedly used to acquire the said property back to the investors’ funds. At the case 
management hearing on July 23, 2018, FCA indicated its willingness to allow SEBI to obtain the necessary 
evidence (including by subpoena, if necessary) to enable SEBI to undertake a tracing exercise. SEBI has now 
appointed a forensic expert in this regard and the matter is pending before FCA.

Recovery proceedings in the matter of Pancard Clubs Ltd.

In addition to the attachment of immovable properties of Pancard Clubs Ltd. (PCL) vide order dated December 
21, 2016, attachment of movable properties available at eight premises of PCL and its directors was made 
simultaneously. Vehicles, jewellery and other movable assets were attached and the attached vehicles were 
auctioned subsequently. Further attachment of immovable assets of PCL was made vide order dated April 
16, 2018. Possession was handed over to the successful purchasers who had bought properties in auctions till 
date by evicting occupants having adverse possession in those auctioned properties. In pursuance of Hon’ble 
SAT’s order directing reconsideration of attachment of assets of Panoramic Universal Ltd., a subsidiary of 
PCL, another order confirming the said attachment was passed on August 21, 2018. An appeal challenging 
the said order is pending before Hon’ble SAT.

In the meantime, the immovable properties thus attached were put up for auction four times, i.e., vide notices 
dated April 9, 2018(5th auction), May 23, 2018(6th auction), July 18, 2018(7th auction) and September 18, 2018 
(8th auction). Consecutive auctions were held for the reason that the properties failed to attract bidders and 
remained unsold in earlier auctions.

In the eight auctions so far, fifteen immovable properties were sold and a total amount of ` 110 crore (approx.) 
was realized. However, prior to issuance of confirmation of sale to the successful purchasers, Hon’ble High 
Court of Bombay in Writ Petition No.12998 of 2018 had vide an ex-parte order stayed confirmation of sale 
pursuant to auctions conducted in eighth auction. Later, after hearing SEBI, Hon’ble High Court vide order 
dated  January  9,  2019  had  permitted  the  purchasers  to  take  possession  of  the  auctioned  properties  and 
directed to maintain ‘status quo’ till further directions. The aforesaid writ petition is pending before Hon’ble 
High Court of Bombay.

Regulations, 2018

 The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
(Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2009 (“ICDR Regulations”) have 
been  amended  on  various  occasions  since  its 
notification.  Further,  a  number  of  informal 
guidance/  interpretative  letters  have  been 
issued by SEBI regarding the interpretation of 
the  provisions  of  the  ICDR  Regulations.  The 
market practices and regulatory environment 
have  changed  over  a  period  of  time  and 
different types of offerings to raise funds in the 
primary market have also been introduced.

 In  view  of  the  above,  it  was  felt  to  review 
and  realign  the  ICDR  Regulations  with  the 
developments and to ensure that they reflect the 
best  practices  adopted  globally.  Accordingly, 
SEBI  constituted  an  Expert  Group  consisting 
of  market  participants 
the 
language and complexities in the regulations, 
to  incorporate  changes/  new  requirements 
which have occurred due to change in market 
practices  and  regulatory  environment  and  to 
make the regulations more readable and easier 
to understand.

to  simplify 

 The recommendation of the Expert Group was 
considered  by  the  Primary  Market  Advisory 
Committee  and  upon  receipt  of  public 
comments,  SEBI  notified  the  Securities  and 
Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and 
Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009

 update  the  references  to  the  Companies  Act, 
2013/ other new SEBI Regulations,

 incorporate  the  circulars,  Frequently  Asked 
Questions  (FAQs)  and  informal  guidance  in

SEBI  notified  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Board  of  India  ((Buy-back  of  Securities)

Regulations, 2018

 The new ICDR Regulations have been amended 
twice since coming into force on September 11, 
2018. The amendments are as follows:

 Amendment Notification dated December 31, 
2018: Amendment to Regulation 253 of ICDR 
Regulations  by  adding  a  similar  provision  to 
Regulation 32(4) of ICDR Regulations to enable 
allocation in the net offer for issues made other 
than through book building process in the IPO 
Offerings in the SME segment. Further, in case 
of an Offer for sale, change in the number of 
shares offered for sale may be permitted upto 
50  per  cent  without  requiring  fresh  filing, 
irrespective of the issue size.

  Rationale: SME IPO issues can either be book 
built issues or issues made other than through 
book  building  process,  i.e.  fixed  price  issues. 
However,  provision  for  IPO  Offerings  in  the 
SME segment is presently only for book built 
issues. In the SME Segment, many issues are 
made through the fixed price method and thus, 
creating  an  enabling  provision  for  allocation 
in  the  net  offer  for  fixed  price  issues  would

facilitate  fund  raising  by  SMEs.  Further,  the 
Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) 
recommended that change may be permitted 
upto  50  per  cent  of  shares  offered  for  sale, 
only in case of offer for sale component of IPO 
offerings,  irrespective  of  the  issue  size  and 
accordingly fresh filing may not be required in 
such cases and that fresh filing would continue 
to be a requirement where there is a variance 
in  issue  size  of  fresh  issues  (excluding  OFS 
component) by more than 20 per cent.

 Amendment  Notification  dated  March 
29,  2019:  The  amendment  inter  alia  takes 
into  account  the  changes  brought  in  by  the 
Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code  and  the 
revisions made by RBI in its debt restructuring 
guidelines  and  confines  the  exemption  from 
lock-in  only  to  lenders  converting  their  debt 
to  equity  under  such  revised  guidelines 
or  to  a  resolution  plan  approved  by  the 
Adjudicating Authority under the Insolvency 
and Bankruptcy Code and the exemption from 
lock-in in preferential issue of shares available 
to  new  investors  who  purchase  equity  from 
lenders  pursuant  to  debt  restructuring  has 
been removed.

 Rationale:  The  amendments  are  pursuant

transactions,  amendments  are  accordingly 
being made to the regulations to harmonize the 
period  of  preserving  records  and  documents 
for eight years.

(10)    Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
(Registrars  to  an  Issue  and  Share  Transfer 
Agents) Regulations, 1993

The regulations have been amended twice this 

 
year and the amendments are as follows:

1. 

 

2. 

 

 Amendment  Notification  dated  May  30, 
2018: Amendment in regulation 14(1) and 15, 
wherein, the word “three” shall be substituted 
with the word “eight”.

 Rationale:  Since  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Board  of  India  (Listing  Obligations  and 
Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015 
requires that listed companies are to preserve 
records and documents for a minimum period 
of  eight  years  after  completion  of  relevant 
transactions,  amendments  are  accordingly 
being made to the regulations to harmonize the 
period  of  preserving  records  and  documents 
for eight years.

 Amendment Notification dated June 08, 2018: 
Amendment to mandate transfer of securities 
only in dematerialized mode.

 Rationale:  The  amendment 
to  mandate 
transfer  of  securities  only  in  dematerialized 
mode  was  to  make  it  easier  and  safer  for 
the  investors  as  this  would  prevent  loss  in 
transit, bad deliveries, fake securities, delays, 
mutilation, thefts etc.

(11)    Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 

(Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999

The regulations have been amended twice this 

 
year and the amendments are as follows:

1. 

 

2. 

 

 Amendment Notification dated May 30, 2018: 
Amendment  to  include  FATF  membership 
as  a  requirement  for  a  foreign  credit  rating 
agency, increasing minimum net worth from 5 
crore to 25 crore and for credit rating agencies 
not  to  carry  on  any  other  activity  other  than 
credit rating of securities unless required by a 
financial sector regulator as defined under the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

 Rationale:  It  was  felt  necessary  for  a  foreign 
credit rating agency to have FATF membership. 
Further,  credit  rating  agencies  have  been 
carrying  out  activities  by  RBI  and  other 
financial sector regulators and therefore, it was 
felt necessary to clarify the same.

 Amendment  Notification  dated  September 
11,  2018:  Amendment  to  regulation  9(f)  to 
make it more stringent and limit the activities 
of credit rating agencies permitted by financial 
sector  regulators  to  only  rating  of  financial 
instruments and not any other activity.

 Rationale:  Prior  to  this  amendment,  credit 
rating  agencies  could  engage  in  any  other 
activity  as  may  be  required  by  a  financial 
sector regulator. The amendment has made it 
more stringent and has limited other activities 
permitted  by  financial  sector  regulators  to 
rating of financial instruments only.

14,  2018:  Amendment 
the  definition 
of  “acquirer”,  “public  shareholders”,

public  shareholders  and  participation  in  the 
reverse  book  building  process  by  holders  of 
depository receipts, restrictions in compulsory 
delisting of a company by stock exchanges and 
clarifications on shareholding.

 Rationale: Amendments were pursuant to the 
recommendations  by  the  Primary  Advisory 
Committee  of  SEBI  and  also  pursuant  to  a 
review  carried  out  by  an  external  expert, 
Shri P.K. Malhotra, former member Securities 
Appellate  Tribunal  and  former  Secretary, 
Ministry of Law and Justice. The review was 
aimed  at  simplifying  the  language,  updating 
the  references  to  the  Companies  Act,  2013/ 
other new SEBI Regulations, and incorporating 
the relevant circular(s), FAQs in the Delisting 
Regulations, without making any substantive 
policy change.

(13)    Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
(Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and

The regulations have been amended four times 

 
this year and the amendments are as follows:

obligation under proviso to sub-regulation (2) of 
regulation 3 if such acquisition is pursuant to a 
resolution plan approved under section 31 of the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC).

shares/voting 

 Rationale: Acquisition pursuant to a resolution 
plan under the IBC may take the shareholding 
beyond 75 per cent. Acquirer was not entitled 
to  acquire  or  enter  into  any  agreement  to 
acquire 
exceeding 
such  number  of  shares  as  would  take  the 
aggregate  shareholding  pursuant 
the 
acquisition  above  the  maximum  permissible 
non-public  shareholding.  This  amendment 
exempts acquisition under IBC plan from this 
prohibition.

 Amendment  Notification  dated  September 
11, 2018: Amendment to grant additional time 
for upward revision of open offer price till one 
working day before the commencement of the 
tendering  period.  Further,  the  definition  of 
“fugitive economic offender”, “list regulations” 
and “postal ballot” have been inserted in the 
regulations, and the word “listing agreement” 
wherever occurring has been replaced by the 
word “listing regulations”.

 Rationale: SEBI had earlier issued a discussion 
paper  on  March  28,  2018  soliciting  public 
comments  for  reviewing  the  SEBI  Takeover 
Regulations.  The  amendments  are  mainly 
aimed at simplifying the language, removing 
redundant  provisions  and 
inconsistencies, 
updating the references to the Companies Act, 
2013  and  other  new  SEBI  Regulations,  and 
incorporating  the  relevant  circulars,  FAQs, 
informal guidance in the regulations.

Companies  (HFCs)  or  HFCs  with  asset  size 
of  Rs.500  crore  or  more,  registered  with  the 
National  Housing  Bank;  and  Systemically 
Important Non-Banking Financial Companies 
(NBFCs).

 Rationale:  Under 
the  regulations,  shares 
taken  by  way  of  encumbrance  are  treated  as 
an acquisition and shares given upon release 
of  encumbrance  are  treated  as  a  disposal. 
Such  acquisition  and  disposal  are  required 
to  be  disclosed.  However,  such  disclosure 
requirements  were  not  applicable 
to  a 
scheduled commercial bank or public financial 
institution  as  pledgee  in  connection  with  a 
pledge  of  shares  for  securing  indebtedness 
in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Pursuant 
to  the  amendment,  shares  taken  by  way  of 
encumbrance (or shares given upon release of 
encumbrance)  by  the  said  HFCs  and  NBFCs 
shall not be treated as acquisition (or disposal) 
for  the  purpose  of  disclosure  requirements 
under Regulation 29 of Takeover Regulations.

 Amendment  Notification  dated  March 
29,  2019:  The  exemptions  available  to  debt 
restructuring  approved  by  a  “competent 
authority”  other  than  a  Court  or  Tribunal 
have  been  removed.  Further,  the  exemption 
available to new investors who purchase equity 
from  lenders  pursuant  to  debt  restructuring 
has been removed.

 Rationale:  The  amendment  inter  alia  takes 
into  account  the  changes  brought  in  by  the 
Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code,  2016  and 
the  revisions  made  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of 
India in its debt restructuring guidelines and 
confines the exemption from open offer only to 
lenders converting their debt to equity under 

such revised guidelines or to a resolution plan 
approved by the Adjudicating Authority under 
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

Security Receipts) Regulations, 2008.

 Rationale:  Based  on  the  recommendations 
of  a  committee  consisting  of  representatives 
from Reserve Bank of India, issuers of Security

with respect to sub-brokers in the regulations.

 Rationale:  Under  the  current  regulations 
and  the  procedure  prescribed  by  the  Stock 
Exchanges, there is no difference between role 
and functioning of a Sub-Broker and that of an 
Authorized  Person.  Hence,  it  was  decided  to 
discontinue the category of sub-broker under 
the regulations.

of  agricultural  commodity  derivatives  in  a 
manner  that  would  help  the  stock  exchanges 
to reduce the cost burden on the farmers/FPOs 
under different cost heads such as transaction 
charges,  delivery  fees,  warehouse  charges, 
assaying  charges  etc.  by  way  of  subsidizing 
these costs from the amount that will be saved 
by  them  from  the  reduction  of  regulatory 
fees by SEBI. For this purpose, it was decided 
that  instead  of  levying  regulatory  fee  at  the 
prescribed turn-over based slab rates discussed 
above, a nominal regulatory fee at a flat rate of 
INR  1,00,000  per  stock  exchange,  irrespective 
of  the  aggregate  value  of  the  transactions  on 
agricultural  commodity  derivatives  shall  be

Regulations).

PIT Regulations

1. 

2. 

 Amendments to the PIT Regulations were made 
to  strengthen  transparence  and  enforcement 
aspects  of  the  PIT  regulations,  and  to  bring 
clarity  in  respect  of  certain  regulations  for 
better implementation.

 A  framework  for  institutional  responsibility 
has been created to ensure that the institution 
takes  responsibility  to  formulate  a  code  of 

conduct  and  put  in  place  an  effective  system 
of  internal  controls  to  ensure  compliance 
with  the  various  requirements  specified  in 
the PIT Regulation to prevent insider trading. 
Listed companies are required to have written 
policies and procedures for inquiries into leak 
of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information 
(UPSI)  or  suspected  leak  of  UPSI,  which  are 
duly  approved  by  board  of  directors  of  the 
company, and to have whistle-blower policies 
that  make  it  easy  for  employees  to  report 
instances of leak of UPSI. Further, every listed 
company  /  market  participant  is  required  to 
maintain  an  electronic  record  containing  the 
names of person / entities with whom UPSI is 
shared to facilitate tracing of UPSI.

 Amendments  to  the  PIT  Regulations  were 
made  to  bring  further  clarity  on  sharing  of 
UPSI for due diligence or legitimate purposes. 
Board of directors of listed company or market 
participants  are  now  required  to  define  their 
own policy / definition relating to “legitimate 
purposes” within the contours provided under 
law.

 Certain defences are available to insider who 
trade when in possession of UPSI. Regulation 
4(1)  of  PIT  Regulations  were  amended  to 
extend  the  defence  available  for  off-market 
inter-se  transfers  between  promoters,  who 
were in possession of the same UPSI, to other 
insiders in possession of same UPSI subject to 
disclosure  of  such  transactions,  transactions 
carried  out  through  the  block  deal  window 
mechanism  among  persons  possessing  the 
same  UPSI,  transactions  carried  out  in  a 
bona  fide  manner  pursuant  to  a  statutory  or 
regulatory  obligation  and  for  transactions 
undertaken  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  stock 
options.

(FSAP),  a  joint  programme  of  the  International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), is a 
comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a country’s 
financial sector.

acknowledged  that  SEBI  has  developed,  adopted 
and  implemented  regulatory  policy  in  virtually 
every area of responsibility, and has contributed to 
growth and development of India’s capital markets.

based on which SEBI has introduced reforms such 
as  in  the  commodity  derivatives  market  which 
include  measures  for  increased  participation  from 
a  diverse  set  of  participants,  introduction  of  new 
products, rationalization of cost of trading, steps to

 Engagement with ESMA (European Securities 
and Markets Authority) on EMIR (European 
Market Infrastructure Regulations)

 
The  European  Parliament  and  the  Council 
adopted  EMIR  effective  from August  2012. As  per 
Article 25(1) of the EMIR, “a Central Counter Party 
(CCP)  established  in  third  country  may  provide 
services  to  clearing  members  or  trading  venues 
established  in  the  Union  only  where  the  CCP  is 
recognized  by  ESMA”.  Therefore,  the  securities 
market CCPs established and operating in India have 
to seek recognition from ESMA for clearing trades of 
entities which are originating from European Union 
(EU).

 
One  of  the  preconditions,  for  recognition  of 
Indian CCPs by ESMA was that ESMA had to enter 
into a MoU with the regulator (SEBI) of the CCPs. 
SEBI and ESMA signed the MoU in July 2017.

Clearing  Corporation  Limited  and  The  National

1.  SIGNIFICANT COURT PRONOUNCEMENTS

I. 

A. 

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

 Judgment  dated  14.05.2018  in  C.A.  no. 
16805/2017 - Chintalapati Srinivasa Raju 
Vs SEBI, and other connected appeals.

This	matter	pertains	to	the	Satyam	Scam.	The	

issue  involved  is  whether  appellants  who 
were	 promoters	 and	 directors	 of	 Satyam	
Computer	 Services	 Ltd.	 (“SCSL”),	 were	 liable	 as	
an	 “insider”,	 having	 knowledge	 of	 undisclosed	
price	 sensitive	 information	 (“UPSI”),	 as	 a	 result	 of	
which they stood to gain by selling their shares at an 
inflated	value.	

	
SEBI,	 vide	 an	 Order	 dated	 September	 10,	
2015,	had	debarred	the	appellants	for	a	period	of	7	
years	and	also	directed	them	to	disgorge	unlawful	
gains	as	quantified	therein,	in	respect	of	violations	
of	 securities	 laws	 committed	 by	 them.	 On	 appeal,	
the	 Hon’ble	 SAT	 inter	 alia	 upheld	 the	 findings	 of	
SEBI	 that	 appellants	 were	 insiders	 under	 the	 PIT	
Regulations	 and	 that	 the	 appellants	 had	 pledged/
sold	 the	 shares	 of	 Satyam	 when	 in	 possession	 of	
UPSI and thus, they have violated the SEBI Act and 
the	PIT	Regulations.	

While  deciding  the  appeals,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court laid down certain important observations:

a) 

Definition of Insider:

	
With	 regard	 to	 definition	 of	 “insider”,	 the	
Hon’ble	 Court	 observed	 that	 regulation	 2(e)(i)	 of	
SEBI	 (Prohibition	 of	 Insider	 Trading)	 Regulations,	
1992	(‘PIT’)	is	in	two	parts.	The	first	part	has	reference	
to any person who is connected with the company or 
is	deemed	to	be	connected	with	the	company.	Thus,	
connection	of	a	person	with	the	company,	as	defined	
in	Regulation	2	(c)	of	PIT	Regulations	would	bring	
him	in	clause	(i)	of	the	definition	of	insider.	However,	
the	 second	 limb	 of	 clause	 2(e)(i)	 also	 has	 to	 be	
satisfied,	which	is	that	such	person	must	reasonably	
be	expected	to	have	access	to	UPSI	by	virtue	of	such	
connection	in	respect	of	securities	of	a	company.	On	
the	use	of	word	“and”	in	clause	(i)	of	the	regulation	
2(e),	 Hon’ble	 Court	 held	 that	 the	 word	 “and”	
should be given its ordinary meaning and should be 
understood in a conjunctive sense, unless it would 
lead	to	an	absurd	situation	or	an	unintelligible	result.	
The	Hon’ble	Court	also	observed	that	the	disjunctive	

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

197

“or”	contained	in	the	2015	PIT	Regulations	must	be	
contrasted	 with	 the	 expression	 “and”	 contained	 in	
the	1992	PIT	Regulations.	Accordingly,	the	Hon’ble	
Court	held	that	the	majority	view	of	Hon’ble	SAT	in	
giving	effect	to	only	the	first	part	of	regulation	2(e)
(i)	of	the	1992	PIT	Regulations	cannot	be	sustained	in	
law.	

b) 

Proof of Reasonable Access:

	
With	respect	to	how	“reasonable	expectation	
of	access	to	UPSI”	can	be	proved,	the	Hon’ble	Court	
held	that	under	the	second	part	of	Regulation	2(e)
(i)	of	PIT,	the	connected	person	must	be	“reasonably	
expected”	 to	 have	 access	 to	 unpublished	 price	
sensitive	 information.	 The	 expression	 “reasonably	
expected”	cannot	be	a	mere	ipse	dixit	–	there	must	
be material to show that such person can reasonably 
be	so	expected	to	have	access	to	UPSI.	Hon’ble	Court	
in	this	regard,	accepted	the	submissions	of	SEBI	that	
in	 cases	 like	 the	 present,  a  reasonable  expectation 
to	 be	 in	 the	 know	 of	 things	 can	 only	 be	 based	 on	
reasonable	inferences	drawn	from	foundational	facts 
and  inter  alia  reiterated  its  observations  regarding 
the	standard	of	evidence	made	in	the	matter	of	SEBI	
v.	Kishore	R.	Ajmera,	(2016)	6	SCC	368	that	the	test	
would	always	be	that	what	inferential	process	that	a	
reasonable	/prudent	man	would	adopt	to	arrive	at	a	
conclusion.	

B. 

 Judgment  dated  25.10.2018  in  C.A.  no. 
1877/2015-  Financial  Technologies  (India) 
Ltd. (“FTIL”) Vs. SEBI.  

	
The	 Forward	 Markets	 Commission	 (“FMC”)	
vide	 its	 order	 dated	 December	 17,	 2013	 held	 that	
FTIL	was	not	a	‘fit	and	proper’	person	to	continue	to	
be	a	shareholder	of	2	per	cent	or	more	of	the	paid-up	
equity	capital	of	the	Multi	Commodity	Exchange	of	
India	Ltd.	(MCX)	as	prescribed	under	the	guidelines	
issued	 by	 the	 Government	 of	 India	 for	 capital	
structure	 of	 commodity	 exchanges	 post	 5-years	 of	
operation.	 	 FTIL	 challenged	 the	 said	order	 by	 way	

of	a	Writ	Petition	No.337/2014,	FTIL	Vs	FMC	before	
the	 Hon’ble	 High	 Court	 at	 Bombay.	 The	 Hon’ble	
High	Court,	vide	its	order	dated	February	28,	2014,	
rejected	the	prayer	of	interim	relief	for	staying	the	
operation	of	the	impugned	order.	FTIL,	assailed	the	
said	order	dated	February	28,	2014,	refusing	to	grant	
interim	relief,	by	way	of	an	SLP	(C)	No.CC	20184/2014	
before	 the	 Hon’ble	 Supreme	 Court.	 However,	 the	
said petition was dismissed as withdrawn vide order 
dated	February	06,	2015.		

Stock	 Exchanges	

FTIL	 was	 having	 shareholding	 in	 several	
	
and	 Clearing	
recognised	
Corporations.	 Accordingly,	 proceedings	 were	
initiated	by	SEBI	against	FTIL	alleging	therein	that	
FTIL	 does	 not	 satisfy	 the	 “fit	 and	 proper	 criteria”	
as	specified	under	Regulation	20(1)(b)(v)	read	with	
Regulation	19	of	the	Securities	Contracts	(Regulation)
(Stock	 Exchanges	 and	 Clearing	 Corporations)	
Regulations,	2012,	for	holding	shares	in	recognised	
stock	 exchanges	 and	 clearing	 corporations.	 	 The	
aforesaid	 proceedings	 culminated	 into	 passing	 of	
an	 Order	 dated	 March	 19,	 2014	 by	 SEBI,	 wherein	
inter	alia	it	was	held	that	FTIL	is	not	a	‘fit	and	proper	
person’ to acquire or hold any equity share or any 
instrument	that	provides	for	entitlement	for	equity	
shares	 or	 rights	 over	 equity	 shares	 at	 any	 future	
date,	 in	 a	 recognized	 stock	 exchange	 or	 clearing	
corporation,	either	directly	or	indirectly.	

	
Challenging	 the	 aforesaid	 SEBI	 Order,	 FTIL	
filed	an	appeal	in	Appeal	no.	130	of	2014	before	the	
Securities	 Appellate	 Tribunal	 (“SAT”).	 SAT,	 vide	
its	majority	decision	dated	July	09,	2014,	dismissed	
the	 Appeal.	 	 Assailing	 the	 said	 order	 of	 SAT,	 the	
captioned	 Civil	 Appeal	 was	 filed.	 	 The	 Hon’ble	
Court,	after	hearing	the	arguments	of	both	the	sides,	
had	on	October	25,	2018	disposed	of	the	appeal	by	
observing  that  the  present  appeal  ought  not  to  be 
heard	 at	 this	 stage	 as	 the	 order	 impugned	 (of	 the	
Whole	Time	Member,	SEBI)	is	based	on	another	order	
passed	by	the	Forward	Markets	Commission	which	

198

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

is pending challenge in the Bombay High Court and 
accordingly	 permitted	 the	 appellant	 to	 pursue	 the	
proceedings	 before	 the	 Bombay	 High	 Court.	 The	
appeal  was  closed  with  liberty  to  the  appellant  to 
move this Court in the event such necessity arises in 
the	future.

C. 

 Judgment  dated  28.02.2019 
in  CA  No.  
11311/2013  -SEBI  Vs.  Bhavesh  Pabari  and 
other connected appeals.

In	 the	 aforesaid	 appeals,	 two	 important	

	
questions	of	law	were	raised,	which	are:	

i) 

ii)  

 Whether the conditions stipulated in clauses 
(a),	(b)	and	(c)	of	Section	15J	of	the	Securities	
and	 Exchange	 Board	 of	 India	 Act,	 1992	
(hereinafter	 referred	 to	 as	 “SEBI	 Act”)	 are	
exhaustive  to  govern  the  discretion  in  the 
Adjudicating	Officer	to	decide	on	the	quantum	
of	 penalty	 or	 the	 said	 conditions	 are	 merely	
illustrative?

 Whether the power and discretion vested by 
Section	 15J	 of	 the	 SEBI	Act	 to	 decide	 on	 the	
quantum	of	penalty,	regardless	of	the	manner	
in	which	the	first	question	is	answered,	stands	
eclipsed by the penalty provisions contained 
in	 Section	 15A	 to	 Section	 15HA	 of	 the	 SEBI	
Act?

	
The	 Hon’ble	 Supreme	 Court,	 vide	 common	
judgment	 and	 order	 dated	 February	 28,	 2019,	
disposed	of	all	the	13	Civil	Appeals	by	observing	that	
the	parameters	under	Section	15J	are	not	exhaustive.	
The	important	observations	of	the	Hon’ble	Court	are	
as under: 

a)	
Hon’ble	 Court,	 with	 reference	 to	 the	 first	
question,	 observed	 that	 Section	 15-I(2)	 empowers	
the	AO	to	impose	penalty	as	he	thinks	fit	and	such	
empowering  provision  will  be  in  consonance  with 
the	harmonious	construction	of	Section	15A(a)	with	
Section	 15J.	 	 Hon’ble	 Court	 further	 observed	 that	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

the	factors	provided	under	Section	15J	may	not	be	
present	at	all	in	cases	of	certain	violations	covered	
under	Section	15A-15C	and	in	case	none	of	the	factors	
are applicable, it cannot be said that penalty cannot 
be	 imposed.	 As	 the	 factors	 enlisted	 under	 Section	
15J	are	not	exhaustive,	AO	can	take	other	factors	to	
arrive	 at	 the	 quantum	 of	 penalty,	 as	 imposition	 of	
penalty is dependent on the substantive provisions, 
15A-15HA.

b) 
Hon’ble  Court,  while  answering  the  second 
question, observed that to answer the doubts created 
due	to	judgment	in	Roofit	matter,	an	Explanation	has	
been	inserted	in	Section	15J	by	the	Finance	Act,	2017,	
which	has	clarified	the	situation	and	vested	discretion	
in	the	AO	for	deciding	the	quantum	of	penalty	to	be	
imposed	under	Section	15A	to	15HA.		As	per	the	said	
clarification,	the	AO	shall	always	be	deemed	to	have	
exercised	the	discretion	to	adjudge	the	quantum	of	
penalty	under	Section	15A	to	15E,	Section	15F(b)-(c),	
15G,	15H	and	15HA	of	the	SEBI	Act.	Hon’ble	Court	
deemed	it	appropriate	to	hold	that	the	provisions	of	
section	15-J	were	never	eclipsed	and	had	continued	
to	apply.		

Hon’ble  Court  also  discussed  the  legislative 
c) 
intent behind the term ‘whichever is less’ in Section 
15A(a)	 (as	 it	 existed	 during	 the	 period	 29.10.2002	
to	 07.09.2014).	 Hon’ble	 Court	 held	 that	 in	 normal	
parlance,	 the	 term	 “whichever	 is	 less”	 would	 take	
away the discretion as minimum penalty has been 
prescribed,	 however,	 Section	 15A(a)	 read	 with	
explanation	 to	 Section	 15J	 clearly	 establishes	 the	
legislative  intent  was  not  to  stipulate  mandatory 
minimum	 penalty	 for	 the	 period	 of	 violation.	
Hon’ble Court also held that the intention to insert 
such	 term	 was	 not	 to	 restrict	 the	 discretion	 of	 the	
AO,	by	stipulating	minimum	mandatory	penalty	of	 
` 1	lakh	per	day,	for	cases	involving	technical	default	
where no loss has been caused to the investor and no 
disproportionate	gain	or	unfair	advantage	has	been	
made.		By	the	2014	amendment,	minimum	penalty	

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report : 2018-19

199

of	` 1	lakh	per	day	was	modified	to	a	penalty	of	upto	
` 1	lakh	and	the	said	amendment	was	clarificatory	as	
the	same	was	not	retrospective.		

d)	 Hon’ble	 Court	 also	 observed	 that	 in	 light	 of	
the	 Explanation	 added	 in	 2017,	 AO	 has	 discretion	
to	 impose	 penalty	 of	 minimum	 one	 lakh	 per	 day	
under	Section	15A(a)	as	it	existed	during	the	period	
29.10.2002	 to	 07.09.2014,	 by	 considering	 period	
of	 default,	 and	 other	 aggravating	 and	 mitigating	
circumstances 
including  those  provided  under 
Section	15J,	as	the	factors	enumerated	under	Section	
15J	are	illustrative	in	nature	and	have	to	be	considered	
only	when	such	factors	exist.	AO	can	always	consider	
factors	apart	from	those	enumerated	under	Section	
15J	in	order	to	decide	the	quantum	of	penalty.	

e)	 With	 respect	 to	 continuing	 offence,	 Hon’ble	
Court	 distinguished	 ‘continuing’	 from	 ‘recurring’	
and	held	that	‘repetitive’,	as	used	under	Section	15J,	
is	a	recurring	default	giving	rise	to	a	separate	cause	of	
action	for	each	such	default	and	the	said	factor	may	
be	considered	by	the	AO	for	deciding	the	quantum.	
The	Court	also	observed	that	a	‘continuing’	default	
would	 also	 be	 a	 relevant	 facts	 as	 it	 was	 held	 that	
clauses	 (a)	 –	 (c)	 of	 section	 15-J	 of	 the	 SEBI	Act	 are	
merely	 illustrative	 and	 are	 not	 the	 only	 grounds/
factors	which	can	be	taken	into	consideration	while	
determining	the	quantum	of	penalty.	

II.  HIGH COURTS

A. 

 Order  dated  29.8.2018  in  Writ  Petition  no. 
1434  of  2017-  SAMCO  Securities  Ltd.  & 
Ors. v SEBI & Ors. (Hon’ble High Court at 
Bombay)

	
The	 instant	 writ	 petition	 was	 filed	 in	 the	
Hon’ble	 High	 Court	 at	 Bombay	 by	 SAMCO	
Securities	 Ltd.	 and	 Samruddhi	 Finstock	 Ltd.	 (who	
were	 running	 a	 competition	 called	 Indian	 Trading	
League	for	ranking	performance	of	clients	of	SAMCO	
Securities	 Ltd.	 trading	 in	 securities	 and	 giving	 out	

certain	awards/rewards)	challenging	inter	alia	SEBI	
Circular	dated	November	03,	2016	vide	which	it	was	
informed	that	stock	broker	or	its	associates	/	group	
companies cannot directly or indirectly sponsor or be 
associated	with	any	schemes	/	leagues	/	competition,	
etc.	 which	 may	 involve	 distribution	 of	 monies	 /	
prizes	/	gifts	/	medals,	etc.	The	petitioners	contended	
that	 the	 circular	 was	 violative	 of	 the	 constitutional	
rights	 guaranteed	 under	 Article	 14	 and	 Article	
19(1)(g)	of	the	Constitution	of	India,	as	the	same	is	
arbitrary  and  based  on  irrelevant  and  extraneous 
considerations.	

	
The	Hon’ble	Court	did	not	find	any	merit	in	
the	contentions	of	the	petitioners	and	held	that	the	
impugned circular did not have any bearing on the 
primary	business	of	the	petitioner	and	the	guidelines	
are issued to achieve the object that investors are not 
misguided  and  lured  into  trading  on  the  pretext 
of	 receiving	 monetary	 incentives	 from	 the	 stock	
brokers.	It	was	further	observed	that	by	the	impugned	
circular,	the	stock	brokers	like	petitioner	No.	1	are	
prohibited	 from	 being	 associated	 with	 any	 sort	 of	
competition  or  league  which  involves  distribution 
of	 prizes	 or	 monies	 or	 gifts.	 The	 primary	 business	
of	 petitioner	 No.1	 is	 to	 carry	 on	 the	 stock-broking	
activities and not the promoting or participating in 
leagues	or	competitions.	By	the	impugned	circular,	
by	no	stretch	of	imagination	it	can	be	said	that	the	
primary	business	of	petitioner	No.1	is	affected.	

the	

restriction	

Further,	 considering	

(in	
	
Schedule-II	 of	 the	 SEBI	 (Stock	 Brokers	 and	 Sub-
brokers)	Regulations,	1992)	on	a	stock	broker	from	
advertising his business publicly without permission 
of	 the	 Exchange	 or	 resorting	 to	 unfair	 means	 for	
inducting	 the	 clients	 from	 other	 stock-brokers,	 the	
Court	held	that	the	impugned	circulars	only	clarified	
that	what	the	stock-broker	cannot	do	directly	is	also	
not	 permitted	 to	 do	 indirectly.	 Accordingly,	 vide	
Order	dated	August	29,	2018,	the	Hon’ble	Court	had	
dismissed	the	Writ	Petition.

 Order  dated  4.10.2018  in  W.P.  (L)  No. 
3295/2018 - IIFL Commodities Ltd. (Erstwhile 
India Infoline Commodities Ltd.) and others 
Vs.  SEBI  and  other  connected  petitions 
(before the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay).

	
The	 petitioners	 were	 commodity	 derivatives	
brokers.	Pursuant	to	the	merger	of	FMC	with	SEBI,	
vide	 amendments	 made	 to	 the	 Forward	 Contract	
Regulation	Act	(FCRA)	and	the	Securities	Contracts	
(Regulation)	 Act,	 1956,	 a	 commodity	 derivatives	
broker	 who	 was	 acting	 so	 before	 the	 merger	 was	
allowed	 to	 do	 so	 for	 a	 period	 of	 three	 months	
from	 such	 date	 of	 merger	 or	 if	 an	 application	 for	
registration	was	made	with	the	said	period	of	three	
months,	till	the	disposal	of	such	application.	

These	 petitioners,	 who	 had	 filed	

	
their	
application	 seeking	 registration	 as	 commodity	
derivatives	 brokers,	 had	 sought	 to	 withdraw	 their	
applications.	 However,	 SEBI	 had	 rejected	 their	
request	 for	 withdrawal	 on	 the	 ground	 that	 there	
were	certain	adverse	findings	against	them	and	had	
accordingly	initiated	proceedings	against	them.	

	
The	 petitioners	 had	 approached	 the	 Hon’ble	
High Court challenging SEBI’s communication dated 
September	 4,	 2018	 informing	 the	 petitioners	 that	
their	 application	 for	 withdrawal	 of	 the	 application	
for	 registration	 has	 been	 rejected.	 The	 petitioners	
had	 also	 challenged	 the	 order	 dated	 August	 30,	
2018	 issued	 by	 SEBI,	 vide	 which	 the	 petitioners	
have	 been	 directed	 to	 submit	 written	 submissions	
within	a	period	of	two	weeks	from	the	date	of	the	
said	order	and	to	appear	for	personal	hearing.		The	
Petitioners	have	also	challenged	the	notices/report	in	
the	enquiry	proceedings.

	
The	 issue	 before	 the	 Hon’ble	 Court	 was	
whether	SEBI	was	bound	to	allow	the	application	of	
the	 petitioners	 for	 withdrawal	 of	 their	 application	
for	 registration	 and	 whether	 the	 continuation	 of	
the  proceedings  under  the  various  regulations  are 
permissible	or	not.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

	
After	 hearing	 the	 parties,	 the	 Hon’ble	 High	
Court  inter  alia  observed  that  while  it  was  not 
necessary	 for	 intermediaries	 like	 the	 petitioners	
to	 have	 registration	 under	 the	 FCRA,	 after	 the	
merger	came	to	effect,	it	has	become	necessary	for	
every  intermediary,  who  is  dealing  in  commodity 
derivatives	 to	 get	 registered	 with	 SEBI.	 As	 a	
transitory  measure,  three  months  period  has  been 
given to them, so as to enable them to get themselves 
registered	 with	 SEBI.	 Even	 if	 within	 three	 months	
such	 persons	 move	 an	 application	 for	 registration,	
they are entitled to continue with their activities, till 
their	application	is	finally	decided	by	SEBI.	Therefore,	
such intermediaries who were dealing in commodity 
derivatives and who had made an application within 
a	period	of	three	months	have	been	brought	under	
the	control	of	SEBI.		

The	 Hon’ble	 High	 Court	 applied	 Heydon’s	
	
rules	 of	 interpretation	 and	 rejected	 the	 petitions	
and	observed	that	after	SEBI	came	to	a	prima	facie	
finding	 that	 there	 exists	 some	 adverse	 finding	
against the petitioners, the petitioners have moved 
an	 application	 for	 withdrawal	 of	 registration	 with	
an	apprehension	that	some	findings	adverse	to	the	
interest	 would	 be	 arrived	 at	 by	 SEBI.	 The	 Hon’ble	
High	 Court	 observed	 that	 the	 conduct	 of	 the	
petitioners	was	nothing	else,	but	an	attempt	to	leave	
the	proceedings	in	the	nip	of	the	bud.

SEBI,	 by	 an	 order	 dated	 December	 19,	 1996,	
held  that  the  transactions  had  been  entered  into 
in	 order	 to	 create	 a	 false	 market	 for	 inducing	 the	
people	to	subscribe	to	the	public	issue	of	Jaltarang	
and directed the third respondent Shri Atul Shah be

December,	1995.	SEBI,	however,	reserved	its	right	to	
proceed	against	the	Bank	under	the	SEBI	(Bankers	to	
an	issue)	Regulation,	1994	for	the	irregularities.	The	
above order came to be challenged by the petitioner 
before	 the	 Hon’ble	 Securities	 Appellate	 Tribunal	
(SAT),	Mumbai	in	Appeal	No.2	of	2000,	which	came	
to	 be	 dismissed	 by	 an	 order	 dated	 July	 27,	 2000.	
Being	aggrieved,	the	petitioner	has	filed	an	appeal	
before	the	Bombay	High	Court,	which	is	pending.

 
In  the  meanwhile,  the  petitioner  presented 
a	 petition	 before	 Hon’ble	 High	 Court	 of	 Gujarat	
wherein it challenged that SEBI has been selective in 
taking	action,	inasmuch	as,	it	is	pursuing	its	remedy	
against	the	petitioner	Bank,	whereas	it	is	not	taking	
any	 steps	 for	 recovering	 the	 amount	 fraudulently	
taken	 away	 by	 the	 respondents	 No.2	 to	 9	 i.e.	
Jaltarang	and	Ors.,	from	the	properties	over	which	
the	SEBI	has	got	a	charge.	Thus,	the	petitioner	sought	
a	 direction	 in	 the	 nature	 of	 mandamus,	 directing	
SEBI	 to	 forthwith	 attach,	 take	 possession,	 sell	 and	
dispose	of	the	properties	of	Jaltarang	and	the	others	

and	to	utilize	the	net	sale	proceeds	for	refunding	the	
subscription	of	members	of	the	investing	public	of	
the	said	public	issue.

	
The	 issue	 before	 the	 Court	 was	 whether	 the	
petitioner	bank	who	is	stranger	to	the	order	dated	
December	19,	1996	has	a	legal	right	to	insist	on	such	
performance	and	whether	it		has	suffered,	or	suffers	
from	 any	 legal	 injury	 to	 challenge	 the	 act/action/
inaction/order,	etc.	of	SEBI	in	a	court	of	law.

The Hon’ble Court inter alia held that – 

(i)	

(ii)	

(iii) 

	a	 writ	 petition	 under	 Article	 226	 of	 the	
Constitution	 is	 maintainable	 either	 for	 the	
purpose	of	enforcing	a	statutory	or	legal	right,	
or when there is a complaint by the appellant 
that	there	has	been	a	breach	of	statutory	duty	
on	the	part	of	the	authorities.	

	the	 court	 can	 enforce	 the	 performance	 of	 a	
statutory duty by a public body, using its writ 
jurisdiction	at	the	behest	of	a	person,	provided	
that	such	person	satisfies	the	court	that	he	has	
a	legal	right	to	insist	on	such	performance.	

 a  person  who  raises  a  grievance  must  show 
how	he	has	suffered	a	legal	injury.	In	the	facts	
of	 the	 present	 case,	 the	 petitioner	 was	 not	 a	
party to the proceedings leading to the order 
dated	December	19,	1996.	Thus,	being	a	total	
stranger  to  such  proceedings  the  Hon’ble 
Court held that a petitioner is not entitled to 
seek	 compliance	 of	 such	 order	 against	 the	
other	respondents.

meeting	and	to	provide	for	removal	of	Independent	
Director	 only	 by	 way	 of	 Special	 Resolution	 at	 the	
Extra	 Ordinary	 General	 meeting.	 The	 plaintiffs	
sought  necessary  amendments  to  the  Companies 
Act,	 2013	 (“Act”)	 by	 issuing	 certain	 orders	 in	
exercise	of	powers	under	Section	470	of	the	Act	and	
Regulation	 101	 of	 SEBI	 (Listing	 Obligations	 and	
Disclosure	Requirements),	Regulations,	2015	(LODR	
Regulations).	

 
SEBI  contended  that  the  appointment  and 
removal	of	Directors	is	dealt	with	in	the	Companies	
Act,	2013,	which	is	regulated	by	MCA/Government	
of	India	and	that	the	provisions	of	LODR	Regulations,	
inter	alia,	deal	with	disclosure	requirements	of	the	
listed entities and corporate governance and as such 
the	 said	 Regulations	 do	 not	 provide	 for	 matters	
relating	 to	 the	 manner	 of	 the	 appointment	 and	
removal	of	Directors	including	that	of	Independent	
Directors.	

	
After	 hearing	 the	 parties,	 the	 Hon’ble	 Court	
dismissed  the  suit  as  withdrawn  vide  order  dated 
February	6,	2019.		Furthermore,	since	no	reason	was	
offered	for	the	withdrawal	of	the	suit,	the	Court	has	
imposed	costs	on	the	plaintiffs,	wherein,	the	plaintiffs	
were	directed	to	pay	each	of	the	defendants	including	
SEBI	 (Defendant	 no.	 3),	 a	 sum	 of	 `  2,00,000/-	 each	
within	six	weeks	from	the	date	of	the	Order,	which	
amount,	 SEBI	 has	 received	 from	 the	 plaintiffs,	 in	
compliance	with	the	Court	direction.

The	 issue	 in	 the	 matter	 was	 whether	 the	
Union	 of	 India	 can	 be	 considered	 as	 a	 ‘person	
acting	 in	 concert’	 with	 Life	 Insurance	 Corporation

had	acquired	shares	of	the	target	company	(i.e.	IDBI

price	 in	 respect	 of	 public	 announcement	 made	 by

to	a	minority	shareholder	of	IDBI	Bank.	

the	

The	 Hon’ble	 Court,	 on	

issue	 of	
	
maintainability	 of	 the	 petition,	 observed	 that	 the	
petitioner	has	not	furnished	any	documentary	proof	
to	 show	 that	 he	 is	 a	 minority	 shareholder	 of	 IDBI	
Bank	 Ltd.	 and	 held	 that	 the	 petitioner	 had	 failed	
to	 establish	 his	 locus	 for	 filing	 the	 petition	 and	
consequently, writ petition is liable to be dismissed 
on	this	ground	alone.	However,	the	Hon’ble	Court	
decided	the	matter	on	merits	also.	

	
On	the	issue	of	‘persons	acting	in	concert’,	the	
Hon’ble	Court	applied	the	ratio	in	the	judgment	of	the	
Hon’ble	Supreme	Court	in	the	matter	of	M/s	Daiichi	
Sankyo	 Company	 Ltd.	 v.	 Jayaram	 Chigurupati	 &	
Ors.	 and	 observed	 that	 persons	 acting	 in	 concert	
are persons who directly or indirectly cooperate by 
acquiring	 (or	 agree	 to	 do	 so)	 shares/voting	 rights	
or	control	over	the	target	company	“for	a	common	
objective	 or	 purpose	 of	 substantial	 acquisition	 of	
shares or voting rights or control and the relationship 
of	“persons	acting	in	concert”	must	exist	not	at	the	
time	 of	 the	 public	 announcement,	 but	 at	 the	 time	
of	acquisition,	for	the	purposes	of	Regulation	20(4)
(b)	 of	 SAST	 Regulations.	 Accordingly,	 it	 was	 held	
that	 Union	 of	 India	 cannot	 be	 termed	 as	 person	
acting	 in	 concert	 with	 LIC.	 Accordingly,	 the	 open	
offer	price	of	 `  61.73	per	share	calculated	in	terms	
of	the	SAST	Regulations	and	already	affirmed	by	a	
judicial	verdict	(in	another	matter)	was	held	to	be	in	
accordance with the applicable legal provisions.

III.   SECURITIES APPELLATE TRIBUNAL

A. 

 Common  order  dated  10.4.2018  in  Appeal 
No. 114 of 2015 - Rajkumar C. Basantani Vs 
SEBI and another connected appeal. 

The	 appeals	 were	 filed	 against	 the	 orders	
	
of	 the	 Adjudicating	 Officer	 for	 violating	 the	 SEBI	
(PFUTP)	 Regulations,	 2003,	 levying	 a	 penalty	 of	 
` 15	crore	in	the	matter	of	Kolar	Biotech	Limited	and	
` 10	lakh	in	the	matter	of	Adam	Comsof	Ltd.	

	
Before	 considering	 the	 merit	 of	 the	 appeals,	
SAT	 dismissed	 the	 delay	 condonation	 application	
and	 observed	 that	 the	 appellant	 had	 successfully	
evaded	service	of	notices/orders	for	decades	initially	
by	 running	 away	 from	 the	 country	 and	 thereafter	
changing	 his	 residence	 every	 now	 and	 then.	 SAT	
also observed that SEBI had discharged its duty to 
serve the appellant by sending the notices through 
Registered	 Post	 with	 Acknowledgment	 Due	 and	
also	by	way	of	affixation.	According	to	SAT,	merely	
because,  SEBI,  at  this  belated  stage,  was  unable  to 
produce	the	Acknowledgement,	it	cannot	be	said	that	
SEBI	had	failed	to	serve	notices/	orders	and	failed	to	
comply	with	the	procedure	for	holding	inquiry.

B. 

 Common  Order  dated  26.4.2018  in  Appeal 
No.  479  of  2016:  Karvy  Financial  Services 
Limited versus SEBI and another connected 
appeal.

Appeals	were	filed	against	the	order	of		SEBI	
	
dated	 October	 27,	 2016	 directing	 the	 appellant	 to	
acquire	 through	 open	 offer,	 the	 shares	 of	 Regaliaa	
Realty	Limited	(target	company)	in	accordance	with	
the	 provisions	 of	 SEBI	 (SAST)	 Regulations,	 2011	
(SAST	 Regulations).	 The	 appellant	 also	 challenged	
the	communication	of	SEBI	dated	September	6,	2016	
whereby	the	application	filed	by	the	appellant	on	July	
21,	2016	seeking	exemption	from	making	the	open	
offer	under	regulation	11(1)	of	the	SAST	Regulations	

in	relation	to	the	shares	acquired	by	invoking	pledge	
on	February	16,	2012	was	rejected	by	SEBI.	

	
SAT	 dismissed	 the	 appeals	 and	 observed	
that	 the	 obligation	 to	 make	 open	 offer	 on	 account	
of	acquiring	20,00,100	shares	of	the	target	company	
on	invocation	of	pledge	arose	on	February	16,	2012,	
whereas,	 the	 application	 seeking	 exemption	 from	
making	 open	 offer	 was	 made	 belatedly	 after	 four	
years	on	July	21,	2016	and	that	the		appellant	was	not	
justified	in	making	application	seeking	exemption.	

SAT	 also	 observed	 that	 the	 acquisition	 of	
	
55.56	 per	 cent	 shares	 of	 the	 target	 company	 was	
not  disputed  by  the  appellant  and  that  appellant 
was	entitled	to	exercise	more	than	25	per	cent	of	the	
voting	rights	in	the	target	company.

	
SAT	also	noted	the	fact	that	the	appellant	after	
acquiring  the  shares  had  not  exercised  controlled 
over  the  target  company,  had  not  exercised  the 
voting  rights  in  the  target  company  and  had  not 
received	any	dividend	cannot	be	ground	either	for	
not	 making	 the	 open	 offer	 or	 seeking	 exemption	
from	making	open	offer	after	lapse	of	four	years.

 Common  Order  dated  20.6.2018  in  Appeal 
No.  356  of  2015:  PVP  Ventures  Limited  & 
Anr. Vs SEBI and another connected appeal 

	
The	 appeals	 were	 filed	 against	 the	 separate	
orders	of	the	Adjudicating	Officer	dated	March	27,	
2015	for	imposing	a	penalty	of	 `  15	crore	each	for

Allegation  is  that  the  unpublished  price 
 
sensitive	
information	 (UPSI)	 of	 PVP	 Ventures	
Limited	(PVL)	pertaining	to	negative	financial	results	
on	account	of	write-off	in	the	value	of	investments	
and	 advances	 to	 PVP	 Energy	 Pvt.	 Ltd	 (PEL)	 came	
into	existence	on	September	30,	2009.	However,	the	
financial	results	were	published	on	stock	exchange	
website	only	on	October	31,	2009.	During,	September	
30,	2009	to	October	30,	2009,	approximately	1.9	crore	
shares	of	PVL	were	sold	by	PEL	and	Mr.	Prasad	V.	
Potluri,	 Chairman	 and	 Managing	 Director	 of	 PVL	
and	 also	 a	 director	 of	 PEL	 who	 traded	 on	 behalf	
of	 PEL.	 In	 view	 of	 the	 same,	 SEBI	 found	 that	 the	
aforesaid	 persons	 have	 violated	 the	 provisions	 of	
SEBI	 (PIT)	 Regulations,	 1992	 and	 imposed	 penalty	
accordingly.

	
SAT,	 while	 disposing	 of	 the	 appeals	 rejected	
the	 main	 contention	 of	 PEL	 that	 UPSI	 came	 into	
existence	 only	 on	 October	 15,	 2009	 and	 not	 on	
September	30,	2009.	The	supporting	argument	of	the	
appellants, that the journal vouchers through which 
the	net	loss	of	 `  599.91	crore	was	written	off	came	
into	existence	on	October	15,	2009	and	the	same	were	
back	dated	to	September	30,	2009	to	reflect	the	true	
value	 of	 the	 assets	 as	 on	 September	 30,	 2009,	 was	
found	held	to	be	inadmissible	by	the	SAT.

	
SAT	upheld	the	penalty	of	` 15	crore	imposed	
on	PEL	and	reduced	the	penalty	of	` 15	crore	imposed	
by	SEBI	on	Mr.	Prasad	Potluri	to	`  5	crore.		It	also	
upheld	the	penalty	of	` 15	lakh	against	PVP	Ventures	
and	Prasad	V.	Potluri	for	disclosure	violations	under	
the	Insider	Trading	Regulations	in	the	other	appeal.

Company  Limited  vs  SEBI  in  the  matter  of

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

Infra	 Limited	
(“MIL”)	
including	
the	 Maytas	
(presently	 known	 as	
IL&FS	 Engineering	 and	
Construction	Company	Limited	(IL&FS)	have	made	
unlawful	gain	on	account	of	sale/	transfer	of	shares	
of	 Satyam	 Computer	 Services	 Limited	 (Satyam)	
while	 in	 possession	 of	 unpublished	 price	 sensitive	
information	(UPSI)	with	complicity	and	involvement	
of	Mr.	B.	Ramalinga	Raju	and	Mr.	B.	Rama	Raju	(Ex-	
Chairman	 and	 Managing	 Director	 respectively	 of	
Satyam).	Accordingly,	the	entities	set	out	in	the	order	
were  directed  to  disgorge  jointly  and  severally  an 
amount	to	the	tune	of	`  543.93	crore,	out	of	which	
` 59.16	crore	was	directed	to	be	disgorged	by	Maytas	
Infra	Limited	(MIL).

	
As	 IL&FS	 had	 acquired	 MIL	 under	 special	
circumstances	after	the	impugned	insider	trading	by	
MIL,	IL&FS	was	directed	to	disgorge	the	aforesaid	
amount  which  was  challenged  by  the  appellants 
before	Hon’ble	SAT.

SAT,	 vide	 separate	 order	 dated	 August	 11,	
	
2017	upheld	the	order	of	SEBI	against	the	connected/
related	entities	of	Satyam	while	the	present	appeal	
was	 pending	 before	 Hon’ble	 SAT.	 The	 Hon’ble	
Supreme	 Court,	 on	 appeal	 by	 connected/related	
entities,	vide	order	dated	May	14,	2018	had	set	aside	
the	aforesaid	order	of	the	SAT	by	holding	that	most	
of	the	entities	connected/related	to	Mr.	B.	Ramalinga	
Raju/	 Mr.	 B.	 Rama	 Raju	 could	 not	 be	 said	 to	 be	
reasonably	expected	to	have	access	to	the	UPSI.	

	
The	 appellant	 submitted	 that,	 since	 the	
Hon’ble	Supreme	Court	of	India	has	held	that	Mr.	B.	
Teja	Raju	could	not	be	said	to	be	reasonably	expected	
to	be	privy	to	the	UPSI,	the	charge	against	MIL	was	
not  sustainable,  as  held  by  SEBI  in  its  order  dated 
September	10,	2015.	

	
Hon’ble	SAT	held	that	in	view	of	the	decision	
of	the	Hon’ble	Supreme	Court	of	India	dated	May	14,	
2018	wherein	it	is	held	that	several	entities	including

E. 

 Order dated 27.6.2018 in Appeal No. 92/2018: 
Shaswat Agarwal vs. SEBI

The	 appeal	 was	 filed	 against	 the	 order	 of	
	
the	 Adjudicating	 Officer	 dated	 January	 31,	 2018	
wherein	a	penalty	of	` 5,00,000/-	was	imposed	on	the	
appellant.	

	
The	appellant,	promoter	as	well	as	managing	
director	 of	 the	 appellant	 company,	 Rich	 Universe	
Network	Limited,	though	held	6.85	per	cent	of	the	
total	 paid	 up	 share	 capital	 of	 the	 company,	 Rich	
Universe	Network	Limited	however,	did	not	make	
timely	disclosure	to	the	stock	exchange,	with	respect	
to the his entire shareholding and thus violated SEBI 
(SAST)	 Regulations,	 2011	 and	 also	 the	 SEBI	 (PIT)	
Regulations,	1992.	

	
SAT	 upheld	 the	 order	 of	 the	 Adjudicating	
Officer	 and	 dismissed	 the	 appeal	 and	 observed	
that	 though	 the	 appellant	 disputed	 the	 purpose	 of	
the	 transfer,	 he	 did	 not	 dispute	 the	 transfer.	 SAT	
also	 observed	 that	 National	 Securities	 Depository	
Limited	(NSDL)		had	confirmed	that	share	transfer	
had	taken	place	from	the	client	ID	on	September	26,	
2014	and	the	consideration	value	was	` 1.78	crore,	the	
appellant	was	liable	to	disclose	the	stock	exchange	in	
terms	of	the	aforesaid	Regulations.

SAT	 further	 examined	 the	 matter	 as	 to	
	
whether	 the	 ratio	 of	 its	 earlier	 order	 in	 respect	 of	
Mr.	Ravi	Mohan	&	Ors.	vs.	SEBI	(Appeal	No.	97	of	
2014	 decided	 on	 December	 16,	 2015)	 is	 applicable	
in	 the	 matter.	 SAT	 noted	 that	 the	 same	 was	 not	
applicable	since	sub-regulation	29(2)	and	29(3)	of	the	
SEBI	(SAST)	Regulations,	2011	require	disclosure	of	
changes	in	shareholding,	and	not	only	acquisition.

 Common  Order  dated  28.6.2018  in  Appeal 
No. 303 of 2016: Pratik Minerals Pvt. Ltd. Vs. 
SEBI and other connected appeals in in the 
matter of Platinum Corporation Ltd (PCL)

	
The	 appeals	 were	 filed	 against	 the	 order	
of	 SEBI	 dated	 August	 12,	 2016	 by	 which	 several	
entities, including the appellants were held to have 
inter	alia	violated	SEBI	(PFUTP)	Regulations,	2003,	
SEBI	 (SAST)	 Regulations,	 1997	 and	 issued	 various	
directions	 such	 as	 restraint	 from	 dealing	 in	 the	
securities	market	directly	or	indirectly/disgorgement	
of	 the	 unlawful	 gains	 made/	 direction	 to	 make	 an	
open	offer	as	detailed	therein	have	been	issued,	by	
SEBI.	

	
Between	July	20,	2005	and	September	15,	2006	
Platinum  Corporation  Ltd  (PCL)  made  a  number 
of	 misleading	 corporate	 announcements	 which	 led	
to	increase	in	its	share	price	and	volume	of	trading	
in	 its	 shares.	 Promoters	 of	 PCL	 had	 transferred	
shares	in	off-market	transactions	to	related	entities	
(appellants)	 who	 in-turn	 sold	 the	 shares	 in	 the	
market	after	the	corporate	announcements	and	made	
unlawful	gains	to	the	extent	of	` 12	crore	at	the	cost	of	
innocent	investors.	PCL	and	its	directors	misled	the	
public	investors	by	providing	incorrect	information	
on	promoters’	shareholding	for	11	quarters	(i.e.	from	
March	2005	till	September	2007)	to	the	BSE	Limited.		

	
PCL	made	fraudulent	preferential	allotment	of	
290	lakh	shares	to	seven	connected	entities	/persons	
without	 real	 inflow	 of	 funds	 from	 the	 preferential	
allottees.	 The	 allottees	 of	 the	 aforesaid	 preferential	
issue,	four	of	whom	were	directors	of	the	company,	
were  connected  to  one  another  and  were  acting  in 
concert,	acquired	21.32	per	cent	of	the	post	issue	paid	
up	capital	of	the	company.	However,	they	failed	to	
make	 open	 offer	 as	 prescribed	 by	 Securities	 and	
Exchange	Board	of	India	(Substantial	Acquisition	of	
Shares	and	Takeovers)	Regulations,	1997.

 Common  Order  dated  29.6.2018  in  Appeal 
No. 423 of 2015: Alchemist Holdings Limited 
& ors., and other connected appeals 

	
The	 appeals	 were	 filed	 against	 the	 orders	
dated	August	3,	2015	and	August	14,	2015	by	which,	
SEBI had directed, Alchemist Capital Limited and its 
Directors  and Alchemist  Holdings  Limited  and  its 
Directors,	respectively,	to	refund	jointly	and	severally	
the	money	collected	through	Redeemable	Preference	
Shares	(RPS)	as	they	were	found	to	have	inter	alia	
violated	sections	56,	60	and	73	of	the	Companies	Act,	
1956	(Act).

Alchemist Holdings Limited, duly registered 
 
as	a	Non-Banking	Financial	Company	(NBFC)	had	
raised	 funds	 through	 issuance	 of	 RPS	 during	 the	
period	 from	 March	 25,	 2006	 to	 February	 28,	 2009,	
whereas,  Alchemist  Capital  Limited  had  raised 
funds	 through	 issuance	 of	 RPS	 even	 before	 it	 was	
registered	as	NBFC	with	the	Reserve	Bank	of	India	
(RBI)	and	also	after	it	was	registered	as	NBFC	with	
RBI.	

SAT,	 while	 upholding	 the	 orders	 of	 SEBI,	
	
deleted	 the	 direction	 of	 SEBI	 to	 pay	 interest	
‘compounded	at	half	yearly	intervals’,	and	observed	
that	 in	 terms	 of	 the	Act,	 every	 company	 intending	
to	 offer	 shares	 or	 debentures	 to	 the	 public	 for	
subscription	by	issue	of	prospectus	is	required	before	
such	 issue	 to	 make	 an	 application	 to	 one	 or	 more	
recognized	stock	exchanges	seeking	permissions	for	
the  said  shares  or  debentures  to  be  listed  with  the 
stock	exchanges.	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

	
SAT	observed	that	the	plain	and	unambiguous	
language	used	in	Section	67	of	the	Act	clearly	show	
that	NBFCs	are	also	required	to	follow	the	provisions	
contained	in	Sections		67	and	73	therein.

SAT	further	observed	that	the	argument	of	the	
	
appellants	that	they	had	no	‘intention’	to	offer	shares	
to	the	public	and,	therefore,	SEBI	could	not	invoke	
jurisdiction	under	Section	55A	of	the	Act	was	held	to	
be	without	any	merit,	because:-	

	
firstly,	 the	 offer	 made	 by	 the	 company	 was	
not a private placement restricted to the persons to 
whom	the	offer	was	addressed	but	was	open	to	the	
public  namely  individual,  trusts,  corporate  bodies, 
etc.	

	
secondly,	 reading	 Section	 67	 of	 the	 Act	 as	 a	
whole	makes	it	abundantly	clear	that	when	an	NBFC	
offers	 shares	 to	 the	 general	 public	 and	 not	 to	 the	
persons	to	whom	the	offer/	invitation	is	made,	then	
all	the	provisions	applicable	to	a	public	offer	would	
apply.	

	
SAT	 also	 observed	 that	 as	 per	 the	 first	
proviso	 to	 Section	 67(3)	 of	 the	Act,	 where	 an	 offer	
or invitation to subscribe to the shares or debentures 
of	 the	 company	 is	 made	 to	 more	 than	 49	 persons	
receiving	 the	 offer	 or	 invitation,	 then,	 that	 offer	 or	
invitation shall be treated to have been made to the 
public.	

	
According	 to	 SAT,	 since	 the	 offer/	 invitation	
of	 the	 company	 was	 not	 restricted	 to	 the	 persons	
to	whom	the	offer/	invitation	was	made,	SEBI	was	
justified	in	holding	that	the	company	had	made	the	
offer	to	the	public	without	following	the	provisions	
applicable	 to	 public	 offer	 under	 the	 Act.	 SAT	 also	
held	 that	 any	 offer	 or	 invitation	 by	 an	 NBFC	 to	
more	 than	 49	 persons	 to	 subscribe	 to	 its	 shares	 or	
debentures	shall	not	be	a	public	offer.

 Order  dated  29.6.2018  in  Appeal  No.  01  of 
2017: Factorial Master Fund Vs SEBI

I. 

	
The	 appeal	 was	 filed	 to	 challenge	 the	 order	
dated	 December	 8,	 2016	 in	 which	 SEBI	 had	 held	
that  the  appellant  had  indulged  in  unusual  and 
aggressive	 trading	 in	 the	 scrip	 of	 L&T	 Finance	
Holdings	Limited	(LTFH)	on	March	13,	2014	ahead	
of	 the	 announcement	 of	 	 ‘Offer	 for	 Sale’	 (OFS)	 of	
shares	of	LTFH	on	March	14,	2014	by	the	promoter,	
Larsen	&	Toubro	Limited	(L&T)	and	thereby	gained	
a	profit	of	` 20.04	crore	which	was	an	unlawful	gain	
and accordingly directed the appellant to disgorge 
the	said	amount		with	simple	interest	@	10	per	cent	
per	annum	from	March	2014	till	the	date	of	payment.	

	
SAT	allowed	appeal	and	set	aside	the	order	of	
SEBI	and	observed	the	fact	that,	on	March	10,	2014	
L&T	 had	 applied	 to	 SEBI	 seeking	 exemption	 from	
the	 cooling	 off	 period	 so	 as	 to	 offload	 the	 LTFH	
shares	through	OFS	prior	to	March	17,	2014	(date	on	
which	cooling	off	period	was	to	expire)	could	not	be	
considered	as	UPSI.	SAT	also	observed	that	the	mere	
fact	that	the	appellant	had	participated	in	the	market	
gauging	 exercise	 conducted	 by	 Merchant	 Banker	
could  not  be  a  ground  to  hold  that  the  appellant 
was	privy	to	the	UPSI	that	L&T	would	sell	shares	of	
LTFH	through	OFS	imminently.	

	
SAT	 further	 observed	 that	 as	 there	 was	 no	
bar  on  the  investors  who  had  participated  in  the 
market	 gauging	 exercise	 to	 trade	 in	 the	 scrip	 in	
which	 the	 market	 gauging	 exercise	 was	 conducted	
and	that	SEBI	was	not	justified	in	presuming	that	the	
appellant	had	traded	in	the	scrip	of	LTFH	in	the	F&O	
segment	on	March	13,	2014	while	being	in	possession	
of	the	UPSI	that	L&T	would	sell	the	shares	of	LTFH	
through	OFS	imminently.

 Order dated 15.3.2019 in Appeal no. 78/2012- 
Anandkumar  Baldevbhai  Patel  vs.  SEBI 
[In the matter of Passport India Investment 
(Mauritius) Ltd.]

This	 appeal	 was	 filed	 against	 order	 of	
	
Adjudicating	Officer	dated	September	30,	2011	vide	
which	 a	 penalty	 of	 `  1,00,00,000	 (One	 Crore	 only)	
was	imposed	for	violation	of	Regulations	3	(a),	(b),	
(c)	&	(d)	of	SEBI	(PFUTP)	Regulations,	2003.	

	
SAT	dismissed	the	appeal	and	observed	that	
it was not necessary that there has to be a clinching 
evidence  or  that  the  intention  has  to  be  proved  in 
order to impose penalty under the SEBI Act and that 
the	standard	of	proof	is	preponderance	of	probability	
and	 the	 proof	 of	 manipulation	 always	 depends	 on	
the	inferences	drawn	from	a	host	of	circumstances.	
According	to	SAT,	a	finding	has	to	be	arrived	at	from	
the	pattern	of	trading.	

SAT	further	observed	that	the	circumstantial	
	
evidence	could	be	sufficient	to	raise	a	presumption	
with	regard	to	the	existence	of	a	fact	which	is	sought	
to  be  proved  and  that  where  a  transaction  has 
been executed with the intention to manipulate the 
market	or	defraud	its	mechanism	will	depend	on	the	
intention	of	the	parties	which	could	be	inferred	from	
the	attending	circumstances	since	direct	evidence	in	
such	cases	are	not	available.

 Order  dated  1.2.2019  in  Appeal  no.  278  of

The	 appellant,	 who	 was	 earlier	 granted	 the	
benefit	 of	 fee	 continuity	 by	 the	 Hon’ble	 Supreme	
Court,	had	made	a	claim	for	interest	on	the	principal	
amount	 i.e.	 the	 fee	 paid	 under	 protest.	 SEBI	 had	
rejected the claim inter alia holding that there is no

provision	for	payment	of	interest	under	the	Act	or	
statute and that the Supreme Court while allowing 
the	appeal	by	judgment	dated	December	9,	2015	did	
not	issue	any	direction	for	refunding	the	fee	along	
with	interest.	

The	 appellant	 challenged	

	
the	 aforesaid	
decision	of	SEBI	in	rejecting	its	claim	for	interest	vide	
the	captioned	appeal.		The	Hon’ble	SAT	observed	that	
since	the	appellant	did	not	claim	the	relief	of	interest	
while	seeking	the	refund	of	fee	liability	before	it	or	
before	the	Hon’ble	Supreme	Court	of	India,	the	claim	
of	the	appellant	was	barred	by	principle	of	Order	II	
Rule	 2	 of	 Civil	 Procedure	 Code	 from	 claiming	 the	
refund	 of	 interest.	 Therefore,	 it	 was	 held	 that	 the	
claim	 of	 interest	 was	 rightly	 rejected	 by	 SEBI	 and	
accordingly	the	appeal	was	dismissed.

K. 

 Order dated 15.2.2019 in Appeal No. 192/2018- 
Abhey Ram Dahiya & Anr. vs. SEBI & Anr.

The	appellants	through	their	merchant	banker	
	
filed	a	draft	letter	of	offer	on	November	14,	2017	for	
acquisition	 of	 6,79,520	 equity	 shares	 of	 the	 target	
company,	 Polo	 Hotels	 Limited.	 SEBI	 vide	 a	 letter	
dated	May	11,	2018	communicated	to	the	Merchant	
Banker	that	as	per	an	earlier	Order	dated	August	1,	
2003	of	SEBI,	the	appellants	were	required	to	make	
a	 public	 announcement	 for	 acquiring	 20	 per	 cent	
of	 shares	 and	 therefore	 the	 public	 announcement	
should	be	made	for	acquiring	44,74,851	equity	shares	
which	 would	 constitute	 20	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 capital	
of	 the	 target	 company	 which	 is	 2,23,74,253	 as	 per	
regulation	21	of	the	SAST	Regulations.	

The	 appellants	 being	 aggrieved	 by	

	
the	
observations	of	SEBI	regarding	the	offer	size	had	filed	
the	captioned	appeal	before	the	Hon’ble	SAT.		It	was	
the	 contention	 of	 the	 appellants/acquirers	 that	 the	
offer	size	was	already	determined	when	they	came	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

out	with	an	open	offer	in	the	year	1999.	However,	the	
Hon’ble	 SAT,	 vide	 Order	 dated	 February	 15,	 2019,	
dismissed	the	appeal	while	observing	the	following:	

a)	
The	 communication	 dated	 May	 11,	 2018	
issued	 by	 SEBI	 in	 modifying	 the	 Draft	 Letter	 of	
Offer	amounts	to	a	quasi-judicial	order	and	cannot	
be	 termed	 as	 an	 administrative	 order.	 The	 said	
communication  by  SEBI  has  civil  consequences 
and	affects	the	rights	of	the	appellant	and	therefore	
becomes	appealable	before	the	SAT.

In	respect	of	invoking	regulation	16(4)	of	the	
b)	
SAST	Regulations,	2011	was	concerned,	the	Hon’ble	
SAT	 observed	 that	 in	 the	 matter,	 the	 provisions	 of	
1997	SAST	Regulations	were	alone	to	be	invoked	and	
be considered while complying with SEBI directions 
dated	August	 01,	 2003.	 However,	 SAT	 opined	 that	
the	same	does	not	make	the	impugned	order	dated	
May	11,	2018	patently	illegal	and	the	use	of	words	
“Regulation	 16(4)	 of	 the	 Regulations	 of	 2011”	 was	
only	a	clerical	error.

c)	
SEBI	 found	 that	 the	 public	 announcement	
made	 under	 Regulation	 10	 on	 April	 24,	 1999	 was	
not	in	accordance	with	the	provisions	of	the	SAST	
Regulations,	 1997	 and	 the	 same	 had	 affected	 the	
interest	 of	 the	 shareholders	 of	 the	 target	 company.	
SEBI,	accordingly,	directed	the	appellant/acquirer	to	
make	public	announcement	under	Chapter	III	of	the	
SAST	Regulations,	1997.	In	the	opinion	of	SAT,	such	
public	announcement	has	to	be	made	afresh	and	the	
provisions	 of	 Chapter	 III	 of	 the	 SAST	 Regulations,	
1997	was	required	to	be	complied	with	afresh.	The	
contention  that  only  a  corrigendum  to  the  earlier 
public  announcement  was  required  to  be  issued 
was held to be per se misconceived and cannot be 
accepted.	The	Hon’ble	SAT	further	observed	that	it	
was	immaterial	whether	equity	share	capital	of	the	
company	has	increased	in	the	interim.

After	noting	that	the	SEBI	Order	dated	August	
01,	2003	has	not	been	complied	with	for	almost	15	
years	 in	 spite	 of	 the	 said	 order	 reaching	 finality,

within	a	period	of	four	weeks.	

L. 

 Order dated 28.2.2019 in Appeal No. 73/2019- 
Mr. Mahendra Giridharilal vs. NSE & Ors.  

	
The	appellant	is	a	shareholder	of	the	company,	
T.	Stanes	and	Company	Limited.	The	company	was	
listed	on	the	erstwhile	Madras	Stock	Exchange	(MSE).	
Pursuant	 to	 MSE	 surrendering	 its	 recognition,	 the	
company	was	placed	in	the	Dissemination	Board	of	
National	Stock	Exchange	of	India	Limited	(“NSE”),	
with	 effect	 from	 December	 1,	 2014.	 The	 company	
intimated  its  shareholders  vide  a  circular  dated 
December	 2,	 2014	 that	 they	 can	 avail	 the	 limited	
facility	 of	 buying	 and	 selling	 their	 shares	 on	 the	
Dissemination	Board	of	the	NSE.	

	
The	 company	 had	 made	 an	 offer	 to	 its	
shareholders	to	buy-back	their	shares	and	pursuant	
to	such	buy-back	offer,	had	bought	back	the	shares	by	
making	payments	to	the	shareholders.	Accordingly,	
NSE	 had	 issued	 an	 order	 removing	 the	 company	
from	 the	 Dissemination	 Board.	 The	 appellant	 did	
not	accept	the	letter	of	offer	and	chose	not	to	sell	the	
shares	back	to	the	company.	After	a	period	of	two	of	
completion	of	the	buy-back,	the	appellant	challenged	
the	same	and	inter	alia	contended	that	buy-back	offer	
made by the company was wholly illegal in as much 
as	the	circular	dated	April	17,	2015	and	October	10,	
2016	issued	by	SEBI	only	permitted	the	promoters	to	
buy-back	the	shares	and	did	not	allow	the	company	
to	buy-back	the	shares.	

 
While  dismissing  the  appeal,  the  Hon’ble 
SAT	held	that	SEBI	issued	a	circular	dated	July	25,	
2017	permitting	the	company	to	buy-back	its	shares	

so as to provide an exit to the public shareholders 
and	therefore	there	was	no	illegality	in	the	buy-back	
of	 shares	 made	 by	 the	 company	 and	 there	 was	 no	
reason to disturb the arrangement made two years 
ago	at	a	belated	stage.

IV.   SESSIONS COURT/SPECIAL COURT:

A. 

 Order dated 14.3.2019 in Cr. Case No. 10/2016- 
SEBI  Vs.  Golden  Land  Development  Ltd. 
(Judgment of  ASJ, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi) 

The	 accused	 company	 had	 launched	 an	
	
unregistered  Collective  Investment  Scheme  (CIS) 
and collected ` 60.25	crores	from	the	general	public.	
SEBI	 therefore	 filed	 a	 prosecution	 case	 against	 the	
company	and	its	directors	for	the	alleged	violation	of	
sections	11B,	12	(1B)	of	the	SEBI	Act,	1992	(SEBI	Act)	
read	with	regulations	5(1),	68(1),	68(2),	73	and	74	of	
SEBI	 (Collective	 Investment	 Scheme)	 Regulations,	
1999	 (“CIS	 Regulations”)	 punishable	 under	 section	
24(1)	of	the	SEBI	Act.	The	directors	were	also	accused	
in	respect	of	the	alleged	violations	in	terms	of	section	
27	of	SEBI	Act.		

	
The	Hon’ble	Court,	in	its	order	dated	March	14,	
2019,	observed	that	sub-section	(2)	of	Section	12(1B)	
contains absolute bar that no person could sponsor 
or cause to sponsor or carry on any venture or CIS 
scheme	without	obtaining	a	certificate	of	registration	
from	 SEBI	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 CIS	 Regulation.	
The	Hon’ble	Court	also	observed	that	the	company	
did	 not	 file	 the	 Winding-up	 and	 Repayment	
Report	in	spite	of	the	rejection	of	its	application	for	
registration and thus was running a CIS in violation 
of	SEBI	Act	and	CIS	Regulations.	The	requirement	of	
obtaining	a	certificate	of	registration	was	applicable	
in	 respect	 of	 persons	 carrying	 on	 business	 prior	
to	 January	 20,	 1995,	 as	 they	 could	 do	 continue	 to	
do	 so,	 after	 notification	 of	 regulations	 only	 after

guilty	of	violating	the	provisions	of	the	SEBI	Act	and	
CIS	Regulations	as	there	were	admitted	documents	
that  clearly  established  that  they  were  responsible 
for	 the	 conduct	 of	 the	 business	 and	 affairs	 of	 the

 JUDGMENT  OF  FEDERAL  COURT  OF 
AUSTRALIA IN THE MATTER OF PACL

SEBI	 vide	 its	 order	 dated	 August	 22,	 2014	
	
inter  alia,  directed  PACL  to  wind  up  the  existing 
schemes	 and	 refund	 `  49,100	 crore	 collected	 by	 it	
along  with  returns  due  to  the  investors  as  per  the 
terms	of	the	schemes.	Upon	PACL’s	failure	to	comply	
with	 the	 aforesaid	 direction,	 recovery	 proceedings	
were	 initiated	 wherein	 Recovery	 Officer,	 SEBI	 had	
issued	 Certificate	 No.	 832	 of	 2015	 dated	 December	
11,	 2015	 against	 PACL	 and	 its	 promoters/directors	
for	 recovery	 of	 a	 sum	 of	 `  49,100	 crore	 alongwith	
promised	returns,	further	interest,	all	costs,	charges

an	 investor	 group	 (Janlok).	 Trial	 of	 claim	 petition	
filed	by	SEBI	and	petition	filed	by	Janlok	before	the	
FCA	in	the	matter	was	concluded	in	April,	2018.	SEBI	
had claimed that the assets under litigation or their 
sale	proceeds	are	to	be	held	on	trust	for	the	Indian	
investors	in	PACL	and	be	released	to	SEBI.	

The	FCA	pronounced	judgment	in	the	matter	

	
on	July	20,	2018,	inter	alia,	holding	as	under:

i) 

ii)	

iii)	

iv)	

 that  SEBI  conducted  the  proceedings  with 
commendable	efficiency;	

	that	 SEBI	 has	 full	 right,	 interest,	 power	 and	
authority	 to	 seek	 a	 relief	 in	 Australia	 and	
therefore	locus	standi	of	SEBI	was	upheld	in	
this	regard;	

	that	 after	 analysing	 the	 scheme	 pursuant	 to	
which	 PACL	 collected	 funds	 from	 Indian	
investors	and	relying	on	the	report	of	Justice	
Ian	Callinan,	FCA	concluded	that	the	scheme	
operated	 by	 PACL	 is	 indeed	 a	 “collective	
investment	 scheme”	 and	 that	 the	 monies	
received	 by	 PACL	 from	 Indian	 investors	 are	
on	trust	for	those	investors;	

from	

the	 monies	 mobilised	

	that	
the	
investors	 was	 transferred	 by	 PACL	 to	 Pearls

2.  SEBI ORDERS

 Interim  Order  dated  April  27,  2018  in 
the  matter  of  Kalpa  Commercial  Limited 
(“KCL”):

SEBI  had  carried  out  an  examination  into 
 
the	 trading	 activity	 in	 the	 scrip	 of	 KCL	 and	 prima 
facie found	out	that	28	connected	entities	including	
one	 Mr.	 Abhishek	 Ashoka,	 Mr.	 Tejas	 Abhiram	
Nathwani,	 Managing	 Director	 of	 KCL,	 Mr.	 Sunil	
Kumar,	Additional	(Non	–	Executive	Independent)	
Director	 of	 the	 company,	 etc.,	 had	 employed	 a	
scheme	 for	 offloading	 a	 large	 number	 of	 shares	 of	
KCL	 in	 a	 fraudulent	 and	 manipulative	 manner.	
Such	 offloading	 was	 facilitated	 by	 group	 entities	
participated	
larger	 scheme	 of	 sending	
misleading  ‘buy’  recommendations  through  over 
3.42	 crore	 bulk	 Short	 Message	 Services	 (“SMSes”)	
designed  to  create  investor  interest  to  buy  those 
shares,	 in	 contravention	 of	 provisions	 of	 section	
12A	(a)	(b)	and	(c)	of	the	SEBI	Act	and	regulation	3	
(a),	(b),	(c)	and	(d)	and	regulation	4(1)	and	4(2)	(f)	
and	 (r)	 of	 the	 SEBI	 (Prohibition	 of	 Fraudulent	 and	
Unfair	Trade	Practices	relating	to	Securities	Market)	
Regulations,	2003.

in	 the	

	
Accordingly,	 SEBI	 passed	 an	 ad-interim	 ex-
parte	order	dated	April	27,	2018,	inter alia, prohibiting 
28	 connected	 entities	 listed	 therein	 from	 buying,	
selling or dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, 
in	 any	 manner	 whatsoever,	 till	 further	 directions.	
Further,	SEBI	also	directed	them	to	cease	and	desist	
from	 directly	 or	 indirectly	 disseminating	 messages	
or	news	in	any	form	related	to	the	securities	market.

B. 

 Interim  order  dated  May  29,  2018  in  the 
matter  of  F6  Finserve  Pvt.  Ltd.  (“F6”)  and 
others:

NSE	 forwarded	 to	 SEBI	 findings	 of	

	
its	
inspection	 of	 F6	 carried	 out	 during	 January	 2017.	
Considering	the	gravity	of	the	violations	observed,	

SEBI	 also	 conducted	 inspection	 of	 F6	 between	
August	10-30,	2017	for	the	period	April	01,	2015	to	
August	10,	2017	and	found	several	lapses/violations	
such	as	non-settlement	of	funds	of	inactive	clients,	
improper	 use/mis-utilisation	 of	 client	 funds,	 non-
segregation	 and	 mis-utilization	 of	 client	 securities,	
use	of	client	beneficiary	accounts	for	purposes	other	
than	specified,	taking	loans	against	clients’	securities,	
wrong	reporting	of	margin	collection	and	failure	to	
furnish	 information	 to	 the	 SEBI	 inspection	 team.	
Thereafter,	NSE	carried	out	another	inspection	of	F6	
during	January	2018	and	reported	several	violations	
to	SEBI.	These	acts	and	omissions	of	F6	noted	in	the	
inspections	of	SEBI	/	NSE	were	prima facie	found	to	be	
in	violation	of	the	provisions	of	SEBI	(Stock	Brokers	
and	 Sub-brokers)	 Regulations,	 1992	 and	 various	
Circulars	issued	by	SEBI.

 
Accordingly, SEBI issued directions including 
restraining	 F6,	 its	 commodities	 broking	 group	
company	 and	 their	 directors	 from	 accessing	 the	
securities	market	and	further	prohibited	them	from	
buying,  selling  or  otherwise  dealing  in  securities, 
either directly or indirectly, or being associated with 
the	securities	market	in	any	manner	whatsoever,	till	
further	directions.	The	entities	were	also	directed	to	
cease	 and	 desist	 from	 undertaking	 any	 activity	 in	
the	 securities	 market,	 directly	 or	 indirectly,	 in	 any	
manner	 whatsoever	 till	 further	 directions.	 Further,	
the	entities	were	directed	not	to	dispose	of	or	alienate	
any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any 
interest	or	investment	or	charge	in	any	of	such	assets	
excluding	money	lying	in	bank	accounts	except	with

between	 promoter	 entities,	 the	 transferor	 and	 the	
transferee	 promoter	 entities	 can	 be	 deemed	 to	 be	
‘persons	acting	in	concert’	in	terms	of	regulation	2(1)
(q)(2)	of	the	SEBI	(SAST	Regulations),	2011.	Placing	
reliance	 on	 the	 judgment	 of	 the	 Hon’ble	 Supreme	
Court	in	the	matter	of	Daiichi	Sankyo	Company	Ltd.	
vs.	Jayaram	Chigurupati	&	Ors.	(AIR	2010	SC	3089),	
it	was	held	that	since	the	transferor	and	the	transferee	
promoter entities did not have a common objective 
or	purpose	of	acquisition	but	were	rather	acting	in	
opposite directions, where one promoter entity had 
purchased  the  shares  and  another  entity  had  sold 
the  same  shares,  the  deeming  provision  provided 
under	regulation	2(1)(q)(2)	does	not	make	the	said	
promoter	 entities	 “persons	 acting	
in	 concert”.	
Another	 issue	 involved	 in	 the	 matter	 was	 whether	
any	 change	 in	 the	 individual	 shareholding	 of	 any	
acquirer entity, beyond the threshold limit prescribed 
under	 regulation	 3(1),	 would	 trigger	 open	 offer	
requirements,	even	if	the	overall	shareholding	of	the	
acquirer	 and	 PACs	 remains	 the	 same.	 Considering	
the	explicit	clarification	provided	in	regulations	3(3),	
the	question	was	decided	in	affirmative.

 Order  dated  July  27,  2018  in  respect  of  Mr. 
Nilesh Kapadia, Mr. Rajiv Sanghvi and Ors. 
in respect of front-running of HDFC Group’s 
trades:

	
SEBI	 had	 received	 references	 from	 BSE	
and	 NSE	 regarding	 suspected	 instances	 of	 front-
running	 of	 the	 orders	 of	 HDFC	 Mutual	 Fund	 and	
other	related	entities.	In	that	backdrop,	SEBI	carried	
out	a	detailed	investigation	in	the	matter	and	after	
completion	 thereof,	 SEBI	 vide	 ad  interim  ex  parte 
order	dated	January	15,	2016	issued	directions	in	the	
matter	to	Sanghvi	Group,	i.e.,	Mr.	Nilesh	Kapadia,	
Mr.	 Rajiv	 Sanghvi,	 Rajiv	 Sanghvi-HUF,	 Mr.	 Sanjay	
Sanghvi,	 Ms.	 Dipti	 Mehta	 and	 Ms.	 Sonal	 Sanghvi	
and	 Kalpana	 Group	 i.e.,	 Mr.	 Nilesh	 Kapadia	 and	
Ms.	 Kalpana	 Kapadia.	 The	 directions	 were	 inter 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

alia	 for	 impounding	 the	 unlawful	 gains	 of	 a	 sum	
of	 `  2,17,14,284/-	 (gain	 of	 `  1,05,02,417/-	 +	 interest	
of	 `  1,12,11,866/-)	 jointly	 and	 severally	 from	 the	
Sanghvi	 Group,	 and	 a	 sum	 of	 `  1,18,45,638/-	 (gain	
of	` 47,24,293/-	+	interest	of	` 71,21,345/-)	jointly	and	
severally	from	the	Kalpana	Group.

 
Aggrieved  by  the  said  order,  all  the  entities 
except	Ms.	Dipti	Mehta	filed	appeals	before	Hon’ble	
SAT.	Vide	order	dated	March	4,	2016,	Hon’ble	SAT	
disposed	of	the	appeals	and	permitted	the	appellants	
to sell the securities lying in their respective demat 
accounts  so  as  to  enable  them  to  deposit  only  the 
amount	 of	 undue	 profits	 set	 out	 in	 the	 impugned	
order	and	not	the	interest	amount.	All	the	contentions	
on	both	the	sides	were	kept	open.	Accordingly,	the	
entities	deposited	the	amount	of	undue	profit	as	set	
out	in	the	SEBI	order.

	
Thereafter,	 in	 view	 of	 the	 findings	 of	 the	
detailed  investigation,  a  show  cause  notice  dated 
February	 14,	 2017	 was	 issued	 to	 the	 entities.	 The	
entities	were	given	opportunities	to	file	their	replies/	
written	submissions	and	appear	for	personal	hearing	
which	were	availed	by	them.

	
After	consideration	of	the	submissions	of	the	
entities,	it	was	inter	alia	observed	by	SEBI	that	front	
running	is	a	fraud	against	the	securities	market	as	a	
whole	and	not	only	against	the	specific	person,	whose	
trades	 have	 been	 front	 run.	 The	 person,	 who	 does	
front	running,	makes	profit	not	only	at	the	expense	
of	the	person	being	front	run	but	also	at	the	expense	
of	 other	 investors	 in	 the	 market	 who	 incidentally	
suffer	 loss	 because	 of	 the	 transactions	 of	 the	 front	
runner.	Thus,	it	was	held	that	the	calculation	of	the	
profit	 has	 to	 be	 done	 from	 the	 perspective	 of	 the	
person	who	is	doing	front	running	and	not	from	the	
perspective	of	the	person	who	is	being	front	run.	It	
was	also	observed	that	SEBI	was	justified	in	levying	
interest	on	amount	of	ill-gotten	gains	which	had	to	
be	disgorged	from	the	Noticees.

SEBI	 found	 that	 the	 entities	 had	 violated

and	regulations	3	and	4	of	the	SEBI	(Prohibition	of

 Order  dated  July  27,  2018  in  respect  of  36 
entities  in  the  matter  of  M/s  SMS  Techsoft 
(India) Limited:

	
SEBI	passed	an	order	dated	July	27,	2018	in	the	
matter	of	SMS	Techsoft	Limited.	The	order	held	that	
on	March	13,	2012	SMS	Techsoft	Limited	(hereinafter	
referred	to	as	“SMS	Tech”)	had	allotted	3	crore	shares	
on	preferential	basis	to	31	connected	entities	without	
any	 actual	 consideration	 amount	 received	 by	 SMS	
Tech.	Thereafter,	in	November	2012	these	shares	were	
sub	divided	into	1:10	ratio	leading	to	creation	of	30	
crore	shares.	Subsequently,	the	preferential	allottees	
have	offloaded	22.21	crore	shares	in	the	market	from	
March	13,	2013	to	November	05,	2013.	Thereby	the	
preferential	allotees	had	earned	the	profit	of	` 6.79	
crore.	The	order	also	held	that	SMS	Tech	in	its	annual	
report	for	the	Financial	Year	(FY)	2011-12	and	2012-
13	had	misrepresented	its	financials	to	the	effect	that	 
` 30	crore	was	raised	by	way	of	preferential	allotment	
and	the	proceeds	of	the	preferential	allotment	was	
used	 for	 a	 land	 deal.	 Thus,	 the	 order	 held	 that	 36	
Noticees	had	violated	the	provisions	of	Section	12A	
(a),	(b),	(c)	of	SEBI	Act,	1992	read	with	Regulations	
3	(b),	(c),	(d),	4	(1),	(2)(a)	of	Securities	and	Exchange	
Board	 of	 India	 (Prohibition	 of	 Fraudulent	 and	
Unfair	Trade	Practices	Relating	to	Securities	Market)	
Regulations,	2003.

	
The	 said	 order	 dated	 July	 27,	 2018	 directs	
Noticees	 to	 disgorge	 an	 amount	 of	 `  6,78,85,716/-	
along  with  simple  interest  calculated  at  the  rate 

of	 12	 per	 cent	 per	 annum	 from	 the	 date	 of	 end	 of	
investigation	period	i.e.	November	05,	2013,	till	the	
date	of	payment	and	prohibits	the	Noticees	to	buy,	
sell	or	otherwise	deal	in	the	securities	market	in	any	
manner	whatsoever	or	access	the	securities	market,	
directly	or	indirectly,	for	a	period	of	10	(ten)	years

 Order in respect of Maithili N. Desai Family

was	 rejected	 by	 SEBI	 vide	 an	 Order	 dated	 July	 31,

b. 

 The	 inclusion	 of	 a	 clause	 in	 the	 Trust	 Deed	
providing	 for	 the	 management	 of	 the	 Trust	
being  vested  with  a  company  and  not  with

relatives	or	lineal	descendants;

 The	 inclusion	 of	 a	 clause	 in	 the	 Trust	 Deed	
providing	 for	 arbitration	 of	 disputes	
in	
accordance  with  the  Arbitration  Act,  which 
was	not	found	to	be	appropriate	in	the	context	
of	 the	 Hon’ble	 Supreme	 Court’s	 decision	 in	
the	 matter	 of	 Vimal	 Kishor	 Shah	 &	 Ors.	 vs.

 Order in respect of Vakrangee Holdings Pvt

entities	 of	 the	 Vakrangee	 Ltd,	 triggered	 an	 open

offer	 obligation	 under	 Regulation	 3	 of	 the	 SEBI	
(Substantial	 Acquisition	 of	 Shares	 and	 Takeovers)	
Regulations,	 2011	 (“Takeover	 Regulations”),	 by	
exceeding	the	threshold	limit	of	25	per	cent	of	total	
share	capital	of	the	company	on	May	27,	2013.

	
VHPL	inter-alia	submitted	that	it	was	a	person	
acting  in  concert  along  with  the  Promoters  and 
Dinesh	 Nandwana	 had	 the	 ultimate	 control	 over	
the	target	company.	Since	the	promoters	collectively	
already	held	more	than	25	per	cent,	the	noticee	could	
not be alleged to have independently triggered the 
Takeover	Regulations.	SEBI	in	its	order	dated	August	
9,	 2018	 held	 that	 Regulation	 3(3)	 unambiguously	
provides	that	acquisition	of	shares	or	voting	rights	
beyond	the	threshold	of	25	per	cent,	even	by	a	single	
entity	amongst	the	PACs	would	attract	the	obligation	
to	 make	 an	 open	 offer.	 The	 contention	 raised	 by	
the	 Noticee	 that	 VHPL	 was	 controlled	 by	 Dinesh	
Nandwana	 at	 the	 relevant	 time,	 would	 at	 best	 be	
a	 defence	 to	 counter	 an	 allegation	 levelled	 under	
Regulation	 4,	 but	 the	 same	 is	 not	 a	 valid	 defence	
for	an	allegation	under	Regulation	3,	where	specific	
threshold  is  stipulated  without  contemplating  or 
considering,  who  exercises  control  over  the  target 
company.

conducted  an 
the  alleged

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

the	 interests	 of	 the	 stakeholders	 of	 the	 company	
by	 approving	 incorrect	 and	 misstated	 financial	
results declared by the company without exercising 
adequate	due	diligence.	It	was	found	that	the	Noticees	
were	responsible	for	falsification	of	gold	purchases	
and	sales	in	the	books	of	accounts	of	the	company	
and were involved in accounting manipulations and 
created	a	misleading	picture	in	a	deceitful	manner	
to	influence	the	decision	of	investors	dealing	in	the	
securities	of	SCL	and	thereby	violated	the	provisions	
of	Regulations	3(a),	(c),	(d),	4(1),	4(2)	(e)	(k)	and	(r)	of	
Securities	and	Exchange	Board	of	India	(Prohibition	
of	 Fraudulent	 and	 Unfair	 Trade	 Practices	 Relating

Exchange	 Board	 of	 India	 Act,	 1992	 (hereinafter	
referred	to	as	the	“SEBI	Act”).

 
Accordingly, SEBI vide order dated September 
07,	2018	directed	Mr.	K.E.	Devarajan	to	ensure	that	
internal	records	of	the	SCL	reflect	the	correct	data	in	
respect	 of	 the	 impugned	 transactions	 and	 publish	
forthcoming	 quarterly	 filings	 before	 the	 stock	
exchanges	reflecting	the	changes.	Further,	SEBI	also	
restrained	the	Noticees	from	accessing	the	securities	
market	 and	 prohibited	 from	 buying,	 selling	 and	
dealing	 in	 securities	 market	 directly	 or	 indirectly	
for	a	period	of	five	years.	SEBI	also	restrained	from	
associating  themselves  or  holding  any  position 
with	 any	 listed	 public	 company	 and/or	 any	 public	
company	 which	 intends	 to	 raise	 money	 from	 the

within	 one	 financial	 year,	 without	 complying	 with	
the	 obligation	 under	 regulation	 3(2)	 of	 the	 SEBI	
(SAST)	Regulations,	2011,	to	make	an	open	offer	for	
shares	 of	 the	 Target	 Company	 in	 accordance	 with	
the	provisions	of	the	said	Regulations.	The	Noticees	
had	 sought	 relief	 from	 the	 obligation	 to	 make	 an	
open	offer	inter alia on the grounds that the shares 
in question were acquired by two promoter entities 
from	two	borrowers	against	adjustment	of	loans,	in	
order	 to	 arrange	 funds	 for	 the	 company	 and	 since	
the	company	was	sick	and	was	in	dire	need	of	funds	
for	 its	 revival,	 the	 obligation	 of	 open	 offer	 would	
jeopardize	the	future	prospects	of	the	company.	Vide	
order	dated	September	17,	2018,	SEBI	held	that	the	
provisions	of	the	SEBI	(SAST)	Regulations,	2011	do	
not	provide	for	an	exemption	to	any	acquisition	of	
shares	 from	 obligation	 of	 an	 open	 offer	 merely	 on	
the  ground  that  the  shares  were  received  by  the 
acquirer	in	lieu	of	settlement	of	loans.	It	was	further	
held	that	under	the	SEBI	(SAST)	Regulations,	2011,	
it	is	the	interest	of	the	investors	and	their	protection	
which	is	paramount	and	not	that	of	the	promoters.	
The	 shareholders’	 interest	 cannot	 be	 sacrificed	 at	
the	 altar	 of	 the	 company’s	 interest	 or	 that	 of	 its	
promoters.	According,	the	Noticees	were	directed	to	
make	an	open	offer	for	shares	of	the	target	company,	
in	accordance	with	the	provisions	of	the	SEBI	(SAST)	
Regulations,	2011.
J. 

 Order dated October 05, 2018 in the matter of 
Celestial Biolabs Limited:
	
SEBI	passed	an	Order	dated	October	05,	2018	
in	respect	of	Celestial	Biolabs	Ltd.,	its	Directors	and	
statutory	Auditor.	The	Order	held	that	the	company	
has  employed  deceptive  devices  by  projecting 
inflated	sales	in	Bio-IT	and	had	adopted	dubious	and	
inconsistent	 practices	 in	 drawing	 up	 accounts	 for	
manipulating	the	financial	results	of	the	company	to	
present a rosy picture to its shareholders and to the 
public	at	large.	It	was	noted	that	one	of	the	Directors	
was	the	Managing	Director	of	the	company	and	was	

also	the	controlling	Promoter	of	the	company,	holding	
along	with	his	family	members	38.06	per	cent	for	year	
ending	 March,	 2012	 while	 the	 other	 Director	 was	
also	part	of	the	Promoter	Group	wherein	she	along	
with	her	family	members	was	holding	38.06	per	cent	
for	the	year	ending	March,	2012.	Company	though	a	
legal	entity,	cannot	act	by	itself	and	would	not	have	
been able to draw up this elaborate scheme without 
its	Directors	and	statutory	Auditor	being	part	of	the	
manipulative	 and	 deceptive	 device.	 Therefore,	 the	
company,  its  Directors  and  statutory Auditor  have 
contravened	the	provisions	of	Section	12A	(b)	of	SEBI	
Act	 and	 Regulation	 3(c)	 and	 Regulations	 4(1)	 and	
4(2),(a),(e),(f),(k),	and	(r)	of	the	PFUTP	Regulations.	
It	was	also	held	that	by	virtue	of	showing	fake	sales	
in	 the	 Annual	 Reports,	 the	 company	 has	 violated	
Regulations	4(1)(a),	(b),	(c),	(d),	(e),	(g)	and	(j)	of	SEBI	
(Listing	 Obligations	 and	 Disclosure	 Requirements)	
Regulations,	 2015	 (LODR	 Regulations).	 It	 was	 also	
held	that	Directors	by	virtue	of	their	fraud	have	not	
performed	their	obligation	under	LODR	Regulations	
in question and they along with the company were 
liable	for	non-compliance	of	Regulations	4(1)(a),	(b),	
(c),	 (d),	 (e),	 (g)	 and	 (j)	 of	 LODR	 Regulations	 read	
with	 Regulation	 4	 (2)	 (f)	 (ii)	 (7)	 and	 (8)	 of	 LODR	
Regulations.

	
In	view	of	the	above	violations,	the	Company	
and  its  Directors  were,  inter-alia	 restrained	 from	
buying, selling or otherwise dealing in the securities 
market	 in	 any	 manner	 whatsoever	 or	 access	 the	
securities	market,	directly	or	indirectly,	for	a	period	
of	ten	years	from	the	date	of	the	order.	Further,	the	
Directors	 were	 also	 restrained	 from	 associating	
themselves with any listed public company and any 
public	company	which	intends	to	raise	money	from	
the public, or any intermediary registered with SEBI 
for	a	period	of	ten	years	from	the	date	of	the	order.	
The	 directions	 against	 the	 company	 and	 Directors	
were	 made	 contingent	 to	 them	 submitting	 a	 reply	
to	 the	 charge	 of	 violation	 of	 LODR	 Regulations

respect  of  V.  Srinivas,  G 
 Orders 
Ramakrishna and VS Prabhakara Gupta (all 
employees) and B. Ramalinga Raju, B Rama 
Raju,  B.  Suryanarayana  Raju  and  SRSR 
Holdings  Pvt.  Ltd.  (all  promoters)  in  the 
matter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd.

 
SEBI  had  earlier  passed  an  order  dated  July 
15,	2014	against	the	noticees,	in	the	context	of	them	
having	 orchestrated	 fraudulent	 and	 manipulative	
practices	by	falsifying	financial	statements	of	SCSL	
and	 for	 having	 made	 illegal	 gains	 by	 indulging	 in	
insider	trading	in	SCSL’s	shares.	SAT	passed	an	order	
dated	 May	 12,	 2017,	 upholding	 the	 findings	 in	 the	
said	SEBI	order	on	merits.	However,	it	remanded	the	
matter	to	SEBI	for	a	fresh	decision	on	the	quantum	
of	 illegal	 gain	 to	 be	 disgorged	 and	 the	 period	 of	
restraint	to	be	undergone.	Accordingly	two	separate	
orders	 were	 passed	 -	 one	 against	 the	 promoters	
(November	02,	2018)	and	one	against	the	employees	
(order	dated	October	16,	2018).	In	both	cases,	cost	of	
acquisition	(being	the	ESOP	strike	prices)	and	taxes,	
wherever	 provided	 were	 reduced	 from	 the	 illegal	
gain	 (as	 computed	 in	 the	 previous	 SEBI	 order).	 In	
the	case	of	one	of	the	employees	i.e.	VS	Prabhakara	
Gupta,	it	was	found	that	the	liability	of	Noticee	No.3	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

begins	only	from	August	2007	onwards	and	therefore	
the	quantum	of	illegal	gain	must	be	computed	only	
for	 the	 said	 period.	 With	 respect	 to	 the	 promoters	
it  was  also  concluded  that  the  liability  to  disgorge 
would	be	joint	and	several.	As	regards	the	period	of	
restraint,  while  the  direction  in  the  previous  SEBI 
order against promoters were not disturbed, in light 
of	the	relatively	lesser	role	of	Mr.	Gupta	in	the	fraud	
perpetrated	at	SCSL,	the	period	of	restraint	against	
him	was	reduced	to	four	years.	Accordingly,	while	
the	promoters	were	restrained	from	dealing	in	and	
accessing	 the	 securities	 market	 for	 a	 period	 of	 14	
years,	Mr.	VS	Prabhakara	Gupta	was	restrained	for	
a	 period	 of	 4	 years	 and	 the	 other	 two	 employees	
were	restrained	for	a	period	of	7	years.	The	aforesaid	
periods	 stand	 reduced	 by	 the	 period	 of	 restraint	
already	 suffered	 i.e.	 from	 the	 date	 of	 the	 previous	
SEBI	Order.

by	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited	 for	 the	 period	 of	 April	
01,	 2008	 to	 May	 31,	 2008	 which	 revealed	 that	
Sanraa	 Media	 Limited	 issued	 10.00	 million	 GDRs	
(amounting	to	USD	27.50	million)	on	May	02,	2008	
on	the	Luxembourg	Stock	Exchange.

	
The	 scrip	 of	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited	 was	
listed	on	BSE.	Clifford	Capital	Partners	A.G.S.A.,	a	
company	incorporated	in	the	British	Virgin	Islands	
was	the	only	subscriber	to	the	GDR	issue	and	that	
the  subscription  amount  was  paid  by  obtaining  a 
loan	facility	from	Banco	Elisa	S.F.E.,	S.A.	through	a	
Credit	 Agreement	 in	 April,	 2008.	 The	 loan	 facility	
was secured by Account Charge Agreement between 
Sanraa	Media	Limited	and	Banco	whereby	the	GDR	
issue	 proceeds	 were	 pledged	 to	 Banco	 for	 loan	
taken	 by	 Clifford	 Capital.	 The	 Credit	 Agreement	
was	entered	into	between	Clifford	Capital	Partners

A.G.S.A.	 and	 Banco	 for	 the	 specific	 purpose	 of	
subscribing	to	the	GDR	issue	by	SML.	The	Account	
Charge	Agreement	was	an	integral	part	of	the	Credit	
Agreement.	 The	 Account	 Charge	 Agreement	 was	
signed	 by	 the	 Chairman	 of	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited,	
on	its	behalf,	who	was	authorised	by	the	Board	of	
Directors	through	a	resolution	passed	in	one	of	its	
meeting	held	in	January,	2008.	The	Board	of	Directors	
in the same meeting had also approved a resolution 
authorizing	Banco	to	use	the	funds	as	deposited	in	
the	account	where	GDR	proceeds	were	to	be	credited	
as	 security	 in	 connection	 with	 any	 loan.	 The	 GDR	
issue	 would	 not	 have	 been	 subscribed	 if	 Sanraa	
Media	Limited	had	not	given	such	security	towards	
the	loan	taken	by	Clifford	Capital	Partners	A.G.S.A.	
Further,	 the	 fraudulent	 arrangement	 of	 Credit	
Agreement and Account Charge Agreement, which 
resulted	 in	 facilitating	 the	 subscription	 of	 GDR	
issue	of	the	company	was	not	disclosed	to	the	stock	
exchange.	SEBI	observed	that	information	regarding	
execution	 of	 Account	 Charge	 Agreement	 was	
material	information	about	contingent	liability	to	the	
extent	of	proceeds	from	GDR	issue.	Suppression	of	
such	material	information	shows	that	the	corporate	
announcement  was  primarily  meant  to  mislead 
Indian	 retail	 investors	 that	 GDRs	 were	 genuinely	
subscribed,	 whereas	 in	 reality,	 the	 GDR	 issue	 was	
facilitated	by	SML	itself.

	
SEBI	also	observed	that	Sanraa	Media	Limited	
requested	 transfer	 of	 an	 amount	 of	 USD	 27.244	
million	to	Clifford	Capital	Partners	A.G.S.A	towards	
repayment	 of	 the	 loan	 taken	 by	 Clifford	 Capital	
Partners	 A.G.S.A	 for	 subscription	 of	 GDR’s	 issued	
by	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited.	 On	 account	 of	 default	
on	repayment	of	loan	obtained	by	Clifford	Capital	
Partners	 A.G.S.A,	 GDR	 proceeds	 were	 set	 off	 by	
Banco.	 Therefore,	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited	 did	 not	
receive	consideration	for	the	GDR	issue	to	the	extent	
of	US$	27.244	million.

	
SEBI	 passed	 order	 dated	 January	 02,	 2019	
wherein	 it	 held	 that	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited,	 its	
directors	 and	 Sanraa	 Media	 Limited	 had	 violated	
that	 sections	 12A	 (a),(b)	 and	 (c)	 of	 SEBI	 Act,	 1992	
read	 with	 Regulations	 3(a),	 (b),	 (c),	 (d)	 and	 4(1)	 of	
SEBI	 (Prohibition	 of	 Fraudulent	 and	 Unfair	 Trade	
Practices	relating	to	Securities	Market)	Regulations,	
2003.

	
In	 the	 order	 dated	 January	 02,	 2019,	 SEBI	
directed	Sanraa	Media	Limited	to	recover	a	sum	of	
US	 $27.244	 million	 from	 Clifford	 Capital	 Partners	
A.G.S.A.	and	bring	back	the	money	into	Sanraa	Media	
Limited’s	bank	account	in	India	within	three	months	
from	 the	 date	 of	 SEBI’s	 order.	 SEBI	 also	 directed	
that	the	directors	of	the	company	shall	ensure	and	
facilitate	 the	 compliance	 of	 the	 direction	 issued	 to	
Sanraa	 Media	 Limited,	 and	 furnish	 a	 Certificate	
from	 a	 peer	 reviewed	 Chartered	 Accountant	 of	
ICAI along with necessary documentary evidences 
to	 SEBI,	 certifying	 the	 compliance	 of	 the	 direction,	
within	three	months	from	the	date	of	SEBI’s	order.	
Sanraa	Media	Limited	and	its	directors	along	with	
Clifford	Capital	were	also	debarred	from	accessing	
the	capital	markets.

 Final  Order  in  the  matter  of  Shreekrishna 
Biotech Ltd.

	
An	investigation	into	the	scrip	of	Shreekrishna	
Biotech	Ltd.	for	the	period	from	November	1,	2012	
to	 July	 31,	 2015	 revealed	 that	 certain	 entities	 had	
devised	a	scheme	to	manipulate	the	price	of	the	scrip	
by	squeezing	the	supply	of	the	shares	in	the	market.	
In	the	instant	matter,	it	was	observed	that	a	director	of	
the	company	transferred	the	shares	of	the	company	
in	 off-market	 deals,	 directly	 or	 indirectly,	 to	 eight	
entities,	 who	 were	 found	 to	 be	 connected/related	
with	each.	The	entities	who	had	received	shares	dealt	
in  a  unique  way  by  repeatedly  placing  sell  orders

in	very	small	quantities	on	the	trading	platform	of	
the	stock	exchange	at	a	price	much	higher	than	the	
Last	Traded	Price	(LTP),	while	buy	orders	for	large	
quantities	were	pending	in	the	system.	I	t	was	not	
found	 that	 no	 two	 person	 amongst	 the	 connected	
persons placed sell orders on the same day and the 
trades	of	these	entities	contributed	81.44	per	cent	to	
positive	LTP	in	the	market	which	caused	abnormal	
increase	in	the	price	of	the	scrip.

	
In	 view	 of	 the	 above,	 vide	 order	 dated	
January	31,	2019,	it	was	found	that	the	trades	of	the	
Noticees	in	the	scrip	were	fraudulent	and	unfair	and	
were not executed in the normal course dealing in 
securities.	 The	 Noticees	 were	 therefore	 restrained	
from	 accessing	 the	 securities	 market	 and	 were	
further	prohibited	from	buying,	selling	or	otherwise	
dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, or being 
associated	with	the	securities	market	in	any	manner,	
whatsoever,	for	a	period	of	three	years,	from	the	date	
of	the	order.

 Final Order in the matter of Maitreya Plotters 
and Structures Pvt. Ltd.

 
It was revealed during the investigation that 
Maitreya	Plotters	and	Structures	Pvt.	Ltd.	(MPSPL)	
and	its	directors,	Ms.	Varsha	Madhusudan	Satpalkar	
and	Mr.	Janardan	Arvind	Parulekar,	had	mobilized	
an	 amount	 of	 `  1,775	 crore	 (till	 August	 30,	 2013)	
under	 various	 schemes	 offered	 by	 MPSPL	 to	 the	
public.	The	funds	were	received	from	the	investors	
towards	 schemes	 involving	 booking,	 purchase	 and	
development	of	plots	of	land	with	option	of	returns.	
The	 company	 was	 offering	 to	 sell	 plots	 of	 land	
without	identifying	and	specifying	any	detail	of	plot	
except	for	the	plot	size.	The	contributions	received	
from	the	investors	under	the	garb	of	sale	of	plots	of	
land were pooled and the investor did not have any 
control	over	day	to	day	management	of	the	pooled	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

funds	 and	 the	 land	 placed	 under	 the	 scheme	 or	
arrangement.

	
During	 the	 course	 of	 inquiry,	 based	 on	 the	
material	 available	 on	 record,	 it	 was	 found	 that	 the	
company  and  its  directors  had  indulged  in  illegal 
mobilization	 of	 funds	 from	 the	 public	 through	
schemes	 in	 the	 nature	 of	 Collective	 Investment	
Schemes	without	obtaining	certificate	of	registration	
from	SEBI	and	thus	had	contravened	section	12(1B)	
read	 with	 Section	 11AA	 of	 the	 SEBI	Act,	 1992	 and	
regulation	 3	 of	 the	 SEBI	 (Collective	 Investment	
Schemes)	 Regulations,	 1999.	 Therefore,	 vide	 order	
dated	January	31,	2019	they	were	directed,	inter-alia,	
to	wind	up	the	schemes	offered	by	the	company	and	
refund	the	contributions	collected	from	the	investors.

O. 

 Order in the matter of REIL Electricals India 
Ltd (REIL)

	
REIL	 sought	 exemption	 from	 the	 provisions	
of	Regulation	27(3)	(c)	&	(d)	of	the	SEBI	(Delisting	
of	 Equity	 Shares)	 Regulations,	 2009,	 dealing	 with	
special	provisions	for	small	companies	which	states	
that	at	least	ninety	per	cent	of	the	public	shareholders	
should	give	positive	consent	in	a	matter	of	voluntary	
delisting.	 SEBI	 vide	 order	 dated	 February	 04,	 2019	
acceded  to  the  request  considering  inter  alia  the 
following-

(i)	

(ii)	

(iii)	

	The	 company’s	 equity	 shares	 were	 listed	
around	40	years	before.

	The	alleged	non-compliance	was	a	pre-existing	
one  and  not  a  wanton  breach  subsequent 
to  amendment  to  the  norms  in  Securities 
Contracts	(Regulation)	Rules,	1957.

	The	poor	financial	condition	of	the	company	
and	 the	 inadequate	 potential	 for	 its	 revival	
would	 mean	 that	 investors	 are	 unlikely	 to	
evince	 interest	 in	 acquiring	 shares	 of	 the

company	 making	 it	 almost	 impossible	 for	
the	 company	 to	 be	 in	 compliance	 with	 MPS	
norms.

(iv)	

	The	 percentage	 of	 public	 shareholding	 is	
only	around	1.81	per	cent	and	several	public	
shareholders  remain  untraceable  despite  the 
company’s	best	efforts.

(v)	

	There	 are	 no	 investor	 grievances	 as	 on	 date	
pending	against	the	company.

 Order dated February 22, 2019 in respect of 
India  Infoline  Commodities  Limited  (Now 
known  as  “IIFL  Commodities  Limited”); 
Order dated February 22, 2019 in respect of 
Motilal Oswal Commodities Broker Private 
Limited;  Order  dated  February  25,  2019 
in  respect  of  Anand  Rathi  Commodities 
Limited;  Order  dated  February  25,  2019 
in  respect  of  Geofin  Comtrade  Limited 
(formerly  known  as  “Geojit  Comtrade 
Limited);  Order  dated  February  27,  2019  in 
respect  of  Phillip  Commodities  India  Pvt. 
Ltd.  (Formerly  known  as  “MF  Global  SIFY 
Securities India Ltd.”):
	
The	 orders	 held	 that	 considering	 the	 facts	
and	 circumstances	 of	 the	 case	 and	 since	 the	
Noticee	 has	 applied	 for	 registration	 to	 SEBI,	 for	
the	purpose	of	granting	registration	to	the	Noticee	
to	act	as	a	commodity	derivatives	broker,	SEBI	has	
jurisdiction	 to	 determine	 whether	 the	 Noticee	 is	 a	
fit	and	proper	person	to	act	as	a	commodity	broker.	
The	order	notes	that	the	concept	of	a	fit	and	proper	
person	 has	 a	 very	 wide	 amplitude.	 In	 order	 to	
determine	 the	 Fit	 and	 Proper	 status	 of	 Person,	 as	
per	Schedule	II	of	Securities	and	Exchange	Board	of	
India	(Intermediaries	Regulations),	2008	(hereinafter	
referred	 to	 as	 “Intermediaries	 Regulations”),	 the	
Board	 may	 take	 into	 account	 of	 any	 consideration	

including  integrity,  reputation,  competence  and 
character	of	the	Noticee.	The	said	order	states	that	
the	following	two	parameters	would	be	enough	for	
the	Board	to	ascertain	the	reputation	of	the	Noticee	
in	order	to	determine	the	Fit	and	Proper	status	of	the	
Noticee:
(a)	

	The	 existence	 of	 material,	 if	 any,	 adversely	
impacting	the	reputation	of	the	Noticee	or	its	
close	associates,	even	if	such	material	is	prima	
facie	in	nature.
	The	 existence	 of	 a	 close	 association	 or	 even	
prima	facie	evidence	of	a	close	association,	if	
any,	 of	 the	 Noticee	 with	 a	 person	 who	 does	
not	enjoy	a	good	reputation.

(b)	

	
The	 said	 order	 finds	 that	 various	 Courts	
and Authorities  in  the  country  have  made  serious 
adverse	 observations	 against	 NSEL	 and	 Paired	
Contracts, observing the transactions to be violative 
of	 the	 Forward	 Contracts	 (Regulation)	 Act,	 1952	
(hereinafter	referred	to	as	“FCRA“)	and	to	be	in	the	
nature	of	financing	transactions	that	were	violative	
of	Maharashtra	Protection	of	Interest	of	Depositors	
(in	Financial	Establishments)	Act,	1999	(hereinafter	
referred	 to	 as	 MPID	 Act)	 Act.	 Such	 adverse	
observations	 made	 by	 various	 Courts	 /	 Competent	
Authorities  had  seriously  impacted  the  reputation 
and	belief	in	competence,	fairness,	honesty,	integrity	
of	NSEL	and	paired	contracts.	The	Noticee,	by	virtue	
of	 being	 a	 broker,	 and	 by	 its	 own	 admission,	 has	
facilitated	transactions	in	the	said	Paired	Contracts	
for	 its	 clients	 on	 the	 NSEL	 platform.	 This	 in	 itself	
establishes	a	close	association	between	the	Noticee	
on	 the	 one	 hand	 and	 Paired	 Contracts	 and	 NSEL	
on	 the	 other.	 Further,	 the	 order	 holds	 that	 Noticee	
allowed	itself	to	become	a	channel	and	instrument	
for	 NSEL	 to	 promote	 Paired	 Contracts	 amongst	
its	 clients.	 The	 Order	 further	 states	 that	 the	 close	
association	 of	 the	 Noticee	 to	 NSEL	 and	 the	 Paired	

220

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Contracts,	 and	 the	 relatability	 of	 the	 same	 to	 the	
Noticee,	 had	 seriously	 eroded	 the	 reputation	 and	
belief	in	competence,	fairness,	honesty,	integrity	and	
character	of	the	Noticee.	Reputation	is	an	important	
factor	 for	 consideration	 of	 Fit	 and	 Proper	 Criteria	
and	the	reputation	of	the	Noticee	has	been	seriously	
eroded.	Thus,	the	order	held	that	the	Noticee	is	not	
a	fit	and	proper	person	to	be	granted	registration/	to	
operate	as	a	commodity	derivatives	broker.

	
The	said	order	declare	that	the	Noticee	is	not	a	
fit	and	proper	person	to	hold,	directly	or	indirectly,	the	
certificate	 of	 registration	 as	 commodity	 derivatives	
broker,	and	hereby,	reject	the	application	filed	by	the	
Noticee	 for	 registration	 as	 commodity	 derivatives	
broker.	 The	 order	 further	 held	 that	 Noticee	 shall	
cease  to  act,  directly  or  indirectly,  as  a  commodity 
derivatives	broker.

Q. 

Final order in the matter of Polytex India Ltd.

	
Polytex	 India	 Ltd.,	 whose	 shares	 are	 listed	
on  BSE  witnessed  an  abnormal  movement  in  its 
price	 and	 trading	 volume	 without	 any	 significant	
change	 in	 the	 fundamentals	 of	 the	 Company.	 The	
investigation	 by	 SEBI	 revealed	 that	 a	 group	 of	
entities	 had	 engaged	 in	 creating	 artificial	 trading	
volume	 of	 the	 shares	 of	 the	 Company	 (trading	
entities)	and	another	group	of	entities,	who	had	been	
restrained	 (restrained	 entities)	 by	 an	 order	of	 SEBI	
from	 accessing	 the	 securities	 market,	 have	 funded	
the	trading	entities.

	
After	giving	a	show	cause	notice	and	personal	
hearing	 to	 the	 Noticees,	 SEBI	 has	 passed	 order	
dated	February	27,	2019,	finding	that	the	restrained	
entities	 had	 continuously	 provided	 funds	 from	
time	to	time	to	the	trading	entities	for	meeting	their	
pay-in	 obligations	 for	 trading	 in	 scrips	 including	
Polytex	and	the	funds	received	pursuant	to	the	sale	
of	 securities	 were	 transferred	 back	 by	 the	 trading	
entities	to	the	account	of	restrained	entities,	showing	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

direct and immediate nexus between the trades and 
the	fund	transfers.	Funding	the	trades	of	the	trading	
entities	by	the	restrained	entities	were	in	violation	of	
the earlier restraint order and considering that a large 
portion	 of	 these	 trades	 were	 in	 the	 nature	 of	 self-
trades	&	reversal	of	trades	have	been	found	to	have	
indirectly	traded	in	the	securities	market	in	violation	
of	provisions	of	SEBI	(Prohibition	of	Fraudulent	and	
Unfair	Trade	Practices	relating	to	Securities	Market)	
Regulations,	2003.

The	 restrained	 entities,	 were,	

	
therefore,	
vide	 order	 dated	 February	 27,	 2019	 directed	 to	 be	
restrained	from	accessing	the	securities	market	and	
further	 prohibited	 them	 from	 buying,	 selling	 or	
otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, 
or	being	associated	with	the	securities	market	in	any	
manner,	whatsoever,	for	a	period	of	seven	years.

 Final Order in the matter of Jagran Prakashan 
Ltd.

 
SEBI  had  conducted  an  investigation  in  the 
trading	 activity	 of	 certain	 entities	 in	 the	 scrip	 of	
Jagran	Prakashan	Limited	for	the	period	August	01,	
2009	to	October	31,	2009.	Upon	such	investigation,	
SEBI	 observed	 that	 Mr.	 Amit	 Jaiswal,	 Company	
Secretary	&	Compliance	Officer	of	Jagran	Prakashan	
Limited	 and	 his	 wife,	 Ms.	 Mansi	 Jaiswal	 had	
traded	 in	 the	 shares	 of	 Jagran	 Prakashan	 Limited	
while	 in	 possession	 of	 unpublished	 price	 sensitive	
information	and	made	unlawful	gains	in	the	process.

	
SEBI	 passed	 an	 ad-interim	 ex-parte	 order	
dated	 November	 20,	 2015	 impounding	 the	 alleged	
illegal	 gains	 of	 `  10,41,005/-	 made	 by	 the	 Noticees	
with	a	direction	to	the	Noticees	not	to	dispose	of	or	
alienate	 any	 of	 their	 assets/	 properties/	 securities	
till	the	aforesaid	amount	is	credited	into	an	escrow	
account.	 The	 aforesaid	 impounded	 amount	 was

A	show	cause	notice	was	issued	to	Mr.	Amit	
Jaiswal	 and	 Ms.	 Mansi	 Jaiswal.	 After	 considering	
their replies and hearing the submissions made by 
their authorized representatives, SEBI passed order 
dated	March	14,	2019	wherein	it	held	that	Mr.	Amit	
Jaiswal	 has	 violated	 of	 Regulation	 3(i)	 and	 (ii)	 of	
SEBI	 (Prohibition	 of	 Insider	 Trading)	 Regulations,	
1992	 read	 with	 Regulation	 12	 of	 SEBI	 (Prohibition	
of	 Insider	 Trading)	 Regulations,	 2015	 and	 Section	
12A	(d)	&	(e)	of	SEBI	Act	and	Ms.	Mansi	Jaiswal	has	
violated	Regulation	3(i)	of	SEBI	(Prohibition	of	Insider	
Trading)	Regulations,	1992	read	with	Regulation	12	
of	SEBI	(Prohibition	of	Insider	Trading)	Regulations,	
2015	and	Section	12A	(d)	&	(e)	of	SEBI	Act.

In	the	order	dated	March	14,	2019,	SEBI	also	
	
directed	that	an	amount	of	` 10,41,005/-	impounded	
by	SEBI	vide	its	interim	order	dated	November	20,	
2015	from	Mr.	Amit	Jaiswal	and	Ms.	Mansi	Jaiswal	
shall  be  disgorged  and  credited  to  the  Investor 
Protection	 and	 Education	 Fund	 established	 by	 the	
Board	 under	 Securities	 and	 Exchange	 Board	 of	
India	 (Investor	 Protection	 and	 Education	 Fund)	
Regulations,	2009.

S. 

 Final order dated March 18, 2019 in the matter 
of  the  Canning  Industries  Cochin  Limited 
(“CAICO”) and others:

SEBI  passed  an  interim  order  dated  August 
 
9,	 2017	 against	 CAICO	 and	 its	 past	 and	 present	
directors	 and	 Debentures	 Trustee	 in	 respect	 of	 an	
issue	of	Fully	Convertible	Debentures	(FCDs).	SEBI	
prima  facie  observed	 that	 CAICO	 through	 the	 offer	
of	FCDs	raised	an	amount	of	` 2.83	crore	from	335	
allottees	 during	 the	 financial	 year	 2015-2016.	 The	
said	offer	of	FCDs	was	prima facie found	to	be	in	the	
nature	of	deemed	public	issue	under	Section	42	of	the	
Companies	Act,	2013	read	with	Rule	14	(2)	(b)	of	the	
Companies	(Prospectus	and	Allotment	of	Securities)	
Rules,	2014	and	therefore	in	violation	of	respective	
provisions	of	the	SEBI	Act,	1992,	the	Companies	Act,	

2013	and	the	rules	and	regulations	made	thereunder	
including	 SEBI	 (Issue	 of	 Capital	 and	 Disclosure	
Requirements),	Regulations,	2009.

	
Taking	 into	 consideration	 of	 the	 legal	 and	
factual	circumstances	of	the	case,	SEBI	concluded	that	
CAICO	came	with	an	offer	of	FCDs	to	1,929	persons	
(members	 of	 the	 Company)	 and	 allotted	 FCDs	 to	
335	persons	during	the	financial	year	2015-2016	and	
raised	an	amount	of	` 2.83	crore.	It	was	also	held	that	
the	term	FCDs	are	covered	under	expression	“Shares	
or	other	securities”	as	per	the	Explanation	(ii)	to	Rule	
13	of	the	Companies	(Share	Capital	and	Debentures)	
Rules,	 2014	 and	 hence	 Explanation	 ii	 to	 Rule	 13(1)	
which	mandates	compliance	of	conditions	stipulated	
in	Section	42	of	the	Companies	Act,	2013	is	applicable	
to	 the	 said	 issue	 of	 FCDs	 on	 preferential	 basis	 to	
existing	members	of	the	Company.	As	the	Offer	of	
FCDs	 made	 by	 the	 Company	 was	 more	 than	 200	
persons,	the	same	is	a	deemed	to	be	“public	issue”	
as	envisaged	under	Section	42(4)	of	the	Companies	
Act,	2013	read	with	Rule	14(2)	(b)	of	the	Companies	
(Prospectus	and	Allotment	of	Securities)	Rules	2014.	
Since	the	Offer	of	FCDs	is	deemed	to	be	public	issue	
the  Company  was  mandated  to  comply  with  the 
‘public  issue’  norms  as  prescribed  under  the  SEBI 
Act	and	Companies	Act,	2013	which	it	failed	to	do.	
CAICO	failed	to	make	an	application	to	one	or	more	
stock	exchanges	and	the	prospectus	was	required	to	
state	the	name	of	such	stock	exchange	under	Section	
40(1)	and	(2)	of	the	Companies	Act,	2013.	CAICO	has	
also	failed	to	keep	the	monies	received	on	application	
from	 the	 public	 for	 subscription	 to	 the	 securities	
in	 a	 separate	 bank	 account	 under	 Section	 40(3)	 of	
the	Companies	Act,	2013.	CAICO	has	also	failed	to	
comply	with	the	provisions	of	ICDR	Regulations	for	
the	said	issue	and	allotment	of	FCDs.

	
As	 a	 consequence	 of	 violation	 of	 “deemed	
public	 issue	 norms”	 envisaged	 under	 Companies	
Act,	 2013	 read	 with	 ICDR	 Regulations,	 SEBI	 in

 Order dated March 27, 2019 in the matter of 
Aplaya Creations Limited:

	
SEBI	 passed	 Order	 dated	 March	 27,	 2019	 in	
respect	 of	Aplaya	 Creations	 Ltd.,	 its	 Directors	 and	
two	related	entities	of	the	company.	The	Order	held	
that	 after	 the	 company	 came	 out	 with	 preferential	
allotment,	 the	 price	 of	 the	 scrip	 was	 artificially	
manipulated  by  price  manipulators,  connected 
to	 the	 company.	 A	 factor	 that	 enabled	 the	 price	
manipulators  in  their  manipulation  was  that  the 
shares	available	for	trading	in	the	demat	form	was	
controlled	 by	 ACL/	 Promoter	 and	 its	 connected	
entities.	 At	 a	 subsequent	 stage,	 the	 preferential	
allottees	were	provided	exit	at	the	manipulated	price	
by  the  exit  providers  who  were  also  connected  to 
the	 company.	 These	 acts	 of	 preferential	 allotment,	
price	manipulation	and	subsequent	providing	of	exit	
constitutes	 a	 scheme.	 The	 company,	 its	 Directors,	
and  price  manipulators  and  exit  providers  played 
their  respective  roles  in  order  to  constitute  the 
above	scheme	to	operate	as	fraud	in	connection	with	
dealing in securities which undermined the integrity 
of	the	trading	system	of	the	Exchange	hampering	the	
price	discovery.	The	scheme	has	in	effect	resulted	in	
benefit	 to	 the	 preferential	 allottees.	 Therefore,	 the	
company,	its	Non-Executive	and	Non-	Independent	
Directors  and  the  price  manipulators  connected  to 
the	 company	 have	 contravened	 the	 provisions	 of	

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

Regulations	 3(a),	 (b),	 (c),	 (d)	 and	 Regulations	 4(1),	
4(2)	(a)	and	(e)	of	PFUTP	Regulations.

	
In	view	of	the	above	violations,	company,	its	
Non-Executive	and	Non-	Independent	Directors	and	
the  price  manipulators  connected  to  the  company 
were,  inter-alia	 restrained	 from	 from	 accessing	 the	
securities	market	for	a	period	of	eight	years	from	the	
date	of	the	order	and	were	further	prohibited	from	
buying,  selling  or  otherwise  dealing  in  securities, 
directly  or  indirectly,  or  being  associated  with 
the	 securities	 market	 in	 any	 manner,	 whatsoever,	
for	 a	 period	 of	 eight	 years,	 from	 the	 date	 of	 the	
order..	 Further,	 the	 Directors	 were	 also	 restrained	
from	associating	themselves	with	any	listed	public	
company  and  any  public  company  which  intends 
to	raise	money	from	the	public,	or	any	intermediary

the	date	of	the	order.

Review of Recruitment Policy

The 

 
recruitment  policy  of  SEBI  was 
comprehensively  reviewed  to  make  it  more  robust 
and  efficient  with  a  view  to  attract  the  best  talent 
available  in  the  market.  The  review  was  carried 
out  after  studying  the  systems  adopted  by  other 
regulatory agencies as well as UPSC.

 
An  additional  phase  of  screening  has  been 
introduced as part of the process in order to select 
meritorious candidates for appointment as Officers 
in  Grade  ‘A’  The  recruitment  process  now  has 
three  phases:  the  first  phase  is  a  screening  exam 
and  the  second  phase  is  the  main  exam,  followed 
by an interview in the third phase. The candidates 
who  clear  the  cut-offs  in  Phase  I  appear  for  Phase 
II  and  candidates  who  clear  the  cut-offs  in  Phase 
II  are  shortlisted  for  the  interview.  The  number  of 
candidates  shortlisted  is  based  on  the  number  of 
vacancies.

 
To  have  a  larger  pool  of  candidates  for 
selection,  maximum  age  limit  for  a  candidate  to 
apply for the post of Officer in Grade ‘A’ has been 
increased to 30 years as against the earlier age limit 
of  27  years.  Further,  to  avail  talent  from  across 
disciplines,  the  minimum  educational  qualification 
in  the  General  Stream  was  relaxed  to  include

Hindi  was  used  as  a  means  of  communication  in 
7,742  programmes  conducted  by  SEBI  empanelled 
resource  persons;  in  16  awareness  programmes 
conducted  by  Commodities  Derivatives  Trainers; 
in  59  regional  seminars  conducted  in  association 
with  stock  exchanges,  depositories  and  other 
institutions; in 87 awareness programmes conducted 
in  association  with  investors’  associations  as  well 
as in 172 “Visit to SEBI” programmes. Thus, Hindi 
and  other  regional  languages  were  used  as  means 
of  communication  in  around  94  per  cent  of  the 
programmes conducted during the year, so that the 
investors participating in such programmes may be 
apprised of various aspects of securities markets in 
the languages they feel comfortable with. This will 
certainly help them to take well-informed decision 
while  making  investments.  Furthermore,  SEBI  Toll 
Free Helpline for investor assistance is also available 
in Hindi and other regional languages.

5.   INTERNAL INSPECTION DEPARTMENT (IID)

PART FOUR: Organizational Matters

Internal  inspection  is  equivalent  to  an  internal 
 
audit system and plays a significant role in assisting the 
management of any organization in evaluating whether 
the duties are being discharged in an effective and efficient 
manner.

 
In this backdrop, Internal Inspection Department 
(IID)  was  formed  in  SEBI  in August  2017  to  carry  out 
periodic inspections / reviews of the various Departments 
of SEBI. The role of IID is to ensure that each Department 
/  Division  is  complying  with  the  laid  down  SEBI  
benchmarks  /  timelines,  guidelines  and  procedures. 
Another aspect of internal inspections is to check whether 
there are effective supervision systems in the Departments 
/  Divisions  and  to  make  recommendations  to  improve 
their functioning and systems and procedures.

Since setting up, IID has completed comprehensive 
 
inspections of three of the largest Departments in SEBI. 
Further,  theme  based  focussed  inspections  of  five 
Departments have been carried out.

IID  made 

for 

recommendations 

 
further 
improvement  of  the  working  of  the  Departments  / 
Divisions  after  considering  their  comments  on  findings 
of the inspections. The recommendations made by IID in 
all these Departments / Divisions have been accepted and 
corrective steps have been taken by them.

 
Apart  from  regular  inspections,  IID  will  also  
develop the mechanism for monitoring the implementation 
of  its  recommendations  by  various  Departments  / 
Divisions.

7.   INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

OBJECTIVES

During the year, the Information Technology 

 
(IT) Department set itself three key objectives:

a. 

b. 

c. 

 Strategic  deployment  of  technology  within 
SEBI  to  create  significant  impact  on  the 
effectiveness  and  productivity  of  its  key 
operational  and  administrative  departments, 
while  building  a  secure  and  resilient  IT 
infrastructure.

 Partnership  with  the  key  market  facing 
departments  to  facilitate  Ease  of  Doing 
Business for all market participants, while co-
creating policies to ensure both, a secure cyber 
ecosystem in the securities market, as well as 
an encouraging environment for innovation.

 Create  a  Hub  and  Spoke  Model  for  data 
analytics capability within SEBI, with the Hub 
residing in IT department and spokes residing 
in each and every operational department of 
SEBI.

 
In  order  to  achieve  these  objectives,  IT 
department  drew  up  a  four  year  IT  roadmap  that 
was  approved  by  the  Board  and  various  projects 
have been initiated, which are at different stages of 
planning and implementation.

II. 

COMMITTEES

In 

line  with  SEBI’s  strong 

 
tradition  of 
consultation and seeking of expert advice in every 
area of its work, SEBI has four advisory committees, 
in the technology area, with distinguished members 
having  significant  experience  and  insight  in  IT 
matters 
including  practitioners,  regulators  and 
academics. These four committees are:

a. 

 Project  Advisory  Committee  that  advises 
SEBI  on  it  various  IT  projects  right  from 
conceptualization 
to

Padma  Shri  with  a  focus  on  implementation,  it 
partners MRD in the other three committees in order 
to create a synergistic blend of domain and IT inputs 
in policy formulation.

III.  POLICY FORMULATION

 
Given the increasing criticality of Information 
Technology and Data Analytics in the functioning of 
the securities market, during the year, SEBI came out 
with a number of policies in this space:
a. 

 Data  Sharing  Policy:  Adopting  a  view  that 
free and easy availability of data is a critical 
building  block  not  only  for  transparency  in 
the markets, but also for encouraging research 
and innovation, SEBI published its first Data 
Sharing Policy in October 2018.

b. 

 Circular  on  Innovation  Sandbox:  In  order  to 
encourage innovation irrespective of its place 
of origin, this circular seeks to provide access 
to test environments and test data of the key 
Market  Infrastructure  Institutions  including 
stock 
corporations, 

exchanges, 

clearing

depositories  and  Qualified  Registrar  and 
Transfer Agents, to a wide variety of persons 
including startups and entities not otherwise 
registered with or regulated by SEBI.

 Circular on Regulatory Sandbox: Adopting a 
view that certain innovations in technology and 
process need to be tested in live environments 
and the results need to be reviewed in order 
to  assess  the  suitability  of  possible  changes 
in  policy  and  regulation,  this  circular  seeks 
to  provide  such  an  opportunity  to  entities 
already  registered  with  and  regulated  by 
SEBI.

 Circulars on Cyber Security: With increasing 
deployment  of  technology  in  all  aspects  of 
the  functioning  of  the  securities  market,  the 
issue of cyber security has been assessed to be 
critical, both to protect the privacy of investors 
and  to  prevent  disruption  of  the  markets. 
In  this  context,  various  circulars  have  been 
issued  to  Market  Infrastructure  Institutions, 
various  Market  Intermediaries  and  Mutual 
Funds.  IT  department  also  conducts  joint 
inspections of these market participants along 
with the relevant operational departments to 
ensure compliance with the circulars.

 Circular on Market SOC (Security Operations 
Centre): The small intermediaries in securities 
market  play  a  crucial  role  in  increasing  the 
reach of the market in the country. However, 
they  find  it  hard  to  make  the  necessary 
investments  in  cyber  security.  This  circular 
facilitates  the  setting  up  of  Market  SOCs, 
by  large  Market  Infrastructure  Institutions, 
which  small  intermediaries  can  subscribe 
to protect their systems while paying only a 
small subscription fee.

f. 

 Circular  on  Artificial  Intelligence/  Machine 
Learning (AI/ML): As emerging technologies 

g. 

like  AI/ML  are  poised  to  play  an  important 
role in the future, this circular seeks to create 
a  simple,  reporting  mechanism  for  market 
participants  to  report  on  their  use  of  this 
technology.

Interoperability  of  Clearing 
 Circular  on 
Corporations:  As  creating 
interoperability 
of  clearing  corporations  in  the  market  could 
involve  significant  IT  and  systems  related 
challenges, a small working group was created 
under  the  aegis  of  the  Secondary  Market 
Advisory Committee to address all IT related 
issues.  The  report  of  this  working  group 
addressed all these issues, thereby contributing 
to the issuance of the final circular.

IV. 

EASE OF DOING BUSINESS

During  the  year,  IT  department  focused  its 
 
efforts in terms of facilitating Ease of Doing Business 
through the following key initiatives:

SEBI  portal 

:  As  the  principal  interface 
1. 
between SEBI and market intermediaries, the portal 
was enhanced significantly during the year covering 
various functionalities including:

a.

 DATA  ANALYTICS:  HUB  AND  SPOKE 
MODEL

 
Given the increasing volume and complexity 
of activity in the securities market and the resultant 
explosion  in  volume  and  complexity  of  data,  SEBI 
has felt an increasing need to develop data analytics 
capability within the organization. The objective of 
building this capability is threefold:

a. 

b. 

c. 

Using data analytics for policy formulation

 Using  data  analytics  for  surveillance  and 
investigation

 Using data analytics for automation of various 
functions

PART FOUR: Organizational Matters

In order to achieve these objectives, SEBI adopted a 
Hub and Spoke model with the following structure:

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

 The  data  warehouse  team  of  IT  department 
functions as the Hub for data and programming 
support to the Spokes which reside in every 
department of SEBI.

 Across  all  departments  of  SEBI,  officers  are 
selected,  on  the  basis  of  tests  in  the  field  of 
statistics and basic programming, to undergo 
training  in  data  analytics,  domestically  and 
overseas.

 On return from their training, the officers self-
select data analytics projects of their choice, to 
create a proof of concept.

 The proof of concept is then presented to the 
relevant user department that works with the 
officer to fine tune the concept.

 The  final  proof  of  concept  is  presented 
to  the  senior  management  of  SEBI  and  if 
found  suitable,  is  selected  for  full  scale 
implementation.

 Independently,  other  officers  are  also 
encouraged  to  devise  their  own  proof  of 
concept for evaluation and implementation.

 
The  Hub  and  Spoke  model  has  created 
significant  capability  within  SEBI  and  as  many 
as  seven  projects  have  been  selected  for  full  scale 
implementation:
a. 

 Automation  of  data  analysis  and  creation 
of  investigation  report  for  Price-  Volume 
manipulation.
