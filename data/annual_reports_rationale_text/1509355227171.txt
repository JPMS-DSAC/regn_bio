CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT

of doing business and financial education, developing 
the commodity derivatives market by strengthening risk 
management norms and introducing the framework for 
options and framework for the operationalization of the 
International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) remained 
the main areas of policy thrust during the year.   

Going forward, SEBI will continue to play an enabling role 
in the Indian securities market in efficient mobilization 
and allocation of financial resources to meet the needs 
of  the  fast  growing  Indian  economy.  SEBI  will  stay 
focused on investor protection by further strengthening 
the overall governance framework in the market. 

The  securities  market  is  dynamic  and  its  regulatory 
framework  needs  to  evolve  in  tandem  with  this.  SEBI 
will  continue  to  rationalize  the  regulatory  framework 
to  make  it  contemporary  and  user  friendly,  without 
compromising on its over-arching objective of investor 
protection.  

Policy  refinements  for  expanding  the  geographical 
spread  of  the  securities  market  in  India  will  also 
continue. Apart from enhancing investor awareness and 
improving  access  to  the  securities  market,  technology 
solutions will also be explored to achieve the objective 
of scaling up delivery channels in the market including 
eKYC and online registration processes.

Developing a liquid and vibrant corporate bond market 
further is an important agenda for enhancing the role of 

The  overall  positive  outlook  of  the  economy  led  the 
Indian securities market to perform well during 2016-17, 
with equity benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and NIFTY 
registering growth of 16.9 and 18.5 per cent respectively. 
These benchmark equity indices continued their surge 
in financial year 2017-18 touching new highs amidst a 
more positive economic outlook. 

As  far  as  investments  in  the  Indian  securities  market 
are  concerned,  with  record  breaking  addition  of  more 
than 7.7 million folios, the mutual fund sector in India 
continued to grow significantly during 2016-17 with net 
fund  mobilization  to  the  tune  of  ₹3.43  trillion  during 
the  year  and  AUM  touching  a  record  level  of  ₹17.55 
trillion as on March 31, 2017. Net investments by foreign 
portfolio  investors  (FPIs)  were  ₹484  billion  (US$  7.18 
billion) during the same period with net investments of 
₹557 billion (US$8.75 billion) in equities and net sales of 
₹73 billion (US$1.15 billion) in bonds.  

During  2016-17,  SEBI  took  several  policy  initiatives 
to  further  deepen  the  securities  market 
in  India. 
Enhancing investor trust by strengthening governance 
norms,  maintaining  market  integrity  through  effective 
supervision  and  enforcement  actions,  promoting  ease 

the Indian securities market in channelizing long term 
finance. SEBI will work with all stakeholders for this. SEBI 
will also continue to facilitate resource mobilization from 
the Indian securities market through various fund raising 
avenues  –  the  primary  market,  alternative  investment 
funds, REITs, InVITs and municipal bonds. Steps will also 
be taken to further encourage the securities market as a 
source of risk capital for start-ups.  

Developing the commodity derivatives market is one of 
SEBI’s main agendas. SEBI will take necessary measures 
for  the  integration  and  harmonious  development  of 
the  commodity  derivatives  market  with  the  securities 

market  and  will  explore  widening  its  participants  and 
products to further deepen the commodity derivatives 
segment.  

Market  integrity  is  crucial  for  promoting  confidence 
among  market  participants.  SEBI  will  continue  to 
strengthen  market  supervision  through  various  steps 
such  as  Aadhar  based 
investors, 
effective  market  surveillance  and  monitoring  of 
compliances  by  regulated  entities.  Deterring,  effective 
and timely enforcement actions against errant entities 
will also be taken to maintain discipline and the overall 
integrity of the market.

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

Part One:
Policies And Programmes

Global 

economic  activity  picked  up 
modestly  towards  the  end  of  2016-17. 
This  was  backed  by  cyclical  recovery  in 
investments,  manufacturing  and  trade  following  a 
lacklustre out-turn in the beginning of the financial 
year.  Although  the  growth  momentum  in  India 
slowed  down  slightly  during  the  year  partly  due 
to  external  shocks  and  partly  due  to  temporary 
repercussions resulting from a series of reforms, the 
GDP growth rate remained robust compared to other 
emerging  nations.  During  2016-17  India  initiated  a 
series of structural reforms with a view to achieving 
medium and long run gains. In its 2017 ‘Article IV 
Consultation,’  the  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF) highlighted the continued progress in reforms 
that brightens India’s medium-term prospects.

Indian  securities  markets  performed  well 
amid external headwinds as indicated by soaring 

indices,  expansion  of  market  capitalization  of 
the  exchanges  and  assets  under  management 
in  the  mutual  funds  industry.  Despite  a  setback 
in  the  third  quarter  of  2016-17,  foreign  portfolio 
investments  for  the  year  increased  compared  to 
the  previous  year.  Primary  market  issues  also 
increased  both  in  number  as  well  as  in  terms  of 
the  amount  mobilized.  On  the  other  hand,  new 
policy measures have been initiated to develop the 
commodity derivatives market. 

SEBI’s Annual Report 2016-17 covers a major 
account  of  its  activities,  policies  and  programmes 
during the year. 

Part  One  of  the  report  covers  the  general 
economic environment and the investment climate 
followed by a review of the policies and programmes 
adopted by SEBI in the Indian securities market.

 REVIEW  OF  THE  GENERAL  ECONOMIC  ENVIRONMENT  AND 
INVESTMENT CLIMATE

I. 

GLOBAL ECONOMY: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Table 1.1:  The world economy – Recent trends in 

Following  a  lacklustre  out-turn,  economic 
activity  picked  up  towards  the  end  of  2016-17 
especially  in  emerging  markets  and  developing 
economies supported by a recovery in investments, 
manufacturing  and  trade.  The  World  Economic 
Outlook  (WEO)  published  by  the  International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2017 has upgraded 
expected  world  growth  from  3.1  per  cent  in  2016 
to  3.5  per  cent  in  2017  and  3.6  per  cent  in  2018. 
The  tailwind  is  coming  from  stronger  economic 
activities,  expectations  of  more  robust  global 
demand,  amicable  inflationary  conditions  and 
optimistic  financial  markets.  However,  structural 
impediments  to  a  stronger  recovery  appear  as 
headwinds over the medium term. 

Advanced  economies  are  tending  towards 
protectionism  to  deal  with  persistent  structural 
problems  such  as  low  productivity  growth  and 
high  income  inequalities.  This  tendency  might 
affect  global  economic 
integration  between 
advanced  economies  and  emerging  markets  and 
developing  economies.  As  per  WEO’s  forecasts, 
growth in advanced economies may go up from 1.7 
per cent in 2016 to 2.0 per cent in 2017 and 2018. The 
outlook  for  the  United  States  has  brightened  as  a 
result of proposed fiscal policy easing by the newly 
elected  government.  Great  Britain,  on  the  other 
hand, recorded faster recovery fuelled by increased 
spending  after  it  decided  to  leave  the  European 
Union in June 2016. Backed by strong net exports the 
Japanese  economy  too  has  expanded.  Meanwhile, 
recovery also continues in the Euro-zone supported 
by  domestic  demand,  falling  unemployment  and 
recovery  in  peripheral  economies.  Nevertheless, 
the  current  high  sovereign  debt  levels  and  weak 
banking  sectors  in  some  economies  may  thwart 
recovery (see Table 1.1).

The  economic  performance  of  emerging 
markets  and  developing  economies  has  been 
somewhat  mixed  with  a  number  of  countries 
expanding  faster  than  expected,  while  a  few  are 
experiencing  a  slowdown.  WEO  predicts  that 
growth  rates  in  emerging  and  developing  nations 
will  improve  from  4.1  per  cent  in  2016  to  4.5  per 
cent in 2017 and to 4.8 per cent in 2018. Growth in 
the two largest emerging market economies, India 
and China, has remained strong. However, growth 
in China is expected to decelerate from 6.7 per cent 
in 2016 to 6.6 per cent in 2017 and 6.5 per cent in 
2018.  In  India,  the  impact  of  demonetization  has

ebbed and as per WEO, India is expected to grow 
at 7.2 per cent in 2017 and 7.7 per cent in 2018; this 
is substantially higher than the 6.8 per cent growth 
recorded in 2016.

Commodity  prices  showed  an  uptrend 
during 2016-17. As a result, headline inflation has 
been picking up in advanced economies, although 
core inflation has remained subdued. A number of 
emerging markets and developing economies also 
witnessed  spiralling  of  headline  inflation  due  to 
higher commodity prices. Looking ahead, downside 
risks remain heightened due to a number of factors. 
Firstly, protectionist policies being pursued in the US 
may work as a major impediment to global growth 
by hampering cross-border trade and capital flows. 
Secondly,  a  hike  in  interest  rates  by  the  Federal 
Reserve in the United States might further tighten 
international  currency  markets  and  may  result  in 
sharp dollar appreciation, which may have adverse 
repercussions  on  importing  nations.  Thirdly,  high 
leverage  and  economic  rebalancing  in  the  second 
largest economy in the world, China remains a risk 
for  global  markets.  Fourthly,  geopolitical  issues 
such  as  increasing  tension  between  the  US  and 
North Korea could also destabilize markets across 
the world.

expansion during 2016-17 albeit at a slightly slower 
pace as compared to the previous year. The strong 
growth  was  backed  by  private  and  government 
consumption. However this was offset by slowing 
fixed investments, subdued industrial activity and

in 

sluggish  exports.  Lower  energy  costs,  revision  of 
public sector salaries and pensions and a favourable 
monsoon boosted urban and rural incomes which 
resulted 
increased  consumption.  Economic 
activity  also  benefitted  from  foreign  investments 
and  increase  in  public  infrastructure  spending. 
With foreign exchange reserves at around US$ 370 
billion at the end of 2016-17 external vulnerabilities 
are in check. 

The Government of India has initiated a number 
of reforms that are going to benefit the economy in 
the medium and long run. With a view to curbing 
black  money  and  tax  evasion,  and  to  deal  a  body 
blow  to  terrorist  activities  and  counterfeiting,  the 
Indian government undertook ‘demonetization’1 of 
large-denomination currency notes. In other major 
policy initiatives, a constitutional amendment was 
done to pave the way for the Goods and Services Tax 
(GST) to create a common Indian market, improving 
tax  compliance  and  boosting  investments.  The 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was passed 
by Parliament which will help in cleaning up bank 
balance sheets. Besides, the government has opened 
up  defence,  civil  aviation  and  the  single-brand 
retail  and  pharmaceutical  sectors  to  more  foreign 
direct investments. 

Considering the inflationary trend consumer 
price index (CPI) inflation is expected to be below 
5 per cent during 2017-18. In 2016-17 CPI inflation 
was 4.5 per cent, which is below the Reserve Bank 
of India’s (RBI’s) target of 5 per cent. The Economic 
Survey 2016-17 forecast that India may record real 
GDP growth in the 6.8 to 7.5 per cent range in 2017-18. 
Fitch  Ratings  in  its  recent  update  has  maintained 
a  stable  outlook  for  India,  supported  by  a  strong 
medium-term growth outlook.

  On November 8, 2016, the Government of India announced discontinuation of large-denomination currency notes of  ` 500 and 
` 1,000, representing 86 per cent of the total currency in circulation as legal tender. On the same day new ` 500 and ` 2,000 currency 
notes were introduced. The withdrawal from circulation started immediately and ended on December 30, 2016.

A.  GROWTH

The  Indian  economy  is  estimated  to  have 
grown  by  7.1  per  cent  during  2016-17  on  top  of 
a  growth  of  8.0  per  cent  in  2015-16  (Figure  1.1). 
Gross  value  added  (GVA)  at  basic  prices  grew  at 
6.6 per cent during 2016-17 against 7.9 per cent in  
2015-16  (Table  1.2).  The  gross  national  income 

(GNI)  at  constant  prices  rose  by  7.0  per  cent  in  
2016-17  compared  to  8.0  per  cent  growth  during 
2015-16.  Slowing  down  of  the  industrial  and 
services  sectors  accounted  for  deceleration  of 
growth during the year. The primary sector on the 
other hand recorded faster expansion.

B.  AGRICULTURE

As  per  the  Central  Statistics  Office’s  (CSO’s) 
second advanced estimates, GVA at constant prices 
of the ‘agriculture, forestry and fishing’ sector grew 
by 4.9 per cent during 2016-17 against a 0.7 per cent 
growth during the previous year.

C. 

INDUSTRY 

Growth  of  the  industrial  sector  decelerated 
in 2016-17 from the previous year mainly due to a 
slowdown in mining and quarrying activities (GVA 
growth rate fell from 10.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 1.8 
per cent in 2016-17), coupled with a weakening of 
manufacturing activity (GVA growth rate fell from 

10.8  per  cent  in  2015-16  to  7.9  per  cent  in  2016-17). 
The government revised the base year for the Index 
of Industrial Production (IIP) to 2011-12 from 2004-05. 
As per the new series, IIP during 2016-17 (5.0 per 
cent)  showed  a  pickup  in  the  industrial  activities 
compared  to  2015-16  (3.4  per  cent)  (Table  1.4). 
During 2016-17, the IIP of mining registered growth 
of 5.3 per cent and IIP of manufacturing registered 
a  growth  rate  of  4.9  per  cent.  On  the  other  hand, 
positive  impetus  came  from  electricity,  gas  and 
water supply & other utility services as the sector 
witnessed  mild  improvement  in  its  GVA  growth 
rate, which rose from 5.0 per cent in 2015-16 to 7.2 
per cent in 2016-17.

D.  SERVICES

The  services  sector  is  a  major  contributor 
to  India’s  GDP.  This  sector  accounted  for  61.7 
per  cent  of  the  GVA  in  2016-17.  Growth  in  GVA 
in  the  services  sector  decelerated  to  6.9  per  cent 
in 2016-17 from 9.1 per cent in the previous year. 
The  slowdown  was  mainly  caused  by  softening 
of  activities 
transport 
and  communication  and  services  related 
to 
broadcasting as well as financing, real estate and 
professional  services  sectors.  On  the  other  hand, 
construction  and  public  administration,  defence 
and other services witnessed expansion during the 
year as compared to the previous year.

SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS

During 2015-16, gross saving is estimated at  
` 44.05 lakh crore as compared to ` 40.98 lakh crore 
during  2014-15.  The  rate  of  gross  saving  to  GDP 
stood at 32.2 per cent for 2015-16, as compared to 
32.9  per  cent  in  2014-15  (Table  1.5).  Even  with  a

to be the highest contributor to gross savings with 
a  share  of  59.2  per  cent  in  2015-16.  A  decline  in 
household  savings  in  physical  assets  resulted  in 
the share of the household sector in gross savings 
falling to 59.2 per cent in 2015-16 (62.0 per cent in 
2014-15).  The  share  of  non-financial  corporations 
increased from 34.3 per cent in 2014-15 to 37.3 per 
cent in 2015-16. The share of saving of the financial 
corporations  in  the  gross  savings  decreased  from 
8.3 per cent in 2014-15 to 6.5 per cent in 2015-16. The 
dis-saving  of  the  general  government  decreased 
from 4.6 per cent of gross savings in 2014-15 to 3.1 
per cent in 2015-16.

The  gross  capital 

(GCF)  at 
current prices is estimated at ` 45.45 lakh crore for 
2015-16  as  compared  to  `  42.58  lakh  crore  during 
2014-15.  The  rate  of  GCF  to  GDP  declined  from 
34.2  per  cent  during  2014-15  to  33.2  per  cent  in 
2015-16. The rate of capital formation in 2011-12 to  
2015-16  was  marginally  higher  than  the  rate  of 
savings because of net capital inflow from the rest of 
the world (RoW).

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 

India’s  trade  deficit  narrowed  to  US$  82.8 
billion  in  April-December  2016  from  US$  105.3 
billion during the same period in 2015-16. Aided by 
a contraction in the trade deficit, the current account 
deficit  (CAD)  on  a  cumulative  basis  narrowed 
to  0.7  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2016  (April-December) 
from  1.4  per  cent  in  the  corresponding  period  of 
2015-16.  Net  FDI  inflows  during  April-December 

2015  rose  sharply  by  12.3  per  cent  over  those  in 
the  corresponding  period  in  the  previous  year. 
However,  nationalistic  and  protectionist  policies 
adopted by the new US government may diminish 
export revenue from the United States which may 
be  a  cause  for  concern  in  the  medium  and  long 
term.  Foreign  portfolio 
investments,  however, 
witnessed a net outflow of US$ 3.2 billion during 
April-December 2016 as compared to US$ 3.7 billion

outflow  a  year  ago.  During April-December  2016, 
the  level  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  (on  a  BoP 
basis) went up by US$ 14.2 billion. IMF, in its Staff 
Report for the 2017 Article IV Consultation, observed 
that on a positive side India’s external vulnerabilities 
were in check and the current account deficit was 
expected  to  remain  contained.  Forex  reserves 
were also robust which covers around 8 months of 
imports.  On  a  downside,  weak  external  demand 
continues to constrain India’s exports.

G. 

 FISCAL DEFICIT

The  Government  of  India  has  placed  added 
emphasis  on  bringing  down  the  fiscal  deficit  to 
3.0  per  cent  of  GDP  by  2018-19.  In  the  backdrop 
of higher public expenditure and subdued private 
investments,  the  government  is  following  the 
principle of gradual adjustments for improving the 
fiscal condition. The Union Budget 2017-18 declared 
that in 2016-17 the fiscal deficit was 3.5 per cent of 
GDP (Revised Estimates). As per Budget Estimates, 
fiscal deficit for 2017-18 is 3.2 per cent of GDP, that 
is, ` 5,46,531 crore. Revenue deficit, which needs to 
be contained at 2.0 per cent under the existing Fiscal 
Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM) 

Act’s  provisions,  was  estimated  at  1.9  per  cent  of 
GDP,  that  is,  `  3,21,163  crore  (Budget  Estimates) 
in  2017-18  against  2.1  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2016-17 
(Revised Estimates). 

H.  EXCHANGE RATE

Volatility  in  the  USD-INR  exchange  rate 
remained contained during the first half of 2016-17. 
However, there was an uptick in volatility during 
the second half owing to various factors. The Indian 
rupee  depreciated  sharply  vis-à-vis  the  US  dollar 
during November 8-28, 2016 in the aftermath of the 
US presidential election results. However, since end 
of January 2017, there has been a steady appreciation 
of the rupee, mainly due to strong capital inflows 
which  include  portfolio  inflows  into  equities  as 
well  as  into  debt  markets  in  February  and  March 
2017.  During  2016-17,  the  Indian  rupee  touched 
a low of 68.7 (November 28, 2016) against the US 
dollar and a high of 62.2 (April 04, 2016) against the 
US dollar. The Indian rupee closed at 64.8 against 
the US dollar on March 31, 2017. During the year, 
forex  reserves  increased  considerably  by  about  
US$ 9.8 billion from US$ 359.8 billion as of April 01, 
2016 to US$ 369.9 billion as on March 31, 2017.

2.  REVIEW OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

SEBI 

initiated  a  host  of  policies  and 
programmes during 2016-17 with the objectives of:
in 

investors’ 

interests 

 protecting 
securities; 
 promoting  the  development  of  the 
securities market; and 
 regulating the securities market. 

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

This section presents a brief review of SEBI’s 

policies and programmes during 2016-17.

The policies and programmes are categorized 
under  eight  major  heads:  The  Primary  Securities 
Market,  Secondary  Securities  Market,  Commodity 
Derivatives Market, Mutual Funds, Intermediaries 
Associated  with  the  Securities  Market,  Foreign 
Portfolio  Investors,  Corporate  Debt  Market  and 
Other Policies and Programmes. All of these have 
a bearing on the working of the securities market.

I. 

THE PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

A  developed  primary  market 

is  crucial 
for  resource  mobilization  as  it  brings  together 
investors  seeking  investment  opportunities  and 
issuers  seeking  to  mobilize  resources  to  finance 
their  businesses.  Developing  the  securities  market 
being one of its preambles, SEBI has been adopting 

various  measures  to  make  the  primary  securities 
market more efficient and vibrant. During financial 
year  2016-17,  SEBI  implemented  certain  important 
reforms related to the primary market and also other 
regulations  on  delisting,  takeovers  and  buy-backs. 
Details of these major initiatives are now outlined. 

A. 

 Streamlining the Process of Stock Exchange 
Mechanism for Tender Offers

SEBI  has  put  in  place  a  framework  for  the 
stock  exchange  mechanism  to  facilitate  tendering 
of  shares  by  investors  in  takeover,  buy-back  and 
delisting tender offers and their settlement. With a 
view to reducing systematic risks for investors and 
easing implementation, in consultations with stock 
exchanges and depositories, the process under this 
mechanism has been further streamlined. Under the 
revised process, transfer of shares of shareholders 
is made directly to the account maintained by the 
clearing corporation and further, consideration for 
the accepted shares in the tender offer and shares 
tendered  but  not  accepted  under  such  an  offer 
will be credited directly to shareholders’ bank and 
demat accounts respectively. Earlier, the shares and 
payment  of  consideration  were  routed  through 
stock brokers.

Box 1.1: Regulatory Framework on Schemes of Arrangement Strengthened

In order to streamline and simplify the regulatory framework governing schemes of arrangement and to 
prevent the misuse of schemes to bypass regulatory requirements, SEBI revised the regulatory framework 
governing the schemes of arrangement. A summary of the revised framework is as follows:
1) 
 

In case of a merger of an unlisted company with a listed company:
a) 

 The  unlisted  company  inter-alia  shall  comply  with  the  requirement  of  disclosure  of  material 
information as specified in the format for an abridged prospectus.
 The holding of pre-scheme public shareholders of the listed entity and the qualified institutional 
buyers (QIBs) of the unlisted company, in the post scheme shareholding pattern of the ‘merged’ 
company shall not be less than 25 per cent.

 

b) 

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

c) 

 An unlisted company can be merged with a listed company if it is listed on a stock exchange 
having nationwide trading terminals.

2) 

3) 

 

 

 

4) 

5) 

 In order to prevent shares to a select group of shareholders instead of all shareholders, pursuant to the 
scheme it is clarified that the pricing formula for preferential allotment specified under Issue of Capital 
and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations shall be applicable in such cases. 
 To ensure larger participation of public shareholders, the requirement to obtain their approval through 
e-voting has been extended to the following cases:
a) 

 Schemes involving the merger of an unlisted company resulting in a reduction in the voting 
share percentage of pre-scheme public shareholders by more than 5 per cent of the total capital 
of the merged entity.
 Schemes involving transfer of whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of a listed 
company and consideration for such a transfer is not in the form of listed equity shares.
 Schemes involving the merger of an unlisted subsidiary with a listed holding company where 
the shares of the unlisted subsidiary have been acquired by the holding company directly or 
indirectly from the promoters/promoter group.

b) 

c) 

 Companies will be required to submit compliance reports confirming compliance with the circular and 
accounting standards duly certified by the Company Secretary, CFO and Managing Director.
 With  a  view  to  simplifying  the  process,  schemes  which  provide  for  merger  of  a  wholly-owned 
subsidiary (WoS) with the parent company are not required to be filed with SEBI. Such schemes will 
be filed with stock exchanges for the limited purpose of disclosures only.

Relevant amendments to the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 and 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 were notified on February 15, 
2017 and March 06, 2017 respectively and the revised circular incorporating these amendments was issued 
on March 10, 2017.

Box 1.2: Compulsory Delisting of Companies

There are a number of companies that are listed on stock exchanges but are not active. Many of them have been 
suspended from trading by the stock exchanges. The high number of inactive companies makes supervision 
difficult and increases the regulatory burden of the stock exchanges and SEBI. SEBI has initiated a process of 
delisting these inactive companies in accordance with the relevant provisions of SEBI Regulations.
In terms of Section 21A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 a recognized stock exchange may 
compulsorily delist the equity shares of a listed company on certain grounds.
Regulation 23(3) of the Delisting Regulations provides that pursuant to compulsory delisting of a company, 
the promoter will acquire delisted equity shares from public shareholders, subject to their option of retaining 
their equity shares by paying them fair value as determined by the independent valuer appointed by the 
concerned recognized stock exchange. 
In terms of Regulation 24 of the Delisting Regulations, a company which has been compulsorily delisted, its 
whole-time directors, its promoters and the companies promoted by any such person, will not directly or 
indirectly access the securities market for a period of ten years from the date of compulsory delisting.

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

In addition to the restrictions imposed under Regulation 24 of the Delisting Regulations, in order to ensure 
effective enforcement of an exit option to public shareholders in case of compulsory delisting and taking into 
account investors’ interests, it was felt necessary to strengthen the regulatory mechanism. Accordingly, it was 
decided that in the case of companies whose fair value is positive:
 

 such a company and the depositories shall not effect transfer by way of sale, pledge, etc., of 
any equity shares and corporate benefits like dividend, rights, bonus shares and split will be 
frozen for all the equity shares held by the promoters/promoter group till the promoters of the 
company provide an exit option to public shareholders in compliance with Regulation 23(3) of 
the Delisting Regulations as certified by the concerned recognized stock exchange; 
 the promoters and whole-time directors of the compulsorily delisted company will not be eligible 
to become directors of any listed company till the exit option as stated above is provided. 

i. 

 

ii. 

Around 400 such companies have been delisted in the recent past. Further process is on.

B. 

 Empowerment  of  Stock  Exchanges  for 
Effective Regulation of Listed Entities

In order to empower the stock exchanges for 
effective regulations of listed entities, amendments 
have been notified to the SEBI (Issue of Capital and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR 
Regulations) to enable actions such as imposition of 

fines and suspension of trading by stock exchanges 
for contravention of ICDR Regulations. This will be 
much  more  important  in  case  of  minor  violations 
where current actions by SEBI such as prohibiting 
access to the market and adjudication/quasi-judicial 
action may be time and effort-consuming and not 
proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.

Box 1.3: Integrated Reporting by Listed Entities

SEBI has mandated submission of Business Responsibility Reports (BRRs) for top 500 listed entities. The key 
principles which are required to be reported by the entities pertain to areas such as environment, governance, 
stakeholder relationships, etc. 
For improving disclosure standards of non-financial information further, SEBI in consultation with industry 
bodies  and  stock  exchanges  specified  a  framework  for  integrated  reporting  (IR)  by  listed  entities.  An 
Integrated Report shows a holistic picture of the combination, inter-relatedness and dependencies between 
the factors that affect an organization’s ability to create value over time. 
The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) has categorized the following six forms of capital to 
be disclosed to stakeholders to enable informed investment decision making:
•	
•	 Manufactured	capital
•	
•	
•	
•	

Intellectual	capital
Human	capital
Social	and	relationship	capital
Natural	capital

Financial	capital

The  integrated  reporting  framework  provides  seven  guiding  principles  that  can  help  create  a  concise, 
comprehensive and clear report. The eight content elements provided in this framework are aspects that 
should be there in a thoroughly integrated report. Together, they provide information about past performance 
and the short, medium and long term outlook of the company and how it plans to achieve that outlook. 
These elements also ensure that integrated reports are consistent and comparable across peer organizations.

7 Guiding principles
Strategic focus and future orientation
Connectivity of information
Stakeholder relationships
Materiality
Conciseness
Reliability and completeness
Consistency and comparability

8 Content elements
Organizational overview and the external environment
Governance
Business model
Risks and opportunities
Strategy and resource allocation
Performance
Outlook
Basis of presentation

SEBI has clarified that integrated reporting may be adopted on a voluntary basis from financial year 2017-18 
by the top 500 companies which are required to prepare BRRs. Information related to integrated reporting 
may be provided in the annual reports separately or by incorporating it in the Management Discussion & 
Analysis or by preparing a separate report (annual report prepared as per the IR framework). 
As a green initiative, companies may host their integrated reports on their websites and provide appropriate 
reference  to  it  in  their  annual  reports.  Further,  to  avoid  duplication,  cross-referencing  to  other  reports 
prepared in accordance with national/international requirements/ framework is also permitted. 
It is significant to point out that the concept of integrated reporting is being discussed at international forums 
and is yet to be implemented in many of the jurisdictions. The move is aimed at providing stakeholders 
relevant information that is useful for making investment decisions. 

C. 

 Extension  of  the  Applicability  of  Business 
Responsibility Reporting Requirements

SEBI  had  earlier  mandated  publishing  of 
Business  Responsibility  Reports  (BRRs)  in  the 
annual reports of the top 100 listed entities based on 
market capitalization. The key principles which are 
required to be reported by the listed entities include 
environmental, social and economic responsibilities, 
governance  and  stakeholders’  relationships.  The 
applicability  of  BRR  requirements  has  now  been 
extended  to  the  top  500  listed  entities  based  on 

market capitalization as on March 31 of every year. 
Further, as a green initiative, BRRs are permitted to 
be made available on the websites of the companies 
with links to the websites being made available in 
their annual reports. 

D. 

 Streamlining  the  Process  of  System-driven 
Disclosures

SEBI has put in place a framework for system-
driven disclosures wherein the onus of disclosures 
has  been  shifted  from  individuals/companies  to 

12

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

the  securities  market  infrastructure  through  an 
integration  among  depositories,  stock  exchanges 
and the registrar and transfer agents (RTAs). Such 
a  system  will  help  in  eliminating  the  possibility 
of  inadvertent  violations  by  the  entities  and  will 
also  help  in  providing  information  to  investors 
on  a  timely  basis  to  take  investment  decisions 
thus  leading  to  fairness  in  the  markets.  Initially, 
the  system  has  been  made  operational  parallel 
to  disclosures  by  promoters/promoter  group 
and  once  this  stabilizes,  it  will  replace  manual 
disclosure  obligations.  Based  on  the  experience 
gained  by  implementing  the  system,  the  process 
has  been  further  streamlined  pursuant  to  which 
the  depositories  will  provide  transaction  data  of 
promoters/promoter group on a daily basis directly 
to the stock exchanges instead of routing it through 
RTAs for dissemination of necessary disclosures.

E. 

 Implementation 
Standards Ind-AS by Listed Entities

of  New  Accounting 

In  accordance  with  the  rules  prescribed  by 
the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, listed entities are 
required to comply with new accounting standards 
Ind-AS,  which  are  on  the  lines  of  international 
accounting standards in a phased manner beginning 
from financial year 2016-17. 

In  order  to  facilitate  a  smooth  transition 
during  the  first  year  of  Ind-AS  implementation, 
SEBI, in consultation with the market participants 
--  listed  entities,  stock  exchanges  and  members 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI),  issued  detailed  guidelines.  The  formats 
for  financial  results  were  also  aligned  with  those 
prescribed  under  the  Companies Act/the  Banking 
Regulation Act/IRDAI Act.

Box 1.4: Disclosure of Impact of Audit Qualifications by Listed Entities

SEBI has put in place a mechanism to review the audit qualifications contained in listed entities’ audit reports. 
The detailed procedure for this has been prescribed in Schedule VIII read with Regulation 33 and Regulation 
52 of the SEBI (Listing and Other Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations) and SEBI 
circular dated November 30, 2015. 
In consultations with SEBI’s advisory committees, ICAI, stock exchanges and industry bodies, it has been 
decided to streamline the existing process as: 
(i) 

 to make the listed entities disseminate the cumulative impact of all the audit qualifications in a separate 
format simultaneously while submitting their annual audited financial results to the stock exchanges. 
This will ensure that the information is available to investors without delay enabling them to take well 
informed investment decisions; 
 to  dispense  with  the  existing  requirement  of  filing  Form  A  or  Form  B  for  the  audit  report  with 
unmodified or modified opinions respectively; and
 to  dispense  with  the  existing  requirement  of  making  adjustments  in  the  book  of  accounts  of  the 
subsequent year.

Listed  Companies’ 

 Transparency 
Dividend Distribution Policies 
In order to bring in more transparency with 
respect  to  listed  companies’  dividend  policies,  a 

new Regulation 43A has been introduced in the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015. This requires the top 500 listed 
companies  (by  way  of  market  capitalization)  to

formulate and disclose their dividend distribution 
policies in their annual reports and on their websites. 

The policy includes: 

 The circumstances under which shareholders 
can or cannot expect a dividend; 

 Financial parameters that will be considered 
while declaring a dividend; 

 Internal  and  external  factors  that  will  be 
considered for declaring a dividend;

In  case  a  company  proposes  to  declare  a 
dividend  on  the  basis  of  parameters  which  are 
not  part  of  this  policy  or  proposes  to  change  its 
dividend  distribution  policy,  it  is  required  to 
disclose this along with the rationale behind such 
an  action.  This  policy  was  formulated  in  order  to 
provide  investors  with  a  better  understanding  of 
the dividend policies of listed companies to be able 
to take informed decisions.

G.  Enhanced Corporate Governance Standards 

To address concerns related to private equity 
funds  entering  into  compensation  agreements  to 
incentivize promoters, directors and key managerial 
personnel  of  listed  investee  companies  which 
could potentially lead to unfair practices, the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations,  2016 
(Listing  Regulations)  were 
amended to put in place provisions for disclosures 
and  approval  of  the  board  and  shareholders.  The 
revised norms are:

a) 

 No  employee 
including  key  managerial 
personnel or director or promoter of a listed 

entity  shall  enter  into  any  agreement  for 
himself or on behalf of any other person, with 
any shareholder or any other third party with 
regard  to  compensation  or  profit  sharing  in 
connection with dealings in the securities of 
such a listed entity unless prior approval has 
been  obtained  from  the  board  of  directors 
as well as public shareholders by way of an 
ordinary resolution.

 Such an agreement, if any, whether subsisting 
or expired, entered during the preceding three 
years  from  the  date  of  this  sub-regulation 
coming  into  force,  shall  be  disclosed  to  the 
stock exchanges for public dissemination.

 A subsisting agreement, if any, as on the date 
of this sub-regulation coming into force shall 
be  placed  for  approval  before  the  board  of 
directors in the forthcoming board meeting.

 If  the  board  of  directors  approves  such  an 
agreement,  this  shall  be  placed  before  the 
public  shareholders  for  approval  by  way  of 
an  ordinary  resolution  in  the  forthcoming 
general meeting.

For  the  purposes  of  this  sub-regulation  and 
‘interested person’ means any person holding 
voting  rights  in  the  listed  entity  and  who  is 
in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, 
interested  in  an  agreement  or  a  proposed 
agreement, entered into or to be entered into 
by such a person or by any employee or key

Box 1.5: Guidance on Board Evaluation

The evaluation of the performance of the board of directors and its committees is an important component of 
corporate governance. The provisions on board evaluation are contained in the Companies Act, 2013 and the 
SEBI Listing Regulations, 2015. SEBI studied the various practices of board evaluation by listed companies 
in India as well as by companies in jurisdictions abroad. SEBI also organized a conference in association with 
OECD focusing on board evaluation, bringing in an amalgam of views from various regulators from around 
the world.
After consulting the market participants and making an extensive study, SEBI issued a guidance note on 
the matter of board evaluation in January 2017 in order to provide guidance to listed entities by elaborating 
various aspects of the board evaluation that may help them to improve the evaluation process, derive the 
best possible benefits and achieve the objective of the entire process. 
The guidance note covers all major aspects of a board evaluation including:
 
 

Subject of evaluation, that is, who is to be evaluated;
 Process of evaluation including laying down objectives and criteria to be adopted for evaluating 
different persons;
Feedback to the persons being evaluated;

a. 
b. 

c. 
d.  Action plan based on the results of the evaluation process;
e. 
f. 
g. 
h. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of the guidance note is to educate listed entities and their boards of directors about various 
aspects involved in the board evaluation process and improve their overall performance as well as corporate 
governance standards to benefit all stakeholders.

Disclosure to stakeholders on various aspects;
Frequency of board evaluations;
Responsibility for board evaluation; and
Review of the entire evaluation process periodically.

H.  Effective Regulation of Listed Entities

a) 

SEBI  had  earlier  prescribed  a  uniform 
fine  structure  for  non-compliance  with  certain 
provisions  of  SEBI 
(Listing  Obligations  and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing 
Regulations) and Standard Operating Procedure for 
suspension  and  revocation  of  trading  of  specified 
securities.  However,  some  of  the  non-compliant 
listed entities have not paid the fines levied by the 
recognized  stock  exchange(s).  In  order  to  ensure 
effective enforcement, a policy was put in place to 
freeze the holdings of their promoters and promoter 
group entities in the following manner: 

 Where  a  non-compliant  listed  entity  fails  to 
pay a fine levied as per the notice issued by 
the concerned recognized stock exchange for 
non-compliance  within  the  period  indicated 
in the notice, the concerned recognized stock 
exchange intimates the depositories to freeze 
holdings  in  other  securities  in  the  demat 
accounts  of  the  promoter  and  promoter 
group to the extent of liability which is to be 
calculated on a quarterly basis.

b) 

 In case of non-compliance for two consecutive 
periods  and  failure  to  comply  with  the 
notice  issued  by  the  concerned  recognized 

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

15

stock  exchange,  the  exchange  intimates  the 
depositories to freeze the entire shareholding 
of the promoter and promoter group in such 
a listed entity and a further freeze of holdings 
in  the  demat  accounts  of  the  promoter  and 
promoter  group  in  other  securities  to  the 
extent of liability which is to be calculated on 
a quarterly basis. 

 While freezing the holdings of other securities 
in  the  demat  accounts  of  the  promoter 
and  promoter  group,  the  recognized  stock 
exchange  has  the  discretion  to  determine 
which of the securities and holdings of which 
promoter or promoter group entity are to be 
frozen.

 Enhancing 
Reservation in Issues

the  Ceiling  on  Employee 

c) 

I. 

As per SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2009,  an  issuer  can 
make  reservation  for  employees  not  exceeding  
5 per cent of the post issue capital of the issuer. The 
value of allotment to any employee in pursuance of 
reservation was restricted to ` 2 lakh.

SEBI has now allowed allotment to employees 
in excess of the extant limit of ` 2 lakh per employee 
under the employee reservation quota. Accordingly, 
vide  an  amendment  to  the  Regulations,  SEBI 
specified  that  the  application  for  shares  of  the 
value  in  excess  of  `  2  lakh  shall  be  considered  as 
application  for  additional  shares  and  shall  be 
considered only in the event of under-subscription in 
the employee reservation portion. The unsubscribed 
shares available in the employee reservation portion 
shall  be  allotted  on  a  proportionate  basis  to  the 
employees who have applied for additional shares. 
The value of total allotment to an employee under 
the  employee  reservation  portion,  including  the 
additional allotment shall not exceed ` 5 lakh.

II.  THE SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

A. 

 Cyber  Security  and  a  Cyber  Resilience 
Framework  for  Stock  Exchanges,  Clearing 
Corporations and Depositories

SEBI  has  laid  down  a  detailed  framework 
with regard to cyber security and cyber resilience 
that  stock  exchanges,  clearing  corporations  and 
depositories are required to adopt. The framework 
inter-alia  covers  areas 
such  as  governance, 
identification  of  critical  assets  and  cyber  risks 
(threats  and  vulnerabilities),  access  controls, 
physical  security,  network  security  management, 
security  of  data,  hardening  of  hardware  and 
software,  application  security  and  testing,  patch 
management,  disposal  of  systems  and  storage 
devices,  vulnerability  assessment  and  penetration 
testing (VAPT), monitoring and detection, response 
and recovery, sharing of information, training and 
periodic audits.

During  2016-17  SEBI  constituted  a  High 
Powered  Steering  Committee  on  Cyber  Security 
(HPSC-CS)  chaired  by  a  Whole  Time  Member. 
Further,  a  Cyber  Security  Cell  was  also  created 
which  has  issued  the  following  two  advisories  to 
market infrastructure institutions (MIIs): 

a. 

b. 

 To  further  strengthen  vigil  and  surveillance 
of  their  critical  IT  assets  including  website 
and network traffic, monitor internal network 
communications  closely  to  detect  and/or 
block  unauthorized  or  atypical  network 
communications  amongst  servers,  systems 
and endpoint devices, enact a mechanism to 
detect and/or block behavioural anomalies on 
systems, servers and endpoint devices.

 To  strengthen  the  cyber  security  framework 
of  MIIs’  websites,  Web  Application  Firewall 
(WAF),  the  Web  Server  Security  Policy, 
Application  Security  Audit  and  Security 
Audit of Software Vendors.

 Review  of  Guidelines  for  Co-Location/
Proximity Hosting Facility Offered by Stock 
Exchanges

In  consultation  with  its  Technical  Advisory 
Committee (TAC), SEBI reviewed the guidelines to 
be  followed  by  stock  exchanges  while  facilitating 
co-location/proximity  hosting  wherein,  inter-  alia, 
stock exchanges were advised:

a) 

b) 

 To  allow  direct  connectivity  between  the 
co-location  facility  of  one  recognized  stock 
exchange and the co-location facility of other 
recognized stock exchanges.

 To allow direct connectivity between servers 
of a stock broker placed in co-location facility 
of a recognized stock exchange and servers of 
the same stock broker placed in a co-location 
facility  of  a  different  recognized  stock 
exchange. This facility should be available to 
all the co-located brokers who are desirous to 
avail such connectivity in a fair and equitable 
manner.

In  addition,  the  following  were  clarified  to 

stock exchanges:

a) 

b) 

 Co-location services provided by a third party 
or outsourced from a third party are deemed to 
be provided by the stock exchanges. Further, 
stock  exchange  will  remain  responsible  and 
accountable  for  actions  of  such  outsourced 
entities with respect to co-location services.

 A  facility  that  allows  stock  brokers/data 
vendors  to  connect  to  the  stock  exchange 
trading  system  over  a  Local  Area  Network 
(LAN)  shall  fall  within  the  definition  of  
‘Co-location/proximity  hosting’  as  defined

to  Stock 

Stock  exchanges  have  been  advised 

to 
formulate  a  comprehensive  policy  document  for 
providing  stock  market  related  data  to  market 
participants  in  a  fair  and  transparent  manner 
irrespective of the type of mechanism used by them 
for  broadcasting  the  data.  In  this  context,  stock 
exchanges shall ensure the following:

a) 

b) 

c) 

 Appropriate  tools  are  deployed  so  as  to 
monitor the service quality of data feeds;

 Appropriate  mechanisms  (load  balancers, 
randomizers,  etc.)  to  manage  load  across 
systems  disseminating  data 
in  order  to 
ensure consistent response time to all market 
participants;

 All  communication  to  market  participants, 
especially  on  all  technology  related  matters 
such  as  monitoring  tool,  load  balancer  and 
randomization  are  abundantly  clear  and 
precise providing all necessary details related 
to  the  concerned  facility/service  including 
information  on  features,  benefits  and  risks 
of the concerned facility/service, particularly 
for  participants  who  have  opted  for  a  
co-location facility. Earlier SEBI had directed 
stock exchanges to synchronize their system 
clocks  with  an  atomic  clock  before  the  start 
of  the  market  such  that  their  clocks  have 
precision  of  at  least  one  microsecond  and 
accuracy  of  at  least  +/-  one  millisecond.  In 
this regard, the stock exchange should ensure 
that all clocks of the servers and other related 
systems  are  synchronized.  Stock  exchanges 
may  adopt  suitable  mechanisms  to  ensure 
such synchronization of system clocks.

 Review of the Framework of Position Limits 
for Currency Derivatives Contracts

With  a  view  to  easing  trading  requirements 
in the currency derivatives segment, it was clarified 
to  market  participants  that  the  position  limit 
linked  to  open  interest  will  be  applicable  at  the 
time of opening a position and such positions will 
not  be  required  to  be  unwound  in  the  event  of  a 
drop of total open interest in a currency pair at the 
stock exchange. It was also clarified that in such a 
scenario,  eligible  market  participants  will  not  be 
allowed to increase their existing positions or create 
new positions in the currency pair till they comply 
with the applicable position limits.

E. 

 Review  of  the  Position  Limits  Available  to 
Stock  Brokers  /  Foreign  Portfolio  Investors 
(FPIs) - Category I & II / Mutual Funds (MFs) 
for Stock Derivatives Contracts

In order to ease trading requirements of stock 
brokers/foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) - Category 
I & II/mutual funds (MFs) in the equity derivatives 
segment,  it  was  decided  to  modify  their  position 
limits for stock derivatives contracts as given below. 

The  extant  sub-position  limits  applicable  on 
stock  futures  including  quantitative/value  based 
restrictions on position limits for stock derivatives 
were removed. Accordingly, it was decided that the 
combined  futures  and  options  position  limit  for 
stock brokers/FPIs (Category I & II)/mutual funds 
shall be 20 per cent of the applicable market wide 
position limit (MWPL).

F. 

 Restriction on acceptance of Fixed deposits 
as collateral by clearing corporations

Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Risk 
Management  Review  Committee,  SEBI  further 
aligned  the  risk  management  practices  of  the 
Clearing  Corporations  with  the  Principles  for 

Financial  Market  Infrastructures  (PFMIs).  SEBI 
advised the clearing corporations not to accept as 
collateral  those  fixed  deposits  that  are  issued  by 
trading members/clearing members themselves or 
issued  by  banks  that  are  associates  of  the  trading 
members/clearing  members.  Trading  members/
clearing  members  who  had  already  offered  such 
fixed deposits as collateral prior to the issuance of 
the circular were advised to replace such deposits 
with eligible collateral within six months.

In line with the recommendations of the Expert 
Committee on Clearing Corporations, SEBI advised 
the  clearing  corporations  to  build  their  investment 
policy  on  the  premise  of  highest  degree  of  safety 
and  least  market  risk.  Clearing  corporations  were 
advised  to  broadly  invest  in  central  government 
securities, liquid scheme of debt mutual funds (up 
to 10 per cent of its total investible resources at any 
point of time) and fixed deposits of banks that have 
a net worth of more than ` 500 crore and are rated 
A1/AI+  or  equivalent.  SEBI  further  advised  that 
the clearing corporations’ investments in the above 
instruments, cash and bank balance and investment 
in  other  eligible  instruments  as  specified  by  SEBI 
be  considered  as  liquid  assets  for  the  purpose  of 
calculation of net worth of a clearing corporation.

Box 1.6: Milestones - India's first Financial Services Centre (IFSC)

With the objective of facilitating the operation of a securities market at International Financial Services Centre 
(IFSC) SEBI issued the SEBI (International Financial Services Centres) Guidelines, 2015. Subsequently, to 
facilitate the participation of market participants at IFSC, SEBI also took several other steps. To begin with, 
it prescribed the framework for market structure and risk management to operationalize stock exchanges/
clearing corporations at IFSC. Some of the steps taken are:
•	

 Market Structure: In order to achieve synergies in terms of various operations and to facilitate ease of 
doing business, a single market structure has been prescribed in IFSC.
	Trading Hours and Settlement: Stock exchanges have been permitted to conduct trading for 23 hours 
and 30 minutes in a day with settlement at least twice a day.
 Product  Categories:  All  categories  of  exchange-traded  products  as  available  for  trading  in  stock 
exchanges in Financial Action Task Force (FATF)/International Organization of Securities Commission 
(IOSCO) compliant jurisdictions have been made eligible for trading on exchanges in IFSC.
 Risk Management Framework: Clearing corporations have been given the freedom to evolve margining 
frameworks based on best practices in clearing corporations globally, with the Committee on Payments 
and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) IOSCO PFMIs. 
 Dispute  Resolution  Mechanism:  To  resolve  securities  market-related  disputes,  the  International 
Arbitration Centre in IFSC has been allowed to offer arbitration, mediation and other dispute resolution 
mechanisms. 

•	

•	

•	

•	

In addition, commodity derivatives have been specified as eligible securities for trading on exchanges in 
IFSC.
SEBI issued guidelines for participation/functioning of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and eligible foreign 
investors (EFIs) in IFSC. SEBI-registered FPIs proposing to operate in IFSC have been permitted without 
any additional documentation and/or prior approval process. In order to provide ease of registration and 
the account opening process by clients, trading members of recognized stock exchanges at IFSC have been 
permitted to rely on the due diligence process already carried out by a SEBI registered intermediary. In case 
of EFIs not registered with SEBI as FPIs, trading members are allowed to rely on the due diligence carried 
out by a bank permitted by RBI to operate in IFSC.
SEBI  has  granted  recognition  to  the  India  International  Exchange  (IFSC)  Ltd.  (India  INX)  and  the  India 
International Clearing Corporation (IFSC) Limited (India ICC) for a period of one year. NSE IFSC Limited 
and  NSE  IFSC  Clearing  Corporation  Ltd.  have  been  granted  in-principle  approval  for  setting  up  stock 
exchanges and clearing corporations in GIFT IFSC. India INX and India ICC were inaugurated by the Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi in January 2017.

 THE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES MARKET 

The steps taken by SEBI for the regulation and 
development of the commodity derivatives market 
are:

A.  Goods Notified under SCRA

There  were  113  goods  notified  by  the 
central  government  under  the  Forward  Contract 
Regulation Act, 1952 (FCRA) on the basis of which, 
the  Forward  Market  Commission  (FMC)  granted 
permission  to  the  exchanges  to  launch  futures  on 
different  commodities.  Apart  from  these  notified 
goods, there were a few commodities which were 
neither notified under Section 15 of FCRA, nor were 
they  prohibited  under  FCRA  Section  17,  futures 
on  which  were  permitted  by  erstwhile  FMC  for 
trading  on  commodity  derivatives  exchanges.  In 
exercise of the powers conferred by clause (bc) of 
Section  2  of  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation) 
Act,  1956  (SCRA)  and  in  consultation  with  SEBI, 
the  central  government  notified  91  goods  for 
derivatives  trading.  These  notified  goods  include 
earlier  notified  goods  after  reorganizing/clubbing 
names of the related commodities and also include 
six new goods for derivatives trading -- diamonds, 
brass, pig iron, eggs, cocoa and tea.

 Introduction  of  Options  in  the  Commodity 
Derivatives Market

In  his  Union  Budget  speech  for  2016-17,  the 
Finance Minister announced that ‘new derivatives 
products  will  be  developed  by  SEBI 
in  the 
commodity  derivatives  market.’  Introduction  of 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

new  commodity  derivatives’  products  has  been 
a  subject  of  deliberations  as  their  introduction 
is  considered  to  be  conducive  for  the  overall 
development of the commodity derivatives market 
by attracting broad based participation, enhancing 
liquidity,  facilitating  hedging  and  bringing  in 
more depth to the commodity derivatives market. 
The  recommendations  made  by  the  Commodity 
Derivatives  Advisory  Committee  (CDAC)  inter-
alia,  on  the  introduction  of  new  products  were 
considered  by  the  Board  and  subsequently  in 
September  2016,  SEBI  allowed  trading  in  options 
subject to detailed guidelines that it will issue.

C. 

Strengthening Risk Management

Immediately  after  the  merger  of  FMC  with 
SEBI, a comprehensive risk management framework 
was  prescribed  to  streamline  and  strengthen  risk 
management at the national commodity derivatives 
exchanges and align these to the extent appropriate 
with  the  securities  market’s  norms.  To  further 
strengthen  the  risk  management  framework  of 
national commodity derivatives market and to avoid 
any  systemic  risks,  additional  risk  management 
norms  were  issued  during  September  2016.  Some 
important features of the new system are:

•	

•	

•	

	Enhancement in initial margins to have better 
risk coverage.

Concentration margins on big positions.

	Tools for handling default such as liquidation 
in  the  normal  market,  auction  of  positions, 
voluntary tear-up and partial tear-up.

Box 1.7: Strengthening Risk Management in National Commodity Derivatives Exchanges

A SEBI Task Force was constituted in February 2016, with the objective of reviewing and giving suggestions 
to further strengthen the regulation of the commodity derivatives market and to avoid any systemic risks. 
Based on its recommendations and further discussions in the Risk Management Review Committee (RMRC), 
additional / modified risk management norms, some of which are unique to commodity derivatives, were 
prescribed to further strengthen risk management systems of commodity derivatives exchanges:

 Initial margin based on the peculiarity of the product including its level of liquidity: Initial margins 
are the first level of defence against default. As per the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market 
Infrastructures (PFMI), initial margins should be sufficient to cover potential future exposure in the interval 
between the last margin collection and the close out of positions following a participant default. 
 The  initial  margins  being  imposed  by  national  commodity  derivatives  exchanges  were  designed 
to cover 99 per cent value at risk over a one day horizon and they thus covered price risk between 
consecutive  daily  mark-to-market  settlements  only.  Thus,  the  price  risk  subsequent  to  any  pay-in 
default till the time of liquidation of open positions was not covered. The risk was especially more in 
illiquid contracts where more than one day may be required to close a defaulter’s positions. 
 Accordingly,  exchanges  were  required  to  scale  up  initial  margins  based  on  the  liquidity  of  each 
product and a minimum of two days risk coverage by initial margins was specified for all commodity 
derivatives contracts.
 Concentration margins: Default in concentrated positions pose a greater risk as a longer period will 
be  required  to  liquidate  the  concentrated  positions.  Thus,  concentrated  positions  warrant  higher 
safeguards commensurate with the risks that they pose. Exchanges were therefore required to impose 
higher margins on concentrated positions based on the size of the position and the available liquidity.
 Tools to regain matched book: There may be situations of drying up of market liquidity and exchanges 
not being able to liquidate positions following default by a member. To eliminate the risk of such open 
positions, the following tools were prescribed to be preferably utilized in order of priority so as to 
avoid market disruptions:
o 
o 
o 
o 
 Proactive  measures  to  avoid  default:  Repeated  shortfalls  in  margins/pay-ins  by  a  member  are  an 
indication of the stressed condition of the member. To avert any potential risk from such a member, the 
following preventive measures were prescribed:
o 
o 
 Default waterfall: In order to instil greater confidence in participants of the clearing and settlement 
system  and  till  the  clearing  and  settlement  of  commodity  derivatives  is  transferred  to  clearing 
corporations,  a  uniform  default  waterfall  was  prescribed  for  commodity  derivatives  exchanges  in 
alignment with that prescribed for clearing corporations in the securities market.
 Exchanges’ contribution to SGF: Exchanges were required to make good any shortfalls in SGF based 
on the results of stress tests without any upper ceiling (which was earlier capped at 5 per cent of the 
gross revenue in any year).

Liquidation in the normal market in an orderly manner
Auction of positions
Voluntary tear-up with compensation to impacted parties
Partial tear-up with higher compensation to impacted parties 

Require the member to reduce positions
Higher initial margins/exposure free deposits for a month for such members

to  have  robust  and  credible 
warehousing 
in  the  commodity 
derivatives  market,  SEBI  reviewed  the  existing 
norms  for  exchange  accredited  warehouse  service 
providers (WSPs), warehouses and assayers. Based 
on  the  feedback,  in  September  2016  SEBI  issued 
revised  warehousing  norms  for  agricultural  & 
agri-processed commodities traded on the national 
commodity  derivatives  exchanges  to  ensure  good 
delivery and to maintain the integrity of the delivery 
mechanism in the interest of trade. The key features 
of the norms for WSPs are:
•	

	Minimum net worth requirement of ` 25 crore 
for multi-commodity WSPs.
	Storage value of goods in the warehouse not 
to exceed 33 times the net worth of WSP.
Fit and proper criteria.
Compulsory accreditation of assayers.

for  Eligibility,  Retention  and 
 Criteria 
Re-introduction  of  Derivative  Contracts  on 
Commodities 

Since the nature/properties of one commodity 
differ  from  another,  all  commodities  may  not 
be  suitable  for  commodity  derivatives  trading. 
Hence,  before  allowing  any  derivatives  contracts 
on any commodity, the appropriateness/usefulness 
of  commencing  futures  trading  in  products  (not 
necessarily  of 
just  commodities),  needs  to  be 
ascertained.  Therefore, 
in  January  2017  SEBI 
laid  down  criteria  for  eligibility,  retention  and  
re-introduction 
on 
commodities which will be followed by all national 
commodity derivatives exchanges.

G.  Consultative Approach

Policy decisions and reform measures taken by 
SEBI generally emanate after extensive consultative 
processes  through  various  advisory  committees. 
While  evolving  policy  changes,  SEBI  endeavours 
to  seek  comments  from  the  investing  public  and 
stakeholders through the public comments process.

a)  Advisory Committee

In order to advise SEBI to effectively regulate 
and develop the commodity derivatives market, an 
advisory  committee,  the  Commodity  Derivatives 
Advisory  Committee  (CDAC)  was  constituted 
under  the  Chairmanship  of  Professor  Ramesh 
Chand,  Member,  NITI  Aayog.  CDAC  in  its  first 
meeting held on March 04, 2016 constituted three 
sub-groups:

i. 

 Group-I to examine the impact and utilization 
of  commodity  derivatives  market  and  frame 
objective  criteria  for  inclusion  /  exclusion 
of  commodities  from  derivatives  trading. 
This  group  conducted  five  meetings  during 
the 
financial  year  and  deliberated  on 
various issues and presented its reports and 
recommendations to CDAC on the following 
matters:
a. 

 Guidelines  for  permitting  derivatives 
on commodities
 Criteria  for  exit  of  commodities  for 
derivative contract

SEBI  organized  various  meetings  with 
stakeholders  and  market  participants  such  as 
mutual  funds  and  alternative  investment  funds 
(AIFs) to deliberate on issues related to participation 
by  MFs  and  AIFs  in  the  commodity  derivatives 
meetings.  Besides  this,  SEBI  organized  meetings 
for various stakeholders -- members of commodity 
derivatives  exchanges,  value  chain  participants  of 
commodities such as diamonds, castor seeds, sugar, 
soya complex including meal and soya oil, nickel,

IV.  MUTUAL FUNDS

A.  Restriction on Redemption of Mutual Funds

Extant provisions on restriction of redemption 
were  general  in  nature  and  did  not  specifically 
spell out the circumstances in which restriction on 
redemption may be applied leading to discretionary 
disclosures and practices in the industry. Therefore, 
in  order  to  bring  more  clarity  and  to  protect  the 
interests of the investors, SEBI vide its circular dated 
May  31,  2016,  now  prescribed  that  the  following 
should be observed before imposing restrictions on 
redemptions:

a. 

 Restrictions may be imposed when there are 
circumstances  leading  to  a  systemic  crisis 
or  event  that  severely  constricts  market 
liquidity  or  the  efficient  functioning  of 
markets such as: 

 Liquidity  Issues  -  when  the  market  at 
large  becomes  illiquid  affecting  almost 
all  securities  rather  than  any  issuer 
specific security. Further, restriction on 
redemption is not allowed in instances 
where  a  specific  security  becomes 
illiquid in the portfolio of scheme due to 
a poor investment decision.

 Market  Failures,  Exchange  Closures 
-  when  markets  are  affected  by 
unexpected  events  which  impact  the 
functioning of exchanges or the regular 
course of transactions.

 Operational Issues – when exceptional 
circumstances  are  caused  by 
force 
majeure,  unpredictable  operational 
problems  and  technical  failures  (for 
example, a black out).

ii. 

iii. 

b. 

c. 

 Restrictions  on  redemption  can  be  imposed 
for a specified period of time not exceeding 10 
working days in any 90-day period.

 Any  imposition  of  restrictions  will  require 
specific  approval  of  the  boards  of  asset 
management companies (AMCs) and trustees 
and  SEBI  should  be  informed  about  this 
immediately.

d. 

 When restrictions on redemption are imposed, 
the following procedure shall be applied:

i. 

ii. 

 All redemptions requests up to ` 2 lakh 
shall not be subject to such restrictions.

 Where  redemption  requests  are  above 
` 2 lakh, AMCs shall redeem the first ` 
2 lakh without such restrictions and the 
remaining part over and above ` 2 lakh 
shall be subject to such restrictions.

This 

information 

should  be  disclosed 
prominently  and  extensively  in  scheme  related 
documents.

 Prudential  Limits  in  Sector  Exposure  for 
Housing Finance Companies (HFCs)

In  light  of  the  role  of  housing  finance 
companies  (HFCs)  especially  in  the  affordable 
housing space, it has been decided on February 22, 
2017  to  expand  the  exposure  limits  provided  for 
HFCs in the financial services sector to 15 per cent 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

with respect to limits on sectoral exposure for debt 
schemes. Such securities have to be rated AA and 
above  and  the  issuer  HFCs  should  be  registered 
with the National Housing Bank (NHB). However, 
the total investments in HFCs cannot exceed 25 per 
cent of the net assets of the scheme.

Box 1.8: Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are mutual fund products that provide exposure to an index or a basket of securities that trade on 
the exchange like a single stock. As with any listed security, investors may trade ETF units continuously at 
market prices. Through ETFs, investors can gain portfolio exposure to specific sectors, styles, asset classes, 
industries or countries. ETFs offer lower operating costs as compared to traditional open-end funds; they 
also provide flexible trading, diversification and greater transparency. 
ETFs are usually passively managed funds wherein the subscription / redemption of units works on the 
concept of exchange with underlying securities. In other words, large investors / institutions can purchase 
units by depositing the underlying securities with the mutual fund / asset management company and can 
redeem by receiving the underlying shares in exchange of units. Units can also be bought and sold directly 
on the exchange.
ETFs can be of various types -- Index ETF, Physical ETF, Synthetic ETF, Inverse ETF, Leverage ETF and 
Actively Managed ETF. Gold ETF is a form of a physical ETF wherein the underlying is physical gold and 
gold related instruments. 
In India the first ETF, called Nifty BeEs, was launched in 2002 by Benchmark MF. The first Gold ETF was 
launched by Benchmark in 2007. The total assets under management (AUM) and number of ETFs in India as 
on March 31, 2017 are given in Table 1C.

CPSE ETF (Central Public Sector Enterprise ETF)
As a part of its disinvestment programme, on May 02, 2013 the Government of India (GoI) approved the 
setting up of a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) exchange traded fund comprising of equity shares of 
10 CPSEs, which would be launched as a CPSE ETF scheme. The fund will invest in the 10 PSU stocks, which 
are the constituents of the Nifty CPSE Index, in the same proportion as the index.

The ETF launched in March 2014 raised ` 3,000 crore during the New Fund Offer (NFO) of the scheme. 
Thereafter, in January 2017 GoI disinvested ` 6,000 crore through the scheme by launching a Further Fund 
Offer (FFO). The scheme received a total subscription of ` 13,557 crore and was oversubscribed by around 
`  7,557  crore.  In  March  2017,  through  another  FFO,  GoI  divested  `  2,500  crore.  The  scheme  was  again 
oversubscribed to the tune of ` 6,792 crore. The units of the scheme were offered at an upfront discount of 
3.5 per cent- 5.00 per cent to all the investors who invested during the NFO/FFO.
As on March 31, 2017, the total AUM of CPSE ETF was ` 7,732.53 crore and it had 2,49,844 folios.

Retail Participation in CPSE ETF
It was observed that there was huge retail participation during all the three launches of the CPSE ETF and 
retail investors had oversubscribed during NFO/FFOs.
The  total  amount  and  number  of  subscriptions  received  from  retail  investors  at  the  launch  of  the  three 
tranches of the ETF is given in Table 1D.

disinvestment of shares and accordingly, a new ETF with diversified CPSE stocks and other government 
holdings will be launched in 2017-18.

C.  Disclosure of Votes Cast by Mutual Funds

Vide  SEBI  circular  dated  August  10,  2016, 
it was decided that the certification on the voting 
reports  being  disclosed  by  AMCs  on  a  quarterly 
basis in line with the circular dated March 24, 2014 
will be obtained from the ‘scrutinizer’ in terms of 
Rule 20 (3) (ix) of the Companies (Management and 
Administration) Rules, 2014. This will be submitted 
to  the  trustees  and  also  disclosed  in  the  relevant 
portion of the mutual funds’ annual reports and on 
their websites. The boards of AMCs and trustees of 
mutual funds will be required to review and ensure 
that  AMCs  have  voted  on  important  decisions 
that  may  affect  investor  interests  and  that  the 

rationale  recorded  for  vote  decisions  is  prudent 
and adequate. Confirmation of this, along with any 
adverse  comments  made  by  the  scrutinizer,  have 
to  be  reported  to  SEBI  in  the  half  yearly  trustee 
reports.

D.

/  Trading  in  Securities  by 
 Investment 
Employees  of  AMC(s)  and  Trustees  of 
Mutual Funds

With  an  objective  of  bringing  about 
alignment  of  SEBI  circulars  providing  guidelines 
for investment/ trading in securities by employees 
of  AMC(s)  and  trustees  with  the  principles  laid 
down  in  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading) 
Regulations, 2015, and to remove difficulties in the 
implementation  of  these  guidelines,  the  following 
provisions have been modified: 

a. 

 Investments  in  units  of  schemes  floated  by 
Mutual Funds / AMCs, where the concerned 
persons  (in  terms  of  the  applicability  of 
the  circular)  are  employed,  shall  be  as  per 
SEBI  guidelines  for  investment  /  trading  by 
employees of AMC(s) and Trustees of Mutual 
Funds.  However,  investments  in  schemes  of 
other Mutual Funds have been removed from 
the scope of these guidelines.

c. 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

 The applicability of these guidelines has been 
widened  to  include  transactions  for  sale  or 
purchase  of  securities  made  in  the  name  of 
employees’  parents,  siblings  and  children  of 
the employee or of the spouse, any of whom 
is  either  dependent  financially  on  such  an 
employee,  or  consults  such  an  employee 
in  taking  decisions  relating  to  trading  in 
securities.

 Prior to this circular, an AMC access person 
was not permitted to trade in any share and/
or  debenture  and/or  bond  and/or  warrant 
of  the  company  or  derivatives  wherein  any 
scheme  of  the  concerned  MF  had  traded  in 
the last 15 days prior to the date of the written 
application  by  the  such  an  access  person 
(‘cooling  off  period’).  However,  pursuant 
to  this  circular,  trades  executed  pursuant 
to  trading  plans  submitted  by  employees  in 
terms of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) 
(PIT) Regulations, 2015 are exempt from the 
requirement of a ‘cooling off period,’ provided 
that such trading plans:
(i) 

in  compliance  with  the  norms 
 are 
prescribed  in  SEBI  (PIT)  Regulations, 
2015.
 are publicly disclosed on the website of 
the concerned MF.

(ii) 

d. 

e. 

 Further, the compliance officer is required to 
properly  monitor  trades  of  the  MF  scheme 
and that of the access person as per the trading 
plan  in  order  to  ensure  that  such  a  trading 
plan does not entail trading in securities for 
market abuse.

 The  validity  of  approval  given  by  the 
compliance  officer  to  an  access  person  for 
carrying out a sale or purchase of a security 
has been modified from seven calendar days 
to seven trading days.

In  February  2017  SEBI  decided  that  the 
provision  for  obtaining  positive  consent  from  a 
majority  of  the  unit  holders  for  participation  in 
derivative  instruments  by  existing  schemes  will 
be removed because of the challenges involved in 
obtaining positive consent from existing investors. 
However,  before  a  scheme’s  participation 
in 
derivatives,  all  investors  of  the  scheme  will  be 
given an exit option with no exit load for 30 days 
as  against  an  exit  option  for  only  dissenting  unit 
holders mandated earlier.

 Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts 
(REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts 
(InvITs) by Mutual Fund schemes

Mutual funds have been allowed to invest in 
hybrid securities such as units of REITs and InvITs

dated  February  15,  2017.  Any  existing  scheme 
intending  to  invest  in  units  of  REITs/InvITs  will 
have  to  abide  by  the  provisions  of  Regulation  18 
(15A)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996.

of 

With  an  objective  to  disclose  a  MF  scheme’s 
performance related information in a more effective 
and  simple  manner  in  advertisements,  in  March 
2017 SEBI decided that:

a. 

 Performance of MF schemes will be advertised 
in terms of the compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR)  for  the  past  year,  three  years,  five 
years and since inception in place of the earlier 

b.

requirement  to  publish  the  scheme’s  returns 
for as many 12-month periods as possible for 
the past three years.

 Performance  advertisements  of  MF  schemes 
should  provide  information  based  on  the 
last  day  of  the  month-end  preceding  the 
date  of  advertisement,  instead  of  the  earlier 
requirement of publishing such data based on 
last day of preceding quarter-end.

 Performance  of  other  schemes  managed 
by  the  fund  manager  will  be  disclosed  in 
a  summarized  manner  and  MFs  will  be 
permitted  to  provide  an  exact  link  to  such 
summarized  information  in  internet-enabled 
media.

It was also decided that celebrity endorsements 
of mutual funds will be permitted at the industry 
level and not for endorsing a particular MF scheme 
or as a branding exercise of a MF house. Further, 
SEBI  prior  approval  will  be  required  for  issuing 
advertisements which feature celebrities.

 Advisory Committee on Mutual Funds (MFAC)

SEBI  has  an  Advisory  Committee  on 
Mutual  Funds  (MFAC)  which  comprises  industry 
representatives, investor associations, government 
representatives  and  other 
stakeholders.  The 
committee provides a platform for interaction and 
deliberations on issues related to the MF industry. 
It  acts  as  a  platform  for  SEBI  to  place  its  various 
regulatory development activities and at the same 
time the industry places its agenda before SEBI for 
further consideration. During financial year 2016-17, 
the  committee  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri 
Janki  Ballabh,  the  former  Chairman  of  the  State 
Bank of India, met twice on November 17, 2016 and

Box 1.10: Permanent Registration for Market Intermediaries

SEBI had been following a two-step process of granting registration to market intermediaries viz. initial and 
permanent was being followed. The concept of initial registration was introduced in order to enable periodic 
review of the performance of the intermediaries when they applied for permanent registration. Considering 
the  various  measures  taken  by  SEBI  to  continuously  review  the  performance  of  intermediaries  such  as 
disclosure of change in information or particulars previously furnished by the intermediary, which have a 
bearing on the certificate granted to it, half-yearly internal audit, inspection by depositories / SEBI, periodic 
reports, applicability of fit and proper person criteria, risk based supervision, to prevent duplication of the 
registration process, to save cost of compliance and to facilitate ease of doing business for intermediaries 
the SEBI Board in its meeting held on September 23, 2016 decided that henceforth a one-step permanent 
registration will be granted to market intermediaries. Accordingly, relevant SEBI Regulations were amended 
by notifying SEBI (Change in Conditions of Registration of Certain Intermediaries) (Amendment) Regulation,

deliberate on measures and guidelines to bring about greater transparency in the policies of CRAs, enhance 
the standards followed by the industry thus facilitating ease of understanding of the ratings by investors.
Accordingly, SEBI issued a circular dated November 01, 2016 and March 31, 2017 on Enhanced Standards for 
Credit Rating Agencies which prescribed the following:
I. 
 

Policy with respect to non-co-operation by the issuer:
 SEBI has made it mandatory for CRAs to review the rated instrument on an on-going basis throughout 
the instrument’s lifetime, on the basis of best available information, even in case of non-cooperation by 
the issuer. The format of press release and the rating symbol, in case of non-co-operation by the issuer 
has been standardized across CRAs.

II.	 Accountability	and	managing	conflict	of	interest:
	

	CRAs	have	been	advised	to	set	out	the	obligations,	responsibilities,	management	of	conflict	of	interest,	
eligibility,	composition,	system	of	voting	etc.	of	rating	committee	members	and	the	roles,	responsibilities	
and desired timelines for analysts in their operational manuals. Persons having business responsibilities 
have	been	prohibited	from	being	part	of	the	Rating	Committee,	barring	the	MD/	CEO,	provided	that	a	
majority	of	the	Rating	Committee	members	are	independent.	An	annual	review	of	the	functioning	of	
the	rating	committees	is	required	to	be	carried	out	by	all	CRAs.
III.  Standardization of format of press release for rating actions:
 

 CRAs have been directed to follow a standardized template for a press release communicating rating 
action.	The	template	specifies	the	minimum	information	to	be	disclosed	in	the	press	release	–	rating	
action and rating outlook, details of the instrument, key rating drivers, rating history, reference to 
applicable criteria, contact details of the rating analyst, etc.

IV.  Mandatory disclosures on CRAs’ websites:
 

 It has been made mandatory for CRAs to make certain disclosures on their websites. These include 
the criteria used for rating various instruments and sectors and for default recognition, rating process 
and policies and any changes therein, all rating history, press releases and rating reports by the CRAs, 
including ratings withdrawn and those non-accepted by the issuer, even in case of non-public issues, 
rating transition/ rating history of the issuer, details of all such ratings where the review became due 
but was not completed by the due date by the CRA, etc.

V.  Withdrawal of bank loan and mutual fund ratings
 

 While CRAs may withdraw the ratings of open-ended mutual fund schemes on request from the asset 
management company, the ratings will be placed on notice of withdrawal for at least 30 days and this 
will be publicly available on a CRA’s website. In case of bank facilities, ratings may be withdrawn on 
request from the borrower along with a no-objection from the lending bank(s). Further, at the time of 
withdrawal, the CRA shall assign a rating to such facility/ security and issue a press release as per the 
prescribed format, mentioning the reason(s) for withdrawal.

VI.  FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS 

 

A.  Offshore Derivatives Instruments (ODIs)

SEBI  took  the  following  steps  to  further 
tighten norms relating to issuance and transfer of 
ODIs:

 Regulation  22  (2)  of  SEBI  (Foreign  Portfolio 
Investors) Regulations, 2014 (FPI Regulations) 
has been amended as follows:

b) 

 a  foreign  portfolio  investor  shall  ensure 
that  any  transfer  of  any  offshore  derivative 
instruments  issued  by  or  on  behalf  of  it,  is 
made subject to the following conditions :
a) 

 The  offshore  derivative 
instrument 
are  transferred  to  persons  subject  to 
fulfilment of sub-regulation (1)2; and
 Prior  consent  of  the  foreign  portfolio 
investor  is  obtained  for  such  transfer,

 Reconfirmation  of  ODI  Positions: 
ODI  issuers  are  required  to  carry  out 
reconfirmation  of  ODI  positions  on 
a  semi-annual  basis.  In  case  of  any 
divergence  from  the  reported  monthly 
data,  SEBI  should  be  informed  in  the 
format provided.
 Periodic  Operational  Evaluation:  ODI 
issuers  are  required  to  put  in  place 
necessary  systems  and  carry  out  a 
periodical review and evaluation of its 
controls,  systems  and  procedures  with 
respect to ODIs. A certificate should be 
submitted on an annual basis to SEBI by 
the Chief Executive Officer or equivalent 
of an ODI issuer.

 It  was  further  clarified  that  ODI  subscribers 
who  have  subscribed  to  ODIs  under  SEBI 
(Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 
1995  can  continue  to  subscribe  to  ODIs 
under the FPI regime subject to the condition 
that  they  comply  with  Regulation  22  of  FPI 
Regulations  and  meet  the  eligibility  criteria 
as  laid  down  in  the  SEBI  circular  dated 
November  24,  2014  along  with  other  norms 
which  may  be  notified  by  SEBI  from  time 
to  time.  Those  ODI  subscribers  who  do  not 
meet  the  aforementioned  norms,  including 
unregulated funds whose investment manager 
is  appropriately  regulated,  can  continue  to 
hold the position till the date of expiry of such 
positions or till December 31, 2020, whichever 
is earlier. Such subscribers cannot take fresh 
positions or renew old positions.

iii. 

 Applicability  of  Indian  KYC/AML 
Norms for Client Due Diligence: ODI 
issuers  are  now  required  to  identify 
and  verify  beneficial  owners  (BOs) 
in  subscriber  entities,  who  hold  in 
excess  of  the  threshold  25  per  cent 
in  case  of  a  company  and  15  per  cent 
in  case  of  partnership  firms  /  trusts  / 
unincorporated  bodies.  This  is  defined 
under  Rule  9  of  the  Prevention  of 
Money-laundering

the ‘Combined Corporate’ debt limit for all foreign 
investments  in  rupee  denominated  bonds  issued 
both onshore and overseas by Indian corporates. It 
has  also  been  decided  that  foreign  investments  in 
overseas rupee denominated bonds will be reckoned 
against the combined corporate debt limit. However, 
these  investments  will  not  be  treated  as  FPI 
investments and hence will not be under the purview 
of the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors), Regulations, 

2014. The criteria for foreign investments in overseas 
rupee denominated bonds will be as defined by the 
Reserve Bank of India from time to time.

C. 

 Increase  in  Government  Debt  Investment 
Limits for FPIs

In  October  2016  SEBI  enhanced  the  limit 
for  investments  by  FPIs  in  government  securities 
(Table 1.6).

respectively. The incremental limits of ` 3,500 crore 
each for investments by FPIs in state development 
loans (SDLs) was also made available for investment 
on tap with effect from October 03, 2016 and January 
02, 2017 respectively.

D. 

 Permission  to  FPIs  to  Trade  Directly  in 
Corporate Bonds Without a Broker

SEBI  has  taken  the  following  decisions  for 
permitting FPIs to trade directly in corporate bonds:

i. 

 Category  I  and  Category  II  FPIs  will  have 
an option to directly access corporate bond 
markets without brokers as has been allowed 
to  banks,  insurance  companies,  pension 
funds etc. Access to over-the-counter (OTC), 
request  for  quote  (RFQ)  and  electronic 

ii. 

book  provider  (EBP)  platforms  of  RSE  will 
be  provided  to  FPIs  only  for  proprietary 
trading.

 A  proposal  for  amending  Rule  8(4)  of  the 
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 
will be taken up with the Government of India 
to permit FPIs to become members of RSEs for 
the limited purpose of proprietary trading. 

E. 

 Review of Requirement of PAN Card to FPI 
Accounts

In  November  2016  SEBI  clarified 

that 
the  PAN  of  FPIs 
intermediaries  can  verify 
online  from  websites  authorized  by  Income  Tax 
Department at the time of account-opening for FPIs. 
However, FPIs need to provide a copy of the PAN 
card  within  60  days  of  account-opening  or  before 
remitting funds out of India, whichever is earlier to 
their intermediaries.

 Participation  of  Eligible  Foreign  Investors 
(EFIs) and FPIs in the International Financial 
Services Centre (IFSC)

In  January  2017  SEBI  permitted  registered 
FPIs, proposing to operate in IFSC to do so without 
undergoing any additional documentation and / or 
prior approval process. In case of FPIs’ participation 
in IFSC, a trading member of the recognized stock 
exchange  in  IFSC  may  rely  on  the  due  diligence 
process  already  carried  out  by  a  SEBI  registered 
intermediary during the course of registration and 
account-opening process in India. 

In case of participation of an EFI not registered 
with SEBI as a FPI but desirous of operating in IFSC, 
a trading member of the recognized stock exchange 
in IFSC may rely on the due diligence carried out by 
a bank which is permitted by RBI to operate in IFSC 
during the EFI’s account-opening process. 

G. 

 Investments  by  FPIs  in  Unlisted  Corporate 
Debt  Securities  and  Securitized  Debt 
Instruments

In  February  2017  SEBI  permitted  FPIs  to 

invest in the following instruments: 

a) 

 Unlisted corporate debt securities in the form

residual maturity of three years and end-use 
restrictions on investments in the real estate 
business, capital market and purchase of land. 

b) 

Securitized debt instruments which may be: 

(i)

 any  certificate  or  instrument  issued 
and  listed  in  terms  of  the  SEBI  (Public

It was also decided that investments by FPIs 
in unlisted corporate debt securities and securitized 
debt  instruments  shall  not  exceed  `  35,000  crore 
within  the  extant  corporate  debt  limit  which  is 
currently ` 2,44,323 crore.

Box 1. 12: The Corporate Bond Market in India

India’s financial system has traditionally been largely dominated by the banking system where a majority 
of the corporate entities depend on loans from banks and financial institutions and they have not shown 
much interest in raising even a small part of the required long term resources from the market through 
bonds and other debt instruments. The various sources of funding for the industry for its business needs 
are bank credit, external commercial borrowings, commercial papers and certificate of deposits. There is a 
need for mobilizing funds from the corporate bond market as it provides an alternative source of finance and 
supplements the banking system to meet the requirements of the corporate sector to raise funds for long-
term investments. 
However, of late there has been a change and it is observed that the industry is gradually expanding its reach 
towards the corporate bond market and reducing its reliance on bank credit. Chart 4 gives a comparison of 
bank credit to corporate bonds.

Chart 4: Comparison of bank credit to corporate bonds

     Source: Care ratings and SEBI. 

 
It	can	be	seen	in	Chart	4	that	since	FY	2012-13,	there	has	been	an	increase	in	lending	through	bank	loans	as	
compared	to	corporate	bonds.	However,	there	was	a	slight	dip	in	bank	credit	in	FY	2014-15	as	compared	to	
FY	2013-14.	Further,	in	FY	2016-17,	there	was	lending	of	only	` 6.32 lakh crore through bank credit (till March 
31, 2017) whereas around ` 6.7 lakh crore was raised through the issuance of corporate bonds. 
The growth in bank credit was lower primarily due to less demand from the corporate sector as well as banks 
being saddled by huge NPAs and stringent capital requirements under Basel norms. 
The size of the corporate bond market is increasing every year which shows that corporates and borrowers 
are gradually favouring raising funds through the corporate bond market. Better transmission of policy rate 
changes to the bond market and increased transparency and price discovery could be possible reasons for a 
spike in the corporate bond market. 
It is understood that when a corporate issues bonds/debentures which are subsequently listed and traded 
on the stock exchange, the financials, credit ratings of such bonds/issuers and details such as defaults made 
by the issuer in honouring its debt obligations are available in the public domain. The availability of such 
information in the public domain enables investors to assess the health of the company and make prudent 
investment decisions. Thus, corporate bonds are emerging as one of the preferred sources of financing by 
investors. 
The Government of India has also been proactive and taken a number of measures for the deepening of 
the corporate bond market in India. The implementation of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code, 2016 and 
the measures taken by RBI such as Credit Supply for Large Borrowers through the Market Mechanism for 
pushing corporates towards market borrowings and away from bank denominated lending may contribute to 
the overall growth of the corporate bond market. These statistics only point towards a developing corporate 
bond market in India. A vibrant and a deep corporate market will go a long way in improving the growth of 
the economy and sustaining its huge infrastructure requirements.

 Electronic  Book  Mechanism  for  Issuing 
Debt Securities on a Private Placement Basis

SEBI  laid  down  a  framework  for  issuing 
of  debt  securities  on  a  private  placement  basis 
through an electronic book mechanism in order to 

streamline procedures for issuance of debt securities 
on  a  private  placement  basis  and  enhancing 
transparency to discover prices.

Box 1.13: Electronic Book Mechanism for Private Placement of Corporate Bonds

Over  the  past  several  years  various  measures  have  been  taken  by  SEBI,  the  government  and  RBI  for 
developing the corporate bond market. The Indian corporate bond market has evolved gradually over a 
period of time. Earlier, the price discovery of privately placed debt securities was being done either over the 
telephone among identified investors and issuers with the help of arrangers or by physical bids sent to the 
issuer by investors or by submitting individual bids on the portal provided by the issuer. These methods 
were opaque since most of the investors were brought in by the arranger(s) appointed by the issuer and 
there were hardly investors directly approaching the issuer. This resulted in many market malfunctioning 
like poor price discovery, arrangers taking a significant portion of the issue on their books and down-selling 
it without disclosing the price at which the securities were bought.
Keeping in view these issues and challenges, in April 2016 SEBI laid down a framework for an electronic book 
mechanism (EBM) for issuing of debt securities on a private placement basis in order to streamline procedures 
for issuing debt securities on a private placement basis and enhancing transparency in discovering prices. 
Accordingly, from July 01, 2016, NSE and BSE started their operations as electronic book providers (EBPs).

Salient Features of EBM:
The electronic book mechanism is an online portal wherein the issuer enters issue related details which can 
only be seen by eligible investors. Further, the investors need to get enrolled on the EBP before they can start 
bidding. EBP has the following participants:
  Issuer
  Arranger: RBI registered non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), SEBI registered merchant bankers
  Sub-arrangers: As appointed by the arranger. They may be SEBI registered brokers
 

 Investors: They may be institutional investors (qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) and non-qualified 
institutional buyers (non-QIBs)) and non-institutional investors such as HNIs. Once enrolled with EBPs, 
QIBs are eligible to directly bid for any of the issuance on the EBPs, whereas non-QIBs can only bid once 
they have been made eligible by the issuer.

To start with, the mechanism has been made mandatory for all issuances of ` 500 crore and above, inclusive 
of the green shoe option, if any, in a financial year. It is voluntary for issuances less than ` 500 crore. It is 
also voluntary for those issuances wherein there is only one investor.
Mechanism for Price discovery: Investors put their bids on a yield basis. Once the bidding is over, the bid 
book is provided to the issuer which in turn does the allotment. Such bidding is not mandatory on the part of 
the issuer to make allotments, that is, it may seek another round of bids for the same issue. SEBI has provided 
broad operational guidelines and accordingly EBPs have notified their own operational guidelines which 
include:

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

39

  Bidding procedure – whether open or closed bidding
 

 Negotiation window – EBPs also provide a mechanism for negotiations among the issuer and investors 
through the portal 
Issue parameters – EBPs set issue specific parameters in consultation with the issuer
 Mandatory uploads – once the allotment has been done by the issuer it provides the data to the EBP 
which get uploaded on its website on an anonymous basis

 
 

The  key  benefits  of  an  electronic  book  vis-à-vis  over-the-telephone  market,  inter-alia,  are  improvements 
in  efficiency,  transparency  of  the  price  discovery  mechanism  and  reduction  in  cost  and  time  taken  for 
such  issuances.  Apart  from  these,  eligible  institutional  investors  (which  are  predominantly  investors  in 
the privately placed debt market) can directly bid on the EBPs and can also negotiate on the EBPs. The 
mechanism has helped in reducing information asymmetry since eligible investors can directly access issue 
related information and can bid directly on the EBPs irrespective of their physical location. It has created a 
win-win situation for issuers and investors alike. As a result, the yield spread between 10-year G Sec and 
AAA	rated	corporate	bonds	of	a	similar	tenure	shrunk	substantially	in	the	last	quarter	of	the	FY	2016-17.

B.  Restrictions on Wilful Defaulters

SEBI amended the SEBI (Issue and Listing of 
Non-Convertible  Redeemable  Preference  Shares) 
Regulations  (NCRPS  Regulations)  and  the  SEBI 
(Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities)  Regulations 
(ILDS Regulations), 2008 to impose restrictions on 
wilful defaulters. As per the amendments to NCRPS 
Regulations, no issuer will make any public issue of 
NCRPS / debt securities, if as on the date of filing 
of draft offer document or final offer document, the 
issuer or any of its promoters or directors is a wilful 
defaulter or it is in default of payment of interest or 
repayment of principal amount with respect to non-
convertible redeemable preference shares issued by 
it to the public, if any, for a period of more than six 
months.

Further, the following disclosures also have to 
be made in case of listing of NCRPS / debt securities 
made on private placement:
a) 

 Name  of  the  bank  declaring  the  entity  as  a 
wilful defaulter;
 The year in which the entity was declared a 
wilful defaulter;

c) 

 Outstanding  amount  when  the  entity  was 
declared a wilful defaulter;

f) 

d)  Name of the entity declared a wilful defaulter;
 Steps taken, if any, for removal from the list of 
e) 
wilful defaulters;
 Other disclosures, as deemed fit by the issuer 
in order to enable investors to take informed 
decisions; and
 Any  other  disclosure  as  specified  by  the 
Board.

g) 

Besides  the  amendments,  the  fact  that  the 
issuer or any of its promoters or directors is a wilful 
defaulter will be disclosed prominently on the cover 
page with suitable cross referencing to the pages.

C.  Revised Formats for Financial Results

SEBI  prescribed  the  revised  formats  for 
financial results and implementation of Ind AS by 
listed entities which have listed their debt securities 
and  /  or  non-cumulative  redeemable  preference 
shares.  As  per  the  revised  formats,  from  2017 
onwards  the  disclosure  of  half  yearly  and  annual 
financial  results,  that  is,  the  balance  sheet  and 

b) 

40

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

the statement of profit and loss will be as per the  
formats prescribed in Schedule III to the Companies 
Act,  2013.  However,  banking  and 
insurance 
companies  have  to  follow  the  formats  prescribed 
under their respective acts / regulations as specified 
by their regulators. SEBI also prescribed that until 
the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards) 
Rules, 2015 (Ind AS Rules) become applicable for a 
listed entity, the listed entity shall adopt Companies 
(Accounting  Standards)  Rules,  2006  (AS  Rules)  as 
prescribed  by  the  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs 
(MCA). 

SEBI  has  also  specified  the  format  for 
financial results to be published in the newspapers, 
which is in terms of Regulation 52 (8) of the Listing 
Regulations. It is now mandatory for listed entities, 
adopting  the  Indian  Accounting  Standards,  to 
ensure that while publishing the half yearly/annual 
financial  results  the  comparative  financial  results, 
filed  along  with  the  said  half  yearly  /  annual 
financial results, are also Ind AS compliant.

D.  Alternative to ‘Net worth’ for Municipalities

The SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities 
by  Municipalities)  Regulations,  2015  have  been 
amended to provide for a criteria alternative to ‘net 
worth’  for  municipalities  making  public  issues  of 
debt  securities  under  these  regulations.  In  order 
to facilitate issuance of debt securities under these 
regulations  by  entities  other  than  the  Corporate 
Municipal Entity (CME), it has been provided that 
the  municipalities  making  public  issues  of  debt 
securities under these regulations shall have surplus 
as per their income and expenditure statements in 
any  of  the  immediately  preceding  three  financial 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

years or any other financial criteria as specified by 
SEBI from time to time.

E. 

 Dispensation Provided to the Municipalities 
with respect to Submission of Accounts

to 

In  following  the  operational  procedures 
for  submission  of  accounts,  it  is  difficult  for 
municipalities  to  submit  audited  accounts  for 
the  immediately  preceding  financial  year  in  the 
information  memorandum  submitted 
the 
stock  exchanges  for  private  placement  issues  of 
debt  securities.  Hence,  in  order  to  kick-start  and 
provide an impetus to the municipal bond market 
in  India,  SEBI  has  provided  certain  dispensations 
to  the  municipalities  with  respect  to  submission 
of  accounts  for  private  placement  issues  of  debt 
securities under the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt 
Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015. An 
issuer proposing to issue debt securities under these 
regulations in the financial year 2017-18 is required 
to submit the audited accounts for financial years 
2013-14,  2014-15  and  2015-16  in  the  information 
memorandum  to  the  stock  exchanges.  For  the 
immediately preceding financial year (2016-17), the 
issuer  is  required  to  submit  half  yearly  financial 
statements  as  available  (audited  or  unaudited)  as 
on September 2016. 

Issuers  are  also  required  to  submit  audited 
accounts for 2016-17 within one year from the end of 
that 2017-18 to recognized stock exchanges, where 
the  debt  securities  have  been  listed.  Such  audited 
accounts  are  to  be  displayed  on  the  websites  of 
recognized stock exchanges and the issuers. Issuers 
are  also  required  to  provide  on  request  a  copy 
(physical or electronic) of such audited accounts to 
its investors.

Box 1.14: Trade Repository for corporate bonds in India

Corporate bond market in India is mainly institutional market dominated by Banks, Mutual Funds, Insurance 
companies and Provident Funds etc. These institutions prefer to trade in corporate bonds in the OTC market. 
SEBI mandated reporting of OTC trades in corporate bond in reporting platform provided by NSE, BSE, 
FIMMDA (currently phased out) and MSEI. Presently, there are multiple reporting platforms available for 
reporting of the OTC trades in the corporate bonds. As a result consolidated trade data for trades executed 
in corporate bonds and other information about corporate bonds such as rating migration, primary issuance 
and bond yields with different maturities etc. are not available at a central place. 
A Trade Repository aggregates and disseminates trade related data such as price, yield and volume & other 
relevant information in different financial instruments such as bonds derivatives to market participants. A 
Trade Repository for corporate bonds would bring greater level of post trade transparency and bring greater 
level of information to the market participants in bond market by disseminating data such as price, yield, 
volume, specific maturities and credit migrations of a corporate paper etc. Further such consolidation of data 
may be useful tool to know client level exposures/ concentration in particular bonds (e.g. exposure of any 
mutual fund to particular corporate paper etc.). 
SEBI has decided to set up Trade Repository for corporate bonds in two phases. Phase I covers integration of 
secondary market data pertaining to corporate bonds. While Phase II covers integration of data across primary 
and secondary market. Exchanges and Depositories have been permitted to set up trade repositories. Phase I 
has been implemented with effect from June 30, 2016 and Phase II of Trade repository has been implemented 
from October 30, 2016. Accordingly, Stock Exchanges (NSE, BSE & MSEI) and Depositories (NSDL & CDSL) 
have been disseminating primary and secondary market related data in an integrated manner to provide 
holistic view about corporate bonds in India to market participants.

VIII.  OTHER  POLICIES  AND  PROGRAMMES 
HAVING A BEARING ON THE WORKING 
OF THE SECURITIES MARKET

A. 

Surveillance of Stock Exchanges 
India is home to the largest number of listed 
companies in the world. The number of companies 
traded daily on the Indian stock exchanges is more 
than the total number of listed companies in many 
jurisdictions.  However,  it  has  been  observed  that 
the shares of many low cap companies / companies 
with poor fundamentals traded on stock exchange 
platforms  have  witnessed  abnormal  price  rises 
which  are  not  supported  by  any  significant 
financial/operational performance. 

the 

SEBI  and 

stock  exchanges  have 
surveillance mechanisms in place and have taken 
action (suspension of trading in scrips, debarment 

of suspected entities, etc.) after analysing internal 
alerts  as  well  as  external  references.  Surveillance 
measures  like  the  introduction  of  periodic  price 
bands,  shifting  to  trade  for  trade  (TfT)  and 
tightening  the  price  bands  are  taken  by  stock 
exchanges  based  on  the  alerts  generated  in  the 
surveillance system and an analysis of trading in 
scrips.

With a view to pre-empt the misuse of trading 
platforms of stock exchanges, it was decided to also 
put in place certain preventive measures to check 
the abnormal increases in the prices of scrips, more 
particularly  in  the  case  of  companies  which  have 
poor fundamentals. Subsequent to discussions with 
stock  exchanges,  a  joint  proposal  was  finalized 
by  the  stock  exchanges  on  implementing  graded 
surveillance measures.

Box 1.15: Implementation of Graded Surveillance Measures (GSMs) by Stock Exchanges

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

In a market economy, the price of a financial asset is determined by the interaction of the forces of demand 
and supply. The screen-based order-driven anonymous trading platform ensures a nation-wide market for 
the securities listed on the stock exchanges. However, in the case of many companies which have low capital 
bases / poor fundamentals and infrequent trading history, the equilibrium price so discovered was not in sync 
with their financial health and / or operational performance. This happened as certain market participants 
could  abuse  the  stock  exchange  trading  systems.  Concerned  about  such  misuse  of  the  stock  exchange 
platforms, it was felt that certain preventive measures need to be taken to put a check on the abnormal 
increases in the prices of scrips, more particularly in the case of companies which have poor fundamentals.
Subsequent to discussions with stock exchanges it was decided to introduce graded surveillance measures 
(GSMs). These measures work as pre-emptive steps to reduce/check instances of market manipulation in 
identified scrips. GSMs are intended to deal with the abnormal increases in share prices of companies which 
are apparently not in line with their disclosed fundamentals or business models, more particularly companies 
which have poor fundamentals.
The graded surveillance measures cover two phases:
a) 

 Shortlisting  of  companies  with  surveillance-related  concerns,  based  on  the  pre-defined  objective 
criteria. The criteria will be subject to review.
 The operationalization of the GSM framework which includes restrictions such as placing / continuing 
the securities in the trade for trade (TfT) category, once-in–a-week trading, once-in-a-month trading 
and  imposing  additional  surveillance  deposits  as  may  be  required  upon  breaching  the  prescribed 
threshold. The broader framework for initiating GSMs was identified as:

Transfer to the TfT category with a price band of 5 per cent or lower, as applicable.
Continuance in the TfT category with a price band of 5 per cent or lower as applicable and additional 
surveillance deposit (ASD) of 100 per cent of the trade value to be collected from the buyer.
Trading permitted only once-in-a-week (every Monday) and ASD of 100 per cent of the trade value 
to be deposited by the buyers.
Trading permitted only once-in-a-week (every Monday) and ASD of 200 per cent of the trade value 
to be deposited by the buyers.
Trading permitted only once-in-a-month (first Monday of the month) with ASD of 200 per cent of 
the trade value to be deposited by the buyers.
Trading permitted only once-in-a-month (first Monday of the month) with no upward quote in the 
price of the security with ASD of 200 per cent of the trade value to be deposited by the buyers.
 Identified Securities would be moving from one stage to another stage based on certain pre-
defined objective criteria.
 A  periodic  review  of  the  securities  under  Graded  Surveillance  Measures  to  assess  the 
relaxation of the surveillance action, if any, shall be carried out on a quarterly basis. 

Only securities under Stage II onwards shall be eligible for the quarterly review. Accordingly all the stock 
exchanges issued the notices/circulars so as to inform the market and to put in place the Graded Surveillance 
Measures.

for  accessing  capital  resulting  in  further  ease  of 
doing business, entrepreneurial activities, etc.

IX.  ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS

I. 

ASSESSMENT 

An efficient, fair and vibrant securities market 
facilitates the channelization of both domestic and 
international  flows  into  investments  and  capital 
formation.  This  in  turn  translates  into  growth  for 
the economy. The Indian securities market has kept 
good pace with the positive economic environment 
in the country.

A.  Overall Policy Direction 

SEBI has been taking a number of transformative 
steps  for  developing  and  strengthening  a  well 

44

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

regulated,  modern  securities  market  in  India  that 
can play the vital role of meeting the capital needs 
of the economy. The main thrust of these steps has 
been  towards  enhancing  market  trust,  increasing 
the penetration of the securities market, enhancing 
investor  education  and  awareness,  enhancing 
governance  norms,  strengthening  enforcement, 
facilitating fund raising by corporates and aligning 
the development of the securities market with the 
needs of the economy. 

B. 

Steady Market Growth 

India  today  features  among  the  top  10 
markets  in  terms  of  market  capitalization;  market 
capitalization in India has increased from less than 
one-third to more than four-fifth of its GDP in the 
last  25  years.  This  compares  very  well  with  other 
emerging  markets.  The  value  of  trading  on  the 
major exchanges has also more than quadrupled in 
the  last  20  years.  Cumulative  FII/FPI  investments 
grew 100 fold over this period. Resources mobilized 
through public and rights issues increased by more 
than 50 times in the same period. Equity oriented 
assets under management (AUM) of mutual funds 
increased  by  over  30  times  in  just  15  years  and 
AUM of non-equity oriented assets of mutual funds 
increased by over 15 times during the same period. 

C. 

Policy Initiatives in 2016-17

2016-17  saw  SEBI  continuing  its  journey  on 
the  path  of  building  a  stronger  and  more  vibrant 
Indian  capital  market  while  giving  paramount 
importance to upholding investor protection. SEBI 
endeavoured  to  meet  its  objectives  of  protecting 
investor  interests,  regulation  and  development  of 
the Indian securities market by ushering in several 
policy  initiatives  in  various  areas  of  the  market. 
Some  of  the  major  directions  of  policy  initiatives 
undertaken  by  SEBI  during  2016-17,  inter-alia, 
include the following: 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

Development  of  the  Commodity  Derivatives 

Market

SEBI  assumed  the  task  of  regulating  the 
commodity derivatives market in September 2015. 
Since then it has been taking several policy measures 
to strengthen the regulation of the market and also 
for  further  developing  the  commodity  derivatives 
market  in  India.  Some  of  the  important  measures 
taken by SEBI during 2016-17 include formulating 
a  framework  for  the  introduction  of  ‘Options’  in 
commodities and the revision and strengthening of 
risk management practices and warehousing norms 
for  commodities.  The  Commodity  Derivatives 
Advisory  Committee  (CDAC)  was  constituted 
to  advise  SEBI  on  effectively  regulating  and 
developing the commodity derivatives market. 

Framework  for  the  International  Financial 

Services Centre (IFSC)

To  make  IFSC  at  GIFT  City,  Gandhi  Nagar 
operational, a broad framework for the functioning 
of  stock  exchanges  and  clearing  corporations  in 
IFSC was put in place during 2016-17. Steps were 
also  taken  for  putting  in  place  other  necessary 
measures  such  as  the  inclusion  of  derivatives  on 
equity shares of companies incorporated in India as 
permissible securities in IFSC and a framework for 
mutual funds and portfolio managers in IFSC. 

Ease of Doing Business

Ease of doing business in the Indian securities 
market is an important area of focus for SEBI which 
in  line  with  the  overall  national  agenda.  For  this 
SEBI  initiated  several  important  measures  such 
as	 rationalization	 of	 the	 know	 your	 client	 (KYC)	
regime  for  the  securities  market  in  line  with  the 
centralized	KYC	regime	being	implemented	for	the	
Indian  financial  market;  client  registration  forms 
were  simplified  and  made  available  in  15  local 
languages on the stock exchanges/brokers’ websites; 
the procedure for transmission of securities in the 

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

45

event  of  death  were  standardized  and  simplified; 
various  intermediaries  were  provided  permanent 
registration  as  against  the  earlier  practice  of 
registration for a period of three years/ five years; 
arbitration  mechanisms  at  stock  exchanges  were 
strengthened and the number of arbitration centres 
was  increased  to  enhance  investors  and  brokers’ 
access to the stock exchange arbitration mechanisms; 
FPIs (Category I and II) were allowed to access the 
corporate bond market directly without the help of 
brokers; SEBI Alternative Investment Regulations, 
2012 were amended providing more flexibility and 
access  to  capital  from  angel  funds;  the  position 
limits available to stock brokers/FPIs/MFs for stock 
derivatives contracts were reviewed; an electronic 
book  building  mechanism  was  introduced  for 
private  placement  with  issue  size  of  `  500  crore 
and  above;  and  fees  imposed  on  various  market 
participants was calibrated to rationalize the cost of 
doing business. 

Governance

Effective  governance  is  a  necessary  and 
important  tool  for  protecting  the  interests  of 
various  stakeholders,  particularly  small  investors, 
in  the  market.  This  has  been  an  important  area 
of  focus  for  SEBI.  Continuing  with  the  initiatives 
taken  in  previous  years  to  strengthen  the  norms 
for  governance  in  the  Indian  securities  market, 
2016-17 saw measures like disclosures of executive 
remunerations  by  mutual  funds;  disclosure  of 
dividend distribution policies by the top 500 listed 
entities  by  market  capitalization;  extending  the 
applicability  of  business  responsibility  reporting 
requirements  to  the  top  500  listed  entities  based 
on  market  capitalization  from  the  earlier  top  100 
listed  entities;  implementation  of  new  accounting 
standards Ind-AS by listed entities; empowerment 
of stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed 
entities;  strengthening  of  disclosure  of  votes  by 
mutual funds and putting in place norms to address 

concerns  related  to  private  equity  funds  entering 
into  compensation  agreements 
incentivize 
promoters, directors and key managerial personnel 
of listed investee companies in a manner that could 
potentially lead to unfair practices. 

to 

Market Integrity and Investor Protection

Market integrity is key for investor protection 
and  the  overall  fairness  of  the  market.  SEBI  took 
some  important  steps  during  the  year  to  further 
this objective which, inter-alia, included tightening 
of  offshore  derivatives  instruments  (ODI),  norms 
relating  to  issuance  and  transfer  of  ODIs;  norms 
for restrictions on redemptions by MFs; restrictions 
on  fund  raising  by  wilful  defaulters;  delisting  of 
around 400 suspended listed companies on various 
stock  exchanges;  enhanced  standards  for  credit 
rating  agencies  (CRAs);  an  enhanced  supervisory 
mechanism  for  protection  of  clients’  assets  with 
brokers; graded surveillance mechanisms by stock 
exchanges to check abnormal rises, if any, in prices 
of  scrips;  strengthening  the  capacity  of  SEBI’s 
enforcement  function;  reviewing  of  guidelines  for 
co-location / proximity hosting facilities offered by 
stock exchanges; comprehensive policy documents 
by  stock  exchanges  for  providing  stock  market 
related  data  to  market  participants;  initiation  of  a 
consultation to revisit the SEBI Investment Advisers 
Regulations; and a decision to implement a three-
tier structure for tackling cyber security of market 
infrastructure  institutions  in  the  Indian  securities 
market. 

Market Development

In  order  to  further  develop  the  Indian 
securities  market  as  an  avenue  for  fund  raising, 
SEBI followed steps required for further facilitating 
activation  of  fund  raising  through  REITs,  InvITs, 
and  municipal  bonds  through  coordination  with 
the  government  to  iron  out  tax  related  and  other 
operational issues. Norms for mutual funds, which 

46

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

are  getting  significant  inflows  of  funds,  were 
simplified for their participation in the derivatives 
market and investments by FPIs were permitted in 
unlisted  corporate  debt  securities  and  securitized 
debt instruments. In order to expand the scope of 
the National Institute of Securities Market (NISM) 
established  by  SEBI,  the  new  NISM  campus  at 
Patalganga was inaugurated by the Prime Minister 
in  December  2016.  With  improved  infrastructure, 
NISM will be in a better position to play an even 
greater role in building the capacity of the securities 
market. 

Market Oversight and Enforcement 

like 

stock 

Market oversight through inspections, market 
surveillance  and  effective  enforcement  actions 
against violations of provisions under the SEBI Act 
are important for maintaining market integrity and 
promoting  overall  confidence  in  the  market.  SEBI 
undertook  inspections  of  market  infrastructure 
institutions 
exchanges, 
clearing 
corporations  and  depositories.  An 
increased 
number of inspections were undertaken for various 
types of market intermediaries identified in terms 
of  their  risk  assessments.  In  order  to  tackle  the 
menace  of  illegal  fund  raising  by  unauthorized 
collective  investment  schemes  and  by  companies 
through deemed public issues (DPIs) of securities, 
SEBI passed a number of appropriate interim/ final 
orders.  SEBI  issued  warning/  deficiency  letters  to 
intermediaries for various non-compliances of SEBI 
regulations/ guidelines. 

Stock 

exchanges 

undertook 

several 
surveillance actions like shifting of scrips to the trade 
for  trade  segment,  imposition  of  restrictive  price 
bands and initiation of preliminary investigations. 
SEBI also initiated various regulatory actions based 
on the findings of investigations undertaken by it. 
With regard to enforcement, SEBI disposed of 140 
enforcement actions under Sections 11, 11B and 11D 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

of  the  SEBI Act,  1992;  seven  enquiry  proceedings; 
83  adjudication  proceedings  and  87  prosecution 
proceedings;  and  three  summary  proceedings 
during 2016-17. 

D.  Highlights of the Indian Securities Market 

Market Performance

In 2016-17, the benchmark stock market index 
NIFTY	 increased	 by	 18.55	 per	 cent	 (as	 compared	
to -9.87 per cent in 2015-16). This was better than 
the  movements  of  benchmark  indices  in  most  of 
the  other  major  markets  during  2016-17:  China  
(7.28 per cent), Japan (12.83 per cent), South Korea 
(8.24  per  cent),  Hong  Kong  (16.05  per  cent)  and 
South Africa (0.91 per cent). 

Improved  Fund  Raising  from  the  Capital 

Market 

Total funds raised from capital market through 
various  channels  like  public  issues,  right  issues, 
qualified 
institutional  placements,  preferential 
issues, private placements of debt and funds raised 
by alternative investment funds (AIFs) is gradually 
increasing. In 2016-17 the capital raised through all 
these channels was ` 7,735 billion; y-o-y this was 30 
per cent more as compared to 2015-16. 

AIFs play an important role in financing new 
generation entrepreneurs. Fund raising by AIFs has 
consistently  increased  since  the  inception  of  their 
regulations by SEBI in 2012. In 2016-17, AIFs raised 
`182.65 billion; y-o-y this was 38 per cent more as 
compared to 2015-16.

Encouraging  Trend 

in  Mutual 

Fund 

Investments

There  have  been  increasing  net  investment 
flows to mutual funds with more than `3.4 trillion 
inflow during 2016-17 as a result of which MFs’ AUM 
reached an all-time high of more than `17.5 trillion 

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

47

by the end of 2016-17. From a negative investment 
scenario in equity oriented MFs during 2013-14, the 
industry witnessed consistent positive net inflows 
of more than `700 billion into equity oriented MFs 
in each of the last three financial years, making the 
net  investments  in  equity  oriented  mutual  funds 
more than `2.25 trillion during the last three years. 

Even  while  FPI  net  investments  exhibited 
some volatility, investments in mutual funds have 
consistently increased in recent years, which in turn 
have been invested by mutual funds in equities and 
debt. This acted as an effective force in containing 
market volatility even when the FPIs were divesting. 

II. 

PROSPECTS 

Economic Outlook 

According  to  the  World  Economic  Outlook 
update  April  2017,  global  economic  activity  is 
picking  up  with  a  long-awaited  cyclical  recovery 
in  investments,  manufacturing  and  trade.  World 
growth is expected to increase from 3.1 per cent in 
2016 to 3.5 per cent in 2017 and 3.6 per cent in 2018. 
As far as the Indian economic outlook is concerned, 
multilateral  agencies  like  IMF  have  reiterated  in 
the  recent  past  that  the  Indian  economy  today  is 
in  a  ‘bright  spot.’  Recent  results  of  state  elections 
have  further  strengthened  political  stability  in 
the  country  and  have  raised  expectations  of  an 
accelerated  reform  programme,  leading  to  an 
overall  positive  business  sentiment.  According  to 
IMF projections, India will grow by 7.2 per cent in 
2017  and  7.7  per  cent  in  2018;  this  is  significantly 
higher than the 6.8 per cent growth in 2016. 

Greater Role for Market Based Financing

With  the  Indian  economy  poised  to  grow 
faster,  the  Indian  securities  market  will  have 
to  play  an  increasingly  bigger  role  in  financing 
various economic activities. Further, there is a need 
for  concerted  efforts  towards  further  developing 

the  Indian  securities  market  to  increase  market 
based  financing  and  supply  of  risk  capital.  SEBI’s 
endeavour in the coming years will, therefore, will 
be to create the right regulatory environment and 
facilitate the development of market infrastructure 
to meet the financing needs of economic activities 
through  the  securities  market.  SEBI  will  continue 
to facilitate financing though the primary market, 
REITs, InvITs, municipal bonds and the institutional 
trading  platform  (ITP)  by  regularly  reviewing 
relevant  regulations  to  make  them  more  attuned 
to  the  changing  market  dynamics,  while  striking 
a  balance  between  market  regulation  and  market 
development. 

Further  Development  of  a  Corporate  Bond 

Market 

The  securities  market  can  be  a  good  source 
of  debt  financing  only  in  the  presence  of  a  liquid 
and  vibrant  corporate  bond  market.  Further 
development  of 
the  corporate  bond  market 
through  trading  of  securitized  receipts,  increased 
participation  of  domestic  institutional  investors 
and  though  other  relevant  policy  and  operational 
measures  will  continue  to  engage  the  attention  of 
SEBI going forward. 

Channelizing Household Savings 

Increasing  the  role  of  the  Indian  securities 
market hinges on a transformational change in the 
current allocation of households’ savings between 
physical and financial assets. There is also a need 
to channelize more and more savings to productive 
financial assets. SEBI’s endeavour will be to provide 
the right infrastructure and processes for household 
investors  to  have  easier  access  to  investments 
in  financial  products.  For  scaling  up  this  effort, 
SEBI  will  work  with  industry  to  help  leverage 
technology  solutions  to  provide  more  efficient 
delivery channels, inter-alia, for financial education, 
investment products and grievance redressal.

financial 

literacy  and 

Financial education will remain an important 
area  of  focus  for  SEBI  in  making  investors  aware 
of  financial  planning  and  about  their  rights  and 
obligations  in  investments.  SEBI  will  continue 
to 
investor 
awareness,  both  through  physical  and  technology 
led  interventions.  Investors  need  to  know  that 
investments  are  serious  business  and  need 
medium-  to  long-term  investment  strategies,  as 
opposed  to  short  term  speculative  investments  to 
be able to meet investment goals. Given the recent 
success  in  the  performance  of  mutual  funds  in 
India, retail investors will be encouraged to invest 
more professionally with the help of mutual funds 
and to opt for systemic investment strategies over a 
medium to long term investment horizon. 

Continued Investor Confidence

More  and  more  investors  will  come  to  the 
market  only  when  they  feel  that  the  market  is 
safe  and  fair.  A  right  governance  framework  and 
a  transparent  and  clean  market  go  a  long  way  in 
meeting  these  expectations  of  investors  at  large. 
SEBI  will  focus  on  further  enhancing  overall 
governance  standards  in  the  market  be  it  for 
issuers,  intermediaries  or  market  infrastructure 
providers.  To  increase  the  role  of  institutional 
investors 
in  corporate  governance,  SEBI  will 
develop  a  draft  framework  on  the  lines  of  the 
Stewardship  Code  that  some  jurisdictions  have 
adopted. To make the market more fair, SEBI will 
keep a vigil on market activities and will take active 
steps  to  make  the  market  more  transparent.  SEBI 
will  also  try  to  enhance  market  integrity  through 
measures like timely enforcement actions, delisting 
of  suspended/  inactive  listed  companies,  linking 
of  individual  demat  accounts  with  Aadhar  and 
further  strengthening  the  framework  for  market 
surveillance.

derivatives market in India. SEBI will try and create 
a  commodity  derivatives  market  as  advanced  as 
the  securities  market  by  building  a  harmonious 
regulatory ecosystem between the securities market 
and  the  commodity  derivatives  market  segments. 
SEBI  will  take  necessary  steps  to  effectively 
implement  the  announcement  made  in  Union 
Budget 2017-18 of the integration of the commodity 
derivatives and securities markets by harmonizing 
various  regulatory  aspects  between 
two 
markets. Steps will also be taken to widen both the

is  changing  the  way  these  markets 
functioned  traditionally.  With  technology  driven 
evolution of financial markets, regulators are faced 
with  both  challenges  and  opportunities  to  evolve 
their own functioning to be more effective through 
the  adoption  of  new  technology  solutions.  SEBI 
will undertake consultations for evolving a policy 
framework  to  harness  the  opportunities  provided 
by financial technologies for both technology driven 
development and regulation of the securities market 
in  India  as  also  to  deal  with  potential  challenges 
that may be posed by advances in technology. 

Continuous Professionalization of the Market 
A  professional  market  is  important  for  its 
overall  development.  In  this  regard,  SEBI  will 
review  skill-set  requirements  of  a  dynamic  and 
vibrant  securities  market  suitable  to  the  changing 
requirements and position the National Institute of 
Securities Market (NISM) to lead the efforts of skill 
mapping, skill development and capacity building.

Overall Approach 

Markets 

have 

increasingly 

integrated 
globally  and  are  getting  more  and  more  complex 
with  the  emergence  of  new  products  and  cutting 
edge  technologies  and  processes.  In  this  scenario, 
regulators  need  to  upgrade  their  skills  as  per 
the  requirements  of  their  regulated  space  to 
be  effective.  Regulators  also  need  to  have  high 
quality  information  by  engaging  with  analysts 
to  capture  emerging  market  trends.  Being  fully 

aware of these facts, SEBI will continue to actively 
engage  with  market  experts  through  the  setting 
up  of  issue  specific  expert  groups;  through  wider 
stakeholder  consultations;  and  by  effectively 
leveraging  technology  solutions  across  its  various 
areas of operations. SEBI will strive to have a well-
considered and balanced approach in its endeavours 
to  meet  the  mandated  objectives  of  regulating 
and  developing  the  Indian  securities  market  and 
protecting investor interests in securities.

Trends and Operations in the Securities Market

1. 

THE PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

The  primary  market  was  characterized  by 

heightened  activities  in  2016-17  with  the 
initial public offering (IPO) revival gathering 
momentum. A positive investment climate supported 
by  robust  macroeconomic  performance,  easing 
inflationary pressures, stable FDI inflows, continuous 
regulatory  reforms  and  structural  reforms  by  the 
government improved the business confidence and 
attracted  investors  to  the  primary  market.  Several 
mega  issues  apart,  a  number  of  small  companies 
from diverse growth sectors of the economy entered 
the market. There was an overwhelming response to 
a majority of the public issues from foreign portfolio 
investors (FPIs), other institutional investors and the 
retail investors. A large number of the issues were 
over-subscribed  indicating  the  quality  of  issues 
and the appetite for public issues by the investors. 
Globally, trends in IPO statistics indicate that Asia-
Pacific was the epicentre of IPO activity in the 2016 
calendar year with India being the key highlight.

I. 

 Resource  Mobilization  through  Public  and 
Rights’ Issues

 
During  2016-17,  `  62,067  crore  was  mobilized 
through  122  public  and  12  rights  issues  as  against  
` 57,866 crore raised in 2015-16 through 94 public and 
13 rights issues (Table 2.1); 2016-17 was the year of the 

IPO market as there was a quantum jump in the number 
of IPOs and the amount mobilized by them. Of the 106 
IPOs in 2016-17, 77 were listed on the SME platform. 
The companies which came out with IPOs were from 
diverse and unconventional sectors in contrast to the 
trend of dominance by companies from a few sectors 
like banking, finance and IT in the IPO market since 
2000. While this indicates the gradual rise of capital 
market as a mode of finance among large and small 
corporates, it also provides an enormous opportunity 
for investors to invest in a cross-section of firms which 
represent  the  growth  economy.  The  amount  raised 
through IPOs in 2016-17 nearly doubled by 96.4 per 
cent to  ` 29,104 crore as compared to  ` 14,815 crore 
during 2015-16. As in the previous year, there was no 
follow on public offer (FPO) in 2016-17.
 
The share of public issues in the total resources 
mobilized increased to 94.5 per cent in 2016-17 from 
84.0 per cent in 2015-16, while the share of rights’ 
issues decreased from 16.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent 
during the same period. The share of debt issues in 
total resource mobilization stood at 47.6 per cent in 
2016-17 as compared to 58.4 per cent in the previous 
year. During 2016-17, `18,038 crore was mobilized 
through offers for sale by existing shareholders as 
against `7,712 crore in 2015-16.

Figure 2.1 gives the relative share of the four 
modes  of  resource  mobilization  --  IPOs,  FPOs, 
bonds and rights issues - since 2012-13. The share of 
IPOs has gone up significantly from 15.8 per cent in 
2014-15 and 25.6 per cent in 2015-16 to 46.9 per cent 
in 2016-17. While FPOs have had a scant presence in 
the primary market since 2012-13 except in 2013-14, 
the share of debt and rights’ issues declined during 
2016-17 vis-à-vis 2015-16.

with high growth potential and whose post-issue

In 2016-17, 77 companies were listed on the SME 
platforms  raising  `  809  crore  as  compared  to 
`  379  crore  raised  through  50  issues  in  2015-16, 
registering an increase of 113.5 per cent in resource 
mobilization (Figure 2.2).

with  a  98.2  per  cent  share  in  the  total  resources 
mobilized (Figure 2.3). Of the 134 issues, 133 were 
from the private sector which raised ` 60,943 crore 
compared to 96 issues which raised ` 26,768 crore 
in 2015-16. The single public sector issue garnered 
`  1,124  crore  compared  to  11  public  sector  issues 
raising ` 31,098 crore in 2015-16. The dominance of 
the private sector in the mobilization of resources 
from the primary market can be attributed to several 
factors including, inter-alia, resurgence of industrial 
activity,  buoyancy  in  the  secondary  market  and 
corporate  and  investor  confidence  in  the  capital 
market and its regulatory environment.

Size-wise Resource Mobilisation 

 
The  size-wise  distribution  of  capital  raised 
is  presented  in  Table  2.2.  While  there  were  more 
issues for issue sizes up to ` 100 crore, the amount 
mobilized continued to remain high in the cluster 
between  `  100  crore  and  `  500  crore.  In  2016-17, 
issues above ` 500 crore had a share of 90.1 per cent 
in the resources mobilized, as compared to 85.5 per 
cent in 2015-16. There were 29 issues of size equal 
to or greater than ` 500 crore in 2016-17 compared 
to 25 such issues in 2015-16. 

 
The average size of an issue (including public 
and  rights’  issues)  which  accessed  the  primary 
market in 2016-17 was ` 463.2 crore as compared to 
` 540.8 crore in 2015-16. In 2016-17, the mean public 
issue  size  declined  to  `  481  crore  as  compared  to 
` 517 crore in 2015-16. However, the mean IPO size 
increased to ` 275 crore in 2016-17 from ` 200 crore 
in 2015-16.

the cluster of the issue size of above ` 300 crore. The 
amount  raised  by  the  36  large  issues  constituted 
95.0  per  cent  of  the  total  resource  mobilisation 

through  public  and  rights  issues.  Out  of  the  total

IPOs  (through  offer  for  sale  (OFS))  constituted  41 
per  cent.  The  largest  issue  raised  during  2016-17 
was Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited’s 
debt issue (` 10,000 crore), which was followed by 
India  Bulls  Housing  Finance  Limited’s  debt  issue 
(` 7,000 crore) and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance

Preferential  allotments  are  covered  under 
Chapter VII of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2009.  This  mode  of 
resource mobilization is used by a listed company 
to issue equity shares/ fully convertible debentures 
(FCDs)/partly convertible debentures (PCDs) or any 
other financial instruments which will be converted 
to or exchanged with equity shares at a later date. 
The allotments are done on a preferential basis to 
a  select  group  of  investors  under  Section  81(1A) 
of  the  Companies Act,  2013.  Further,  the  issuer  is 
required to take the shareholders’ permission and 
should comply with various provisions as specified 
in the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 vis-à-vis the 
Companies Act, 2013. 

 
During  2016-17,  `  44,250  crore  were  raised

2016-17  witnessed  the  benchmark  indices 
rising  significantly  backed  by  resurgence  post 
the  demonetization,  political  outcomes  in  state 
elections  and  rising  foreign 
inflows  even  as 
the  international  developments  were  not  very 
encouraging.  There  were  a  multitude  of  global 
events  in  2016-17  which  influenced  the  markets 
including the slowdown in Chinese economy, weak 
global  trade  growth,  the  Brexit,  US  presidential 
elections,  policy  normalization  by  the  Federal 
Reserve  and  the  attendant  uncertainties  around 
each  of  these  events.  Nonetheless,  the  domestic 
macro-economic and political conditions remained 
favourable.  Strong  growth  rates,  benign  inflation 
and  contained  twin  deficits  despite  the  recovery 
of  global  crude  oil  prices,  positive  policy  actions 
including 
structural 
reforms like demonetization, progress on the GST, 
Aadhar  linked  public  policy  initiatives,  return  to 
a  normal  monsoon  rainfall,  and  reduced  external 
vulnerabilities were vital for institutional investors’ 
confidence in the India growth story and also in its 
markets.

S&P BSE Sensex (henceforth referred to as Sensex) 
and  NIFTY  50  (henceforth  referred  to  as  NIFTY) 
increased  by  a  significant  16.9  per  cent  and  18.5

II. 

 Performance  of  Major  Stock  and  Sectoral 
Indices

The sectoral and broad based indices showed 
promising  growth  during  2016-17.  The  trends  of 
these indices are shown in figures below. Among 
the  broad-based  BSE  indices,  BSE  100,  BSE  200 
and BSE 500 recorded year-on-year positive index 
gains of 21.2 per cent, 22.5 per cent and 24.0 per 
cent  respectively  over  the  previous  year.  The 
BSE  Small-Cap  Index  also  increased  by  36.9  per 
cent during 2016-17. Similarly, among major NSE 
indices,  the  NIFTY  Midcap  50,  NIFTY  Next  50 
(formerly  known  as  the  CNX  NIFTY  Junior)  and 
NIFTY 500 increased by 37.0, 33.9 and 23.9 per cent 
respectively in 2016-17.

Figure 2.8: Performance of major stock indices

With  divergent  growth  patterns  across 
developed and emerging market economies, global 
economic  growth  slowed  down  in  2016.  Weak 
economic  growth  in  major  advanced  economies 
such as the United States, Japan and in Euro-area, 
dragged down overall global growth. While capital 
inflows  to  emerging  market  economies  improved 
in  2016,  appreciation  in  the  US  dollar  following 
the  presidential  election  led  to  tight  financial 
conditions in some emerging markets. An increase 
in the US government bond yields increased long 
term inflation expectations and prospects of higher 
interest  rates.  Among  major  emerging  markets, 
economic  growth  in  China,  India,  Brazil,  Mexico 
and  Argentina  weakened  during  2016,  while 
Bangladesh,  Pakistan,  Indonesia  and  Thailand 
recorded  higher  economic  growth  during  the 
year.  Amid  weak  investment  and  global  trade, 
commodity  prices  recovered  from  the  declining 
trend  witnessed  in  the  past  two  years.  During  
2016-17, there was a sharp increase in energy and 
metal prices with moderate growth in food prices. 
The  oil  market  witnessed  a  steady,  broad-based 
growth in demand, while coal prices increased on 
strong demand and supply constraints in China. 

Global  equity  markets  across  the  world 
recorded  an  uptrend  during  2016-17.  Among  the 
emerging  markets,  the  year-on-year  index  change 
was  69.9  per  cent  for  Egypt’s  HERMES  index, 
followed by Argentina’s IBG Index (58.9 per cent) 
and Brazil’s IBOV Index (29.8 per cent) (Figure 2.7). 
Among developed equity markets, the year-on-year 
index  change  for  Germany’s  DAX  Index  was  23.6 
per cent, followed by US NASDAQ (21.4 per cent) 
and the UK FTSE 100 Index (18.6 per cent). Among 
the markets analysed, only South Africa recorded a 
negative return (0.4 per cent).

During  2016-17,  In  BSE’s  sectoral  indices, 
BSE  Tech  and  BSE  IT  registered  a  decline  of  5.5 
and 9 per cent respectively. The highest increment 
was  recorded  for  S&P  BSE  Metal  (56.5  per  cent), 
followed  by  S&P  BSE  Oil  (48  per  cent),  S&P  BSE 
Small Cap (36.9 per cent) and S&P BSE Bankex (32.8 
per cent) (Figure 2.9). 

Figure 2.9: Movement of BSE’s sectoral indices

Among  the  sectoral  indices  at  NSE,  NIFTY 
PSU  Bank  (44  per  cent)  recorded  the  highest 
increase  in  2016-17,  followed  by  NIFTY  PSE  
(40.9 per cent), NIFTY Petrochemicals (40 per cent) 
and NIFTY Midcap 50 (37 per cent), whereas NIFTY 
IT declined by 5.4 per cent (Figure 2.10).

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

The value of shares with respect to a company’s 
earnings  is  gauged  from  the  price-earnings  ratio 
(P/E). As on March 31, 2017 S&P Sensex and NIFTY 
50’s  P/E  ratios  were  22.6  and  23.3  respectively  as 
compared  to  19.3  and  20.9  respectively  on  March 
31, 2016 (Table 2.14). Month-wise data indicates that 

the highest NIFTY P/E ratio was observed in August 
2016 when it reached a level of 24.09, while for the 
Sensex the highest P/E ratio was observed in March 
2017 (at 22.63). On the other hand, monthly Sensex 
and NIFTY’s P/E ratios were at their respective lows 
in April 2016.

VI.  Volatility in Stock Markets

During  2016-17,  the  Indian  equity  markets 

were  less  volatile  as  compared  to  its  peers  in 
global  financial  markets.  India’s  volatility  index, 
India  VIX,  indicates  investors’  perceptions  of  the 
market’s  volatility  in  the  next  30  calendar  days. 
At the end of 2016-17, India VIX closed at 12.4 as 
compared to 16.6 at the end of 2015-16. During 2016-
17, annualized volatility of the Sensex, decreased 
to  12.1  per  cent  from  17.0  per  cent  recorded  in 
2015-16. A similar trend was observed for NIFTY 
which moved down from 17.1 per cent to 12.3 per 
cent  in  2016-17  (Table  2.16).  During  2016-17,  the 
S&P BSE Small cap recorded a volatility of 20.7 per 
cent, followed by S&P BSE 100 (17.3 per cent).

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

SEBI notified the exit policy for de-recognized/
non-operational  stock  exchanges  in  2012.  As  on 
March  31,  2017,  18  regional  stock  exchanges  had 
been granted exit by SEBI. Three stock exchanges – 
the Magadh Stock Exchange Ltd., the Ahmedabad 
Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  and  the  Calcutta  Stock 
Exchange Ltd. are under the exit process.

Activities of dormant RSEs are mainly routed 
through subsidiaries which have taken up trading 
membership of BSE and NSE. With respect to the 
exiting  exchanges,  the  turnover  in  subsidiaries  is 
considered up to the date of the exit order. During 
2016-17,  the  turnover  of  ASE  Capital  Markets 
Limited increased by 0.8 per cent to ` 54,295 crore 
from ` 53,870 crore in 2015-16.

IX.  Dematerialization

Dematerialization  has  progressed  at  a  fast 
pace  in  India  and  has  gained  acceptance  amongst 
the  market  participants  since  the  introduction  of 
the  depository  system.  All  actively  traded  scrips 
are  held,  traded  and  settled  in  demat  form.  The 
two  depositories  in  India  --  National  Securities 
Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository 
Services (India) Limited (CDSL) -- provide depository 
services to investors through depository participants 
(DPs). The depositories do not charge the investors 
directly, but charge their DPs who in turn charge the 
clients. However, as per SEBI directive, DPs cannot 

Table 2.21: Depository statistics 

Particulars

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

charge  investors  towards  opening  of  a  beneficiary 
owner  (BO)  account  (except  statutory  charges), 
credit  of  securities  into  a  BO  account  and  custody 
charges. With time, depositories have been reducing 
their charges along with the growth in volumes.

 

At  the  end  of  March  2017,  there  were 
155.81 lakh demat accounts at NSDL and 122.7 lakh 
demat  accounts  at  CDSL;  17,835  companies  had 
signed up for dematerialization at NSDL and 9,887 at 
CDSL as on March 31, 2017 (Table 2.21). The quantity 
of  dematerialized  securities  at  NSDL  increased  by 
19.8  per  cent  to  1,31,76,251  lakh  in  2016-17  from 
1,10,02,089 lakh in 2015-16. At CDSL, the quantity 
of  dematerialized  securities  increased  by  12.1  per 
cent from 22,75,489 lakh in 2015-16 to 25,51,508 lakh 
in 2016-17. The number of shares settled in demat 
form  and  their  value  increased  at  both  NSDL  and 
CDSL. Similarly the number of securities settled in 
demat form and their value observed an increase at 
both NSDL and CDSL in 2016-17. At NSDL, the total 
value of demat settled shares increased by 31.1 per 
cent from ` 20,09,725 crore in 2015-16 to ` 26,34,095 
crore in 2016-17. At CDSL, too, the value of shares 
settled  in  demat  form  increased  by  33.1  per  cent 
from ` 4,82,355 crore in 2015-16 to ` 6,41,849 crore 
in 2016-17. The ratio of dematerialized equity shares

The Derivatives Segment

A.  The Equity Derivatives Segment 

In comparison to the underlying cash market, 
India has a better position in being internationally 
competitive  in  equity  derivatives  and  is  placed 
among  the  best  in  the  world,  with  state-of-the-art 
technology, institutional mechanisms, products and 
market  size.  Though  derivatives  being  leveraged 
structures  have  the  potential  to  amplify  losses 
or  gains  in  an  asset  and  can  contribute  to  market 
volatility, in India they are increasingly being used 
by  hedgers,  speculators  and  arbitrageurs.  This  is 
evident  from  the  fact  that  the  equity  derivatives 
market  contributes  approximately  80.5  per  cent 
of the total traded value in the secondary market. 
The  volumes  in  the  Indian  derivative  segment 
witnessed spectacular growth post its introduction 
in  2000.  Not  only  growth,  there  has  also  been  a 
product shift in favour of more complex products 
like options since 2009. 

Among the three exchanges in the derivative 
market ecosystem viz, NSE, BSE and MSEI, NSE is 
the  dominant  market  leader  in  equity  derivatives 
products. As per the annual data for 2016 published 
by  World  Federation  of  Stock  Exchanges  (WFE), 
NSE is placed at first position in the world in index 
options  and  is  placed  at  second  position  in  stock 
futures,  when  ranked  in  terms  of  the  number  of 
contracts  traded  and/or  cleared.  In  index  options, 
three exchanges accounted for 67 per cent of the total 
volume traded in the world, with NSE and Korea 
Exchange from the Asia-Pacific region making up 
50 per cent of the total volume traded. NIFTY was 
the top index option contract traded in the world 
in 2016. NSE’s equity derivatives turnover to GDP 
ratio for 2016-17 stood at 621.5 and this is testimony 
of  the  volume  and  liquidity  of  the  segment.  The 
aggregate  all-India  turnover  in  2016-17  in  the 
derivatives segment was approximately 15.6 times 
the turnover in the cash market, and was 36.2 per 

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

cent  higher  than  the  total  futures  and  options’ 
(F&O)  turnover  recorded  in  2015-16  (Figure  2.14). 
NSE had a majority share in trading volumes at 99.9 
per cent in 2016-17, while BSE contributed only 0.1 
per cent. BSE’s share has waned gradually over the 
years from 26.8 per cent in 2014-15 to 6.5 per cent in 
2015-16 and further to 0.1 per cent in 2016-17. 

Figure 2.14: Derivatives’ turnover vis-à-vis cash 

market turnover

While  the  number  of  contracts  traded  on 
NSE  in  equity  derivatives  decreased  by  33.3  per 
cent,  the  value  of  the  contracts  traded  increased 
by  45.6  per  cent.  The  contracts  traded  in  NSE’s 
equity derivatives segment declined to 139.97 crore 
in  2016-17  from  209.8  crore  in  2015-16  whereas 
the  turnover  increased  from  `  6,48,25,834  crore 
in  2015-16  to  `  9,43,70,301  crore  in  2016-17.  On 
the  other  hand,  BSE  recorded  dwindling  volumes 
in  its  equity  derivatives  segment.  While,  the 
number of contracts declined to a mere 1,23,538 in  
2016-17  from  10.6  crore  traded  in  2015-16,  the 
turnover  declined  steeply  by  99.8  per  cent  to  
`  6,939  crore  in  2016-17  from  `  44,75,008  crore  in 
2015-16. As in 2015-16, MSEI recorded nil trading in 
its equity derivatives segment in 2016-17. 

Open  interest  in  NSE’s  derivatives  segment 
increased  by  13.9  per  cent  from  `  1,54,411  crore 
at the end of 2015-16 to ` 2,49,497 crore at the end 
of  2016-17  whereas  at  BSE,  the  open  interest  was  
` 8 crore at the end of 2016-17 as against ` 3 crore in 
2015-16 (Table 2.24).

In  2016-17,  monthly  trends 

in  turnover 
indicate  a  steady  increase  at  NSE.  The  highest 
turnover was recorded in March 2017 (` 99,71,152 
crore), followed by February 2017 (` 93,48,339 crore) 
and November 2016 (` 92,64,480 crore). The number 
of  contracts  traded  was  the  highest  in  November 
2016  (13.56  crore)  followed  by  March  2016  (13.03 
crore) and February (12.65 crore). Trading in BSE’s 
derivatives segment fluctuated throughout the year 
with  the  highest  turnover  in  April  2016  (`  4,460 
crore)  followed  by  that  in  August  2016  (`  1,224 
crore)  and  in  September  2016  (`  473  crore).  The 
average daily turnover at NSE in 2016-17 increased 
by 44.9 per cent to ` 3,80,525 crore from ` 2,62,453 
crore in 2015-16, while at BSE it declined by 99.8 per 
cent to ` 27.9 crore from ` 18,117 crore. 

Across  the  world  in  calendar  year  2016, 
options  accounted  for  38  per  cent  of  the  total 
volumes  traded  while  futures  had  a  62  per  cent 
share. This shows a significant change from 2015, 
when  options  accounted  for  42  per  cent  of  the 
global  volumes  traded.  Overall,  options  volumes 
fell  by  8  per  cent,  while  the  number  of  futures 
contracts  traded  increased  by  10  per  cent  in  2016 
as compared to 2015. Over the years, index options 
have emerged as the most traded instrument in the 
Indian derivatives market. In 2016-17, index options 
accounted for a major share at NSE and BSE (77.1 and 
64.4 per cent respectively) (Table 2.25). However, at 
BSE, 99 per cent of the index options’ turnover was 
registered in April 2016, after which it petered out. 

At NSE, single stock futures held an 11.8 per cent 
share in turnover followed by stock options (6.5 per 
cent) and index futures (4.6 per cent). Compared to 
this, in 2015-16, index futures had a larger share of 
7.0 per cent and stock options accounted for 5.4 per 
cent. In brief, option products’ share in the turnover 
at NSE vis-a-vis futures increased in 2016-17.

Trends in the Currency Derivatives Market

 

Currency  derivatives  are 

important 
for  firms  and  other  participants  to  hedge  their 
exposures  to  exchange  rate  volatility,  which  may 
increase temporarily as monetary policy focuses on 
stabilizing  prices.  Manufacturers  in  traded  goods 

industries,  in  particular,  need  to  be  able  to  hedge 
against  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  in  order  to 
maintain their competitiveness and margins. With 
the  objective  of  providing  such  an  instrument, 
trading  in  exchange  traded  currency  derivatives 
was launched in India in August, 2008. Presently in 
Indian markets, currency derivatives are traded on 
BSE, NSE, and MSEI. 

In  2016-17  the  aggregate  turnover  in  the 
currency  derivatives  segment  at  the  exchanges 
increased by 4.3 per cent to ` 69,62,833 crore from 
`  66,76,821  crore  in  2015-16.  During  2016-17,  the 
total turnover was the highest at NSE (` 48,57,076 
crore), followed by BSE (` 18,07,829 crore) and MSEI 
(` 2,97,928 crore). NSE accounted for 69.8 per cent of 
the total turnover in the currency segment followed 
by BSE (26.0 per cent) and MSEI (4.3 per cent) (Table 
2.32). Globally, currency derivatives’ volumes have 
increased  significantly  since  2005,  with  a  10.4  per 
cent  increase  in  volumes  traded  in  2016  over  the 
previous  calendar  year.  The  volumes  were  up  for 
both  options  and  futures  with  an  increase  of  39.3 
and  4.0  per  cent  respectively  in  2016.  As  per  the 
WFE’s 2016 report, NSE was the second exchange 
in  the  world  in  currency  derivatives  in  terms  of 
the number of contracts traded in both futures and 
options segments. Moreover, as per the report, the 
increase in volume traded in Asia-Pacific region in 
2016 was mainly driven by increase in volumes at 
BSE (23 per cent) and NSE (22 per cent).

C.  Trends in Interest Rates Derivatives

In an economy like India with an expanding 
financial sector, interest rate is a key variable that 
affects  firms  and  individuals  across  the  board.  In 
India, these products were first introduced in 2003 
which  were  cash  settled  and  based  on  the  zero 
coupon  yield  curve.  However,  after  some  initial 
interest, market liquidity waned. In 2008, physically 
settled  futures  contracts  were 
introduced  on  
10-year  government  bonds. As  these  also  did  not 
pick up as expected, cash settled single bond futures 

contracts  were  introduced  in  January  2014  and 
they have been trading since then with reasonable 
liquidity. The trends observed in turnover and open 
interest in the interest rate derivatives at NSE, BSE 
and MSEI are given in Table 2.34. 

During  2016-17,  the  aggregate  turnover  in 
the  interest  rate  derivatives  segment  across  all 
exchanges registered a decrease of nearly 33.9 per 
cent.  Though  NSE  contributed  a  major  share  to 
the turnover (70.2 per cent) vis-a-vis BSE (29.2 per 
cent) and MSEI (0.6 per cent), the turnovers at NSE

and MSEI witnessed heavy slides compared to the 
previous year. At NSE, the turnover declined by 41.5 
per cent to ` 3,07,809 crore in 2016-17 as compared 
to ` 5,26,425 crore in 2015-16. A substantial decline 
of  88.8  per  cent  was  recorded  in  the  turnover  at

MSEI from ` 22,814 crore in 2015-16 to ` 2,552 crore 
in 2016-17. However, at BSE the turnover increased

D.  Trends in the VIX Futures Segment

NSE launched trading in futures contracts on 
India VIX in the futures and options segment w.e.f. 
February  26,  2014.  India  VIX  is  a  volatility  index 
based  on  NIFTY’s  index  option  prices.  India  VIX 
is computed using the best bid and ask quotes of 
the out-of-the-money near and mid-month NIFTY 

options  contracts  which  are  traded  on  the  F&O 
segment  at  NSE.  India  VIX  indicates  investors’ 
perceptions  of  the  market’s  volatility  in  the  near 
term. However, the turnover in India VIX gradually 
waned to ` 0.09 crore in 2016-17 from ` 10 crore in 
2015-16 and ` 2,256 crore in 2014-15 (Table 2.35).

indicators,  price  stability  and 
macroeconomic 
unprecedented 
demonetization, 
Indian 
commodity  derivatives  segment  witnessed  mixed 
trends  during  2016-17.  While  the  metal  segment 
exhibited  gains  in  terms  of  volumes  and  value 
traded, that of energy, bullion and the agricultural 
commodity  derivatives  segment  declined  during 
the  year.  The  suspension  of  liquid  contracts  of 
chana’s futures and castor seed’s futures at NCDEX 
impacted  the  aggregate  volumes  traded  in  the 
agricultural (agri) segment.

The  underlying  markets  in  the  agricultural 
intermittent  price 
futures  segment  witnessed 
fluctuations

by 
mismatches during 2016-17. According to CSO, the 
growth in agriculture and allied sectors is estimated 
at  4.4  per  cent  in  2016-17  as  against  0.8  per  cent 
in  2015-16.  The  first  advance  estimates  for  the 
production  of  Kharif  crops  released  in  September 
2016,  showed  an  increase  in  food  grains,  pulses, 
oilseeds and cotton in 2016-17. It reported a decline 
in sugarcane production over the previous year. As 
per  the  second  advance  production  estimates  for 
2016-17  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, 
food  grain  production  is  expected  to  increase  by 
8.1  per  cent  during  2016-17  as  compared  to  2015-
16, pulse production is estimated to increase by 35.4 
per  cent,  followed  by  oilseeds  (33.0  per  cent).  On 
the other hand, sugarcane production is estimated 
to  decline  by  11.0  per  cent.  Rabi  crop  sowing  in 
2016-17 was also higher than in previous years.

 International Developments in Commodity 
Derivatives Market

In 2016-17, global commodity prices recovered 
from  the  sharp  declining  trend  witnessed  in  the 
last  two  years.  As  per  the  commodity  price  data 
released by the World Bank, the Index for Energy 
Prices  (based  on  nominal  US  dollars)  increased 
by  38.0  per  cent  in  2016-17,  whereas  the  Metal  & 
Minerals Index recorded a growth of 26.5 per cent. 
Global food prices increased by 5.0 per cent during 
2016-17  and  coal  prices  too  increased  during  the 
year  on  strong  demand  and  supply  tightness  in 
China  resulting  from  the  government’s  efforts  to 
reduce  coal  capacity.  The  oil  market  continued 
to  slowly  re-balance  amid  a  steady  and  broad-
based growth in demand. As per the World Bank’s 
assessment,  the  influence  of  lower  oil  prices  has 
diminished, particularly in advanced countries and 
global demand is now trending at close to its long-
term average. The World Bank projects the Energy 
Price Index to increase by 25.7 per cent in 2017 and 
8.2 per cent in 2018.

Greater  than  expected  government  related 
in  Asia  and  reluctance  by 
supply  restraints 
producers to activate idle capacity added to upside 
risks for metal prices. After declining 5.9 per cent 
in  2016,  metal  &  minerals’  prices  are  projected  to 
grow by 10.8 per cent in 2017, while food prices are 
forecast to increase by 1.6 per cent in 2017. 

The  monthly  movement  of  the  World  Bank 
commodity  indices  for  a  period  of  two  years  is 
given  in  Figure  2.17.  Indices  for  energy,  metal  & 
minerals and food have recorded an uptrend since 
February 2016.

commodity indices

Note: 

 The  World  Bank  Commodity  Price  Index  for  Energy  is 
composed of coal (4.7 per cent), crude oil (84.6 per cent) 
and natural gas (10.8 per cent). The Index for Food forms a 
sub-group of the Index for Non-Energy and is composed 
of  cereals  (28.2  per  cent),  vegetable  oils  and  meals  (40.8 
per  cent)  and  other  food  (31  per  cent).  The  Index  for 
Metals is also a sub-group of the Non-Energy Index and 
is composed of metals excluding precious metals.

III.  Permitted Commodities

During 2016-17, the total number of permitted 
the 
commodities  remained  unchanged  at  all 
commodity exchanges. As on March 31, 2017, NCDEX 
had the highest number of permitted commodities at 
25,  followed  by  MCX  (16)  and  NMCE  (13)  (Figure 
2.18).  While  trading  at  NCDEX  is  predominantly 
concentrated  on  agri  commodities,  NMCE  and 
regional exchanges trade only agri commodities.

facilitate 

companies 

In  the  financial  market  ecosystem,  asset 
management 
financial 
intermediation and portfolio diversification. Besides 
providing  financial  stability,  they  help  investors 
diversify their assets more easily and can provide 
financing to the real economy. The Indian mutual 
fund  industry  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  and 
most competitive segments of the financial sector. 
In  the  last  two  decades  the  mutual  fund  industry 
has shown impressive growth not just in the scale of 
assets under management (AUM) but also in terms 
of schemes and products. Buoyed by robust capital 
inflows and strong participation of retail investors, 
the  asset  base  of  the  mutual  fund  industry  again 
produced record breaking numbers in 2016-17. As 
of March 31, 2017, the total AUM of the sector stood 
at ` 17,54,619 crore. The AUM of the industry saw 
a lucrative year-on-year growth of 42.3 per cent in 
the  year  ending  March  2017.  However,  AUM  to 
GDP  (`  151.83  lakh  crore  at  current  prices)  ratio 
of 11.6 per cent indicates a large untapped market 
potential and very low penetration vis-a-vis global 
and  peer  benchmarks.  There  is  immense  scope 
for  unprecedented  growth  of  the  industry  with 
support  from  innovative  technological  initiatives 
and broadened investor participation over time.

Mutual  funds  witnessed  impressive  growth 
in  terms  of  net  resource  mobilization  and  assets 
at the end of the financial year 2016-17. The gross 
resources  mobilized  by  all  the  fund  houses  stood 
at  `  1,76,15,549  crore  in  2016-17  as  compared  to 
`  1,37,65,555  crore  in  the  previous  year,  showing 
a  tremendous  increase  of  28.0  per  cent  (Figure 
2.23).  Correspondingly,  redemption  increased  by 
26.7 per cent to ` 1,72,72,500 crore in 2016-17. The 
mutual fund industry saw net inflows to the tune of  
`  3,43,049  crore  in  2016-17,  demonstrating  an 
increase  of  almost  3  times  from  2015-16.  The  net 

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

annual inflows in income oriented funds in the year 
ending  March  31,  2017  stood  at  `  2,13,154  crore, 
which is 6.5 times more than the annual inflows in 
the year ending March 31, 2016.

Figure 2.23: Mobilization of resources by mutual 

funds (` crore)

The cumulative net assets of all mutual funds 
as on March 31, 2017 was ` 17,54,619 crore as against 
` 12,32,824 crore on March 31, 2016, representing an 
increase of 42.3 per cent. The income/debt oriented 
schemes  accounted  for  a  share  of  61.2  per  cent  of 
the assets under management, followed by growth/
equity  oriented  schemes  with  a  share  of  31.0  per 
cent. The average assets of the mutual fund industry 
at the end of 2016-17 were ` 18,57,806 crore.

Sector-wise Resource Mobilization

Private  sector  mutual  funds  continued  to 
retain their dominance in the mutual fund industry 
in 2016-17 as well, with a share of 80.8 per cent in 
gross resource mobilisation and 81.4 per cent in net 
resource mobilisation. The corresponding share of 
public sector funds including UTI was 19.1 per cent 
and  18.5  per  cent  respectively.  In  absolute  terms, 
gross  resource  mobilisation  by  the  private  sector 
mutual funds rose by 28.1 per cent to ` 1,42,47,937 
crore in 2016-17 (Table 2.40). While, the net resource 
mobilisation increased alarmingly by more than 200

per  cent  for  private  sector  mutual  funds  to  stood 
at ` 2,79,388 crore in 2016-17 compared to ` 91,394 
crore in 2015-16.

The share of public sector mutual funds in net 
resource  mobilisation  is  witnessing  an  increasing 
trend especially from the year 2014-15, when they 
contributed  just  0.8  per  cent.  In  2016-17,  public 

sector mutual funds contributed 18.6 per cent to the 
net  resource  mobilization,  including  UTI  mutual 
funds’  share  of  5.9  per  cent.  Similar  to  the  trends 
observed in the past, in 2016-17 as well, close-ended 
and interval schemes of private sector mutual funds 
recorded net outflows, while open-ended schemes 
witnessed net inflows.

Unit Holding Patterns

As  on  March  31,  2017,  96.9  per  cent  of  the 
total  folios  were  subscribed  by  the  individuals’ 
category  and  their  share  in  the  total  net  assets 
was  44.0  per  cent.  On  the  other  hand,  corporate/
institutions had a miniscule share of 1.4 per cent 
in the number of folios and a significant share of 
52.2  per  cent  in  total  net  assets. As  compared  to 
2015-16,  the  share  of  corporates  in  total  folios  as 

well as total net assets improved in 2016-17. NRIs/
overseas  corporate  bodies  (OCBs)  with  a  1.7  per 
cent share in folios had a 3.3 per cent share in total 
net assets (Figure 2.24).

Figure 2.24: Unit holding patterns of all mutual 

funds (percentage to total AUM and folios)

Table 2.43 provides data on private and public 
sector sponsored mutual funds wherein it is evident 
that  the  private  sector  mutual  funds  dominated 
with  a  higher  number  of  folios  and  greater  net 
assets. While private sector mutual funds had a 68.1 
per cent share in total folios of around 5.4 crore, the 
corresponding share of public sector mutual funds 
(including the UTI mutual fund) was 31.9 per cent 
as at the end of March 2017. In total net assets worth 
` 17.5 lakh crore as on March 31, 2017, the share of 
private sector mutual funds stood at 82.7 per cent as 
compared to 17.3 per cent for public sector mutual 
funds, including the UTI mutual fund.

INTERMEDIARIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIES MARKET

I. 

Portfolio Managers

92.0 per cent of the total number of clients.

According  to  the  Asia-Pacific  Wealth  Report 
2016, the Asia-Pacific region is recognized as having 
the  highest  net  worth  individuals  (HNIs)  and  as 
being  the  region  with  the  highest  HNI  wealth. As 
per  the  report,  India  is  home  to  the  fourth  largest 
population of HNIs in the Asia-Pacific region. This 
is  evident  in  the  expanding  clientele  base  of  the 
portfolio  management  industry.  The  total  number 
of clients increased to 77,150 in 2016-17 from 52,288 
in  2015-16.  In  2016-17  while  the  number  of  clients 
taking discretionary and non-discretionary services 
increased, 
for  advisory  services 
decreased. The dominant group in the client base is of 
those taking discretionary services; they constituted 

those  opting 

Table 2.44: Assets managed by portfolio managers

Meanwhile,  in  2016-17  the  assets  of  the 
portfolio  management  industry  increased  by  17.7 
per cent to  `12,30,482 crore from `10,45,428 crore. 
The discretionary services offered to the Employees 
Provident  Fund  Organization  (EPFO)/provident 
fund  (PF)  constituted  69.6  per  cent  of  the  total 
assets under the management of portfolio managers 
followed  by  advisory  services  which  constituted 
15.3 per cent. The AUM of discretionary portfolio 
managers, managing non-EPFO/PF funds observed 
an increase of 45.8 per cent in 2016-17 from ` 76,141 
crore  in  the  previous  financial  year  (Table  2.44). 
Portfolio managers’ AUM/GDP ratio was recorded 
at 8.1 per cent in 2016-17.

II.  Alternative Investment Funds

AIFs are defined in Regulation 2(1)(b) of the 
SEBI(Alternative  Investment  Funds)  Regulations, 
2012. They refer to any privately pooled investment 
fund, (whether from Indian or foreign sources), in 
the form of a trust or a company or a body corporate 
or a limited liability partnership (LLP). In India, AIFs 
are private funds which are otherwise not coming 
under  the  jurisdiction  of  any  regulatory  agency. 
The  various  categories  of  funds  in  AIFs,  provide 
stable and long-term capital with a wide range of 
investment  objectives  and  investment  strategies. 

This is not only a valuable service for both savers 
and  portfolio  companies,  but  also  for  the  Indian 
economy  as  it  creates  jobs,  improves  governance 
and promotes innovation and economic growth. For 
AIFs to perform this invaluable role, the regulatory 
framework  must  be  an  enabler  and  foster  ease  of 
doing  business.  In  view  of  this,  SEBI  has  always 
ensured reforms in this private fund industry so as 
to pave the way for AIFs much greater contribution 
to India’s development, economic growth and start-
up policies.

6.  FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT

The  net  investments  made  by  FPIs  in  the 
Indian  securities  market  have  been  positive  ever 
since they were allowed to participate in the Indian 
securities  market,  except  for  three  years,  1998-
99,  2008-09  and  2015-16.  This  reflects  the  strong 
economic  fundamentals  of  the  country  as  well  as 
the  confidence  that  foreign  investors  have  in  the 
growth potential and stability of the Indian market. 
As per UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2016, 
India  continues  to  be  among  the  top-10  countries 
in terms of FDI inflows globally and the fourth in 
developing Asia.  India  also  jumped  16  notches  to 
reach 39 among 144 countries in the World Economic 
Forum’s  Global  Competitiveness  Index  2016.  This 
index  ranks  countries  on  the  basis  of  parameters 
such as institutions, macroeconomic environment, 
education,  market  size  and  infrastructure.  IMF  in 
its  April  2017  World  Economic  Outlook  observed 
that  the  Indian  economy  has  grown  at  a  strong 
pace in recent years owing to the implementation 
of  critical  structural  reforms,  favourable  terms 
of 
lower  external  vulnerabilities. 
Nevertheless  till  January  2017,  foreign  portfolio 
investment flows into India were weighed heavily 
by global factors Brexit, the US presidential election, 
policy  normalization  by  the  US  Federal  Reserve, 
slowdown in the Chinese economy and weakness 
in global trade growth as well as by a few domestic 
factors  like  demonetization.  However,  this  trend 
was  reversed  towards  the  end  of  the  year  with 
positive net investments despite an increase in the 
benchmark interest rate by the US Federal Reserve.

trade  and 

The  diversity  of  FPIs  has  been  increasing 
steadily  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of  FPIs 
registered  FPIs  in  India.  On  the  basis  of  their 
sources of incorporation, as on March 31, 2017, FPIs 
registered in India were from 57 different countries. 

There were 18 registered custodians of securities as 
well  as  18  SEBI  approved  designated  depository 
participants  (DDPs)  as  on  March  31,  2017.  Based 
on  the  country  of  incorporation,  the  number  of 
FPIs registered was the highest from USA (3,024), 
followed by Luxembourg (1,007), Canada (677) and 
Mauritius  (608)  (Figure  2.25).  In  terms  of AUC  as 
well,  FPIs  from  the  USA  had  the  maximum AUC 
(` 8,57,945 crore), followed by Mauritius (` 5,11,293 
crore), Singapore (` 2,74,472 crore) and Luxembourg 
(` 2,38,642 crore).

and number of registered FPIs

FPI 

investments 

into  India  have  grown 
remarkably  in  recent  years.  During  2016-17,  net 
investments  by  FPIs  stood  at  `  48,411  crore  as 
compared  to  negative  net  investments  of  `  18,175 
crore  during  2015-16  (Figure  2.26).  In  USD  terms, 
net  investments  during  2016-17  were  USD  7,177 
million  compared  to  negative  net  investments  of 
USD  2,523  million  during  the  previous  year.  The 
gross purchases made by FPIs increased by 13.8 per 
cent to ` 15,07,028 crore in 2016-17 from ` 13,24,418 
crore during the previous year. On the other hand, 
gross  sales  by  FPIs  increased  by  8.6  per  cent  to  
` 14,58,617 crore from ` 13,42,593 crore during the 
same period last year.

Figure 2.26: Trends in investments by FPIs 

(` crore)

An  analysis  of  FPI  net  investments  reveals 
that  a  major  part  is  invested  in  equity.  This  has 
been  the  trend  over  the  years  except  in  2011-12. 
Further, From Figure 2.27, it can be seen that FPI net 
investments  were  positive  in  equity,  however,  the 
net investments in the debt segment were negative 
in 2016-17. Net investments in the equity segment 
increased  to  `  55,703  crore  as  compared  to  an 
outflow of ` 14,172 crore during the previous year. 
On the other hand, for the second consecutive year, 
FPIs were net sellers in the debt segment to the tune 
` 7,292 crore in 2016-17 as compared to ` 4,004 crore 
during the previous year. 

During 2016-17, the combined net investments 
in  the  equity  and  debt  segments  were  highest  in 
March 2017 (` 56,261 crore), followed by September 
2016 (` 20,233 crore) and July 2016 (` 19,457 crore). 
During  March  2017,  both  the  equity  and  debt 
segments  recorded  their  highest  investments  of  
` 30,906 crore and ` 25,355 crore respectively.

(` crore)

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

During October 2016 to January 2017, FPI net 
investments in both the equity and debt segments 
were  negative.  Combined  net  sales  in  both  the 
equity  and  debt  segments  were  the  highest  in 
November 2016 (` 39,396 crore). Coincidentally, the 
demonetization  of  currency  notes  of  `  1,000  and 
` 500 denomination was announced on November 
08, 2016. This outflow trend, however, got reversed 
in a positive direction from February 2017.

 OTHER  ACTIVITIES  HAVING  A  BEARING  ON  THE  WORKING  OF  THE 
SECURITIES MARKET

I. 

The Corporate Bond Market

Deep  and  liquid  markets  for  long-term  debt 
securities can provide alternative financing options 
for  growth,  leading  to  greater  diversification  of 
the  sources  of  funding  beyond  bank  financing  or 
equity  offerings.  Though  India’s  corporate  bond 
market  has  expanded  rapidly  in  recent  years,  it 
remains as a limited source of funding, with firms 
relying  predominantly  on  bank  credit.  There  are 
various  structural  impediments  in  the  corporate 
bond  markets,  including  dominance  of  issuances 
by  financial  sector  entities,  prevalence  of  private 
placements,  very  limited  market  liquidity,  and 
restrictions  on  institutional-investor  allocations  to 
non-investment-grade bonds. In view of its looming 
infrastructural  finance  requirements,  a  flourishing 
corporate bond market is necessary for India. So far, 
the corporate funding is largely met by bank credit, 
which  might  languish  given  the  NPAs  and  asset 
quality problems in the banking sector and stringent 
capital  requirements  on  the  implementation  of 
Basel  III  norms.  In  the  recent  years,  significant 

Table 2.50: Secondary market: Corporate bond trades

policy attention has been directed towards reviving 
and  nurturing  the  growth  of  the  corporate  bond 
markets in India. In order to support the corporate 
debt market, comprehensive reform measures were 
proposed by the Working Group on Development of 
the Corporate Bond Market in India in August 2016 
and this is being discussed with RBI. 

In  continuation  of  the  trend  observed  in  the 
past,  in  2016-17  also  private  placements  of  debt 
issues  outscored  that  of  public  issues’  private 
placements  and  it  continued  to  be  the  preferred 
route  among  issuers  for  its  obvious  advantages 
like  operational  ease,  minimal  disclosures  and 
lower  costs.  Reporting  platforms  for  corporate 
bonds have been set up and are maintained by BSE, 
NSE  and  MSEI  to  capture  information  related  to 
trading  in  corporate  bonds.  While  the  secondary 
market  trading  of  corporate  bonds  issued  under 
a public issue takes place on the exchanges along 
with equities, trading of privately placed corporate 
bonds in the secondary market happens in the over 
the counter (OTC) category.

 REGULATION  OF  BUSINESS  IN  STOCK  EXCHANGES  AND  CLEARING 
CORPORATIONS

SEBI  under  Section  4  of  the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation) Act (SCRA), 1956. As on March 31, 2017 
there were seven stock exchanges in India, of which 
four  had  permanent  recognition,  the  Metropolitan 
Stock  Exchange  of  India  Ltd.  was  granted  renewal 
of  recognition  while  the  Magadh  Stock  Exchange 
was  de-recognized  and  is  in  the  process  of  exit. 
During  the  year  SEBI  granted  recognition  to  the 
India International Exchange (IFSC) Limited (India 
INX)  for  one  year,  commencing  on  the  29th  day 
of  December,  2016  and  ending  on  the  28th  day  of 
December, 2017.

 
Out  of  the  four  permanent  exchanges,  the 
Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and the Calcutta Stock 
Exchange  are  in  the  process  of  exit.  Pursuant  to 
the  exit  policy  for  de-recognized/non-operational 
stock  exchanges  notified  by  SEBI  in  2012,  18  stock 
exchanges  have  exited  so  far.  Of  these,  12  exited 
during  2012-13,  2013-14  and  2014-15,  five  more 
stock exchanges exited during 2015-16 and one stock 
exchange exited in 2016-17.

A stock exchange is a platform for facilitating 

price  discovery  of  various  instruments 
available  for  trading.  Stock  exchanges 
play an important role in the efficient allocation of 
resources in any economy as the prices discovered 
provide a signal for efficient allocation of financial 
resources across corporations. Apart from providing 
platforms for trading, stock exchanges have also been 
entrusted  with  various  regulatory  responsibilities 
for  ensuring  market  integrity  and  for  protecting 
investor  interests.  The  stock  exchanges’  regulatory 
functions 
issuer  regulations,  member 
regulations, trading regulations, investor protection,

Subsequent to this, SEBI received applications from 
de-recognized/non-operational 
exchanges 

stock 

seeking voluntary exit as stock exchanges. In order 
to facilitate the exit process for such exchanges, SEBI 
has been taking several policy initiatives. Pursuant 
to these measures, 18 de-recognized/non-operational 
stock exchanges had exited as on March 31, 2017.

Three exchanges have either applied for exit or have 
been identified for compulsory exit and their process 
of exit is underway (Table 3.5)

initiated  awareness  programmes 

 
in 
coordination with stock exchanges to interact with 
SMEs  from  different  clusters  to  familiarize  them 
with the various products that are being offered by 
the stock exchanges for the benefits of SMEs. During 
financial  year  2016-17  SME  meets  were  held  in 
Gurgaon, Bhopal, Nagpur and Shimla.

 
Technical  sessions  were  held  during  these 
programmes  in  which  stock  exchanges  interacted 
with  SMEs  in  small  groups,  apprised  them  about 
the regulatory parameters for SMEs and addressed 
their  queries  and  apprehensions.  The  technical 
sessions were followed by the main event wherein 

SEBI’s senior management and the stock exchanges 
addressed SME representatives.

 MEASURES ADOPTED FOR REGULATION 
OF STOCK EXCHANGES

 EXCLUSIVELY  LISTED  COMPANIES  OF 
DE-RECOGNIZED / NON-OPERATIONAL / 
EXITED STOCK EXCHANGES PLACED ON 
THE DISSEMINATION BOARD

Considering 

 
the  concerns  expressed  by 
exclusively  listed  companies  (ELCs)  and  in  the 
interest  of  the  market,  SEBI  had  earlier  allowed  a 
time line of 18 months within which such companies 
had  to  obtain  listing  upon  compliance  with  the 
Listing  Requirements  of  the  nation-wide  stock 
exchanges. Until such a listing, these companies had 

102

SEBI Annual Report

PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

to  continue  to  remain  on  the  Dissemination  Board 
(DB).  Promoters  and  directors  of  such  companies, 
who  had  failed  to  provide  the  trading  platform  or 
exit  to  its  shareholders  even  after  the  extended 
time of 18 months had to undergo stricter scrutiny 
for  their  any  future  association  with  the  securities 
market.

Further,  to  protect  shareholder  interests  of  ELCs, 
SEBI  laid  down  the  framework  which  provided 
options  to  raise  capital  for  meeting  the  capital 
requirements  for  getting  listed  on  the  nation-wide 
exchanges. The exclusively listed companies which 
fail to list on the nation-wide stock exchanges will 
provide exit to its investors.

The  policy  also  stipulates  action  against 
the 
promoters or directors whose companies remain on 
the DB and who have failed to demonstrate adequacy 
of efforts for providing exit to their shareholders in 
conformity with the exit mechanism as provided in 
this circular.

B. 

 PROCEDURES  FOR  AN  EXCHANGE 
LISTING CONTROL MECHANISM

Regulation  45  of 

the  SECC  Regulations 
 
provides  for  listing  of  stock  exchanges  on  any 
recognized stock exchange, other than itself and its 
associated stock exchange.

 
In order to address any conflict arising out of 
provisions  regarding  listing  of  stock  exchanges  on 
any  other  recognized  stock  exchange,  other  than 
itself and to ensure compliance with applicable laws, 
SEBI prescribed that:

a. 

 The  Listing  Department  of  the  listing  stock 
exchange (that is, a stock exchange on which 

the  listing  is  done)  will  be  responsible  for 
monitoring the compliance of the listed stock 
exchange  (that  is,  a  stock  exchange  which  is 
getting listed) as in the case of listed companies.

 The Independent Oversight Committee of the 
listing  stock  exchange  will  exercise  oversight 
at  the  second  level  to  deal  with  conflicts,  if 
any.  The  listed  stock  exchange  may  appeal 
to  the  Independent  Oversight  Committee  of 
the  listing  stock  exchange,  if  aggrieved,  with 
the decision on disclosure of the listing stock 
exchange as referred under para (a) above.

 An 
Resolution 
Committee  (CRC)  constituted  by  SEBI,  with 
the  objective  of  independent  oversight  and

 EXIT OF NON-FUNCTIONAL COMMODITY 
DERIVATIVES EXCHANGES

 
SEBI  vide  circular  dated  January  11,  2016, 
prescribed  the  minimum  criteria  (for  example,  for 
national  level  exchanges  minimum  turnover  of  
` 1,000 crore per annum and for regional exchanges 
minimum  5  per  cent  of  nation-wide  turnover  of 
the  commodity,  principally  traded  at  the  regional 
exchange)  and  also  specified  various  terms  and 
conditions that exchanges have to comply with failing 
which they need to surrender their recognition either 
voluntarily or due to the withdrawal of recognition 
proposed by SEBI.

 
As there had been no trading on the platform of 
the Bombay Commodity Exchange Limited (BCEL) 
since December 13, 2013, the exchange conveyed its 
decision to voluntarily surrender its recognition as a 
deemed recognized stock exchange. In terms of the 
provisions of the aforesaid circular, SEBI, vide order 
dated October 28, 2016, allowed the exit of the BCEL 
as a recognized stock exchange.
 
As  there  was  no  trading  from  2006-07,  the 
Cotton  Association  of  India  (CAI)  conveyed  its 
decision  to  formally  exit  as  a  deemed  recognized 
stock  exchange.  SEBI,  vide  order  dated  December

  REGISTRATION AND REGULATION OF WORKING OF INTERMEDIARIES 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIES MARKET

Regulation of market intermediaries has three 

 
objectives:

(i) 

 To protect client assets from insolvency of the 
intermediaries  and  guarding  against  defaults 
as well as sudden disruption in the market;

(ii) 

 To ensure that the intermediaries are fair and 
diligent in dealing with their clients; and

intermediaries.  Under  these  acts,  the  government 
and SEBI issue notifications, guidelines and circulars 
that  market  intermediaries  need  to  comply  with. 
SEBI  ensures  standard  and  quality  of  services  to 
clients  and  investors,  fair  and  sound  conduct  and 
compliance practices.

I. 

 REGISTRATION OF STOCK BROKERS

(iii) 

 To reduce conflict of interest.

A.  CASH SEGMENT

 
The  regulation  sets  qualifying  standards, 
prudential  standards,  internal  controls  and  risk 
management  standards  and  enforces  a  code  of 
conduct.  In  order  to  enhance  investor  confidence, 
it  is  necessary  that  all  the  intermediaries  maintain 
high standards of integrity and fairness and also act 
with due skill, care and diligence in conducting their 
business with high levels of compliance. The various 
intermediaries’  regulations  have  been 
framed 
under the SEBI Act, 1992 and the Depositories Act, 
1996  for  registration  and  regulation  of  all  market

Box: 3.1 Framework for Registration of Fund Managers for Overseas funds under  

SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993

 
In  the  Union  Budget  2015-16,  the  Finance  Minister  announced  amendments  to  the  Income  Tax 
Act, 1961. Section 9A was inserted to the Act to provide a ‘safe harbour’ to overseas funds availing fund 
management services from India-based managers, provided the fund and the manager complied with the 
requirements specified in the section. Such overseas funds and fund managers were designated as ‘Eligible 
Investment Funds’ and ‘Eligible Fund Managers’ respectively. These changes are aimed at developing and 
promoting the fund management industry in India.
One of the requirements for a fund manager to become an ‘Eligible Fund Manager’ is to be registered 
with  SEBI  under  specified  regulations.  In  pursuance  of  this,  SEBI,  vide  notification  dated  January  02, 
2017, notified amendments to the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 (PMS Regulations). These 
amendments provide a separate Chapter II-A for ‘Eligible Fund Managers’ and permit existing portfolio 
managers as well as new applicants, compliant with requirements specified under Section 9A of the Income 
Tax Act, 1961, to act as ‘Eligible Fund Managers.’
A new applicant desirous of providing fund management services to overseas funds and compliant with 
the requirements specified in Section 9A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, may seek registration with SEBI, as 
laid out in Chapter II-A. Existing portfolio managers desirous of providing fund management services to 
overseas funds, if compliant with the requirements specified in Section 9A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, may 
pursue this activity on intimation and submission of declarations to SEBI.
Further, Chapter II-A also defines the obligations and responsibilities of such fund managers. Recognizing 
the different business requirements of such fund managers, as compared to the existing portfolio managers, 
SEBI has also identified certain provisions in the PMS Regulations which will not be applicable to ‘Eligible 
Fund Managers.’ These pertain to their activities as fund manager to eligible investment funds. Some of the 
provisions are:
 a. 
 b.  Obligation to act in a fiduciary capacity;
 c.  Audit of overseas funds;
 d.  Entering into agreements between the portfolio manager and the overseas fund;
 e.  Reporting requirements with respect to overseas funds;
 f.  Minimum investment requirements (`25 lakh), etc.

 REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST 
MUTUAL FUNDS

 
During  2016-17,  37  warning  letters  and  35 
deficiency  letters  were  issued  to  mutual  funds  on 
account  of  non-compliance  with  SEBI  Regulations 
/  guidelines  observed  in  compliance  test  reports, 
inspection  reports,  etc.  Adjudication  proceedings 
were initiated against three mutual funds during the 
year.

V.  DEEMED PUBLIC ISSUES

 
In  the  last  few  years,  there  has  been  illegal 
mobilization  of  funds  by  companies  through  issue 
of  securities  including  non-convertible  debentures/ 
non-convertible  preference  shares  in  the  garb  of 
private  placements  without  complying  with  the 
provisions of the Companies Act and various SEBI 
Regulations.

 
In order to curb the menace of illegal collection 
of money through these means, SEBI passed an order 
against  the  entities  for  issuance  of  non-convertible 

debentures  /  non-convertible  preference  shares  to 
more than 49 persons for non-compliance of various 
provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 read with the 
Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI (Issue and Listing of 
Debt Securities), Regulations, 2008, SEBI (Issue and 
Listing  of  Non-Convertible  Redeemable  Preference 
Shares), Regulations, 2013.

 
In interim directions, SEBI directed the entities 
and  their  directors  to  stop  mobilizing  funds  from 
the public in contravention of various laws and also 
directed them not to divert or dispose of any asset or 
money collected etc. Further, in its final orders SEBI 
directed the entities to refund the money collected 
from the public and also prohibited the companies 
and their directors from accessing the capital market 
for a specified period of time.

 
In  financial  year  2016-17,  SEBI  passed  orders 
against  57  such  companies.  Out  of  which  interim 
orders  were  passed  against  11  companies  which 
mobilized  ` 8.39 crore (the summary of the orders 
passed in the last four years is given in Table 3.23)

  FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES

To  protect  investor  interests  and  to  promote 
 
a  fair  and  orderly  securities  market,  SEBI  ensures 
the  integrity  of  the  markets  by  detecting  market 
frauds  on  a  proactive  basis,  investigating  abusive, 
manipulative  or  illegal  trading  practices  in  the 
securities market and taking punitive steps to punish 
the manipulators.

 TYPES OF FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR 
TRADE PRACTICES

 With relation to an IPO, an issuer company in 
collusion with a merchant banker siphoned off 
IPO proceeds. Further, the issuer, contradicting 
its  statements/  disclosures  in  the  prospectus, 
used  IPO  proceeds  to  fund  net  buyers  who 
supported the demand (buy). The issuer also 
made  mis-statements  and  non-disclosures  in 
its prospectus. IPO proceeds was not utilized 
as  per  the  issue  objects  disclosed  in  the 
prospectus. In addition, the merchant banker 
provided a wrong due-diligence certificate to 
SEBI.

 An  issuer  company  did  not  utilize  a  major 
part  of  the  IPO  proceeds  for  the  purpose 
of  the  objects  stated  in  the  prospectus  and 
diverted  the  IPO  proceeds  to  various  entities 
through  group  companies  and  other  entities. 
The statutory auditor of the company issued a 
utilization certificate which was also included 
in its annual report. It was observed that the 
statutory auditor had falsely certified that the 
issuer had utilized the entire proceeds of the 
issue  towards  the  objects  of  the  issue  stated 
in  the  prospectus.  This  was  misleading  and 
contained information in a distorted manner.

c. 

 A  group  of  connected  entities  bought  a 
majority of the shares at a price higher than the

last traded price of the scrip. The buy orders 
placed by these entities, although placed after 
the  sell  orders,  were  repeatedly  at  a  price 
higher than the available sell order price and 
for quantity lower than the available sell order 
quantity. Thus, the orders placed by the group 
of connected entities exhibited a manipulative 
intent,  many  of  which  also  resulted  in  an 
increase in the scrip price.

 A 
containing  false  news  pertaining  to  a  listed 
company  on  behalf  of  its  alleged  client.  The 
telemarketer did not do due diligence in KYC 
verification of its alleged client while admitting 
the  request  and  accepted  cash  for  rendering 
services.  Hence,  the  telemarketer  facilitated 
circulation of false news, thereby engaging in 
deceitful activity.

 Several Indian companies that claimed to have 
successfully issued global depository receipts 
(GDRs)  had  issued  them  in  a  fraudulent 
manner. Investors who subscribed to the GDRs 
did  so  by  availing  loans  from  foreign  banks 
and  these  loans  were  secured  against  GDR 
proceeds to be received by issuer companies. 
Thereafter,  only  post  repayment  loans  were 
taken  by  the  GDR  subscribers  and  the  issuer 
companies  were  able  to  utilize  the  GDR 
proceeds  to  the  extent  of  loan  repayment. 
Thereby, the issuer companies did not have the 
GDR proceeds available unless the loans were 
repaid by subscribers.

 

	

 Thereafter, the issuer companies were broadly 
observed to have done the following:

•	

	Transferred funds to India in part or in 
full; and/ or

•	

	The GDR proceeds in part or in full were 
transferred  to  their  foreign  subsidiary 
purportedly  engaged  in  the  business 
of  general  trading.  In  a  majority  of  the 
cases,  no  real  inflow  of  funds  to  the 
company  was  observed  as  the  money 
was never brought back to India and was 
purportedly  utilized  for  the  purpose  of

GDRs. Therefore, GDR proceeds to such 
an extent were not realized by the issuer 
companies.

 Investigations  revealed  that  a  certain  set 
of  entities 
listed  company 
and  manipulated  the  price  of  the  scrip  by 
controlling the supply of shares, that is, entire 
free  float  shares  in  the  market.  Thereafter, 
these entities kept selling shares in minimum 
lots  and  increased  the  price  of  the  scrip. 
These  entities  also  defaulted  on  the  delivery 
of  the  shares  required  consequent  to  the 
sale  transactions  that  they  had  entered  into. 
Therefore,  these  entities  effectively  increased 
the  price  of  the  scrip  without  increasing  the 
free float in the market. Thereby, these entities 
continued to exercise control over the free float 
in the market and manipulate the price of the 
scrip

III.  FINANCIAL EDUCATION

 
With  a  developing  financial  market  in  India 
there  is  an  increased  need  for  financial  education 
among people who are not necessarily investors in 
the securities market. Hence, it is important to enable 
them,  depending  on  their  needs,  to  understand 
the role of money, the need and use of savings, the 
advantages of using the formal financial sector and 
various  options  of  converting  their  savings  into 
investments, the protection available to them and a 
realistic recognition of the attributes of these options.

A. 

 ACTIVITIES OF SEBI TRAINED RESOURCE

 NATIONAL  STRATEGY  FOR  FINANCIAL 
EDUCATION

 
A proposal for drafting a National Strategy for 
Financial Education along with the initial document 
was  presented  by  SEBI  at  the  first  meeting  of  the 
Technical  Group  of  the  Sub-Committee  of  the 
Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) 
on  Financial  Inclusion  and  Literacy  on  November 
11, 2011. The document received wide appreciation 
from all regulators who were part of the Technical 
Committee  and  was  approved  by  the  FSDC.  The 
vision  of  the  strategy  is  – A  financially  aware  and 
empowered India.
 
As  envisaged  in  the  National  Strategy  for 
Financial  Education, 
for 
Financial  Education  (NCFE)  is  incubated  in  the 
National  Institute  of  Securities  Markets  (NISM). 
NCFE’s  activities  are  monitored  by  a  technical 
group for financial inclusion and literacy under the 
Financial Stability and Development Council. NCFE 
undertakes various activities for financial education, 
including:

the  National  Centre 

•	

	National Financial Literacy Assessment Test 
(NFLAT):  The  National  Financial  Literacy 
Assessment  Test  was  conducted  during 
2016-17  in  both  online  and  offline  mode.  A 
total  of  2,40,000  students  registered,  out  of 
which  approximately  1,81,000  students  have 
appeared  in  the  exam.  The  online  test  was 
conducted  using  NFLAT  software  procured 

•	

•	

•	

	National  Portal:  NCFE’s  website  ncfeindia.
org  is  available  in  8  vernacular  languages 
to  reach  a  larger  number  of  audience.  The 
website comprehensively covers all aspects of 
financial education, programs undertaken and 
proposed and acts like repository of financial 
education in the country.

	Training of teachers (money smart teachers): 
It  is  an  initiative  of  the  NCFE  to  provide 
unbiased  financial  education  in  schools  for 
improving financial literacy, an important life-
skill for holistic development of each student. 
Upon  successful  implementation,  the  schools 
are  certified  as  a  “Monet  Smart  School”  and 
the students who participated are given merit 
and participation certificates. So far around 300 
schools have registered for this program and 
have started implementing financial education 
in  their  school  on  voluntarily  basis,  Out  of 
which 15 schools have already completed the 
curriculum.  Under  this  initiative,  more  than 
5000 students have been evaluated.

	Technology led Financial Literacy Campaign 
(Kiosks):  NCFE  is  installing  Kiosks  on  pilot 
basis  at  100  locations  in  the  country.  Out  of 
which,  30  will  be  Interactive  Kiosks  while 
70  would  be  Large  Format  Commercial 
Display.  The  Kiosks  and  displays  will  be 
managed  centrally.  RBI  has  already  shared 
the site details of 100 locations in 5 states i.e. 
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Odisha 
and Himachal Pradesh (20 locations per state).

IV. 

 INVESTOR GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL

 
SEBI  has  been  taking  various  measures  to 
expedite  the  redressal  of  investor  grievances.  The 
grievances  lodged  by  investors  are  taken  up  with 
the respective listed company or intermediary and 

124

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

monitored on a regular basis. Grievances pertaining 
to  stock  brokers  and  depository  participants  are 
taken  up  with  concerned  stock  exchanges  and 
depositories  for  redressal  and  monitored  by  the 
concerned  department  through  periodic  reports 
obtained from them. Grievances pertaining to other 
intermediaries  are  taken  up  with  them  directly 
for  redressal  and  monitored  regularly  by  SEBI’s 
concerned department.

 
The  company/intermediary  is  required  to 
respond in a prescribed format in the form of an action 
taken report (ATR). Upon the receipt of an ATR, the 
status of grievances is updated. If the response of the 
company/intermediary  is  insufficient  /  inadequate, 
follow-up action is initiated. SEBI takes appropriate 
enforcement  actions  (adjudication,  11B  directions, 
prosecution, etc.) as provided under the law where 
progress  in  redressal  of  investor  grievances  is  not 
satisfactory.

 
The  SEBI  Complaints  Redressal  System 
(SCORES)  has  helped  investors  in  obtaining  real 

time  information  on  the  status  of  their  grievances. 
Investors can log on to SCORES at any time and from 
anywhere and check the status of the grievance with 
the  help  of  a  user-name  and  password  provided 
at  the  time  of  lodging  a  grievance.  Alternatively, 
investors can also call the SEBI toll free helpline to 
check the status of their grievances.

 
Since SCORES has made it possible to receive 
grievances  online  this  helps  SEBI  take  up  issues 
very fast, including those that may require a policy 
change. Further, since companies are required to file 
an ATR within 30 days of receipt of a complaint, in 
case of any failure SEBI can initiate action against the 
company depending on the merit of the case.

A. 

SEBI’s COMPLAINTS REDRESS SYSTEM

 
The number of investor complaints received by 
SEBI on a cumulative basis increased from 29,63,454 
as  on  March  31,  2016  to  30,03,454  as  on  March  31, 
2017.  But,  during  the  same  period  the  number  of 
pending  actionable  complaints  reduced  from  5,452 
to 4,476 (Table 3.28).

Figure 3.1: Cumulative pending grievances on 

SCORES

Figure  3.1  indicates  that  the  number  of 
 
pending  grievances  has  been  steadily  declining 
over the years due to expeditious disposal by SEBI. 
Moreover,  out  of  the  4,476  pending  grievances  as 
on  March  31,  2017,  3,492  grievances  have  been 
pending  for  less  than  six  months.  Further,  only 
984  grievances  were  pending  for  more  than  six 
months as on March 31, 2017 as compared to 1,973 
grievances pending for more than six months as on 
March 31, 2016.

 
SCORES enables investors to lodge complaints 
directly online and such complaints are considered 
‘e-complaints.’ During the year, 22,304 e-complaints 
were received compared to 22,969 received during 
the  previous  financial  year.  While  investors  can 
lodge  e-complaints  on  SCORES,  any  physical 
complaint received against any of the entities in the 
SCORES database is also uploaded on SCORES and 
thereby  converted  into  an  e-complaint  and  action 
similar  to  that  with  regard  to  an  e-complaint  is 
taken.

The  SCORES  system  has  been  working 
 
satisfactorily  and  has  helped 
in  making  the 
complaint  handling  and  redress  mechanism  more 
efficient.

implemented 

A  review  module  was 

 
in 
SCORES  in  July  2016  wherein  an  investor  can 
make a one-time request for review of a complaint 
closed by a SEBI dealing officer within 15 days of 
the closure of a complaint. As on March 31, 2017, 
SEBI had received 2,347 complaints for review out 
of which 695 have since been closed.

B. 

SCORES SURVEY

 
During  2016-17,  SEBI  conducted  a  survey 
on  SCORES  through  an  independent  agency  to 
gauge  investor  satisfaction  with  the  system.  The 
survey  was  conducted  with  10,000  investors  who 
were  selected  randomly  across  the  four  cities  of 
Mumbai,  New  Delhi,  Ahmedabad  and  Kolkata. 
These  cities  were  chosen  based  on  the  maximum 
number  of  complaints  received.  The  survey 
broadly indicated that more than 75 per cent of the 
respondents  who  had  filed  complaints  with  SEBI 
expressed satisfaction with the grievance redressal 
mechanism.

C. 

 ISSUANCE OF NO OBJECTION 
CERTIFICATES

 
Companies  raising  capital  through  public 
issues  of  securities  are  required  to  deposit  1  per 
cent of the issue amount with the designated stock 
exchange.  This  deposit  is  released  by  the  stock 
exchange only.

SEBI 

issues  NOCs 

 
to  companies  after 
satisfactory  redressal  of  complaints  against  them 
as  received  by  SEBI.  During  2016-17,  NOCs  were 
issued  to  80  applicant  companies.  NOCs  to  43 
companies were not issued as the applications were 
incomplete  or  due  to  unsatisfactory  redressal  of 
investor grievances.

During  2016-17,  52  open  offers  with  offer

open offers with offer size of ` 11,766 crore during 
2015-16.  Out  of  the  52  open  offers,  43  with  offer 
size  of  ` 5,340  crore  were  made  with  the  objective 
of  change  in  management  control,  six  open  offers 
of size ` 219 crore were made with the objective of 
consolidating  holdings  and  three  open  offers  with 
offer size of ` 366crore were made with the objective 
of substantial acquisitions of shares (Table 3.31).

II.  BUY-BACK

 
Buy-back  is  one  of  the  ways  in  which  a 
company can return money to its shareholders. SEBI 
started regulating this activity with respect to listed 
entities from 1998 and accordingly framed the SEBI 
(Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 1998.

 
In 2016-17, 51 buy-back offers were received, 
of which 10 were through the open market purchase 
method  and  41  were  through  the  tender  offer 
compared  to  16  buy-back  applications  in  2015-16 
(five  through  the  open  market  purchase  method 
and 11 through tender offers). Out of the 10 offers 
for  buy-back  through  the  open  market  purchase 
method,  seven  offers  were  closed  and  three  offers 
are yet to close. Further, out of the 41 offers for buy-
back  through  tender  offers,  36  offers  were  closed 
and  five  offers  were  not  closed  during  2016-17. 
The  total  buy-back  offer  size  during  2016-17  was 
` 37,460  crore  compared  to  ` 1,834  crore  during 
2015-16  representing  an  increase  of  1,942.5  per 
cent.  It  is  also  observed  from  the  buy-back  offers 
which  were  opened  and  closed  during  2016-17 
that  the  average  utilization  was  98  per  cent  of  the 
total  offer  size  compared  to  97  per  cent  in  2015-16  
(Table 3.32).

III. 

 STREAMLINING  THE  PROCESS  OF 
ISSUANCE  OF  OBSERVATIONS  AND 
EXPEDITIOUS  CLEARANCE  OF  OFFER 
DOCUMENTS
 
As was the case in 2015-16, where the process 
of issuance of observations on draft offer documents 
filed by merchant bankers for raising funds by the 
companies or for takeover of other companies was 
streamlined, a similar process was followed this year 
also  resulting  in  a  further  reduction  of  time  in  the 
process of clearing offer documents. Media reports 
highlighted  the  expeditious  clearance  of  offer 
documents by SEBI.
 
SEBI  has  been  displaying  the  status  of 
processing  each  offer  document  on  its  website 
which is updated on a weekly basis, including the 
reasons  for  pendency  and  whether  the  pendency 
was at SEBI’s end or at the merchant banker or other 
regulatory  agency’s  end.  The  initial  observations 
seeking clarifications were sent to merchant bankers 

within 30 days. Even stricter timelines are followed 
for  final  observations.  With  a  view  to  ensuring  a 
higher  level  of  transparency  and  accountability 
within  SEBI,  the  SEBI  website  also  states  that  in 
case any application has remained unattended, the 
applicant  should  not  hesitate  to  approach  senior 
officials  -  Chief  General  Manager  or  the  Executive 
Director of the Corporation Finance Department -- 
whose e-mail IDs are also provided on the website.

 
The move to advise merchant bankers to make 
additional  disclosures  on  risks  associated  with  a 
specific pricing of the issue in pre-issue advertisements 
on price bands and their track record has received 
positive feedback from investors. These disclosures 
are  required  to  be  made  prominently  in  the  same 
font  size  as  the  price  band  in  the  advertisements 
and  also  on  the  websites  of  the  companies  as  well 
as the stock exchanges. SEBI’s endeavour to ensure 
quicker disposal of offer documents and enhanced 
disclosures to investors continued this year as well.

 INFORMATION CALLED FROM, INSPECTIONS UNDERTAKEN, INQUIRIES 
AND AUDITS OF STOCK EXCHANGES AND INTERMEDIARIES AND SELF- 
REGULATING ORGANIZATIONS CONDUCTED BY SEBI

 
Supervision of intermediaries through on-site 
and off-site inspections, inquiries and adjudications 
in  case  of  violation  of  rules  and  regulations  and 
administrative  and  statutory  actions  are  essential 
features  of  effective  enforcement  by  SEBI.  The 
basic objective of prudential supervision of market 
intermediaries  is  to  safeguard  the  stability  of  the 
financial  system;  protecting  client  interests  from 
undue  risks  of  losses  that  may  arise  from  failure, 
fraud  or  any  opportunist  behaviour  on  the  part 
of  the 
intermediaries;  promoting  the  efficient 
performance  of  intermediaries  and  markets;  and 
ensuring compliance by market intermediaries. SEBI 
conducts  inspections  directly  as  well  as  through 
organizations like stock exchanges and depositories. 
Inspections were also conducted during the year to 
verify intermediaries’ compliance levels.

With  the  objective  of  having  oversight  over 
the  activities  carried  out  by  market  infrastructure 
institutions (MIIs) such as stock exchanges, clearing 
corporations  and  depositories,  SEBI  conducts 
inspections,  periodic  compliance  analyses  and 
annual system audits of various MIIs.

During  2016-17,  comprehensive  inspections 
were  carried  out  at  BSE,  NSE  and  MSEI.  Further, 
inspections of the following commodity derivatives 
exchanges were completed: MCX, NCDEX, NMCE, 
HCX, IPSTA and RCX. In addition, visits to various 
warehouses  and  warehouse  service  providers 

(WSPs) were also undertaken to study the systems, 
processes  and  procedures  related 
to  delivery 
mechanisms. The oversight of an exchange conducted 
through inspections is undertaken to assess market 
operations, 
structure  and 
administrative  control  of  that  exchange.  Further,  it 
helps SEBI to ascertain as to whether:

D.  SYSTEM AUDIT OF MIIs

 
An annual system audit of MIIs such as stock 
exchanges,  CCs  and  depositories  was  conducted 
during  the  year  through  external  system  auditors. 
The  terms  of  reference  currently  include  BCP/  DR 
norms formulated post consultations with the SEBI 
Technical Advisory Committee.

 INSPECTION 
INTERMEDIARIES

OF 

MARKET 

 
The number of inspections conducted during 
2016-17  stood  at  333  as  compared  to  310  in  2015-
16.  Selection  of  intermediaries  for  carrying  out 
inspections  is  based  on  a  risk  assessment  of  each 
intermediary.

 
Based  on  the  findings  of  the  inspections 
after  considering  the  comments  of  intermediaries, 
intermediaries  were  specifically  advised  about 
the  areas  where  improvements  were  required. 
Intermediaries were also required to report to SEBI 
the corrective steps taken by them and also place them 
before their boards/partners/proprietors, as the case 
may be. These steps taken by SEBI have improved 
the  level  of  compliance  among  the  intermediaries. 
Administrative  and  quasi-judicial  actions  were 
initiated based on the deficiencies and seriousness of 
the violations committed by the intermediaries.

A. 

 INSPECTION OF STOCK BROKERS AND 
SUB-BROKERS

 
During  2016-17,  190  stock  brokers  and  sub-
brokers  were  inspected  as  against  176  in  2015-16. 
The focus of the inspections included themes such 
as  compliance  of  norms  regarding  anti-money 
laundering, 
redressal  mechanisms, 
handling clients’ funds and securities, settlement of 
accounts of clients on a timely basis, segregation of 

investor 

clients and proprietary funds/securities, KYC norms 
and clearing operations.

 
During  this  financial  year,  apart  from  specific 
purpose  inspections  and  single-theme  inspections, 
eight comprehensive inspections of stock brokers were 
conducted.  During  inspections,  the  compliance  of 
specific provisions of SEBI’s regulations/circulars was 
verified. The details of inspections of stock brokers and 
sub-brokers carried are given in Table 3.33.

Moreover,  the  stock  exchanges  carried  out 
inspections  as  per  the  policy  adopted  by  them  in 
consultation with SEBI. Additionally, stock brokers/
clearing  members  are  also  required  to  carry  out 
complete  internal  audits  on  a  half-yearly  basis  by 
independent auditors. Stock exchanges are levying 
penalties  for  delays  in  filing  the  internal  audit 
reports  by  stock  brokers.  The  system  of  internal 
audits  of  stock  brokers  by  outside  professionals 
and  inspections  by  stock  exchanges  and  by  SEBI 
has improved stock brokers’ compliance levels. The 
number of entities inspected by the stock exchanges 
in 2016-17 is given in Table 3.34.

INSPECTION OF MUTUAL FUNDS

SEBI has adopted a risk based inspection policy 
 
for the inspection of mutual funds. The inspections 
are undertaken on the basis of various factors such 
as assets under management (AUM) and the number 
of  complaints  received  against  a  mutual  fund. 
During 2016-17, 23 mutual funds were inspected and 
inspections of two registrars (executing mutual fund 
transactions) were initiated.

SEBI  conducted 

 
inspections  of  debenture 
trustees  based  on  the  number  of  public  issues 
handled  by  them  to  confirm  compliance  with 
applicable  regulatory  and  statutory  requirements 
with focus on their systems and controls with respect 
to  monitoring  of  payment  of  interest/redemption 
amounts,  processing  of  investor  grievances  and 
action taken in case of default by issuer companies.

During  2016-17,  inspections  were  completed 
 
for 59 depository participants, 12 merchant bankers, 
two debenture trustees, one CRA and 69 RTIs and 
STAs. In all SEBI conducted 143 inspections of these 
intermediaries  as  compared  to  134  inspections  in 
2015-. There was special focus on follow-up action 
after the inspections so that corrective steps are taken 
by the intermediaries (Table 3.35).

Money  laundering  is  globally  recognized 
as one of the largest threats posed to the financial

PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

system  of  a  country.  The  fight  against  terrorist 
financing  is  another  such  emerging  threat  with 
grave  consequences  for  both  the  political  and 
economic  standing  of  a 
jurisdiction.  Rapid 
developments  and  greater  integration  of  financial 
markets together with improvements in technology 
and  communication  channels  continue  to  pose 
serious challenges to the authorities and institutions 
dealing with AML/CFT.

 
The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering  Act, 
2002  (PMLA)  and  the  rules  framed  thereunder, 
which have been brought into force with effect from 
July 01, 2005, have been a significant step taken by 
India towards joining the global war against money 
laundering  and  financing  of  terrorism.  PMLA  was 
amended  in  December  2012  so  that  the  legislative 
and  administrative  framework  of  the  country 
became more effective and capable of handling new 
evolving  threats  in  the  areas  of  money  laundering 
and financing of terrorism. Further, the Prevention of 
Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 
2005 were also amended to reflect these new changes. 
SEBI has already incorporated the amendments in its 
AML/CFT framework.

 
As  in  the  past,  during  2016-17  too  SEBI 
continued  focused  efforts  on  strengthening  the 
regulatory  framework  and  minimizing  the  risks 
emanating  from  money  laundering  and  terrorist 
financing  in  the  securities  market.  The  following 
steps were taken in this regard:

A. 

 INSPECTIONS  OF  AML/CFT  RELATED 
ISSUES

 
SEBI  has  appropriately  included  AML/CFT 
risks  as  a  part  of  its  inspection  of  intermediaries 
such  as  stock  brokers,  depository  participants  and 
mutual funds. SEBI also carried out specific theme 
based  inspections  of  intermediaries  focusing  on 
compliance  with  KYC  norms  (including  client  due 
diligence)  and  AML/CFT  guidelines.  During  2016-
17,  with  respect  to  stock  brokers,  SEBI  has  carried 
out  105  special  purpose  inspections  to  check  their 
compliance  with  the  AML/CFT  and  KYC  norms 
respectively; 
,  and  with  respect  to  depository 
participants,  36  inspections  were  carried  out  to 
verify compliance with AML/CFT and KYC norms 
respectively. With respect to mutual funds and PMS, 
23 and 10 inspections were carried out respectively 
wherein  compliance  with  AML/CFT  and  KYC 
related norms was reviewed.

to  SEBI’s 

In  addition 

special  purpose 
 
inspections,  compliance  with  AML/  CFT  norms  is 
also  verified  by  stock  exchanges  and  depositories 
during  their  inspections  of  stock  brokers  and 
depository participants and also at the time of half 
yearly internal audits by independent professionals. 
Depository  participants  are  also  required 
to 
undergo  concurrent  audits  with  respect  to  their 
operations including KYC/AML norms. Appropriate 
sanctions  are  applied  where  AML/CFT  violations/
discrepancies are observed.

 
Table  3.36  provides  data  on  the  number  of 
members/participants  against  whom  action  for 
AML/CFT  violations/discrepancies  was  taken  by 
exchanges and depositories during 2016-17.

Stock  exchanges  and  depositories  also 
conducted  training/  seminars  for  their  members  to 
sensitize  them  about  the  significance  of  the  AML/
CFT framework and the need to ensure continuous 
compliance with it.

B. 

 INTERNATIONAL  COOPERATION  ON 
AML/CFT RELATED ISSUES

 
SEBI has consistently been in touch with global 
bodies  and  other  Indian  regulators  to  keep  the 
regulatory framework for AML robust in the Indian 
securities  market.  As  part  of  Indian  government 
delegations SEBI officials participate in the plenary 
and  working  group  meetings  of  the  Financial 
Action  Task  Force  (FATF)  and  the  Eurasian  Group 
on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  Terrorist 
Financing  (ML/TF),  which  is  a  FATF-style  regional 
body  (FSRB)  for  setting  standards  and  promoting 
effective 
regulatory 
and  operational  measures  for  combating  money 
laundering,  terrorist  financing  and  other  related 

implementation  of 

legal, 

threats to the integrity of the international financial 
system.

 
In  order  to  protect  the  international  financial 
system from ML/FT risks and to encourage greater 
compliance with AML/CFT standards, the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) identifies jurisdictions that 
have strategic deficiencies and works with them to 
address  the  deficiencies  which  pose  a  risk  to  the 
international  financial  system.  The  names  of  these 
jurisdictions are made public as part of the FATF public 
statements. As required by FATF Recommendations, 
the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Government  of  India 
circulates  FATF  public  statements  to  all  regulators 
with  advice  to  disseminate  these  to  all  financial 
institutions  under  their  supervision  for  applying 
enhanced  due  diligence  measures  when  dealing 
with  clients  from  these  high-risk  jurisdictions.  In 
2016-17,  SEBI  circulated  three  such  FATF  public 
statements dated June 24, 2016, October 21, 2016 and 
February  24,  2017  to  registered  intermediaries  for 
their compliance.

Standing  Committee  on  Finance,  Central  Statistics 
Office, as and when requested.

III.  SEBI INVESTOR SURVEY

 
In its short journey of 25 years SEBI has made 
an impression on investors and the securities market. 
The Indian securities market has evolved manifold 
in  terms  of  size,  reach,  diversity  of  investors  and 
product  complexity.  SEBI  has  conducted  three 
investor  surveys  till  now 
in  1998-99,  2001-02 
(quick  survey)  and  2008-09.  During  2016-17,  SEBI 
published  a  comprehensive  investor  survey  and 
a  survey  of  market  participants  for  the  base  year 
2015. The survey was carried out in all 29 states and 
seven  union  territories  through  a  comprehensive 
questionnaire.  The  sample  size  was  approximately 
50,000 investors and 1,000 market participants.

IV.  SYSTEMIC STABILITY UNIT

 
SEBI’s  Systemic  Stability  Unit  (SSU)  acts 
as  an  interface  with  the  Financial  Stability  and 
Development Council (FSDC) and monitors systemic 
risks, if any, emanating from the securities market.

 
Through coordination of SSU, SEBI provided 
inputs  to  the  meetings  of  FSDC,  the  FSDC  sub- 
committee  and  other  committees/  task  forces/ 
workings  groups  including  the  Early  Warning 
Group,  Macro  Financial  Monitoring  Group,  Inter-
Regulatory Technical Group and the Committee on 
Household Finance set up under the FSDC umbrella. 
SSU  also  provided  inputs  for  a  peer  review  of  the 
Indian  financial  market  done  by  the  Financial 
Stability  Board  (FSB)  and  the  Financial  Sector 
Assessment Programme (FSAP). SSU also provided 

inputs on economic and systemic risk-related issues 
discussed  in  various  international  forums  like 
IOSCO meetings and FSB meetings and as sought by 
the Office of International Affairs from time to time.

 
SEBI contributed inputs on potential systemic 
risk  issues  as  well  as  important  measures  taken 
to  further  strengthen  systemic  stability  and  the 
development of the securities markets in India. SEBI 
provided  inputs  for  RBI’s  Network  Analysis  on  a 
periodic  basis.  It  also  provided  inputs  to  the  IMF 
Data Gap Analysis being undertaken by RBI.

 
An  in-house  template,  the  Systemic  Risk 
Monitoring  Template  (SRMT)  developed  by  SEBI 
monitors some of the securities market’s indicators 
as to assess signs of systemic vulnerabilities in the 
Indian  securities  market  on  a  monthly  basis.  The 
template was revisited and reviewed during 2016-17 
wherein  the  number  of  indicators  captured  by  the 
template was increased for monitoring on a monthly 
basis.

Apart  from  SRMT,  SEBI  also  examined  and 
 
analysed  potential  risks,  if  any,  emanating  from 
emerging developments and events on a case to case 
basis. As such, the likely impact of major events like 
the Fed Rate hike, Brexit and the US election’s results 
were also examined.

V.  RESEARCH PAPERS/NOTES
 
During  2016-17,  research  papers/notes  were 
prepared  and  presented  on  a  wide  array  of  topics 
including: a) Impact of Demonetization, b) Trends and 
Progress of Banking in India , c) Stress in the Banking 
Sector – Recent Measures Taken by Government, d) 
Indian  Economy  and  Investment  Flows  ,  e)  Non-
Performing Assets and Asset Quality Review, and f) 
A  research  paper  on  Financial  Statistics:  Relevance 
and  Uses  was  presented  by  Research  Department 
at  the  19th  annual  national  conference  at  Sher-e-
Kashmir,  University  of  Agricultural  Sciences  and 
Technology, Jammu.

11.  SURVEILLANCE

Effective surveillance of the securities market 
 
is a pre-requisite for maintaining market integrity to 
enhance investor confidence. The stock exchanges are 
on the frontline as far as real time surveillance of the 
market segments that they operate in are concerned. 
At SEBI, ISD is responsible for the surveillance of all 
the segments of the Indian securities market. Over 
the  years,  various  amendments  to  the  SEBI  Act, 
1992  have  empowered  SEBI  to  undertake  credible 
surveillance action.

 
Complementing the surveillance infrastructure 
of  the  stock  exchanges,  SEBI  has  robust  in-house 
systems  in  place  to  monitor  activities  across  all 
market segments and platforms and to check unfair 
trade practices like market manipulation and insider 
trading.  The  Joint  Fund-Bank  Financial  Sector 
Assessment Programme of India noted that building 
a robust market surveillance system, among others, 
allowed SEBI to build a reputation of being a credible 
enforcement agency.

A. 

SURVEILLANCE MEASURES

As  an  on-going  mechanism,  SEBI  conducts 
 
meetings at regular intervals with stock exchanges/
depositories  to  keep  track  of  market  movements 
and  surveillance  activities.  During  2016-17, 
in 
consultation with stock exchanges and depositories, 
the following surveillance measures were taken:

a. 

b. 

 Action taken in the matter of dealing in shares 
of companies with poor fundamentals.

 In  cases  of  misuse  of  the  stock  exchange 
trading  platform  for  tax  evasion  purposes, 
focused  inspection  of  suspicious  brokers  and 
depository participants undertaken.

c. 

d. 

B. 

 To  deal  with  increasing  instances  of  bulk 
fraudulent SMSes to investors at large, action 
taken in a few cases to send a message to the 
market.

Strengthened the depository alert system.

SURVEILLANCE ACTION

 
SEBI  and  the  stock  exchanges  have  robust 
surveillance mechanisms in place to track activities 
on  the  stock  exchange  platform  and  to  generate 
alerts based on dynamic, system-based parameters. 
The  stock  exchanges  apprise  SEBI  of  surveillance 
concerns and actions at regular surveillance meetings. 
Stock  exchanges  initiate  surveillance  measures like 
introducing periodic price bands, shifting to trade for 
trade (TfT) and tightening price bands on the basis of 
the alerts and the analysis of trading in scrips. Stock 
exchanges  also  take  punitive  action  (suspension  of 
trading  in  the  scrips,  debarment  of  the  suspected 
entities, etc.).

 
In 2016-17, NSE, BSE and MSEI shifted 174, 666 
and 88 scrips respectively to the TfT segment (versus 
132, 642 and 49 respectively during 2015-16). During 
the year, NSE, BSE and MSEI imposed price bands 
of 2, 5 and 10 per cent on 959, 1,831, and 638 scrips 
respectively versus 1,292, 3,000 and 670 respectively 
in the previous year.

 
In  2016-17,  NSE,  BSE  and  MSEI  conducted 
preliminary investigations in 36, 1,535 and 7 cases, 
respectively (versus 31, 1,009 and 1 cases respectively 
during 2015-16). Also, during the year, NSE, BSE and 
MSEI verified 294, 301 and one rumours (versus 239, 
253  and  one  rumours  verified  during  the  previous 
year) (Table 3.38).

 SURVEILLANCE MEASURES – 
COMMODITIES

Following surveillance measures/actions have been 
taken during 2016-17:

 
During  2016-17,  the  prices  of  sugar,  chana, 
cotton seed oil cakes, rapeseed/ mustard seeds, maize 
(Rabi),  guar  seeds,  guar  gum,  wheat,  soyabean, 
castor seeds, jeera, cardamom, mentha oil and cotton 
derivative contracts were found to be volatile in line 
with  spot  prices  of  the  respective  commodity.  With 
an objective of tempering the possible exuberance in 
their  futures  markets  the  Commodity  Surveillance 
Department  took  up  regulatory  measures  such  as 
imposition of additional margins and special margins 
on these commodity futures contracts. The margins so 
imposed  on  certain  commodity  derivative  contracts 
were also revised/withdrawn as and when required.

 
In  addition  to  the  imposition  of  additional/
special margins in chana contracts, directions were 
issued to exchanges on June 16, 2016 that no fresh 
chana contracts will be launched and only squaring-
off  positions  will  be  allowed  in  running  contracts. 
Further, as a measure of abundant caution, directions 
were issued to exchanges on July 27, 2016 to close 
out all open positions at the end of the day, that is, 
July 27, 2016.

c. 

d. 

 Commodity  Watch  System:  A  commodity 
watch system has been designed in line with 
the  equity  surveillance  system.  Exchanges 
have successfully implemented this w.e.f. July 
01, 2016.

 Spread  Positions:  The  national  exchanges 
were  directed  on  September  27,  2016  that  in 
case of spread trades, special margin shall not 
be applicable.

 Wash  Trades/Self-trades’  Restrictions:  The 
issue of wash trades in commodity derivatives 
was  discussed 
in  detail  with  exchanges 
during  surveillance  meetings.  The  exchanges 
have  augmented  their  capabilities  whereby 
wash trades / self-trades are restricted before 
execution.

 Surveillance  Obligations 
for  Trading 
Members: As advised, all national commodity 
exchanges 
effective 
surveillance  at  the  member  level.  As  per 
the  directives,  members  are  responsible  for 
carrying  out  due  diligence  of  their  clients;

they are also directed to frame a surveillance 
policy for monitoring and reporting on various 
factors. This system is effective from January 
01, 2017.

 Mark  to  Market  (MTM)  Margin  Shortages: 
Exchanges  issued  a  circular  that  in  case  of 
members  delaying  the  MTM  margin,  an 
amount  equivalent  to  the  last  30  days’  MTM 
shortages are blocked for a period of 10 days 
without providing any margin benefit.

 

1. 

 Warehouse  Inspections:  On  the  basis 
of  complaints  in  contracts  of  coriander 
and  cotton  seed  oil  cakes,  warehouse 
inspections were conducted in Rajasthan 
and  Gujarat 
in  August  2016  by  a 
team  of  officers  from  the  Surveillance 
Department and samples collected. The 

 

 2. 

samples  were  sent  to  the  laboratory  of 
the Spice Board of India (for coriander) 
and the Central Institute for Research on 
Cotton Technology (CIRCOT) (for cotton 
seed oil cakes) for assaying purposes.

 Surveillance  Inputs  from  Regional/
Local Offices: SEBI’s regional and local 
offices  have  been  asked  to  monitor 
vernacular  language  newspapers  and 
complaints  and  provide  surveillance 
inputs.  Regional/local  offices  are  also 
requested to provide surveillance inputs 
gathered from local mandis and keep a 
close watch on spot prices prevailing in 
the local mandis.

12.  INVESTIGATION

Timely  completion  of 

investigations  and 
 
effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  action  in 
case  of  violations  of  securities’  laws  are  important 
for protecting investor interests and ensuring a fair, 
transparent and orderly functioning of the market. 
These  are  also  vital  for  improving  confidence  in 
the  integrity  of  the  securities  market.  Another 
important  benefit  resulting  from  investigations  is 
contribution to policy changes with a view to further 
strengthening 
the  regulatory  and  enforcement 
environment. Therefore, SEBI is constantly striving 
to upgrade its investigative skills by making use of 
IT and other latest investigative tools.

Keeping 

 
these  objectives  and  principles 
of  securities’  regulations  in  view,  SEBI  initiates 
investigations  to  examine  alleged  or  suspected 
violations  of  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  the 
securities  market.  Possible  violations  may  include 
price  manipulation,  creating  an  artificial  market, 
insider  trading,  capital  issue  related  irregularities, 
takeover  related  violations,  non-compliance  of 
disclosure requirements and any other misconduct 
in the securities market.

A. 

INITIATION OF INVESTIGATIONS: 

SEBI 

initiates 

 
investigations  based  on 
references  received  from  sources  such  as  SEBI’s 
Integrated 
other 
operational  departments  within  SEBI  and  external 
government agencies.

Surveillance  Department, 

B. 

PROCESS OF INVESTIGATION: 

The steps involved in an investigation include 
 
an  analysis  of  market  data  (order  and  trade  log, 
transaction  statements,  etc.)  and  static  data  (KYC 

from  brokers,  depository 
documents  obtained 
participants,  etc.,  bank  records,  financial  results, 
events  around  major  corporate  developments, 
call  data  records  etc.).  The  purpose  of  such  an 
investigation  is  to  gather  evidence  and  to  identify 
persons/ entities behind irregularities and violations 
so  that  appropriate  and  suitable  regulatory  action 
can be taken wherever required.

C.  TRENDS IN INVESTIGATION CASES: 

 
During  2016-17,  245  new  cases  were  taken 
up for investigation and 155 cases were completed 
compared to 133 new cases taken up and 123 cases 
completed  in  2015-16  (Table  3.40).  There  was  a 
comparative increase in the number of cases taken 
up  during  2016-17  mainly  due  to  the  references 
received from the Department of Income Tax in the 
matter  of  long  term  capital  gain/short  term  capital 
loss in various scrips.

market  manipulation  and  price  rigging  compared 
to  63  per  cent  (84  out  of  133)  cases  in  2015-16. 
While  insider  trading  and  takeover  violation  cases

Since  several

 NATURE  OF  INVESTIGATION  CASES 
COMPLETED: 

 
During 2016-17, 76 per cent (118 out of 155)cases 
that were completed pertain to market manipulation 
and price rigging compared to 49 per cent (60 out of 
123) cases in 2015-16. In addition, the other category 
of  cases  completed  pertained  to  insider  trading, 
takeover violations, ‘Issue’ related manipulation and 
other violations of securities laws; these accounted 
for 10 per cent (15 cases), 3 per cent (4 cases), 3 per 
cent (5 cases) and 8 per cent (13 cases) respectively 
(Table 3.41).

F. 

REGULATORY ACTION TAKEN: 

 
After  an  investigation  is  completed,  penal 
action  is  initiated  as  approved  by  the  competent 
authority wherever violations of laws and obligations 
relating to the securities market are observed. Action 
is  decided  based  on  the  principles  of  objectivity, 
consistency,  materiality  and  quality  of  evidence 
available after a thorough analysis and appreciation 
of facts. The action taken includes issuing warning 
letters, initiating enquiry proceedings for registered 
intermediaries,  initiating  adjudication  proceedings 
for  levy  of  monetary  penalties,  passing  directions 
under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and initiating 
prosecution  and  referring  the  matter  to  other 
regulatory agencies (Table 3.42).

ENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS

 
Effective  enforcement  lies  at  the  heart  of 
ensuring  integrity,  transparency  and  fairness  in 
the market. It not only leads to a better compliance 
culture  but  also  underscores  the  point  that  market 
misconduct  and  abuse  will  not  go  unpunished. 
A  credible  enforcement  strategy  underpins  the 
importance  of  consistent,  timely  and  transparent 
regulatory  outcomes  which  are  proportionate, 
dissuasive  and  effective.  Under  the  SEBI  Act, 
1992;  SCRA,  1956;  and  the  Depositories  Act,  1996 
SEBI  broadly  pursues  two  streams  of  enforcement 
action,  that  is,  administrative/civil  or  criminal. 
Administrative/civil 
issuing 
directions such as remedial orders, cease and desist 
orders,  suspension  or  cancellation  of  certificates  of 
registration  and  imposition  of  monetary  penalties 
under respective statutes. Proceedings of a criminal 
nature  involve  initiating  prosecution  proceedings 
against violators by filing criminal complaints before 
a competent court.

substantially pursuant to the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme

1365 0f 2005) where it was held that the Adjudicating Officer 
has no discretion to decide the quantum of monetary penalty. 
This was differed by another bench in the matter of Siddharth 
Chaturvedi (Civil Appeal 14730 of 2015) and referred for a larger 
bench. The issue was ultimately resolved by the Finance Act, 
2017, by amending the securities laws, which came into effect

Box 3.2: Recovery Actions

Action taken in the PACL case
 
After initiation of recovery proceedings against PACL Ltd. in December 2015 for recovery of ` 49,100 
crore along with returns/ interest due to more than 5.5 crore investors, SEBI secured about ` 200 crore lying 
in various banks. As there were multiple proceedings before the Delhi High Court regarding the attachment 
of bank accounts by other agencies, SEBI filed transfer applications before the Supreme Court of India.

 
The Supreme Court vide order dated February 02, 2016 directed: (i) SEBI to constitute a committee 
under the Chairmanship of former Chief Justice of India Shri R.M. Lodha to sell PACL Ltd.’s assets and 
distribute money to the investors, (ii) money lying in all the bank accounts to be released to SEBI and SEBI 
will  keep  this  in  separate  bank  accounts,  (iii)  the  Central  Bureau  of  Investigation  to  hand  over  original 
documents  relating  to  properties  of  PACL  Ltd.  to  the  committee. As  per  the  order,  SEBI  constituted  the 
committee on February 17, 2016 and provided office space and manpower to it at Hotel Ashoka, New Delhi. 
SEBI has so far recovered ` 210 crore from all the bank accounts and transferred it to a separate bank account 
opened by the committee. The committee has called for Expression of Interest from the general public for 
sale of the properties. Based on the responses received, the committee is taking steps to assess the value of 
the properties and auction them. The committee has been receiving a number of cross-claims with respect to 
various PACL Ltd.’s properties The committee has disposed 47 vehicles and realized ` 15.22 crore.

 
On receipt of information that a contract for sale of Hotel Sheraton Mirage in Gold Coast, Australia 
which  was  purchased  out  of  the  funds  mobilized  by  PACL  and  diverted  to Australia,  SEBI  has  filed  an 
application before the Federal Court of Australia for securing the proceeds of sale and two other properties 
acquired by PACL Ltd.’s associates in Australia. The Federal Court has directed that the sale proceeds be 
deposited in an interest bearing deposit account in Australia. SEBI has also filed an application claiming 
the sale proceeds of AUD 87.37 million (` 437 crore approximately). As some of the Indian investor groups 
have claimed the said proceeds and the other properties, these are yet to be released in favour of SEBI due 
to the objections raised by the said group and the matter is pending before the court, which SEBI is pursuing 
legally.

Actions taken in other recovery cases:
Exercise its recovery powers during 2016-17 with the limited available manpower dealing with recovery 
 
matters, 275 fresh recovery proceedings for recovery of  ` 15,336 crore were initiated and 707 attachment 
notices were issued against bank accounts/lockers, demat accounts and others. The recovery proceedings 
were completed in 121 cases, all of which were non-CIS / DPI cases and ` 88 crore was recovered during 
2016-17.

Attachment of assets by multiple agencies:
In many of the cases where SEBI has initiated recovery proceedings, there are litigations making any 
 
sale difficult. Further, many assets have multiple attachments by various agencies leading to disputes relating 
to claims and counter-claims of the assets as the law is not yet settled -- 108 cases involving ` 59,396 crore are 
affected either due to litigations or multiple agency attachments. Therefore, SEBI is required to defend the 
cases and/or to coordinate with other agencies for disposal of the assets of the defaulters. A Special Court 
set up under the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors (MPID) Act permits SEBI to undertake 
valuation and auction of assets in coordination with the competent authority under the MPID Act in a couple 
of cases and the court has appreciated its efforts so far.

VI.  SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT CELL

 
SEBI  constituted  the  Special  Enforcement 
Cell  to  specifically  handle  work  relating  to  the 
verification process of documents submitted in terms 
of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and 
matters  connected  therewith.  Developments  in  the 
matter of M/s. Sahara India Real Estate Corporation 
Ltd.,  (SIRECL)  and  M/s.  Sahara  India  Housing 
Corporation Ltd. (SHICL) are given below.

A.  BACKGROUND:

alia  upheld  SEBI  directions  to  SIRECL  and  SHICL 
(collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Saharas”) 
to  forthwith  refund  the  money  collected  by  them 
through RHPs with 15 per cent interest from the date 
of receipt of money till the date of payment.
 
SEBI  has  been  acting  in  accordance  with  the 
directions  contained  in  the  said  judgment  of  the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court and its actions are overseen 
by  Hon’ble  Justice  (retd.)  B.  N. Agrawal.  SEBI  has 
filed 15 status reports before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court in this respect which have also been furnished 
to Saharas.
B. 

 DEVELOPMENTS 
DURING 2016 - 17:
 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  vide  Order  dated 
March  29,  2016,  directed  SEBI  to  devise  a  suitable 
mechanism  for  sale  of  properties,  the  title  deeds 
whereof  have  already  been  deposited  with  it  by 
Saharas, in consultation and under the supervision 
of Justice (retd.) B.N. Agrawal, with or without the 
assistance of an expert agency and to keep Saharas 
duly informed about the steps taken by it in which 
event Saharas shall be free to provide such inputs as 
may be considered necessary so that the properties 
fetch  a  fair  price  towards  sale  consideration.  It 
has  also  been  directed  that  SEBI  shall  not  sell  any 
property owned by Saharas for a price less than 90 

IN  THE  MATTER 

per cent of the circle rates for the area in question 
without the permission of the Hon’ble Court.

 
SEBI  engaged  the  services  of  SBI  Capital 
Markets  Ltd.  and  HDFC  Realty  Ltd.,  (collectively 
referred to hereinafter as “Agencies”) in the process 
of sale of the properties of the Saharas. These agencies 
were assigned with the sale process of 30 properties 
each (out of 67 properties for which title deeds were 
submitted to SEBI by Saharas).

 
The  auctions  resulted  in  sale  of  only  five 
properties for a total value of `127.68 crore. Out of 
the said total sale value, consideration in respect of 
sale of four properties have been received in full and 
Certificates of Sale have been issued. As regards the 
remaining property, the due date for remittance of 
the final instalment of the sale consideration is due 
on April 25, 2017.

C.  AMOUNT RECEIVED FROM THE SAHARAS

 
Pursuant  to  various  Orders  passed  by  the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court and the attachment Orders 
dated February 13, 2014 passed by SEBI, as on March 
31, 2017, an aggregate amount of about `11,800 crore 
has been recovered by SEBI. As on March 31, 2017, 
these  amounts along  with  interest  earned on them 
after providing for making refunds to the investors, 
have  been  deposited  in  ‘nationalized  banks’  for  an 
aggregate amount of `.14,487 crore, in terms of the 
judgment  dated  August  31,  2012  of  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme Court.

D.  STATUS OF REFUNDS MADE BY SEBI

 
Pursuant to the order of the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court dated May 08, 2013 permitting SEBI to make 
refunds to those genuine investors who lodged their 
claim with SEBI, a press release was issued on May 
28,  2012  followed  by  two  series  of  advertisements 
released in August 2014 and December 2014 and the 
format  of  the  “Application  for  refund”  was  put  on

VII.  REGULATORY CHANGES

Section  30  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  empowers 
 
SEBI to make regulations consistent with the Act by 
issuing notifications. Every rule and every regulation 
made under this Act is to be laid before both Houses 
of  Parliament.  During  2016-17,  SEBI  took  various 
regulatory  measures  to  protect  the  interests  of 
investors in the securities market, for developing the 
securities  market  and  for  regulating  the  securities 
market.  It  notified  various  new  regulations  and 
various amendments to existing regulations.

Regulations.

Rationale: Considering that the units issued by REITs 
and  InvITs  are  more  like  equity  securities,  mutual 
funds  were  allowed  to  invest  in  such  instruments 
subject to conditions.

d. 

 SEBI  (Employees’  Service)  (Amendment) 
Regulations, 2016 w.e.f. November 30, 2016

Scheme.

Rationale: To introduce a new pension scheme for 
SEBI employees as per the government’s policy.

placements of such securities, adequate disclosures 
are to be made by the wilful defaulter at the time of 
issue.

Rationale:  Tightening  the  regulatory  framework 
so as to restrict a company from raising money by 
issuing convertible debt instruments if it or any of its 
promoters or directors is a wilful defaulter.

subscription  in  the  employee  reservation  portion, 
can  the  shares  be  allotted  to  employees  over  and 
above the extant limit of ` 2 lakh on a proportionate 
basis, but not exceeding ` 5 lakh per employee.

Rationale: To enhance the limit of employee 
reservations in listed companies.

j. 

 SEBI 
(Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure 
Requirements)  (Amendment)  Regulations, 
2017 w.e.f February 15, 2017

Details: The amendment provides that pursuant to 
a scheme of merger/ amalgamation, if allotment of 
shares is done on a preferential basis to a select group 
of  shareholders  of  unlisted  companies,  then  the 
pricing norms under the SEBI (Issue of Capital and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR) 
will apply. Further, the amendment also empowers 
stock exchanges to impose fines/take action against 
a  listed  entity/any  person,  for  contravention  of  the 
Regulations  by  way  of  inserting  Regulations  111A 
and 111B.
Rationale:  To  tighten  the  regulatory  framework 
governing schemes of arrangements -- mergers and 
demergers  of  companies.  To  prevent  the  misuse 
of  schemes  where  the  exemption  from  the  pricing 
formula under ICDR has been used to allot shares 
to  a  select  group  of  persons  or  promoters  at  a 
discounted  price  which  is  not  the  intention  of  the 
regulations and also to empower stock exchanges to 
impose  fines  on  listed  entities  for  contravention  of 
the Regulations.

Details:  The  amended  regulations  define  wilful 
defaulters and provide that such defaulters will not 
be allowed to take control over other listed entities. 
However, if a listed company or its promoter or its 
director is categorized as a wilful defaulter, it may 
be  allowed to  make  a  competing  offer  for  the  said 
listed company in accordance with SEBI (Substantial 
Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations, 
2011.

Rationale: To tighten the regulatory framework so as 
to protect shareholders of listed companies.

Details:  The  amendment  relaxes  the  norms  with 
respect  to  minimum  investment,  lock-in  period 
and  number  of  investors  in  angel  funds.  It  also 
allows angel funds to invest in securities of foreign 
companies  subject  to  conditions  that  may  be 
stipulated  by  RBI  and  SEBI.  The  definition  of  a 
‘start-up’  has  also  been  aligned  to  the  definition 
prescribed  by  the  Department  of  Industrial  Policy 
and Promotion, Government of India.

Rationale:  To

fall in the contribution to SGF, the recognized clearing 
corporation and the recognized stock exchange will 
replenish the fund to the threshold level as may be 
specified by SEBI from time to time.

Rationale:  To  do  away  with  the  requirement  of 
profit  transfer  of  25  per  cent  by  stock  exchanges 
to  SGF  since  the  available  core  SGF  is  sufficient 
to  cover  expected  shortfalls.  Also  to  mandate  the 
responsibility of replenishing the SGF corpus in case 
of a shortfall with the clearing corporation and stock 
exchanges.

exchanges,  depositories,  banking 
companies, 
insurance  companies  and  commodity  derivatives 
exchanges to hold up to 15 per cent of paid-up equity

 SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible 
Redeemable Preference Shares) (Amendment) 
Regulations, 2016 w.e.f. May 25, 2016

Details:  The  amendment  defines  wilful  defaulters 
and  provides  that  such  defaulters  are  barred  from 
raising  money  from  the  public  by  way  of  issue  of 
non-convertible 
redeemable  preference  shares. 
In  case  of  private  placements  of  such  securities, 
adequate  disclosures  are  to  be  made  by  the  wilful 
defaulter at the time of issue.

Rationale: Tightening the regulatory framework so 
as to restrict a company from raising money through 
the issue of non-convertible redeemable preference 
shares if it or any of its promoters or directors is a 
wilful defaulter.

(Amendment)  Regulations, 
2016, w.e.f. August 29, 2016

Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  clarifies  that 
Regulation  5(2)(b)  of  the  SEBI  (Settlement  of 
Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 
2014 is not to prohibit settlements with respect to all 
kinds  of  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices  and 
that  Regulation  5(2)(c)  disqualifies  only  defaults 
which are ‘serious’ and have a market-wide impact 
or cause substantial losses to investors or affect the 
rights  of  investors  in  securities,  especially  retail 
investors and small shareholders.

The  Regulations  were  formulated  primarily  to 
settle  minor  and  technical  violations  not  having 
a wider impact on the market so that enforcement 
is  concentrated  on  major  and  significant  cases. 
However, the intention was not to reject settlements 
with respect to violations pertaining to fraud.

Details: The amendment eases the structuring and 
offering  requirements  for  InvIT  by  allowing  it  to 
invest through a two-level SPV structure, reducing 
the  quantum  of  mandatory  sponsor  holdings, 
removing the restriction on the number of sponsors 
and  aligning  the  minimum  public  holding  in  line 
with  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957 
etc.  The  amendment  also  eases  the  process  of 
registration of InvIT with SEBI by doing away with 
the requirement of filing the project implementation 
agreement  at  the  time  of  making  registration 
application.  The  amendment  also  rationalizes  the 
requirements for private placement of InvIT and the 
requirements  for  unit  holder  approval  for  related 
party  transactions  and  expands  the  definition  of 
‘valuer’ under the Regulations.

Rationale: To facilitate InvITs’ growth by easing the 
regulatory framework.

 SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements)  (Amendment)  Regulations, 
2016 w.e.f. May 25, 2016

Details:  The  amendment  modifies  the  current 
mechanism of dealing with financial statements and 
audit  qualifications  contained  in  the  audit  reports 
of  listed  companies.  The  new  mechanism  inter-alia 
specifies that listed entities are required to disclose 
the cumulative impact of all the audit qualifications 
in  a  separate  form  called  ‘Statement  of  Audit 
Qualifications’  and  that  the  management  may  be 
given opportunity to explain its point of view on the 
audit qualifications.

Rationale: To prescribe a new mechanism of dealing 
with financial statements of listed companies which 
have  been  qualified  by  auditors.  The  new  system 
which  has  been  made  applicable  from  March  31, 
2017  is  simplified  and  will  also  lower  the  cost  of 
compliance by listed companies.

 SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements) 
Amendment) 
Regulations, 2016, w.e.f. July 8, 2016

(Second 

Details: The amendment mandates the top-500 listed 
entities based on market capitalization to formulate 
a  dividend  distribution  policy  as  per  suggested 
parameters which will be disclosed in their annual 
reports  and  on  their  websites.  In  case  of  deviation 
from  the  suggested  parameters,  this  has  to  be 
disclosed along with the rationale. The amendment 
further allows listed entities (other than the top-500 
listed entities) to voluntarily disclose their dividend 
distribution policies.

Rationale:  To  enable  investors  to  take  informed 
decision  with  respect  to  expected  returns  on  their 
investments.

Details: This amendment mandates that –

	 	Profit  sharing  agreements  entered  into  by 
any  employee  including  promoters  or  key 
managerial  personnel  or  directors  of  a  listed 
company  will  be  executed  only  after  prior 
approval  from  the  board  of  directors  as  well 
as  from  public  shareholders  by  ordinary 
resolution;

	 	All  agreements,  either  subsisting  or  expired, 
entered into during the preceding three years 
will  be  disclosed  to  the  stock  exchanges  for 
public dissemination;

	 	Subsisting agreements will be placed before the 
board of directors and pursuant to its approval 
be  placed  before  the  public  shareholders  for 
approval by ordinary resolution in the general 
meeting; and

	 	Interested persons are directed to abstain from 

voting in the general meeting.

Rationale:  To  overcome  the  concerns  raised  with 
respect  to  private  equity  funds  entering 
into 
compensation agreements to incentivize promoters, 
directors  and  key  managerial  personnel  of  listed 
investee companies which could potentially lead to 
unfair practices.

of  merger  or  amalgamation  between  a  holding 
company and its wholly owned subsidiary company 
wherein the requirement for making an application 
to  the  tribunal/  courts  has  been  dispensed  with. 
Hence,  no  major  regulatory  concern  arises  in  such

surplus incomes as per their income and expenditure 
statements in any of the three immediately preceding 
financial  years  or  any  other  financial  criteria  as 
specified by SEBI from time to time.

Details: The amendment made to various Regulations 
to enable market participants to make payments to 
SEBI through digital mode (such as NEFT/RTGS) as 
well and also provides for revision of fees/charges in 
various regulations covered therein. The amendment 
regulations, which were made effective from March 
06, 2017, rescinded the earlier SEBI (Payment of Fees 
and  Mode  of  Payment)  (Amendment)  Regulations, 
2017 notified on March 06, 2017 and saved any action 
taken in pursuance of the said notification.

Rationale:  Payment  modes  permitted  by  RBI 
through  electronic  medium  have  been  allowed  for 
market participants/others for making payments to 
SEBI. This mode is in addition to the existing mode 
of payment through demand draft.

During  2016-17,  CPIO  office  conducted 
department focused workshops for SEBI officials of 
respective departments in the Head Office to enable 
them to become more appreciative of the provisions of 
the RTI Act and reiterated the duties, responsibilities 
and statutory obligations therein. Similar workshops 
were also conducted in the Northern Regional and 
Eastern Regional offices during the year.

 

A training module was designed in association 

with  the  National  Institute  of  Securities  Markets 
(NISM),  especially  focused  on  aspects  of  the  RTI 
Act, 2005. This was the first in a series of three-day 
residential training programmes titled ‘RTI Act and

MIS Portal (web portal) launched by the Department 
of  Personnel  and  Training,  which  facilitates  online 
filing  and  disposal  of  RTI  applications  and  first 
appeals  and  allows  public  authorities  to  dispose-
off RTI applications and first appeals expeditiously 
through  a  paperless  process  and  generate  online 
returns / reports. The office of the CPIO encourages 
RTI applicants to use this paperless option.

FSB PEER REVIEW OF INDIA

The  FSB  peer  review’s  focus 

is  on  the 
 
financial  sector  standards 
implementation  of 
and  policies  agreed  within  FSB,  as  well  as  their 
effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes. As part 
of its commitment towards global financial stability, 
India underwent the FSB peer review in 2015. The 

peer  review  covered  two  topics:  (1)  The  macro-
prudential  policy  framework,  and  (2)  regulation 
and supervision of non-banking finance companies 
(NBFCs)  and  housing  finance  companies  (HFCs). 
With  regard  to  the  regulation  and  supervision  of 
non-banking  financial  entities,  the  focus  of  the 
FSB  analysis  peer  review  was  limited  to  NBFCs 
(regulated  by  RBI)  and  HFCs  (regulated  by  the 
National Housing Board). The Final FSB Peer Review 
Report  for  India1  was  published  in  August  2016.
The  report  acknowledges  that  progress  has  been 
made  in  developing  the  macro-prudential  policy 
framework  and  in  strengthening  regulation  and 
supervision of NBFCs and HFCs in recent years.

The  FSB  peer  review  assessed  the  activities 
 
carried out by SEBI in the context of the analytical 
framework  and 
the 
macro-prudential  policy  framework.  The  report 
acknowledged a few of the good practices adopted 
by SEBI:

risk  assessments  under 

 

 

1 

 In October 2015, the Systemic Stability Unit of SEBI 
developed a Systemic Risk Monitoring Template to 
monitor on a monthly basis the emerging systemic 
risks in the Indian securities market, feeding some 
of  this  information  into  the  EWG  and  the  FSR. 
Enhanced  monitoring  takes  place  when  there  are 
signs  of  particularly  high  volatility  in  a  market. 
Additionally,  a  RBI-SEBI  standing  committee 
was established in 2008 to examine the trading of 
currency and interest rate derivatives on exchanges 
and  coordinate  the  regulatory  roles  of  the  two 
authorities.  Finally,  SEBI  requires  that  all  liquid 
fund  and  money  market  fund  (MMF)  schemes 
carry out stress tests at least on a monthly basis on 
their interest rate, credit, liquidity and redemption 
risks.

 SEBI  also  has  tools  that  can  be  used  for  macro-
prudential  purposes,  including  circuit  breakers 
and variation margins that are introduced if there 
are  large  daily  movements  in  market  wide  prices. 
At  a  firm  level,  SEBI  also  uses  capital  adequacy 
requirements for brokers, as well as restrictions on 
maturity, concentration, investments, leverage and 
derivatives for MMFs.

II. 

SECTOR  ASSESSMENT 

 FINANCIAL 
PROGRAMME
 
The  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Programme 
(FSAP)  is  an  in-depth  assessment  of  a  country’s 
financial  sector. 
In  developing  and  emerging 
market countries, FSAP assessments are conducted 
jointly by IMF and the World Bank and include two 
components  :  financial  stability  assessment  (main 
responsibility of the IMF) and financial development 
assessment (main responsibility of the World Bank).
 
In  the  past,  India  has  undergone  FSAP  pilot 
assessments in 2000 and the FSAP Update in 2011. 
The  third  FSAP  of  India,  currently  underway,  was 
initiated by the formal visit of the scoping mission 
team  in  December  2016  to  discuss  and  finalize  the 
terms and areas of assessment. From the securities 
market’s viewpoint, this FSAP includes assessment 
of  IOSCO  Principles  and  Objectives  of  Securities 
Regulation  and  CPSS-IOSCO  Recommendations 
for  Securities  Settlement  Systems  and  Central 
Counterparties.
The  scoping  mission’s  visit  was  followed  by 
 
detailed  questionnaires  to  the  Indian  authorities 
including  SEBI.  Subsequently,  the  first  mission  of 
the FSAP team was held during March 14-31, 2017. 
Approximately 20 meetings took place for six days 
between  the  review  team  and  SEBI  officials  from 
various  departments/divisions.  SEBI  provided 
information, supporting data/reports and comments 
to the FSAP team during and post the meetings.

 

Besides,  on  the  request  of  the  FSAP  team, 

meetings  were  also  scheduled  with  the  stock 
exchanges, industry organizations, corporate equity/
debt issuers, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and 
select securities market’s intermediaries. The work is 
currently under progress.

 REGULATORY 
INITIATIVES 
PURSUANT TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

POLICY 

 
On numerous occasions, the vast and varying 
international  experience  gathered  by  SEBI  through 
its international engagements with global bodies has 
been  carefully  applied  in  formulating  its  domestic 
policy.  The  deliberations  and  valuable  knowledge 
sharing efforts at the international level translate into 
formulating  and  adopting  global  standards.  Such 
standards are, time and again, adopted by SEBI in 
its domestic rule-making. This demonstrates SEBI’s 
commitment  towards  the  international  community 
and gives the necessary breadth and depth to SEBI’s 
own policy formation.

SEBI has been proactive in developing policies 
 
based  on  issues  discussed  at  the  global  level.  For 
example, international discussions and deliberations 
in  key  areas  such  as  market  conduct,  corporate 
governance,  cyber  security,  regulation  of  central 
counter  parties  (CCPs)  and  digitalization  have 
provided very useful inputs and have been used by 
SEBI in its domestic regulations.

 
SEBI  has  representation  in  various  policy 
committees  and  also  participates  in  most  of  the 
reviews, which facilitates it in keeping a regular tab 
on the evolution of global benchmarks.

IV.  BILATERAL ENGAGEMENTS

 
SEBI  has  signed  bilateral  MoUs  with  various 
securities regulators for enhancing cooperation and

 ENGAGEMENT 
INTERNATIONAL REGULATORS

WITH 

OTHER 

1. 

Engagement with ESMA on EMIR

The  European  Parliament  and  the  Council 
 
adopted 
Infrastructure 
Regulations (EMIR) effective from August 2012. As 

the  European  Market 

per  Article  25(1)  of  the  EMIR,  ‘A  Central  Counter 
Party  (CCP)  established  in  third  country  may 
provide  services  to  clearing  members  or  trading 
venues established in the Union only where the CCP 
is  recognized  by  ESMA.’  Therefore,  the  securities 
market CCPs established and operating in India have 
to seek recognition from ESMA for clearing trades of 

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

171

entities which originate in the European Union (EU). 
Before ESMA grants recognition EU has to adopt an 
‘implementing act’ with regard to India.

 
During  2016,  SEBI  and  RBI  jointly  engaged 
with  European  Commission  (EC)  to  complete  the 
provisions of EMIR in order to enable EC to adopt 
an ‘implementing act’ which in turn will aid in the 
recognition of Indian CCPs by ESMA. On December 
15, 2016, EC adopted the implementing act wherein 
it  stated  that  India  satisfied  all  three  conditions  of 
recognition:

	 	CCPs  authorized  in  India  are  subject  to 
effective  supervision  and  enforcement  on  an 
on-going basis.

	 	The  legal  and  supervisory  arrangements  in 
India  ensure  that  CCPs  authorized  in  India 
comply  with  legally  binding  requirements 
which are equivalent to the requirements laid 
down in Title IV of EMIR.

	 	India has a specific regime for the recognition 
of CCPs authorized under the legal regime of a 
third country.

 
In 2014, SEBI had received a draft MoU from 
ESMA which is a pre-requisite for recognition under 
EMIR for all future supervisory activities. Both SEBI 
and  ESMA,  through  subsequent  alterations  have 
revised the MoU and this was agreed upon in 2016-
17. The draft MoU will be signed once SEBI receives 
approval from the Ministry of Finance.

2. 

 Engagement  with  Autorité  des  marchés 
financiers 
(AMF), 
(Securities 
Regulator of France)

France 

 
On  the  side-lines  of  various  international 
meetings, SEBI and AMF France had discussed the 
possibility of engaging with each other with a view 
to learning from each other and for identifying areas 
of collaboration.

After 

several 

closer  discussions, 

 
topics 
including  asset  management,  market  surveillance, 
SME  financing,  private  placements  and  crowd-
funding  were  identified  and  it  was  agreed  that 
these topics will be prioritized and interactions will 
initially  be  done  through  video-conference  calls 
followed by expert visits.

 
Accordingly,  four  video  calls  took  place 
between July 2015 and March 2016 between SEBI and 
AMF. Two topics, ’Asset Management Industry’ and 
‘Market Surveillance’ were deliberated on during the 
course of these calls.

 
In 2016-17, two conference calls were held with 
AMF  on  SMEs.  The  first  one  was  held  in  October 
2016 and the second one in January 2017. Officials 
on  both  the  sides  felt  that  the  discussions  were 
informative and provided an excellent overview of 
how the respective areas were regulated, governed 
and could be further developed.

3. 

Engagement between SEBI and US CFTC

 
During  2015-16,  SEBI  and  the  Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) engaged with 
each other in the wake of FMC’s merger with SEBI. 
It  was  agreed  that  CFTC  will  provide  technical 
assistance to SEBI officials in the area of regulation 
of commodity derivatives.

 
It was agreed that technology will be leveraged 
to impart the training. SEBI officials will be provided 
with a unique URL, which will provide time-limited 
access to lectures on the You Tube website. This will 
allow SEBI officials to view the lectures in their time 
zone and at their convenience.

 
Accordingly,  CFTC  circulated  seven  lectures 
during 2016-17. The topics of the lectures included 
contract  design, 
commodity 
derivatives  markets, 
disorderly 
markets, elements of a comprehensive enforcement 
programme, 
supervision  of 

surveillance  of

intermediaries,  regulation  and  supervision  of 
clearing  houses,  best  practices  and  contemporary 
challenges.  Each  lecture  was  followed  by  a  live 
tele-conference session to respond to SEBI officials’ 
questions.

 
Additionally,  a  visit  of  around  10  officials  to 
US  CFTC  was  also  arranged  to  have  detailed  in-
person  discussions  on  the  regulatory  structure  of 
US  markets.  The  officials  also  visited  various  US 
markets players, warehouses and stock exchanges to 
understand how the commodities market functions 
in the prevalent regulatory structure with a view to 
developing the Indian commodities market.

4. 

Engagement Between SEBI and US-SEC

 
With  a  view  to  understanding  and  imbibing 
the best practices of the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission  (SEC)  in  examining  mutual  funds,  a 
SEBI team comprising of three officials participated 
in an onsite examination of mutual funds /investment 
advisers jointly with the US-SEC.

 
A  telephonic  conference  call  was  arranged 
between  US-SEC  and  SEBI  officials  where  the 
SEC  officials  provided  valuable  perspectives  on 
algorithmic trading, co-location and high frequency 
trading to SEBI.

made  by  it  was  not  hit  by  Regulation  22  (7)  of 
the  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and 
Takeovers)  Regulations,  1997  (SAST  Regulations 
1997), as in his case there was no MoU and only a share 
purchase agreement (SPA) was executed. Therefore, 
in  terms  of  Regulation  2(o)  of  SAST  Regulations, 
1997, in such a case, the ‘offer period’ will commence 
from the date of public announcement as there was 
no MoU. SEBI was of the view that in the absence 
of any MoU, the offer period will commence from 
the date of the SPA, as the SPA is a crystallized form 
of a MoU. The SAT allowed the appeal filed by the 
acquirers.  SEBI  challenged  SAT’s  order  before  the 
Supreme  Court  which  allowed  the  appeal  while 
agreeing with SEBI’s contention.

 SEBI  versus  Opee  Stock-Link  Limited  and 
Another

 
The cases involved SEBI’s investigation in the 
manipulations committed in the IPOs of companies 
by  using  benami/fictitious  accounts  to  corner  the 
shares  meant  for  retail  investors  by  the  financer. 
SEBI directed such entities to disgorge the amount 
of  unlawful  gain  with  interest  and  also  debarred 
such  entities  from  accessing  the  securities  market. 
Penalties  were  also  imposed  on  such  entities.  In 
appeal, SAT held that the alleged fictitious/benami 
accounts were genuine persons and hence the first 
link  was  broken.  The  appellants  traded  in  shares 
in  the  secondary  market  and  charges  against  such 
entities had not been established and thus allowed 
the appeal. In an appeal filed by SEBI, the Supreme 
Court appreciated the fact finding done by SEBI and 
held  that  the  transactions  under  reference  were  a 
scam and the demat account holders were benami/ 
fictitious and the shares were purchased on behalf 
of someone who had financed these demat account 
holders. The Supreme Court also observed that SAT 
had not concluded that SEBI’s findings were incorrect 
and it was open to SAT to re-appreciate the evidence. 
The judgment, inter-alia, also held that the Securities

Pramod Jain versus SEBI

 The  issues  of  law  before  the  Supreme  Court 
were:

	To  what  extent  is  the  timeline  laid  down 
under  the  Takeover  Regulations  required  to 
be adhered to and the effect of SEBI’s delay in 
the present case?

	To what extent unilateral action of the target 
company in dealing with the property of the 
company after a hostile public offer is made 
furnish a cause of action for the acquirers to 
withdraw  the  public  offer  and  whether  in 
the present case a decision not permitting the 
withdrawal of public offer was justified?

 
With respect to the first question, after taking 
into  consideration  its  earlier  decision  in  Nirma 
Industries  Limited  versus  SEBI  case  the  Supreme 
Court  held  that  though  SEBI  was  not  justified  in 
causing  delay  in  giving  its  comments  on  a  public 
offer,  this  by  itself  was  not  enough  to  justify 
withdrawal from the public offer so long as the case 
did  not  fall  under  Regulation  27  of  the  Takeover 
Regulations, 1997. On the issue of unilateral actions 
of the target company dealing with its property, the 
Court  observed  that  in  terms  of  the  scheme  of  the 
Takeover  Regulations,  1997  there  was  no  absolute 
bar for the target company to take a decision about 
its  assets,  subject  to  compliance  with  statutory 
procedures  and  subject  to  the  decision  being 
otherwise  valid.  There  was  no  doubt  that  against 
any  mala  fide,  illegal  or  unjustified  decision  of 
the  target  company,  remedies  at  the  appropriate 
fora  were  available  to  the  aggrieved  parties.  Thus, 
there was no justification for automatic withdrawal 

from the public offer without clear prejudice to the 
acquirers  to  the  extent  of  rendering  the  carrying 
out of the public offer impossible. In the facts of the 
present case, it did not find any ground to interfere 
with SEBI’s concurrent finding and SAT’s request for 
withdrawal from the public offer was not justified. 
Accordingly,  the  appeals  filed  by  the  acquirers  for 
withdrawing the open offer were dismissed by the 
Court vide its order dated November 07, 2016.

d. 

SEBI versus NSDL, NSDL versus SEBI

 
The  issue  of  law  before  the  Supreme  Court 
was  whether  a  circular  issued  by  SEBI  could  be 
challenged  in  an  appeal  before  SAT  under  Section 
15T of the  SEBI Act. The Supreme Court  held that 
Section  15T  envisaged  appeals  only  against  quasi-
judicial orders passed by SEBI. The Court, thereafter, 
examined  the  various  provisions  of  the  SEBI  Act, 
1992  to  segregate  SEBI’s  administrative,  legislative 
and  quasi-judicial  functions  under  the  Act.  The 
Court held that the functions/powers under Sections 
11(4), 11B, 11D, 12(3) and 15I are quasi-judicial, those 
under  Section  11(1)  are  administrative  and  those 
under Section 30 are legislative. The Court held that 
its orders referable to Sections 11(4), 11B, 11D, 12(3) 
and 15-I of the Act, being quasi-judicial orders, and 
quasi-judicial  orders  made  under  the  Rules  and 
Regulations are the subject matter of appeal under 
Section 15T. Administrative orders such as circulars 
issued under Section 11(1) of the Act are outside the 
appellate jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

Bonanza Biotech Limited versus SEBI proceeded to 
answer the question whether the AO under Section 
15A  of  the  SEBI Act,  1992  is  authorized  to  impose 
penalty  on  the  ground  that  the  documents  which 
had been asked and had been furnished were false 
or whether power of the AO to impose penalty was 
limited and could be exercised only in the event of 
failure to furnish documents. The Court quoted para 
31  of  the  AO  order  dated  January  20,  2006  which 
states that the appellants has already furnished the 
materials which are available on record. By referring 
to said para, the Court held that since the materials 
had already been furnished, in its opinion the said 
Section (15A) was not attracted on the given facts.

SEBI  had  conducted  an  investigation  into 
the affairs of Bank of Rajasthan Limited (BoR). The 
investigation  revealed  that  the  promoters  of  BoR 
and  certain  companies  connected  to  one  of  the 
promoters  of  BoR  in  their  continuous  disclosures 
had announced that their stake in BoR had reduced. 
However, the shareholdings of such promoters had 
actually increased with the active collusion of front 
entities  who  were  alleged  to  be  persons  acting  in 
concert (PACs).

Adjudication  proceedings  were 

 
initiated 
wherein  the AO  vide  its  order  dated  February  14,

Securities  Markets)  Regulations,  2003  and  SEBI

Regulations  and  also  stated  that  the  schemes  were 
closed and substantial amounts had been refunded 
to the investors and granted two years’ time to pay 
the balance amount (approx. ` 786 crore) refundable

The present appeal was filed by SEBI against

own findings SAT had allowed RTSCL to continue 
receiving  EMIs  from  the  existing/willing  members 
as per the existing contract for availing the facility

and  to  ensure  that  the  noticees  do  not  continue 
with  the  money  mobilization  activities  through  its 
plans  /  schemes.  SEBI  was  further  directed  to 
conduct an investigation into the operations of the 
Company, in order to form a final view as to whether 
the activity of the Company is in the nature of CIS as 
prima facie observed in the interim order.

 
Citrus challenged the SEBI order before SAT. 
SAT prima facie upheld SEBI’s view that Citrus was 
running a CIS scheme. However, SAT set aside SEBI’s 
direction and directed Citrus to make an application 
for registration with SEBI and directed SEBI to grant a 
provisional certificate of registration and eventually 
on receipt of the final investigation report, if found 
appropriate,  to  grant  final  registration  so  that  the 
scheme  being  operated  was  henceforth  regulated. 
SAT  further  allowed  Citrus  to  continue  to  receive 
the  subscription  amount  from  the  existing  CIS  till 
the  date  of  grant  of  provisional  registration.  SEBI 
challenged SAT’s order before the Supreme Court.

HIGH COURTS

 SEBI  versus 
(India) Limited (ITL) and Others

Information  Technologies 

 
SEBI received a complaint from M/s Industrial 
Finance Corporation of India Limited (IFCI) that in 
spite of repeated requests Information Technologies 
(India)  Limited  (ITL)  had  not  transferred  the  2.27 
million shares of face value of ` 5 each, in favour of 
IFCI. SEBI sought information from ITL, which failed 
to  respond.  Finally,  SEBI  asked  IFCI  for  necessary 
information.  IFCI  provided  the  information  on 
August 20, 2004.

 
Based  on  the  information  provided  by  IFCI, 
SEBI filed a complaint under Sections 113 and 621 of 
the Companies Act, 1956 against the respondent, ITL 
and  its  directors,  along  with  an  application  under 
Section 473 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) 
seeking condonation for the delay, before the court 
of the Additional Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM), 
Tis Hazari Court, New Delhi.

 
ACMM  dismissed  the  condonation  of  delay 
application.  Consequently,  the  SEBI’s  complaint 
also got dismissed being barred by limitation. SEBI 
preferred a revision being a criminal revision against 
the  said  ACMM  order  of  June  04,  2008  before  the 
Court of the Additional Session Judge (ASJ), Delhi. 
This was dismissed by ASJ vide order dated January 
18, 2011. ASJ noted that criminal action could have 
been initiated even by IFCI as per the provisions of 
Section 621 of the Companies Act.

 
Subsequently,  SEBI  filed  the  present  case 
assailing  the ASJ  order  under  Section  473  of  CrPC 
before the Delhi High Court. SEBI mainly contended 
two  points  relying  on  various 
in 
support;  firstly  that  sufficient  cause  was  shown  in 
the  application  seeking  condonation  of  delay  and 
secondly that the offence being continuous in nature, 
there  was  no  delay  in  filing  the  complaint  and  it 
ought to have been entertained on merit.

judgments 

The Delhi High Court concluded that the date 
 
of knowledge of the offence to SEBI which fell in the 
category of a ‘person aggrieved by the offence’ could 
be  attributed  only  to  when  the  complete  record 
were given by IFCI, that is, on August 25, 2004. The 
complaint was filed by SEBI on September 30, 2004. 
Thus  there  was  no  delay  in  filing  the  complaint. 
Accordingly, the impugned order was set aside and 
ACMM was directed to proceed with the complaint 
as per law.

(SAT)

 J.C.  Mansukhani  versus  SEBI,  and  Man

Appellants 

in 

these 

 
two  appeals  were 
aggrieved  by  a  common  order  passed  by  the 
Adjudicating  Officer  (AO)  dated  March  28,  2014 
imposing a penalty of ` 25 lakh jointly and severally 
on the appellants under Section 15-HB of the SEBI 
Act  for  violation  of  certain  provisions  of  SEBI 
(Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  1992. 
The AO  found  that  the  company  and  its  board  of 
directors had delayed disseminating price sensitive 
information  relating 
two 
substantive  orders  received  by  the  company  from 
two Iranian companies.

to  bagging/obtaining 

 
SAT  held  that  since  the  value  of  the  two 
contracts in question constituted nearly 65 per cent 
of the total order book of the company during the 
year, it was abundantly clear that entering into such 
contracts  constituted  price  sensitive  information 
which ought to have been disclosed under Scheduled 
II of Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations. Apart 
from  this,  in  the  past  the  company  had  conceded 
before SEBI that bagging orders worth about ` 1,200 
crore in that year was price sensitive information. In 
the  present  case,  the  contracts  bagged  were  to  the 
tune of ` 1,340 crore. Therefore, in the present case, it 
was not open to the appellants to change their stand 
and argue to the contrary.

 
SAT further held that all the major contracts 
became binding and effective on the date of signing 
of the contract and had to be disclosed without any 
delay. As and when major changes to the contracts, if 
any, were effected, these also had to be disclosed.

b.  MFL India Limited

 

The  appellant  was  aggrieved  by  the  order 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

passed  by  the  Adjudicating  Officer  (AO)  on 
September 30, 2014. By the said order a penalty of  
` 4 lakh was imposed on the appellant under Section 
15C  of  the  SEBI  Act  for  its  failure  to  obtain  the 
SCORES  authentication  within  the  stipulated  time 
in  spite  of  the  circular  issued  by  SEBI  on  June  03, 
2011, August 13, 2012 and April 17, 2013 and failure 
to respond to the complaints filed by the investors 
within reasonable time.

 
SAT  held  that  in  spite  of  the  SEBI  circular 
dated April 17, 2013, instead of obtaining SCORES 
authentication within 30 days, the appellant applied 
for  SCORES  authentication  on  the  last  day  for 
obtaining  the  authentication  set  out  in  the  circular 
dated April 17, 2013. In these circumstances, the AO’s 
decision that the appellant failed to obtain SCORES 
authentication within the stipulated time could not 
be faulted with.

SAT  held  that  Section  15C  of  the  SEBI  Act 
 
provides that if any listed company fails to comply 
with  the  directions  issued  by  the  Board  within 
the  stipulated  time  and  fails  to  redress  investor 
grievances  within  the  time  specified  by  the  Board, 
then  such  a  company  is  liable  to  a  penalty  which 
will not be less than ` 1 lakh but which may extend 
to ` 1 lakh for each day during which such failure 
continued  subject  to  a  maximum  of  `  1  crore.  In 
the  present  case,  investor  grievances  mentioned  in 
the  show  cause  notice  dated  March  26,  2014  were 
redressed by the appellant belatedly on September 
26, 2014. Similarly, six investor grievances noticed by 
the  appellant  on  obtaining  SCORES  authentication 
on  September  26/29,  2014  were  redressed  by  the 
appellant belatedly on November 20, 2014. In these 
circumstances,  no  fault  could  be  found  with  the 
quantum of penalty imposed against the appellant.

 Mrs  Chandra  Mukherji,  Shelter 
Infra 
Projects  Private  Limited,  Hasmukh  Parekh 
and  Others,  Shanti  Ranjan  Paul  and  
Mr Sisir Kumar Saha and Others

 
These  appeals  raise  the  issue  of  trigger  date 
of  Unpublished  Price  Sensitive  Information  (UPSI) 
and whether the company failed to keep the trading 
window of its scrip closed during the period when 
UPSI was in force and whether this enabled some of 
the  promoters/directors  and  some  other  entities  to 
share the UPSI with other entities and/or trade in the 
shares of Shelter Infra Projects Limited (Shelter Infra) 
thereby  violating  relevant  provisions  of  securities 
laws.

 
The Hon’ble SAT held that it was established 
beyond doubt that UPSI came into existence at least 
on June 19, 2009. All the directors and their relatives 
were  covered  under  the  definition  of  ‘insider.’  The 
Parekh group having business dealings and partners 
in  business concerns with  an  insider were  covered 
under the definition of ‘connected persons.’ Passing 
on the information needed to be judged in this context 
and in the instant context it was not disputed that the 
Parekh group started trading from June 22, 2009 after 
UPSI  came  into  existence.  Thus,  the  company,  its 
directors and their  relatives and connected entities 
were guilty of violating the provisions of securities 
laws and thus were liable for action under the SEBI 
Act and/or SCRA.

d. 

Khandwala Securities Limited

 
The appellant was aggrieved by SEBI’s Whole 
Time Member’s (WTM), order dated May 13, 2015. 
By  the  said  order  the  certificate  of  registration  of 
the  appellant  as  a  stock  broker  at  NSE  had  been 
suspended  for  one  month  for  violating  certain 
provisions  of  the  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent 
and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  relating  to  Securities 
Market)  Regulations,  1995  (PFUTP  Regulations 

1995) read with SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and 
Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) 
Regulations,  2003  (PFUTP  Regulations  2003)  and 
certain clauses relating to the Code of Conduct under 
SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 
1992 (Stock Brokers Regulations).

 
SAT  held  that  a  large  number  of  cross  deals 
executed through the appellants by its clients could 
not  be  normal  trades  of  buying  and  selling  in  the 
securities  market  as  a  broker,  and  the  argument 
that the appellant only placed orders in the trading 
system  and  obtained  the  brokerage  could  not  be 
accepted.  Data  given  clearly  indicated  that  orders 
were  placed  at  prices  far  away  from  prevailing 
market prices and that too in many instances. While 
the order price may be within the circuit filter range, 
the intention behind placing such orders at far away 
prices was not normal. Similarly, it was an admitted 
fact that the appellant was aware of the impending 
UTI order as recorded by SEBI’s investigating officer.

 
In the said circumstances, SAT held that even 
if some of the orders placed by the clients did not 
fructify because they were at far away prices, the very 
fact that the orders were placed at far away prices 
was sufficient to give a false picture to the investors 
in the scrip. Therefore, the argument of the appellant 
that non-fructified orders did not impact the market 
and as long as the orders were within the range of 
the circuit filters there was no abnormality in placing 
the orders could not be accepted. Where the orders 
were found to have been placed at far away prices 
to manipulate the market, then it would amount to 
violating PFUTP Regulations. In the instant case, the 
inference  drawn  by  SEBI’s  WTM  that  placing  high 
quantity orders repeatedly at prices far away from 
the  market  prices  constituted  violation  of  PFUTP 
Regulations  could  not  be  faulted.  This  inference 
was  further  fortified  by  the  fact  that  there  was 
synchronized trading of large quantities.

Tijaria Polypipes Limited and Others

f. 

 
Appellants  were  aggrieved  by  WTM’s 
impugned order dated June 20, 2014 whereby they 
had  been  restrained  from  dealing  in  the  securities 
market  in  any  manner  for  a  period  of  7  years  for 
various  violations  under  the  SEBI  Act,  PFUTP 
Regulations  2003  and  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.

 
SAT held that since IPO proceeds were used to 
refund inter-corporate deposits (ICDs), funds raised 
through  ICDs  were  in  the  nature  of  bridge  loans 
and hence as per ICDR provisions all bridge loans 
also must be disclosed. This fact should have been 
disclosed  through  the  prospectus  or  immediately 
after  the  board  meeting  on  September  10,  2011. 
The  prima  facie  reading  of  the  ICDR  Regulations 
necessitates disclosures of funds raised prior to the 
board meeting for providing the full and balanced 
financial position of the company to enable investors 
to take informed decisions.

 
SAT  further  held  that  information  relating 
to  an  amount  to  the  tune  of  25  per  cent  of  the 
IPO  proceeds  was  not  just  a  material  one  it  was 
substantively  material  for  the  market  to  correctly 
evaluate the advantages and risks of an IPO. Hence, 
the contention of the appellants that since money was 
used for normal business and the information did not 
pose any risk to the investors did not have any merit 
and was therefore rejected. Since the IPO proceeds 
were used to refund the ICDs, SEBI’s argument that 
they  were  in  the  form  of  a  bridge  loan  also  could 
not be faulted. So was the requirement of disclosing 
information  related  to  past  ICDs  which  should  all 
have been disclosed given the statutory requirements 
of a disclosure based regime in the securities market. 
As such all charges in the impugned order relating 
to information disclosure or limited disclosure were 
borne out of facts and could not be faulted.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

 Mr  Sandeep  Baid,  Mr  Sunder  Lal  Dugar, 
Mahendra  Pratap  Singh  and  Mr  Sachin 
Shridhar

The  appellants  were  aggrieved  by 

 
the 
impugned order dated August 06, 2014 whereby the 
appellants  were  held  liable  to  pay  penalty  jointly 
and  severally  under  Sections  15HA  and  15HB  of 
the  SEBI  Act  aggregating  to  three  crore  rupees  for 
violating  the  provisions  contained  in  the  SEBI Act 
and the Regulations made thereunder. Additionally 
a  penalty  of  five  lakh  rupees  was  imposed  on  Mr 
Sandeep  Baid  under  Section  23H  of  SCRA  for  not 
complying with Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement 
read with Section 21 of SCRA.

 
SAT  held  that  when  the  Listing  Agreement 
specifically  provides  that  the  Chairman  of  the 
Audit Committee will be an Independent Director, 
the  Whole  Time  Director  could  not  have  chaired 
the Audit Committee Meeting held on October 07, 
2011 especially when an Independent Director was 
available on that day to chair the Audit Committee. 
There  was  no  basis  for  the  alleged  bonafide  belief 
entertained by the Whole Time Director and therefore 
chairing  the Audit  Committee  by  the  Whole  Time 
Director  on  October  07,  2011  was  in  violation  of 
Clause  49  of  the  Listing  Agreement.  Although  the 
penalty imposable for such a violation under Section 
23H of the SCRA could extend up to ` 1 crore, the 
AO after considering all mitigating factors deemed 
it fit to impose a penalty of ` 5 lakh which cannot be 
said to be unreasonable or excessive.

 
SAT  further  held  that  utilizing  the  IPO 
proceeds  for  a  purpose  other  than  the  purpose 
specified  in  the  IPO  being  material  information 
ought to have been disclosed as contemplated under 
the ICDR Regulations. Failure to do so, constituted 
violations  of  ICDR  Regulations.  It  was  also  held 
that  investing  surplus  funds  in  high  quality  liquid 
instruments  could  not  be  equated  with  giving  a 

SEBI Annual Report

loan to a group company. In the present case, RDB 
had utilized the IPO proceeds to give a loan to RDB 
Realty and Infrastructure Limited (RDBRIL) instead 
of investing the IPO proceeds in high quality interest 
bearing liquid instruments by obtaining security of 
valuable assets and postdated cheques.

 
Thus, it was held that in the facts of the present 
case,  the  resolution  passed  on  September  12,  2011 
to  give  a  loan  up  to  `  50  crore  to  RDBRIL  being  a 
resolution related to the utilization of IPO proceeds 
was material information which ought to have been 
disclosed. Apart from this, when the statement was 
made in the offer document that the IPO proceeds 
would  be  invested  in  high  quality  interest  bearing 
liquid  instruments,  utilizing  the  IPO  proceeds  by 
giving a loan to RDBRIL amounted to mis-utilizing 
the IPO funds in violation of ICDR Regulations.

 
The  fact  that  apart  from  IPO  proceeds,  RDB 
did  not  have  any  other  surplus  funds  to  give  as  a 
loan  to  RDBRIL  and  the  fact  that  immediately  on 
receiving IPO proceeds amounting to ` 34.25 crore, 
RDB  transferred  IPO  proceeds  to  the  extent  of  
` 31.60 crore to RDBRIL, even before the RDB board 
approved  giving  such  a  loan  and  even  before  the 
RDB board approved the draft loan agreement, left 
no manner of doubt that RDB and its directors had 
adopted  manipulative  and  deceptive  devices  to 
suppress material facts from the investors which was 
a gross violation of Section 12A of the SEBI Act and 
Regulations 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations.

 
In these circumstances, the AO’s decision that 
RDB’s conduct and that of its directors (appellants) in 
suppressing material information from the investors 
by  resorting  to  manipulative  and  deceitful  devices 
was in violation of Regulations 3 and 4 of the PFUTP 
Regulations could not be faulted.

Dushyant N. Dalal and Others versus SEBI

The  appellants  challenged  various  orders 

of  the  SEBI  Recovery  Officer  involving  a  common 
question of law before SAT. The common question of 
law raised in all these appeals was whether Section 
28A  inserted  to  the  SEBI Act  with  effect  from  July 
18, 2013 imposed interest liability on a person who 
failed to pay  the amounts specified in Section 28A 
within the stipulated time and if so, whether Section 
28A can be invoked for demanding interest on the 
amounts due to SEBI pursuant to the orders passed 
prior to July 18, 2013.

 

•	

•	

•	

•	

In this regard, SAT held:

	Object of inserting Section 28A to the SEBI Act, 
was to provide a mechanism for collection and 
recovery of the amounts due to SEBI. Instead 
of  providing  an  independent  mechanism, 
the  legislature  incorporated  the  provisions 
contained  in  the  Income  Tax  Act  relating  to 
‘Collection and Recovery’ in Section 28A.

	As a result of incorporating Section 220 of the 
Income Tax Act in Section 28A the obligation 
to  pay  interest  for  delayed  payments  of 
the  amount  due  to  SEBI  became  statutorily 
introduced  from  the  date  on  which  Section 
28A came into force. Since the legislature had 
inserted Section 28A with effect from July 18, 
2013, it was apparent that the interest liability 
under  Section  28A  would  be  operative  from 
July 18, 2013.

	Any  substantive  provision  inserted  for  the 
first  time  which  imposes  any  burden  or 
liability would be prospective in nature unless 
otherwise  provided  either  expressly  or  by 
necessary implication. In the present case, the 
interest  obligation  under  Section  28A  would 
commence from July 18, 2013.

	The  interest  obligation  contained  in  Section 
28A  read  with  Section  220  would  come  into 
operations from July 18, 2013.

186

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

•	

	It  was  clear  that  the  interest  liability  for 
recovery of the amounts specified in Section 
28A would arise only if the amounts were not 
paid within 30 days from July 18, 2013 and not 
prior thereto.

 
In  view  of  this,  the  RO  order  against  the 
appellant  was  upheld  and  the  remaining  appeals 
were remanded to the RO for fresh computation of 
interest.

 Sanjay Dalmia and Others versus SEBI, and 
Mrs Chanchal Kumar and Others

The  appellants  were  aggrieved  by 

 
the 
AO’s  order  dated  February  14,  2014  imposing  a 
penalty  of  `  1  crore  under  Section  15HB  of  the 
SEBI  Act  for  violating  Regulation  23(1)  of  the 
Takeover Regulations, 1997. On November 12, 2009,  
Mr  Pramod  Jain  and  two  others  made  a  public 
announcement  under  the  Takeover  Regulations, 
1997  disclosing  their  intention  to  acquire  44,02,201 
equity shares (25 per cent) of the company Golden 
Tobacco Limited (the company) at a price of  ` 101 
per share. While the open offer was still in operation, 
a MoU was entered into by the company with Sheth 
Developers  and  Suraksha  Realty  Limited  for  joint 
development of a property subject to the approval of 
the shareholders as contemplated under Regulation 
23(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997.

 
SAT held that Regulation 23(1) of the Takeover 
Regulations,  1997  expressly  provided  that  during 
the  public  offer  period  without  obtaining  prior 
approval  of  the  general  body  of  shareholders, 
the  BoD  of  a  company  will  neither  sell,  transfer, 
encumber or otherwise dispose of the assets of the 
company nor the BoD of the company will enter into 
any  agreement  for  sale,  transfer,  encumbrance  or 
disposal of the assets of the company.

 
It was further held that holding the expression 
‘agreement’ used in Regulation 23 will not apply to an 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

‘MoU’ and will amount to defeating the object with 
which Regulation 23 had been framed. Therefore, in 
the  facts  of  present  case,  entering  into  an  MoU  on 
December 26, 2009 for joint development of property 
subject  to  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  was  in 
gross  violation  of  Regulation  23  of  the  Takeover 
Regulations, 1997. Accordingly, the AO’s order was 
upheld.

i. 

 Pan  Asia  Advisors  Limited  and  Mr  Arun 
Panchariya (AP) versus SEBI

 
The  appellants  challenged  the  WTM’s  order 
dated  June  20,  2013  debarring  the  appellants  from 
the securities market for a period of 10 years.

By a majority decision of SAT, the appeal was 
 
allowed  holding  that  SEBI  had  no  jurisdiction  to 
initiate proceedings against the appellants in relation 
to the role played by them as lead managers to the 
global depository receipts (GDRs) issued by several 
Indian companies outside India.

On an appeal filed by SEBI, the Supreme Court 
 
vide  order  dated  July  06,  2015  to  set  aside  SAT’s 
majority decision and held that SEBI had jurisdiction 
in  such  cases  to  pass  a  debarment  order  if  the 
allegations levelled against the appellants fell within 
the scope of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI 
Act and PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and to determine 
the aforesaid question the matter was remanded to 
SAT.

SAT vide order dated October 25, 2016, inter-
 
alia, held that it was absolutely clear that if a person 
by  his  act  either  directly  or  indirectly  caused  the 
investors in the securities market in India to believe 
in  something  which  was  not  true  and  thereby 
induced investors in India to deal in securities, then 
that  person  was  said  to  have  committed  fraud  on 
the  investors  in  India.  In  such  a  case,  action  could 
be taken under the PFUTP Regulations against the 
person committing the fraud, irrespective of the fact 

SEBI Annual Report

2016-17

187

that  any  investor  had  actually  become  a  victim  of 
such fraud or not. In other words, under the PFUTP 
Regulations,  SEBI  was  empowered  to  take  action 
against  any  person  if  his  act  constituted  fraud  on 
the  securities  market  even  though  no  investor  had 
actually  become  a  victim  of  such  a  fraud.  In  fact, 
the  object  of  framing  the  PFUTP  Regulations  was 
to prevent fraud being committed on the investors 
dealing  in  the  securities  market  and  not  to  take 
action  only  after  the  investors  had  become  victims 
of such a fraud. Therefore, in the facts of the present 
case, if fraud was committed by the appellants on the 
investors in India, then without making the investors 
a  party  to  the  proceedings,  SEBI  could  take  action 
against the appellants.

 
Similarly,  if  fraud  was  said  to  have  been 
committed  by  AP  on  the  investors  in  India  by 
subscribing to GDRs outside India by entering into 
a  loan  agreement/pledge  agreement  outside  India 
through the entities with which AP was connected, 
then,  even  if  the  GDRs  were  validly  issued  and 
even if the loan agreement/ pledge agreement were 
valid, proceedings could be initiated against AP for 
committing fraud on the investors in India without 
impleading  the  entities  who  had  issued  the  GDRs 
and  without  impleading  the  entities  who  were 
parties  to  the  loan  agreement/pledge  agreement. 
In  other  words,  whether  the  Loan  Agreement/ 
Pledge Agreement were validly entered into or not, 
proceedings could be initiated against AP if the very 
act  of  AP  in  subscribing  to  the  GDRs  through  his 

connected entities constituted fraud on investors in 
India. In such a case, the entities which issued the 
GDRs -- Overseas Depository Banks or the entities 
who  were  parties  to  the  loan  agreement/pledge 
agreement  were  not  required  to  be  impleaded  as 
parties  to  the  proceedings  initiated  against  AP 
for  committing  fraud  on  the  investors  in  India. 
Therefore,  the  argument  of  the  appellants  that 
without impleading the Overseas Depository Banks/ 
parties to the loan agreement and pledge agreement 
as  parties  to  the  proceedings  initiated  against  the 
appellants,  it  could  not  be  accepted  that  no  order 
could be passed against the appellants.

SAT further held that the appellants knew that 
 
if the investors in India came to know that the GDRs 
of  the  issuer  companies  have  not  been  subscribed 
by  foreign  investors  but  by  the  entities  controlled 
by the Managing Director (AP) of Pan Asia, then it 
would not generate an interest in the minds of the 
investors  in  India  to  subscribe  to  the  shares  of  the 
issuer  companies.  Therefore,  in  order  to  create  an 
artificial impression that global investors had shown 
keen interest in investing in the issuer companies by 
subscribing  to  the  GDRs,  appellants  by  a  dubious 
method introduced fictitious and non-existent initial 
subscribers to the GDRs of the issuer companies so 
as  to  mislead  the  investors  in  India  into  believing 
that  global  investors  had  shown  a  keen  interest  in 
investing in the GDRs of issuer companies. In these 
circumstances, SEBI’s order was upheld.

dated  February  15,  2013,  restrained  nine  entities 
from  accessing  the  securities  market  and  further 
prohibited  them  from  buying,  selling  or  dealing 
in  securities  in  any  manner  whatsoever  till  further 
directions.  Thereafter,  SEBI,  vide  order  dated 
December 06, 2013 directed to carry out a detailed 
investigation and revoked the directions issued vide 
the aforesaid interim order.

The 

that

seven 
suspected  entities,  Navinya  Multitrade  Private 
Limited  (Navinya),  Shreyans  Credit  and  Capital 
Private  Limited 
(Shreyans),  Aventis  Biofeeds 
Private  Limited  (Aventis),  Sunmate  Trade  Private 
Limited  (Sunmate),  Uni24  Technosolutions  Private 
Limited (Uni24), Vision Millennium Exports Private 
Limited  (Vision)  and  Moebius  Credit  and  Capital 
Private Limited (Moebius) had traded in Ruchi Soya 
Industries  Limited’s  shares  on  September  27,  2012 
during  03:00  pm  to  03:30  pm  and  influenced  the 
settlement price of the Ruchi Soya futures expiring 
on September 27, 2012. It was also observed that on 
account  of  the  manipulative  trading  activities,  the 
suspected entities who were holding long positions 
in  Ruchi  Soya  futures  expiring  on  September  27, 
2012 had reduced their square-off losses.

Accordingly,  as  an 

 
interim  measure,  an  
ad-interim ex-parte order under Sections 11(1), 11(4)
(d)  and  11B  of  SEBI Act,  1992  was  passed  on  June 
07,  2016  against  the  seven  entities  impounding 
unlawful gains of  ` 8.30 crore (alleged gains along 
with interest).

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

 Interim Order in the Matter of Unregistered 
Investment  Advisory  Activities,  in  Respect 
of  Mansoor  Rafiq  Khanda,  Firoz  Rafiq 
Khanda and Their Proprietary Concerns

 
SEBI  received  numerous  complaints  against 
Mr  Mansoor  Rafiq  Khanda  and  Mr  Firoz  Rafiq 
Khanda  and  their  proprietorship  concerns  stating 
inter-alia  that  they  were  offering  trading  tips 
through 
‘WhatsApp’  messages/SMSs  sent  from 
various mobile numbers and also on the website –  
www.fullonoption.com. On the basis of preliminary 
examination,  SEBI  prima  facie  observed  that  these 
entities  had  acted  as  unregistered 
investment 
advisors  and  passed  an  interim  order  on  June 
05,  2014  and 
issued  certain  directions  which 
were  subsequently  confirmed  vide  order  dated  
September 05, 2014.

 
SEBI  conducted  further  investigations  in  the 
matter. The investigations revealed that the aforesaid 
entities were engaged in activities of giving trading 
tips, stock specific recommendations, etc. to investors 
on payment of fees without obtaining the certificate 
of  registration  from  SEBI  to  act  as  investment 
advisors. Further, the entities had received payments 
to the tune of ` 3,83,80,477 from general investors in 
the  bank  accounts  of  the  proprietorship  concerns 
as  subscription  fee  from  investors  for  the  services 
provided which was in the nature of ill-gotten gains.

Accordingly,  as  an 

 
interim  measure,  an  
ad-interim ex-parte order under Sections 11(1), 11(4)(d) 
and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 was passed on May 
12, 2016 against the aforesaid two entities and their 
12 proprietary concerns impounding unlawful gains 
of ` 5.04 crore (alleged gains along with interest).

 Interim  Order  in  the  Matter  of  Trading  by 
Certain  Entities  in  Exelon  Infrastructure 
Limited’s Scrip

 
SEBI  conducted  an  investigation  into  Exelon 
Infrastructure  Limited’s  scrip  (the  company)  for 
the  period  December  08,  2010  to  January  20,  2012. 
During  investigations,  it  was  observed  that  the 
company,  along  with  its  promoter,  directors  and 
other  connected  entities,  by  acting  together  as  a 
group had formulated a scheme to make illegal gains 
and defraud genuine investors, as explained:

 

 

 

a. 

b. 

c. 

company 

submitted  positive 
 The 
corporate  announcements, 
including 
split of shares, to BSE during February 
10, 2011 to March 07, 2011 as a result of 
which the price of the scrip increased by 
85.28 per cent in 26 trading days during 
the period of announcement.

 In  the  meanwhile,  the  promoter  / 
director connected entities manipulated 
the  price  of  the  scrip  by  contributing 
substantially  to  the  new  high  price 
(NHP)  during  pre-stock  split  period. 
Further, these entities also manipulated 
the price after the stock split.

 During this period, when the company 
along  with  its  directors  and  other 
connected  entities  were  manipulating 
the  price  of  the  scrip  upwards,  the 
promoter  of  the  company  (Cementex 
India  Private  Limited),  two  entities 
(Srinivasa  Rao  Marupudi  and  Srinivas 
Yadav Sher) who were the directors of 
the  company  during  the  investigation 
period and 44 other promoter/director 
connected  entities,  took  advantage  of 
such manipulation of price of the scrip 
and made illegal profits of ` 7.86 crore 
by net selling at an increased price.

Accordingly,  as  an 

 
interim  measure,  an  
ad-interim ex-parte order under Sections 11(1), 11(4)
(d) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 was passed on June 
07,  2016  against  52  entities  impounding  unlawful 
gains  of  `  12.54  crore  (alleged  gains  along  with 
interest).

d. 

 Interim  Order  in  the  Matter  of  Beejay 
Investment & Financial Consultants Private 
Limited and Others

 
SEBI  received  a  Suspicious  Transaction 
Report dated December 21, 2012 from the Financial 
Intelligence  Unit  generated  by  ICICI  Bank  with 
respect to Sudhir Jain (Sudhir), Beejay Investment & 
Financial Consultants Private Limited (Beejay) and 
Eversight  Tradecomm  Private  Limited  (Eversight) 
due to large value transactions in their accounts and 
also due to the fact that an interim order dated June 
04,  2009  was  passed  against  the  group  restraining 
it  from  accessing  the  market  directly  or  indirectly. 
SEBI conducted an investigation into the matter of 
violation  of  SEBI  directions  by  Sudhir,  Beejay  and 
Eversight to ascertain whether the entities violated 
SEBI’s  prohibitory  orders  by  indirectly  dealing  in 
the securities market during September 01, 2011 to 
September 30, 2012 (investigation period).

The  investigation  alleged  that  the  barred 
 
entities  had  traded  indirectly  in  the  securities 
market by transferring funds, directly/indirectly, to 
connected  entities  during  the  investigation  period 
and made unlawful gains in the process.

Accordingly,  as  an 

 
interim  measure,  an  
ad-interim ex-parte order under Sections 11(1), 11(4)
(d) & 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 was passed on June 16, 
2016  against  18  entities  for  impounding  unlawful 
gains of approximately ` 27.44 crore (alleged gains 
along  with  interest).  The  directions  issued  vide

 Interim  Order/Confirmatory  Order  in  the 
Matter of Castor Seed Contracts

 
After  an  examination  SEBI  passed  an  
ex-parte ad-interim order restraining two entities in 
the matter of castor seed contracts on May 24, 2016 
restraining them from buying, selling or dealing in 
the securities market, either directly or indirectly, in 
any manner whatsoever, till further directions.

 
It  was  found  that  the  connected  entities 
(connection  based  on  fund  transfers),  acting  in 
concert  under  a  premeditated  plan,  acquired  a 
dominant  market  share  in  Castor  Seed  Contracts 
traded at NCDEX. Further, it was also observed that 
on account of the clubbed position held by connected 
entities  in  Castor  Seed  Contracts  across  different 
expiries there were several instances of position limit 
violations.

 
Therefore,  in  order  to  protect  the  interests 
of  the  investors  and  the  integrity  of  the  securities 
market, SEBI passed an ad-interim ex-parte order on 
May 24, 2016 restraining two entities from buying, 
selling  or  dealing  in  the  securities  market,  either 
directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, till 
further  directions.  Further,  with  respect  to  interim 
orders dated March 02, 2016 and May 24, 2016 in the

Further, BSE was also directed to withhold the pay-
out of the funds for the trades executed on July 27, 
2015  and  to  keep  the  same  in  an  interest-bearing 
escrow account till further directions. A preliminary 
examination revealed the deployment of fraudulent 
bulk  SMSes  for  manipulating  and  offloading  the 
shares of Dhyana Finstock Limited by certain entities.

 Ad-Interim Ex-parte Order in the Matter of 
Supreme Tex Mart Limited (STML)

A  suspicious  trading  pattern  was  observed 
 
in the shares of Supreme Tex Mart Limited (STML) 
with linkages with bulk SMSes being sent to a large 
number of investors. The trade volumes of the STML 
scrip,  on  the  days  on  which  the  bulk  SMSes  were 
sent, were significantly higher than its average daily 
trading volume during the pre-SMS period. Further, 
on an examination of the trades of identified entity, the 
bulk  SMSes  sender,  vis-à-vis  the  recommendations 
by SMSes sent by him on STML, it was observed that 
entity traded contrary to the BUY recommendations 
sent by him through the bulk SMSes, thereby making 
profits on the shares bought at lower prices prior to 
sending the SMSes. Accordingly, based on the facts 
and  the  circumstances,  SEBI  passed  an  ad-interim 
ex-parte order on February 23, 2017, restraining the 
entity from buying, selling or dealing in securities, 
directly or indirectly, or in any manner whatsoever, 
till further notice.

1.  ABOUT SEBI

I. 

SEBI’S ESTABLISHMENT

The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 

(SEBI)  was  constituted  on  April  12,  1988 
as  an  interim  administrative  body  under 
the  overall  administrative  control  of  the  Ministry 
of  Finance  (MoF)  by  a  notification  published  in 
the  Gazette  of  India:  Extraordinary.  The  objective 
of  establishing  SEBI  was  investor  protection  and 
promotion  of  the  orderly  and  healthy  growth  of 
the securities market. SEBI was accorded statutory 
status on January 30, 1992 by an ordinance. It was 
formally established on April 12, 1992 in accordance 
with the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992.

Awareness  Week  was  also  sent  by  the  CVO  to  all 
employees.

VI.  With  a  view  to  bringing  about  transparency 
and accountability within SEBI, a guidance note was 
issued by the CVO to all the officials dealing with 
quasi-judicial  matters  and  all  Executive  Directors 
on  February  28,  2017  which  inter  alia  contains  the 
following:

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

 There  should  be  regular  monitoring  of  the 
cases after the interim orders have been passed 
and delays should be avoided.

 Quasi-judicial  authorities  should  endeavour 
to  pass  confirmatory  orders  within  a  period 
of three months, if applicable, and final orders 
within one year of the passing of the interim 
orders.

 As a principle, they may endeavour to complete 
older  cases  first.  However,  priority  may  be 
given to certain types of cases as indicated in 
the Guidance Note.

 Pendency  of  more  than  one  year  may  be 
reported to the Board along with chronology 
of  events  with  reasons  and  justifications  in 
each case.
