Chairman’s Statement

In a journey that was embarked 26 years ago 

with  the  overarching  objective  of   investor 
protection and the development and regula-
tion of  the securities markets in India, SEBI 
and the Indian capital markets have  grown from 
strength to strength with each passing year. With 
the  advent  of   SEBI,  the  Indian  markets  experi-
enced  a  sweeping  evolution  from  a  highly  con-
trolled  merit  based  regulatory  regime  to  a  mar-
ket oriented disclosures based regulatory regime. 
Over the years, SEBI has been introducing various 
measures for the betterment and advancement of  
the Indian securities market. 

In the course of  this remarkable journey, SEBI 
has  incessantly  strived  to  incorporate  and  adopt 
various  global  standards  and  international  best 
practices  within  its  regulatory  framework.  It 
has  also  stood  the  test  of   time  through  various 
domestic  as  well  as  global  crises  and  came  out 
stronger every time. This has resulted in enhanced 
efficiency,  integrity  and  transparency  in  the 
Indian securities market and has also catapulted 
it into the global league. In fact, in international 
circles today, the Indian securities market is often 
considered  as  one  of   the  most  developed  and 
highly respected market across the globe.

the 

The  year  2014-15  was  a  year  of   significant 
accomplishments  across  all 
functional 
areas  under  SEBI  and,  as  always,  the  mandate 
of   protection  of   interests  of   investors,  market 
development and regulation guided all our policy 
initiatives  during  the  year.  A  major  highlight 
during the year was the passing of  Securities Laws 
Amendment  Act,  2014,  endowing  SEBI  with 
enhanced  regulatory  powers  including  search 
and  seizure,  attachment  and  recovery,  power  to 
call  for  information  from  any  person,  powers  of  

disgorgement etc. A judicious, righteous and fair 
application of  these new powers by SEBI would be 
crucial for achieving our overall objectives.

One  of   the  major  thrust  areas  during  this 
year  was  corporate  governance  reforms  and 
the  alignment  of   these  requirements  with  the 
provisions of  the new Companies Act. Further, the 
derecognized/non-operational  stock  exchanges 
were facilitated with a clear and detailed regulatory 
framework to enable them to procure a hassle free 

One of  the major thrust areas during 
this year was corporate governance 
reforms and the alignment of  these 
requirements with the provisions 
of  the new Companies Act. 

and  efficient  exit.  Also,  as  part  of   our  ongoing 
focus on a robust risk management system, norms 
for Core SGF, Default Waterfall and Stress Testing 
as  also  a  well  documented  and  comprehensive 
risk  management  policy  at  depositories  was 
introduced. The index based market-wide circuit 
breaker mechanism was also strengthened.

the  FPI  regime 

During  the  year,  SEBI  also  notified  three 
new  regulations  viz.,  Research  Analysts,  REITs 
and  InvITs  to  bring  these  newer  categories  of  
participants  and  products  within  its  regulatory 
purview.  Also, 
that  was 
implemented  with  a  view  to  rationalise  and 
harmonize 
investment 
routes  has  definitely  made  the  Indian  markets 
an  attractive  investment  destination  through 
easier entry norms and operational frameworks. 
Additionally,  the  investment  avenues  for  FPIs 
have been expanded to exchange traded currency 
derivatives  and  non-convertible/  redeemable

companies.

The year was also unprecedented in terms of  
the  enforcement  actions  taken  by  SEBI  against 
numerous  unregulated  collective 
investment 
schemes sprouting across the length and breadth 
of   the  country  and  duping  numerous  investors. 
Severe deterrent actions and penalties have been 
imposed on erring individuals and entities through 
enforcement actions throughout the year. 

As  already  mentioned,  today  the  Indian 
securities  market  is  being  hailed  as  one  of   the 
best regulated markets in the world. This indeed 
is a matter of  great pride for us. But, at the same 
time, this also brings in a huge responsibility on 
our  shoulders  to  continuously  strive  to  improve 
the  Indian  markets  as  also  the  quality  of   our 
regulations.  Accordingly,  the  goals  for  2015-16 
have also been well laid out for us. 

We  plan 

to 

the 

strengthen 

risk-based 
supervision  framework  for  all  intermediaries, 
in  line  with  international  standards.  Given  the 
emerging  potential  of   new  age  startups  like 
technology, e-commerce etc,  in kick starting the 
faster pace of  growth of  Indian economy, SEBI  is 
proposing to carve out a regulatory framework for 
their    market  based  financing.  Also,  technology 
will  be  garnered  to  its  most  extensive  and 
intelligent  use  to  facilitate  and  further  ease  the 
investing process in the securities market through 

e-IPO,  Aadhaar  based  e-KYC  and  system  driven 
disclosures.  We  also  propose  to  significantly 
increase  our  investor  education  and  awareness 
efforts by tapping the increasing stature of  social 
media, through collaboration with other agencies 
and empanelment of  more Resource Persons. We 
also  plan  to  further  streamline  our  enforcement 
process  and  develop  capabilities  to  effectively 
utilize  the  additional  enforcement  powers  vested 
on SEBI.

futures  market  under 

Further,  the  recent  policy  announcement  of  
the Government of  India to bring the regulation 
of   commodity 
the 
jurisdiction of  SEBI presents to us another set of  
fresh and unique challenges. As the commodities 
markets operate in a different ecosystem, SEBI is 
conducting  thorough  analysis  and  due  diligence 
before  articulating  its  vision  for  the  commodity 
derivatives segment.

Thus,  our  agenda,  going  ahead,  is  definitely 
ambitious  and  challenging,  particularly  in  the 
context of  today’s dynamic market place. We are 
often  chasing  ‘moving  targets’  requiring  us  to 
constantly re-align our priorities and strategies to 
meet the changing systemic needs. Nevertheless, 
given our commitment, strengths and legacy, SEBI 
is all geared up to face newer challenges, evolve 
with the times and also to ensure that the Indian 
Capital Markets scale greater heights in the years 
to come.

reforms. 

Financial  year  2014-15  brought  new  optimism 

for  the  Indian  economy  on  the  back  of  
strong  policies,  controlled 
inflation,  decline 
in  oil  prices,  rise  in  domestic  demand  and  increased 
investments.  The 
International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF)  in  its  assessment  of   the  Indian  economy 
under  the  Article  IV  Consultation  Process  described 
the  Indian  economy  as  a  bright  spot  in  the  global 
landscape  for  becoming  one  of   the  fastest-growing 
big  emerging  market  economies  in  the  world.  To 
achieve  this,  however,  the  Indian  economy  needs 
to  revitalise  the  investment  cycle  and  accelerate 
structural 
stalled 
projects,  particularly  in  the  agriculture,  power  and 
transport sectors and recovery in the industrial sector 
on  higher  external  demand  are  expected  to  aid  this 
recovery.  The  prospect  of   recovery  in  the  service 
sector  in  2014-15,  led  by  higher  exports  as  well  as 
a  positive  influence  from  higher  industrial  growth, 
will help in taming inflation as well as in cushioning 
growth.  Nonetheless,  there  are  possible  risks  on  the 
horizon,  both  external  and  domestic.  High  inflation 
expectations  and  a  wide  fiscal  deficit  remain  key 
macroeconomic  challenges,  limiting  the  policy  space 
for adopting countercyclical policies. On the domestic 
front,  the  spillovers  from  below  normal  agricultural 
growth, 
the  massive 
requirements  of   skill  creation,  and  on  the  external

front,  weak  global  growth  and  potential  global 
financial  market  volatility  could  pose  challenges  to 
the growth scenario.

The  Ministry  of   Statistics  and  Programme 
Implementation (MOSPI), Government of  India (GoI), 
has  released  the  new  series  of   national  accounts 
revising  the  base  year  from  2004-05  to  2011-12 
for  estimating  national  income.  As  per  international 
practices,  industry-wise  estimates  are  now  presented 
as  gross  value  added  (GVA)  at  basic  prices  instead  of  
factor  cost,  while  ‘GDP  at  market  prices’  is  referred 
to  as  GDP. The  economic  scenario  as  depicted  by  the 
new  series  (with  2011-12  as  the  base  year)  reveals 
that  there  was  perceptible  improvement  in  some  of  
the  macro-aggregates  of   the  economy  in  2013-14, 
which  got  further  strengthened  in  2014-15.  India’s 
general  index  of   industrial  production  (IIP)  picked 
up in 2014-15, reversing the stagnating trend of  the 
last two years. Its services sector remained the major 
driver of  economic growth contributing 72.4 percent 
of  the GDP in 2014-15. 

Several  key  reforms  were  implemented  during 
2014-15  in  financial  markets.  As  a  part  of   the 
financial inclusion initiative, the Pradhan Mantri Jan 
Dhan Yojana was launched in August 2014 with the 
intention of  providing atleast one basic bank account 
for every household.

growth momentum in the Indian economy. Economic 
growth  as  measured  by  the  growth  in  GDP  at 
constant prices (2011-12) was 7.3 percent for 2014-
15  as  compared  to  6.9  percent  in  2013-14.  As  per 
provisional  estimates,  GVA  at  basic  constant  prices 
(2011-12)  increased  from  `  91,69,787  crore  in 
2013-14  to  `  98,27,089  crore  in  2014-15.  The 
growth rate in 2014-15 was 7.2 percent as compared 
to 6.6 percent in 2013-14. (Table 1.1)

database  MCA21  and  comprehensive  coverage  of  
the  financial  sector  in  the  new  series  of   national 
accounts  turned  out  to  project  the  pace  of   growth 
of   manufacturing  and  services  sectors.  The  base 
revision  has  also  shown  that  the  percentage  share 
of   agriculture  and  allied  activities  was  moderately 
higher  in  the  new  series  while  that  of   industry 
witnessed  a  downward  revision.  Going  forward,  the 
decline  in  crude  oil  prices  by  about  50  percent  can 
be envisaged as a positive for the growth prospects of  
the  Indian  economy  as  India  has  so  far  been  a  large 
importer of  crude oil.

While  in  the  previous  year  the  agriculture 
sector  supported  the  growth  rate  while  there  was 
sluggishness  in  industry  and  the  services  sector,  the 
current  financial  year  witnessed  a  pick-up  in  the 
industrial and manufacturing sectors. As per the new 
series  of   national  income,  agriculture  sector  growth 
is  estimated  at  0.2  percent  in  2014-15  against  a 

target of  4.0 percent set in the 12th Five Year Plan for 
agriculture  and  allied  sectors.  The  revival  in  overall 
growth  could  be  attributed  primarily  to  the  services 
sector 
is  estimated  to  have 
grown  by  9.4  percent.  The  manufacturing  sector 
is  estimated  to  grow  at  7.1  percent  in  2014-15.

AGRICULTURE
The  delayed  onset  of   the  southwest  monsoon, 
its  uneven  distribution  and  low  intensity,  especially 
in  the  early  part  of   the  season,  affected  Kharif   crops 
which  slowed  down  agricultural  activity  throughout 
the  year.  Agriculture  registered  a  growth  of   0.2 
percent  in  2014-15  as  compared  to  3.7  percent 
in  2013-14.  Estimates  released  by  the  Ministry  of  
Agriculture  also  indicate  a  decline  in  production 
of   foodgrains  by  3.2  percent  in  the  current  year  as 
compared to a growth of  5.6 percent in the previous 
year.  This  decline  is  on  account  of   lower  production 
of  rice by 3.4 percent and lower production for pulses 
by  6.8  percent.  However,  among  the  horticultural 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

fruits  and  vegetables 

crops,  production  of  
is 
expected  to  increase  by  1.1  percent  during  2014-
15  as  compared  to  an  increase  of   3.5  percent  in  the 
previous financial year.

The total share of  agriculture and allied sectors 
(including  the  forestry  and  fishing  sub-sectors)  in 
terms of  percentage of  GDP was 16.1 percent during 
2014-15 at 2011-12 prices. The 12th Five Year Plan’s 
estimates  of   expanding  the  storage  capacity  to  35 
million tonnes and the target of  achieving an overall 
growth  of   4.0  percent  will  also  go  a  long  way  in 
boosting  agriculture  sector  growth  in  the  following 
years. (Chart 1.1)

INDUSTRY
As  per  CSO  estimates,  the  industrial  sector 
showed  positive  signs  of   development  with  a  growth 
rate  at  6.6  percent  in  2014-15  as  compared  to  5.3 
percent  in  2013-14.  Mining  continued  to  record  a 
downfall  similar  to  the  previous  year,  in  contrast  to 
the  electricity  sector  which  witnessed  a  significant 
growth of  7.9 percent in 2014-15 as opposed to 4.8 
percent in 2013-14. Structural constraints alongwith 
fluctuating  capital  goods  production  led  to  persistent 
contraction in the mining and quarrying sectors.

The  IIP  figures,  which  had  slowed  down  since 
2011-12,  started  picking  up  with  a  growth  rate  of  
2.8  percent  in  2014-15.  (Table  1.3)  The  growth  in 
IIP  was  primarily  on  account  of   impressive  growth 
recorded  by  the  electricity  sector  at  8.4  percent  as 
compared  to  a  6.1  percent  growth  in  the  previous 
year.  The 
the  sector 
was  primarily  due  to  the  high  growth  in  thermal 
generation.  On  the  other  hand,  manufacturing 
and  mining  sectors,  with  weights  of   75.5  percent 
and  14.1  percent  in  IIP,  recorded  growth  rates  of  
2.3  percent  and  1.4  percent  respectively  in  2014-

in 

15  as  compared  to  a  decline  of   0.8  percent  and  0.6 
percent  in  2013-14.  The  contraction  in  the  mining 
and  quarrying  sectors  in  the  IIP  highlights  the  steep 
decline in production in core industries such as steel, 
natural  gas,  crude  oil  and  fertilisers.  The  growth  in 
the  manufacturing  sector  is  imminent  and  it  is  also 
desired  to  improve  the  sector’s  contribution  to  GDP. 
It  has  been  observed  that  the  sector’s  contribution 
to  GDP  has  stagnated  at  15  percent  and  is  relatively 
lower 
emerging  and  developed 
economies. As per the National Manufacturing Policy, 
the  manufacturing  sector’s  contribution  to  GDP 
should be improved by 2022 in order to fill the gap.

to 

Based  on  the  index  of   eight  core  industries, 
the  infrastructure  sector  recorded  a  growth  of   3.5 
percent  in  2014-15  as  compared  to  4.2  percent  in 
2013-14.  As  per  the  use-based  classification,  the 
growth  in  industrial  production  was  driven  by  basic 
and  capital  goods.  While  the  growth  in  intermediate 
goods  remained  sluggish 
in  2014-15,  consumer 
goods  witnessed  a  contraction  of   3.5  percent, 
primarily  on  account  of   the  consumer  durables 
sector.

III.  SERVICES

The  striking  aspect  of   India’s  recent  growth 
has  been  the  dynamism  of   the  services  sector.  The 
services sector accounted for a share of  60.6 percent 
in  the  GVA  (at  basic  price)  in  2014-15  as  reflected 
in  the  new  series  of   national  accounts. This  shows  a 
substantial decline in the share of  the services sector 
under  the  new  method.  There  was  a  major  change 
in the share of  ‘trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants’ 
from  17.2  percent  in  2012-13  using  the  old  factor 
cost  method  to  11.3  percent  using  the  new  basic 
price  method  in  2014-15.  The  growth  picked  up 
steam from Q2 and strengthened further in Q3 led by 
‘financial,  real  estate  and  professional  services’  and 
‘public  administration  and  defence’,  which  registered 
an  overall  growth  of   11.5  percent.  This  sub-sector 
contributed 20.5 percent of  the sector’s share in GVA 
(at basic price). 

The  growth  in  the  services  sector  was  recorded 
at  9.4  percent  in  2014-15  as  compared  to  8.1 
percent  in  2013-14;  this  is  much  higher  than  the 
other  two  sectors  of   the  economy. The  ‘trade,  hotels, 
transport  and  communication  and  services  related 
to  broadcasting’  sub-sector  recorded  10.7  percent 
growth 
in  the  current  year  compared  to  11.1 
percent  in  the  previous  financial  year.  The  ‘public 
administration,  defence  and  other  services’  sector 
witnessed  a  growth  of   7.2  percent  as  compared  to 
7.9  percent  registered  in  the  previous  year.  While 
‘trade,  hotels,  transport  and  communication  and 
services  related  to  broadcasting’  contributed  19.4 
percent  to  GVA  at  basic  price,  ‘public  administration, 
defence, and other services’ contributed 12.6 percent. 
The  research  and  development  sector  grew 
in  double  digits  registering  a  growth  of   nearly  20 
percent  in  2014-15.  Also,  consultation  services  are

emerging  as  one  of   the  fastest  growing  services  in 
India  cutting  across  different  sectors.  The  estimates 
of  HSBC’s services PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) 
data  also  indicate  an  improvement  in  the  services 
sector’s  growth  in  2014-15.  Overall,  India’s  services 
sector  has  emerged  as  a  prominent  sector  over  a 
decade  in  terms  of   its  contribution  to  national  and 
states’ incomes, FDI inflows and employment.

IV.  SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS

The  economic  scenario  presented  by  the  new 
series, with 2011-12 as the base year, reveals a fall in 
India’s gross domestic savings as a percentage of  GDP 
from  33.9  percent  in  2011-12  to  30.9  percent  in 
2013-14. The share of  household savings in physical 
assets  stood  at  10.7  percent  in  2013-14,  down  from 
15.1 percent in 2011-12 while the total contribution 
of  household savings in GDP stood at 18.2 percent in 
2013-14  as  compared  to  22.8  percent  in  2011-12. 
Financial  liabilities  as  a  percentage  of   gross  capital 
formation  (GCF)  were  recorded  at  12.6  percent  in 
2013-14 as compared to 8.6 percent in 2012-13. 

sector  was 

The  household 

the  highest 
contributor  to  gross  savings  with  a  share  of   59.4 
percent  in  2013-14.  This  percentage  however  was 
a  decline  from  67.3  percent  in  2011-12  and  63.4 
percent  in  2012-13.  This  decline  can  be  attributed 
to  a  fall  in  household  savings  in  physical  assets  from 
`  3,37,552  crore  in  2011-12  to  `  12,12,302  crore 
in  2013-14.  On  the  other  hand,  the  share  of   non-
financial  corporations  in  GDS  increased  from  29.3 
percent in 2011-12 to 34.5 percent in 2013-14. The 
share of  financial corporations was around 9 percent 
in all these years, while the dis-saving of  the general 
government  decreased  from  5.4  percent  in  2011-12 
to 3.2 percent in 2013-14.

5

In  absolute  terms,  gross  savings  at  current 
prices  in  2013-14  stood  at  `  34,75,935  crore  as 
against  `  31,81,262  crore  in  2012-13,  registering 
a  growth  of   9.3  percent.  The  savings  of   the 
household  sector  increased  by  a  mere  2.4  percent 
from `  20,16,122 crore in 2012-13 to `  20,65,179 
crore  in  2013-14.  While  savings  in  physical  assets 
witnessed  a  decline  of   5.6  percent  to  `  12,12,302 
crore  in  2013-14  from  `  12,84,620  crore  in  2012-
13,  financial  savings  increased  by  18.0  percent  from 
`  6,94,234  crore  in  2012-13  to  `  8,19,450  crore 
in  2013-14.  Savings  by  non-financial  corporations 
saw  an  increase  of   22.7  percent  from  `  9,78,732 
crore  in  2012-13  to  `  12,00,632  crore  in  2013-14 

while  financial  corporations  recorded  a  growth  of  
2.3 percent in absolute terms from `  3,14,424 crore 
in  2012-13  to  `  3,21,752  crore  in  2013-14.  (Table 
1.4)

Improvement 

in  the  saving-investment  gap 
to  1.6  percent  this  year  as  compared  to  4.8  percent 
in  the  previous  financial  year  could  be  attributed  to 
curbs on gold imports, a sharp slowdown in domestic 
demand  pulling  down  consumption  and  investment 
goods’  imports,  and  a  weak  rupee.  However,  an 
improvement 
in  saving-investment  gap  can  be 
unsustainable  in  the  future  unless  major  structural 
reforms are implemented to make use of  productivity 
gains.

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

The  expenditure  side  of   GDP  reveals  that  the 
government’s  final  consumption  expenditure,  which 
includes  consumption  expenditure  by  the  centre, 
states,  local  bodies  and  autonomous  bodies,  stood 
at  11.3  percent  as  per  CSO  estimates,  mainly  on 
account  of   faster  expenditure  growth  by  the  states 
as  indicated  in  Budget  estimates.  The  contribution 
of   private  final  consumption  expenditure,  a  principal 
component,  to  GDP 
further  accelerated  to  59.7 
percent in 2013-14 from 58.8 percent in 2012-13. 

V. 

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

sector  position 

India’s  external 

improved 
in 
considerably  on  the  back  of   higher  growth 
in 
merchandise  exports  and  a  marginal 
rise 
merchandise  imports,  with  a  sizeable  increase  in  net 
financial  flows  financing  the  current  account  deficit 
(CAD)  and  enabling  a  large  build-up  of   reserves. 
India’s  CAD  shrank  to  USD  27.5  billion  in  2014-
15  (1.3  percent  of   GDP)  from  USD  32.4  billion  (1.7 
percent  of   GDP)  in  previous  financial  year.  The 
reduction  in  the  deficit  can  be  attributed  to  a  lower 
trade deficit along with moderate growth in invisibles 
accompanied by a surge in capital inflows. This surge 
was  enabled  by  higher  portfolio  investment,  foreign 
direct  investment  (FDI)  and  external  commercial 
borrowings. There has been a significant deceleration 
in  valuables  with  curbs  on  gold  imports  and  this  is 
expected  to  positively  impact  household  financial 
savings and help restrain CAD. 

With 

imports  exceeding  exports 

in  2014-
15,  India’s  trade  deficit  widened,  although  only 
modestly.  In  2014-15,  the  value  of   total  exports 
was  USD  310.5  billion  as  against  USD  314.4  billion 
in  the  previous  fiscal,  a  fall  of   1.2  percent.  Imports 
too  contracted  in  2014-15  to  USD  447.5  billion. 
Consequently,  India’s  trade  deficit  for  the  current 
fiscal  is  estimated  at  USD  137.0  billion,  compared 
to  USD  135.8  billion  in  2013-14.The  trade  deficit 
was  contained  primarily  on  account  of   a  fall  in 
international  oil  prices  which  compensated  for  a 
contraction  in  exports.  Hence,  a  policy  focus  on 
enhancing  productivity  and  competitiveness  is  not 
only  desired  for  the  revival  of   exports  but  this  is  also 
essential  for  gradually  reducing  its  dependence  on 
imports. 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Capital  inflows,  largely  portfolio  flows,  into 
domestic  debt  and  equity  markets  and  foreign  direct 
investment  have  enabled  accretion  to  the  foreign 
exchange reserves which reached an all-time peak of  
USD  341.3  billion  as  on  March  27,  2015,  indicating 
a rise of  USD 37.7 billion from the level of  USD 303.7 
billion  observed  at  end  March  2014.  The  increase 
in  reserves  reflects  a  steady  improvement  in  India’s 
growth  trajectory  in  terms  of   an  increase  in  the 
import cover accompanied by a decline in short-term 
external debt to reserves ratio.

VI.  FISCAL DEFICIT

to 

As  the  elevated  fiscal  deficit  posed  a  major 
challenge  to  the  economy,  the  government  remained 
committed 
the  path  of   fiscal  consolidation. 
However,  with  an  improving  economic  scenario,  the 
pressure  to  accelerate  fiscal  consolidation  too  has 
decreased.  The  budgeted  target  of   gross  fiscal  deficit 
as  a  percentage  to  GDP  at  4.1  percent  was  achieved 
with the help of  expenditure reduction amid sluggish 
non-debt receipts. 

In  the  Union  Budget  2015-16,  the  government 
indicated  that  it  aimed  at  high  growth,  although  the 
pace of  cutting the fiscal deficit would be slow as the 
government  seeks  to  boost  investments.  The  Budget 
has  set  India’s  fiscal  deficit  target  for  the  2015-16 
at  3.9  percent  of   GDP  to  be  achieved  in  three  years 
rather  than  in  two  years  and  is  estimated  to  decline 
to three percent by 2017-18.

At  the  end  of   2014-15,  the  policy  repo  rate 
under  the  liquidity  adjustment  facility  (LAF)  stood 
at  7.75  percent.  To  provide  smooth  liquidity,  the 
overnight  repos  were  allowed  at  0.25  percent  of  
bank-wise  NDTL.  During  2014-15,  SCBs’  cash 
reserve  ratio  (CRR)  remained  unchanged  at  4.0 
percent of  NDTL.

In  order  to  create  space  for  banks  to  expand 
credit,  the  statutory  liquidity  ratio  (SLR)  of   SCBs 
was  reduced  from  22.0  percent  of   NDTL  to  21.5 
percent  which  will  help  increase  their  lending  to 
productive  sectors  on  competitive  terms  so  as  to 
support  investment  and  growth.  The  outlook  for 
growth  is  improving  gradually.  Comfortable  liquidity 
conditions  should  enable  banks  to  transmit  the 
recent  reductions  in  the  policy  rate  to  their  lending 
rates  thus  improving  financing  conditions  for  the 
productive sectors of  the economy.

VIII.  INFLATION

inflation, 

The  barometer  of   headline 

the 
wholesale  price 
(base  year  2004-
05=100)  had  remained  persistently  high  at  around 
6.0  to  9.0  percent  during  2011-13.  However,  it 
moderated  to  an  average  of   3.4  percent  in  2014-15 
on  the  back  of   lower  food  and  fuel  prices.  Following 
sharp  corrections  observed  in  vegetable  prices,  food 
inflation  which  remained  high  at  9.4  percent  in 
2013-14  moderated  to  4.8  percent  in  the  current 
fiscal.  The  major  developments  driving  the  inflation 
down were falling global commodity prices, especially 
of  crude oil; decline in the growth rate of  rural wages; 
moderation  in  the  increase  in  minimum  support 
prices;  and  slack  in  economic  activity.  To  sustain 
low  inflation  levels  and  to  rein  in  an  increase  in  food 
inflation,  it  is  imperative  to  enhance  the  resilience 
of   the  agriculture  sector  and  eliminate  leakages, 
inclusion and exclusion errors and other distortions.

to  5.3  percent  in  March  2015,  while  the  consumer 
food  price  index  stood  at  6.1  percent.  CPI  inflation

IX.  EXCHANGE RATE

After  experiencing  bouts  of   depreciation  in 
the  currency  with  intense  pressure  followed  by  the 
tapering  announcement  by  the  US  Fed,  the  rupee’s 
movement  with  respect  to  the  US  dollar  broadly 
remained  stable  during  the  year  on  account  of   the 
huge  inflow  of   FDI  and  FPI  in  the  equity  and  bond 
markets.  The  rupee  depreciated  by  4.2  percent  from 
`  60.1  per  USD  on  March  28,  2014  to  `  62.6  per 
USD as on March 31, 2015, though it reached a high 
of  `  58.43 per USD on May 19, 2014. 

Uncertainties  in  the  exchange  rate  persist.  The 
key risk arises from normalisation of  monetary policy 
by the US Fed which may spark off  safe haven capital 
flows  into  US  Treasury  securities  and  spur  further 
appreciation of  the US dollar.

X.  CAPITAL MARKETS

In  2014-15,  the  Indian  securities  markets 
rallied  strongly  with  benchmark  indices,  BSE  Sensex 
and NSE Nifty, registering all-time highs reflecting the 
confidence  of   investors  in  the  fundamental  strengths 
and  prospects  of   the  Indian  economy.  During  the 
year,  Sensex  and  Nifty  increased  by  24.9  and  26.7 
percent  respectively  over  March  31,  2014.  Sensex 
and  Nifty  closed  at  27,957  and  8,491  on  March  31, 
2015. On the whole, the markets displayed buoyancy 
during  the  second  half   of   2014-15  against  the 
backdrop  of   improved  domestic  fundamentals  and  a 
global appetite for risk.

The  market  capitalisation  of   BSE  and  NSE 
recorded  an  increase  of   36.9  and  36.4  percent 
respectively  in  the  current  financial  year  and  stood 
at  `  1,01,49,290  crore  for  BSE  and  `  99,30,122 
crore  for  NSE  as  on  March  31,  2015.  The  market 
capitalisation 
to  GDP  ratio,  commonly  referred 
to  as  the  m-cap  ratio,  exhibited  a  positive  outlook 
for  Indian  markets  as  it  increased  in  2014-15. 
Taking  into  account  the  advance  estimates  of   GDP 
(at  current  prices)  as  per  the  2011-12  series,  the 
m-cap  ratio  for  BSE  was  65.4  percent  in  2014-15; 
it  was  64.1  percent  for  NSE.  The  demat  statistics 
at  depositories,  NSDL  and  CDSL,  exhibited  an 
accelerating  trend  and  number  of   demat  accounts 
at  CDSL  witnessed  a  growth  of   9.5  percent  over  the 
previous  year.  (Table  1.5a)  Moreover,  the  number 
of   listed  companies  on  NSE  and  BSE  continued  to 
increase. (Table 1.5b)

was  59.7  percent  higher  than  the  previous  year.  In 
currency  derivatives,  among  exchanges  the  turnover 
at NSE was the highest. The total turnover in interest

During  the  year,  SEBI  took  a  number  of   policy 
initiatives 
in  accordance  with  approved  Budget 
proposals  which  were  in  consonance  with  the  three 
mandated  statutory  objectives  of   SEBI:  protecting 
the  interests  of   investors  in  securities  markets  and 
promoting 
the  development  of   and  regulating

2.   REVIEW OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

A  proactive  and  evolving  regulatory  regime  is 
integral  to  dynamic  financial  markets,  participants 
and  investors.  SEBI  initiated  several  policies  and 
programmes  in  financial  year  2014-15.  This  section 
presents a brief  note on these developments. 

The  developments  are  categorised  under  nine 
major  heads:,  Primary  Securities  Market,  Secondary 
Securities  Market,  Mutual  Funds,  Intermediaries 
associated  with  Securities  Market,  Foreign  Portfolio 

Investors, Corporate Debt Market, Investor Assistance 
and  Education,  Other  Policies  and  Programmes 
having  a  bearing  on  the  working  of   securities 
markets. The section ends with a note on ‘Assessment 
and Prospects’.

issuers  and  the 

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET
A  healthy  and  regulated  primary  market  is 
vital 
for  maintaining  the  confidence  of  
issuers, 
intermediaries  and  investors.  In  order  to  keep  pace 
with  the  changing  economic  environment  and  to 
address  concerns  of   various  market  participants, 
especially 
investing  community, 
regulations  governing  the  primary  market  have 
been  amended  from  time  to  time.  Such  reviews 
are  intended  to  facilitate  easy  capital  mobilisation 
by 
investor 
protection. A review of  the pricing mechanism of  the 
preferential  issue,  norms  on  corporate  governance 
and  notification  of   SEBI  (Share  Based  Employee 
Benefits)  Regulation,  2014  were  some  important 
developments  that  took  place 
in  2014-15.  This 
section  discusses  policy  measures  initiated  by  SEBI 
pertaining to the primary market during the financial 
year:

Box 1.1: India ranks 7th with respect to protection of  minority shareholders  

as per a World Bank Report

On  October  29,  2014  the  World  Bank  released  a  report  titled  ‘Doing  Business  2015  Going  Beyond  Efficiency’. This  World 
Bank Group publication is the 12th in a series of  annual reports measuring regulations that enhance business activity and 
those that constrain it. The recent report which compares business regulations for domestic firms in 189 economies inter-
alia  observed,  ‘India  has  strengthened  minority  investor  protections  by  requiring  greater  disclosure  of   conflicts  of   interest 
by  board  members,  increasing  the  remedies  available  in  case  of   prejudicial  related-party  transactions  and  introducing 
additional safeguards for shareholders of  privately held companies.’

It is observed from the report that India ranks seven in respect of  minority investor protection.  Based on a quick study of  
previous World Bank reports on doing business, a comparative perspective over the last three years with respect to ranking 
for protecting investors is given in Table 1.

A.  Revisiting the Norms on Minimum Offer to 

Public
In  order  to  make  regulatory  requirements 
consistent  across  companies  irrespective  of   post-
issue  capitalisation  and  to  facilitate  mid-size  issuers 
who may not be in need of  large funds, the following 
norms  were  prescribed  by  way  of   amendments 
to  Rule  19(2)(b)  of  
the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulations)  Rules,  1957  and  Regulation  41  of   the 
ICDR Regulations, 2009:

a.  Minimum  dilution  to  public  in  an  IPO  shall  be 
25  percent  or  `  400  crore,  whichever  is  lower 
for  companies  with  post-issue  capitalisation  of  
less  than  or  equal  to  `  4,000  crore.  This  will 
remove  the  anomaly  that  a  company  just  short 
of   `  4,000  crore  market  capitalisation  was 
required  to  dilute  about  `  1,000  crore  while 
another  company  with  more  than  `  4,000 
crore  market  capitalisation  was  required  to 
dilute only `  400 crore.

b. 

In  case  of   dilution  being  less  than  25  percent, 
a  minimum  public  shareholding  of   25  percent 
is required to be achieved within three years of  
listing. 

B.  Review  of   Minimum  Public  Shareholding 

Requirement in Public Sector Companies 
Earlier,  while  listed  private  sector  companies 
were  required  to  have  at  least  25  percent  public 
shareholding,  listed  public  sector  companies  were 
required  to  maintain  a  minimum  of   only  10  percent 
public  shareholding.  This  was 
inconsistent  with 
the  broader  market  design.  Therefore,  Rule  19A  of  
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulations)  Rules,  1957 
was  amended  to  align  the  norms  by  increasing  the 
minimum  public  shareholding  requirement  in  listed 
public  sector  companies  to  25  percent.  Listed  public 
sector  companies  with  existing  public  shareholding 
below  this  level  are  required  to  increase  this  to  at 
least 25 percent within a period of  three years i.e. by 
August 22, 2017. 

C.  Review  of   Corporate  Governance  Norms 

in India for Listed Companies
SEBI reviewed the extant regulatory framework 
for  corporate  governance  in  India. Towards  this  end, 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

a  discussion  paper  was  put  up  on  SEBI’s  website  for 
public  comments  on  January  4,  2013. The  proposals 
were  further  discussed  in  several  meetings  of   the 
PMAC. Final norms were approved by the SEBI board 
on  February  13,  2014.  Subsequently,  Clause  49  of

Box 1.2: Enhancing Governance and Transparency: Unrelenting Initiatives

Good  corporate  governance  standards  are  essential  for  the  integrity  of   corporations,  financial  institutions  and  markets. 
They  also  have  a  bearing  on  the  growth  and  stability  of   the  economy.  SEBI  is  of   the  view  that  any  code  of   corporate 
governance  must  be  dynamic,  evolving  and  should  change  with  changing  contexts  and  times.  To  keep  pace  with  the 
changing  expectations  of   investors,  shareholders  and  other  stakeholders,  necessary  amendments  are  carried  out  to  the 
regulatory  framework.  Recent  policy  initiatives  like  periodic  disclosures  of   pledged  shares,  voting  rights  and  agreements 
with  media  companies  have  come  a  long  way  in  further  strengthening  investor  confidence  in  the  market.  Broadly,  the 
regulatory  framework  in  India  is  in  compliance  with  OECD  principles,  an  international  benchmark  used  worldwide. 
As  a  part  of   a  bilateral  cooperation  agreement  between  SEBI  and  OECD  in  the  area  of   corporate  governance,  a  policy 
dialogue on ‘Minority Protection- Related Party Transactions (RPTs)’ was held in 2011 and  a policy dialogue on the role of  
institutional investors was held in 2014. 

The  enactment  of   the  Companies  Act,  2013,  which  replaced  the  Companies  Act,  1956,  was  a  major  development  in 
corporate  governance  to  improve  governance  standards,  simplify  regulations  and  enhance  the  interests  of   minority 
shareholders.  SEBI  also  reviewed  Clause  49  of   the  Listing  Agreement  during  2014  to  align  it  with  the  provisions  of   the 
Companies Act, 2013 and to also prescribe additional conditions in this regard. The governance framework now comprises 
of   revised  norms  with  regard  to  the  board  of   directors,  audit  committee,  subsidiary  companies,  risk  management,  related 
party transactions and disclosures, a compulsory whistle blower mechanism, requirement of  at least one woman director on 
the  board,  mandatory  constitution  of   a  nomination  and  remuneration  committee,  performance  evaluation  of   independent 
directors  and  prohibition  of   stock  options  to  independent  directors,  maximum  tenure  of   independent  directors  and  limit 
on  the  number  of   independent  directorships. These  are  some  of   the  key  provisions  that  were  made  applicable  to  all  listed 
companies. The scope of  RPTs was widened to include elements of  both the Companies Act and Accounting Standards.

As a regulator, SEBI and its policy have always endeavoured to communicate transparency and ethical conduct at all levels 
for stakeholders. To ensure this, SEBI mandated the top 100 listed companies to include a business responsibility report as 
a  part  of   their  annual  reports  focusing  on  environmental,  social  and  governance  issues.  It  also  implemented  the  concept 
of   general  information  document  (GID)  containing  generic  information  thereby  eliminating  the  repetition  of   common 
information in the abridged prospectus thus helping investors to better understand the nuances of  public offers.

To  comply  with  the  Government  of   India  (GoI)  notification  requiring  listed  companies  to  achieve  and  maintain  minimum 
public  shareholding  (MPS)  norms,  SEBI  specified  various  methods  for  ensuring  timely  compliance  by  non-compliant 
companies.  SEBI  also  initiated  a  consultative  process  with  companies  which  were  not  meeting  the  MPS  requirement  to 
impress  upon  them  the  importance  of   achieving  timely  compliance  and  eliciting  a  concrete  plan  of   action  in  this  regard. 
The  companies  were  also  made  aware  of   the  penal  actions  that  might  result  in  case  of   non-compliance.  With  respect 
to  non-compliant  companies,  SEBI  issued  interim  directions  against  the  promoters/promoter  groups  and  directors  of  
107  listed  companies  including  one  state  PSU.  Further,  to  remain  consistent  with  the  broader  market  design,  Securities 
Contracts (Regulations) Rules, 1957 was amended during 2014 to bring the MPS requirement for listed public and private 
sector companies at par at 25 percent. This was earlier 10 percent in the case of  public sector companies. 

Even  as  too  many  stock  exchanges  fragment  liquidity  that  might  stifle  growth  and  innovation,  too  frequent  exits  of   stock 
exchanges  will  jeopardise  the  interests  of   investors  and  disrupt  the  stability  of   the  markets.  Further,  technology  has  altered 
the marketplace so much that the need for multiple stock exchanges has been reduced largely. In this regard, SEBI formulated 
an  exit  policy  keeping  in  mind  the  interests  of   shareholders  of   exclusively  listed  companies  by  providing  an  exit  option  and 
by  providing  trading  members  a  trading  opportunity  through  the  subsidiary  route.  Subsequently,  in  2014  SEBI  introduced 
measures to facilitate the exit of  de-recognised/non-operational stock exchanges subject to certain conditions. Indian markets 
are  vibrant  and  a  timely  review  of   the  corporate  governance  system  is  inevitable  in  the  light  of   the  new  technological 
developments, introduction of  new products, growth of  financial markets, trade and capital flows and global integration.

D. 

Eligibility  of   Shares  for  Offer  for  Sale  in 
an  IPO  with  respect  to  Bonus  Issues  on 
Shares held for more than a year
Bonus  shares  issued  on  securities  held  for  a 
period  of   at  least  one  year  prior  to  filing  of   the  draft 

offer document, have been permitted to be offered for 
sale,  provided  that  these  bonus  shares  were  issued 
out of  the free reserves or share premium and not by 
utilizing  revaluation  reserves  or  unrealised  profits  of  
the issuer.

Increased  Investment  Bucket  for  Anchor 
Investors 
In order to increase the participation of  serious, 
committed  investors  in  IPOs,  the  anchor  investors’ 
bucket  has  been  increased  to  60  percent  of   the 
overall  qualified  institutional  buyers  (QIB)  bucket 
from 30 percent, which was the norm earlier. 

F. 

Revised  Norms  on  Pricing  in  Preferential 
Issues
A  distinction  has  been  made  for  pricing  of   non-
frequently  traded  shares.  It  has  been  prescribed  that 
for  such  shares,  the  price  determined  by  the  issuer 
for  allotting  shares  in  a  preferential  issue  shall  take 
into  account  valuation  parameters 
including  book 
value,  comparable  trading  multiples  and  such  other 
parameters  as  are  customary  for  the  valuation  of  
shares  of   such  companies.  This  has  to  be  certified  by 
an  independent  merchant  banker  or  an  independent 
chartered  accountant  in  practice  having  a  minimum 
experience  of   10  years.  Further,  in  case  of   frequently 
traded  shares,  the  pricing  is  now  based  on  volume 
weighted average price vis-à-vis closing price previously.

SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET
Trading  activity 

in  the  secondary  securities 
market  witnessed  upsurge 
line  with  global 
developments  with  the  Indian  benchmark  indices, 
Sensex  and  Nifty,  scaling  new  heights  in  the  current 
financial  year.  During  2014-15,  various  initiatives 
were  taken  up  to  revive 
investor  confidence  and 
encourage  the  participation  of   small  investors.  Other 
policy  measures  like  the  Core  Settlement  Guarantee 
Fund  (Core  SGF)  norms,  OFS  through  the  stock 
exchange  mechanism  and 
the  risk  management 
framework  at  depositories  were  introduced  to  further 
strengthen  the  secondary  securities  market.  This 
section  presents  the  major  policy  initiatives  taken  by 
SEBI relating to the secondary market during 2014-15.

A.  Allowing  Mutual  Fund  Distributors  to  use 
Stock  Exchange  Infrastructure  for  Mutual 
Fund Distribution
To  enable  mutual  fund  distributors  to  leverage 
the  stock  exchange  platform  so  as  to  improve  their 
reach,  SEBI  allowed  mutual  fund  distributors  to  use 
the  infrastructure  of   recognised  stock  exchanges 
for  purchases  and  for  redeeming  mutual  fund  units 
directly 
funds/assets  management 
companies  on  behalf   of   their  clients.  In  order  to 
broad-base  the  reach  of   this  platform,  SEBI  also 
permitted  non-demat  transactions  in  mutual  fund 
transactions through the stock exchange platform.

B.  Core  Settlement  Guarantee  Fund,  Default 

Waterfall and Stress Test
SEBI  prescribed 

for 

the  norms 

the  Core 
Settlement  Guarantee  Fund  (Core  SGF),  Default 
Waterfall  and  Stress  Testing 
to  bring  greater 
clarity  and  uniformity  and  for  aligning  them  with 
international  best  practices  while  enhancing  the 
robustness  of   the  present  risk  management  system 
in  clearing  corporations  to  enable  them  to  deal  with 
defaults  of   clearing  members  much  more  effectively 
by achieving the following:
a. 

Creating  a  core  fund  (called  Core  Settlement 
Guarantee  Fund)  within  SGF  against  which 
no  exposure  is  given  and  which  is  readily  and 
unconditionally  available  to  meet  settlement 
obligations  of   clearing  corporations  in  case 
clearing  member(s)  fail  to  honour  settlement 
obligations.

Norms  for  contribution  to  Core  SGF  as  well 
as  Default  Waterfall  were  specified  with  a  view  that 
all  the  stakeholders  (clearing  corporations,  stock 
exchanges and clearing members) are incentivised to 
adequately monitor the risks brought into the system.

C.  Position  Limits  for  Mutual  Funds  in  10-

year Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) 
SEBI  prescribed  a  framework  for  trading  of  
cash  settled  interest  rate  futures  (IRFs)  on  10-year 
Government  of   India  security  on  stock  exchanges 
wherein  it  was  clarified  that  the  following  position 
limits  in  IRF  shall  be  applicable  for  mutual  fund  and 
scheme levels: 

Mutual  funds  shall  have  position  limits  as 

applicable to trading members presently.

Mutual funds schemes shall have position limits 

as applicable to clients presently.

Box 1.4: Making Markets: Safe, Fast, Efficient, Simple and Clear

In  recent  years,  securities  markets  have  deepened  with  a  slew  of   initiatives  and  simplified  norms.  Simplification 
and  streamlining  of   various  processes  has  created  a  conducive  environment  for  stakeholders  in  securities  markets. 
Simultaneously,  the  market  micro-structure  has  undergone  many  changes  with  the  underlying  objective  of   making  the 
market  more  accessible,  transparent  and  efficient.  The  key  developments  here  include  the  world’s  best  practices  across 
various segments being adapted to India with the objective of  making markets more open and efficient.

SEBI  introduced  the  e-IPO  facility  to  submit  application  forms  for  public  issues  as  an  additional  mode  for  investors  to 
submit  applications  using  the  nation-wide  stockbroker  network  of   stock  exchanges  and  where  there  is  a  presence  of   the 
brokers’ terminals (broker centre), who may not be the syndicate or sub-syndicate members in an issue. It is also intended 
to reduce the timeline for listing of  shares to 2-3 days as against 12 days. The mechanism is aimed at simplifying the IPO 
process  and  cutting  costs  while  meeting  its  objective  of   reaching  more  and  more  retail  investors.  Further,  with  a  view 
to  encouraging  retail  participation  in  OFS,  enabling  other  large  shareholders  to  use  the  OFS  mechanism  and  expanding 
the  universe  of   companies  to  use  OFS,  the  OFS  framework  was  modified  and  made  available  to  the  top  200  companies  by 
market  capitalisation  in  any  of   the  last  four  completed  quarters  where  non-promoter  shareholder  of   eligible  companies 
holding  at  least  10  percent  of   the  share  capital  were  also  allowed  to  offer  shares  through  the  OFS  mechanism  with  a 
minimum 10 percent of  the offer size reserved for retail investors. Sellers were permitted to offer discount to retail investors 
and also an option to retail investors to place their bids at cut-off  prices in addition to placing price bids.

To  aid  companies  with  high  growth  potential  in  raising  capital,  SEBI  set  up  a  separate  dedicated  platform  for  the  listing 
and  trading  of   SME  securities  in  2012-13. This  platform  is  for  small  and  medium  sized  companies  whose  post-issue  paid 
up capital is less than or equal to `  25 crore. In addition, SEBI has also introduced the institutional trading platform (ITP), 
enabling start-ups and SMEs to list on the SME platform without having to make an IPO while informed investors can find 
suitable companies to invest in. The possible eligibility route includes a minimum investment of  `  50 lakh in the equity of  
the company by registered VCFs, AIFs, merchant bankers, etc. Companies seeking to list on this platform should not be older 
than 10 years or having revenues more than `  100 crore or a paid up capital of  more than `  25 crore.

To  enable  mutual  fund  distributors  to  leverage  the  stock  exchange  platform  so  as  to  improve  their  reach,  on  October  4, 
2013  SEBI  allowed  mutual  fund  distributors  to  use  the  infrastructure  of   recognised  stock  exchanges  to  purchase  and 
redeem  mutual  fund  units  directly  from  mutual  funds/AMCs  on  behalf   of   their  clients.  In  order  to  broad  base  the  reach 
of   this  platform  on  December  9,  2014.  SEBI  decided  to  permit  non-demat  transactions  also  in  mutual  fund  transactions 
through the stock exchange platform.

SEBI  has  prescribed  norms  for  the  Core  Settlement  Guarantee  Fund  (Core  SGF),  Default  Waterfall  and  Stress  Testing 
which  will  bring  greater  clarity  and  uniformity  and  also  align  them  with  international  best  practices  while  enhancing 
the  robustness  of   the  present  risk  management  system  in  clearing  corporations  to  enable  them  to  deal  with  defaults  of  
clearing members much more effectively. This is achieved by creating a core fund, Core SGF, within SGF, against which no 
exposure  is  given  and  which  is  available  for  meeting  settlement  defaults  by  clearing  members.  Norms  for  contributions  to 
the Core SGF as well as Default Waterfall have been specified with a view that all the stakeholders (clearing members, stock 
exchanges and clearing members) are incentivised to adequately monitor the risks brought into the system.

As  interest  rate  futures  have  become  a  fundamental  risk  management  tool  for  financial  markets  worldwide,  after 
consultation  with  RBI  and  taking  into  account  feedback  from  market  participants,  on  December  5,  2013  SEBI  permitted 
stock  exchanges  to  introduce  cash  settled  interest  rate  futures  on  a  10-year  GoI  security.  SEBI  has  also  permitted  NSE  to 
introduce  derivatives  on  India  VIX,  which  is  India’s  first  volatility  index  and  is  a  key  measure  of   market  expectations  of  
near-term  volatility.  India  VIX  indicates  investors’  perceptions  of   the  market’s  volatility  in  the  near  term.  It  enables 
participants  to  hedge,  trade  and  arbitrage  the  expected  volatility  more  easily.  SEBI  has  also  specified  disclosures  and  other 
requirements  in  offer  documents  for  issue  of   structured  products/market  linked  debentures  that  seek  listing  on  stock 
exchanges as such securities differ from plain debt securities or debt securities issued with embedded call or put options, that 
is, by offering market linked returns obtained through exposures on exchange traded derivatives.

Easing  the  operational  requirements  in  registration  of   intermediaries,  SEBI  allowed  a  single  registration  process  for  stock 
brokers and clearing entities that allows them to operate across stock exchanges. The new requirements will ease the cost 
burden and also avoid duplication of  the registration process. For a registered entity, trading in other segments will also be 
easy  as  now  a  direct  exchange/clearing  corporation  approval  may  be  sought.  SEBI  has  also  put  in  place  a  one-time  single 
registration  process  for  depository  participants  to  operate  at  both  the  depositaries. To  enable  two-way  information  sharing 
between  debenture  trustees  and  credit  rating  agencies  (CRAs),  SEBI  allowed  debenture  trustees  to  seek  information  from 
CRAs making it easier for both the intermediaries to effectively perform their functions.

In  order  to  enable  easy  understanding  by  investors,  standardisation  of   rating  symbols  and  definitions  used  by  CRAs  has 
been  done.  SEBI  has  decentralised  the  process  of   filing  draft  offer  documents  with  issues  upto  `  100  crore.  These  are 
now  to  be  filed  with  SEBI’s  concerned  regional  office  under  the  jurisdiction  of   which  the  registered  office  of   the  issuer 
company  falls.  The  supervisory  and  monitoring  roles  of   the  depositaries  and  their  participants  were  strengthened  with 
respect  to  the  issuance  and  processing  of   delivery  instruction  slips  (DIS).  The  depositaries  had  to  put  in  place  measures 
to  ensure  standardisation,  monitoring  and  scanning  of   DIS  to  safeguard  the  interests  of   investors.  Further,  making  the 
transmission  of   securities  efficient  and  investor  friendly  in  both  the  dematerialised  and  physical  modes,  SEBI  has  also 
simplified  the  procedure  for  transfer  of   securities  from  the  account  of   a  deceased  person  and  raised  the  threshold  limit  for 
such transactions in demat format to `  5 lakh.

SEBI  has  enabled  a  single  consolidated  view  of   all  the  investments  of   an  investor  in  mutual  funds  and  securities  held  in 
demat form with the depositories. With a view to simplifying and rationalizing the account opening process, SEBI reviewed, 
consolidated  and  updated  all  the  documents/requirements  while  devising  a  uniform  documentation  to  be  followed  by  all 
stock  brokers/trading  members.  Similarly,  to  make  the  KYC  process  easier  for  investors,  SEBI  notified  a  set  of   norms  that 
allow entities such as brokers and mutual funds to get details from centralised KYC agencies rather than carrying out fresh 
KYC verification procedures. SEBI prescribed the base minimum capital deposit for members holding registration as ‘trading 
members’  in  any  derivative  segment  which  will  enhanced  for  members  holding  registration  as  ‘stock-brokers’  in  the  cash 
segment to be commensurate with the risks, other than market risks, that a broker may bring to the system.

SEBI  (Foreign  Portfolio  Investors)  Regulations,  2014  were  notified  and  made  effective  from  June  2014.  Existing  FIIs  and 
QFIs were merged into one category called FPI. The regime hence simplified investment and registration norms for foreign 
investors and has made Indian securities markets more attractive for foreign investors.

SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (Real  Estate  Investment  trusts)  Regulations,  2014  and  SEBI  (Infrastructure  Investment  trusts) 
Regulations,  2014  for  providing  a  framework  for  registration  and  regulation  of   REITs  and  InvITs  in  India.  REITs/  InvITs 
are  mutual  fund  like  institutions  that  enable  investments  in  the  real  estate/infrastructure  sector  by  pooling  small  sums 
of   money  from  multiple  individual  investors  for  directly  investing  in  real  estate  properties  so  as  to  return  a  portion  of   the 
income  (after  deducting  expenditures)  to  unit  holders  of   REITs/InvITs  who  pooled  in  the  money.  REITs  provide  a  highly 
liquid method of  investment in real estate to all kind of  investors.

With  a  view  to  achieving  wider  financial  inclusion,  encouraging  holding  of   demat  accounts  and  reducing  the  cost  of  
maintaining securities in demat accounts for retail individual investors, SEBI provided for all DPs to make available a BSDA 
with  limited  services  and  reduced  costs.  With  respect  to  purchase  of   units  in  equity  and  income/debt  oriented  schemes 
(other than liquid schemes) for an amount equal to or more than `  2 lakh, irrespective of  the time of  receipt of  application, 
the closing NAV of  the day on which the funds are available for utilisation shall be applicable. This will ensure fair treatment 
being meted out to all investors of  mutual fund schemes.

The  Indian  mutual 

is  one 
of   the  fastest  growing  segments  of   the  financial 
sector.  Buoyed  by  robust  capital  inflows  and  strong 
participation  of   retail  investors,  the  asset  base  of   the 
mutual  fund  industry  reached  all-time  highs  during 
2014-15.  On 
initiated  regulatory 
reforms  like  introducing  seed  capital  and  increasing

launch  and  manage  new  schemes  from  `  10  crore 
to  `  50  crore.  Mutual  funds  specializing  only  in 
infrastructure  debt  funds  (IDFs)  have  been  exempt 
from  this 
increase.  SEBI-registered  AMCs  which 
presently  have  a  net  worth  less  than  `  50  crore 
have  been  given  a  three-year  time  frame  to  achieve 
the  same.  Till  the  net  worth  is  raised  to  `  50  crore, 
only  two  new  schemes  per  year  shall  be  allowed  to 
be  launched  by  such  AMCs,  provided  the  board  is 
satisfied  that  the  concerned  AMC  is  taking  necessary 
steps  to  meet  the  networth  requirement  within  the 
specified time period. 

B. 

Introduction of  Seed Capital
The  concept  of   seed  capital  was  introduced 
for  mutual  fund  schemes.  As  per  this  concept,  one 
percent of  the amount raised (subject to a maximum 
of   `  50  lakh)  is  to  be  invested  by  AMCs  in  all  open 
ended  schemes  in  the  growth  option  of   the  scheme 
and  such  investments  shall  not  be  redeemed  unless 
the  scheme  is  wound  up  during  its  lifetime.  A  time 
period  of   one  year  from  the  date  of   notification  of  
these regulations has been given for compliance with 
existing schemes.

for  Debt  Oriented 

(AUM)  prescribed 
Schemes
SEBI has mandated that:

a. 

b. 

c. 

The  minimum  subscription  amount  for  debt-
oriented and balanced schemes shall be at least 
`  20  crore  and  for  other  schemes  it  shall  be  at 
least  `  10  crore  at  the  time  of   the  new  fund 
offer.

Further,  open  ended  debt-oriented  schemes 
have  been  mandated  to  maintain  a  minimum 
average  AUM  of   `  20  crore  on  a  half-yearly 
rolling basis.

The  existing  open  ended  debt-oriented  schemes 
which  do  not  comply  with  these  requirements 
have  been  given  a  time  frame  of   one  year  to 
scale  up  their  AUMs  after  which  the  trustees 
will  have  to  take  a  view  whether  to  merge  or 
wind  up  such  schemes  if   AMCs  are  unable  to 
scale up their AUMs.

Box 1.5: Re-Energizing the Asset Management Industry

Globally,  asset  management  companies  have  facilitated  financial  intermediation.  They  help  investors  to  diversify  their 
assets more easily and can provide financing to the real economy besides providing financial stability. As per the latest IMF 
report, ‘In recent years, credit intermediation has been shifting from the banking to the nonbank sector, including the asset 
management industry.’

The Indian mutual fund industry is one of  the fastest growing and most competitive segments of  the financial sector. As of  
March 31, 2015, total AUM stood at `  10,82,757 crore. The actual average growth of  AUM for the last four years was 17 
percent, which was much higher than the growth in other countries (Table 1).

The AUM of  equity schemes increased to `  3.45 lakh crore in 2014-15 from `  1.95 lakh crore in 2010-11. Further, in the 
last five years, there were net outflows during three financial years while there was a net inflow of  `  71,000 crore during 
the current financial year in equity schemes.

Though  mutual  funds  have  seen  overall  growth  in  the  last  10  years,  they  have  faced  a  significant  challenge  with  respect 
to  penetration  into  new  markets  and  increase  in  the  number  of   investors.  Urgency  was  felt  for  scaling  up  mutual  funds 
beyond Tier I cities besides retaining existing customers. In this light, SEBI implemented a two-pronged approach: increasing 
awareness among investors and improving accessibility of  mutual fund products. Hence, SEBI directed mutual funds/AMCs 
to  annually  set  apart  at  least  two  basis  points  on  daily  net  assets  within  the  maximum  limit  of  TER  for  investor  education 
and awareness initiatives. In order to improve the geographical reach of  mutual funds and bring in long term money from 
smaller towns, AMCs were allowed to charge additional TER if  the new inflows from beyond the top 15 cities were at least 
within  specified  limits.  While  these  efforts  will  go  a  long  way  in  enhancing  the  reach  of   mutual  funds,  SEBI  further  made 
available  to  the  public  printed  literature  on  MFs  in  regional  languages  in  consonance  with  its  broader  investor  education 
initiatives.  Mutual  funds  were  also  encouraged  to  introduce  investor  awareness  campaigns,  both  in  print  and  electronic 
media and in regional languages.

In  improving  the  accessibility  of   mutual  fund  products,  the  role  of   a  distributor  assumes  importance  as  this  is  the 
touch  point  between  mutual  funds  and  investors  and  it  is  critical  that  distributors  undertake  efforts  to  educate  investors 
and  increase  their  awareness  levels.  In  order  to  energise  the  distribution  system  and  to  increase  the  ‘feet-on-street’  in 
distribution,  a  new  cadre  of   distributors  was  enabled  by  including  postal  agents,  retired  officials  from  government,  banks, 
retired  teachers  etc.  with  NISM  certification  for  distribution  of   simple  products.  The  distributors  were  also  allowed  to 
leverage the stock exchange platform so as to improve their reach by allowing them to purchase/redeem mutual fund units 
directly from AMCs through stock exchanges. They were also permitted non-demat transactions. 

In spite of  SEBI’s best efforts there have been recurrent episodes of  mis-selling in the markets. To give a better understanding 
about  a  product/scheme  and  the  suitability  of   the  investment,  ‘Product  Labelling  in  Mutual  Funds’  has  been  introduced. 
In addition, mis-selling has been included as a ‘fraudulent and unfair trade practice’ as per SEBI (FUTP) Regulations and a 
system of  identifying actual sales personnel of  distributors has been implemented. In order to encourage long term holdings 
and  to  reducing  churn,  it  has  been  mandated  that  entire  exit  loads  will  be  credited  to  the  scheme  and  additional TER  on 
account of  inflows from beyond the top 15 cities charged would be clawed back in case the investment is redeemed within a 
period of  one year from the date of  investment.

SEBI  reviewed  the  valuation  norms  for  money  and  debt  funds  and  redefined  the  principles  of   fair  valuation,  that  is, 
valuation  shall  be  reflective  of   the  realizable  value  of   the  securities/assets. The  objective  of   fair  valuation  is  to  ensure  fair 
treatment  to  all  investors  including  existing  investors  as  well  as  investors  seeking  to  purchase  or  redeem  units  of   mutual 
funds in all schemes at all points of  time.

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part One: Policies and Programmes

In order to enable investors to take informed decisions, SEBI has continuously increased transparency and disclosure norms 
of   mutual  funds.  Transparency  was  furthered  when  mutual  funds  were  mandated  to  disclose  monthly  average  AUM  of  
various scheme categories and various investor types. Mutual funds were also mandated to disclose contribution to monthly 
average AUM from B-15 and T-15 cities, from sponsors and their associates and others, alongwith data on state-wise/union 
territory-wise  monthly  average  AUM  and  monthly  average  AUM  garnered  through  sponsor  group/non-sponsor  group 
distributors. 
As  a  class  of   domestic  institutional  investors,  mutual  funds  play  an  important  role  in  ensuring  corporate  governance  in 
listed companies. To increase transparency and encourage mutual funds to diligently exercise their voting rights in the best 
interest of  unitholders they are required to disclose voting data along with rationale supporting the decision on a quarterly 
basis on their websites. 
While enabling regulatory frameworks are being put in place continuously, SEBI has also widened the scope of  the industry 
by  allowing  enhanced  participation  of   larger  categories  of   investors  and  introducing  innovative  product-mixes. To  attract 
foreign funds for the financing of  infrastructure, SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations were amended to increase the investment 
universe of  IDFs, permitting private placement as an alternative to new fund offers for IDFs, increasing the IDF-NFO period 
up to 45 days and permitting extension of  the original tenure of  the IDF Scheme by up to two years. Regulatory frameworks 
for setting up and listing of  REITs and InvITs on stock exchanges opens the way for fresh investments in the real estate and 
infrastructure sectors. Gold ETFs floated by mutual funds have been allowed to invest in the gold deposit schemes of  banks to 
the extent of  20 percent of  the total AUM of  such schemes.
While all these reforms have invigorated and energised the mutual fund industry, the potential for the future is much larger. 
There is immense scope for unprecedented growth of  the industry with the support from innovative technological initiatives 
and broadened investor participation over time.

in 

Accordingly,  an  initial  certificate  of   registration 
as  stock  broker/clearing  member  shall  be  granted  by 
SEBI and subsequent permissions for operation in other 
stock exchanges/clearing corporations shall be granted 
by  the  respective  stock  exchange/clearing  corporation 
after following the procedure prescribed by the board. 

The amendment to the SEBI (Stock Brokers and 
Sub-Brokers)  Regulations,  1992  in  this  regard  was 
notified on October 8, 2014.

B. 

Single Registration to Depository Participants
With  a  view  to  further  simplifying  registration 
requirements  for  depository  participants  (DPs)  and 
for  reducing  the  regulatory  burden  and  saving  cost 
and  time,  SEBI  approved  the  policy  of   granting  a 
single registration to an entity making an application 
for  initial  or  permanent  registration  for  operating 
with  both  the  depositories.  As  per  the  new  policy, 
SEBI  will  process  the  registration  application  only 
for  the  first  time  whether  for  initial  or  permanent 
registration,  as  the  case  may  be,  through  one 
depository  and  subsequent  permissions  to  act  as  a 
participant  of   the  other  depository  shall  be  granted 
by the concerned depository after complying with the 
prescribed requirements. The amendment to the SEBI 
(Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996  in 
this regard was notified on December 24, 2014.

C.  Review of  Certification Examinations

employees 

Based  on  representations  received  from  market 
participants, SEBI has clarified that the requirement of  
certification examination for  
of  
stock  brokers  and  depository  participants  doing  basic 
elementary/clerical  level  work  and  whose  work  is 
supervised by a certified personnel is optional. Further, 
with  a  view  to  removing  the  difficulties  faced  by 
approved  users  and  sales  personnel  of   stock  brokers 
in  giving  three  separate  certification  examinations  in 
currency, interest rate and equity derivatives segments,

SEBI  introduced  a  common  derivatives  examination 
on  March  10,  2015  as  an  optional  examination  for 
approved  users  and  sales  personnel  operating  across 
the three derivatives segments.

D. 

Limited  Liability  Partnerships  Allowed  to 
Become Sub-Brokers
SEBI has informed the stock exchanges about a 
clarification  regarding  admission  of   limited  liability 
partnerships  as  sub-brokers.  In  this  regard,  it  was 
clarified  that  a  limited  liability  partnership  is  eligible 
to  be  registered  as  a  sub-broker  under  Regulation 
11A  (5)  (ii)  of   the  SEBI  (Stock  Brokers  and  Sub-

Box 1.6: Enhancing Risk Governance and Strengthening Supervision

SEBI  has  been  playing  a  dominant  role  in  ensuring  a  robust  risk  management  framework  across  market  infrastructure 
institutions and in introducing policies that strengthen the supervision of  market players. 

In  order  to  improve  existing  supervisory  mechanisms,  a  risk  based  supervision  task  force  was  set  up  and  assigned  the 
task  of   understanding  the  objective  of   supervision  for  each  class  of   SEBI  registered  intermediaries  so  as  to  identify  and 
define various risk metrics, both quantitative and qualitative to explore and lay down the methodology for assigning ratings 
of   various  risk  metrics.  The  task  force  studied  both  the  risk-based  supervision  framework  in  other  jurisdictions  and  the 
framework adopted in India. It sought comments from market participants and accordingly finalised its report. The report 
seeks  to  provide  necessary  guidance  to  supervisory  divisions  to  formulate  their  policies  for  supervision  and  inspection  in 
the future. The approach recommended providing a combination of  onsite and offsite monitoring of  the intermediaries by 
SEBI  and  SROs. The  entities  falling  in  the  high  risk  group  are  subjected  to  stricter  monitoring  (offsite)  and  comprehensive 
inspections. Thematic inspections, as a supervisory tool, are to be utilised for specific purposes such as verifying compliance 
with recently issued regulatory requirements on references received from departments within SEBI, regulatory bodies, etc. 
or where a focused review of  assessing compliance in a particular area of  operations is needed.

To  maintain  consistency  and  uniformity  of   approach  by  stock  exchanges  for  taking  action  against  listed  entities  for  non-
compliance with certain important listing conditions, SEBI prescribed the standard operating procedure for suspension and 
revocation of  suspension of  trading in the shares. 

With  a  view  to  streamlining  and  strengthening  the  process  of   testing  software  used  in  or  related  to  trading  and  risk 
management, the process of  testing involves testing in a simulated test environment provided by the stock exchange, mock 
testing in close-to-real trading environment, a UAT by the stock broker and submission of  a system audit report to the stock 
exchange. In view of  the risk caused by the inability on the part of  software vendors to provide software or related services 
in a timely and continuous manner, it was suggested that stock exchanges may advise stock brokers to consider exploring 
the possibility of  establishing a ‘software escrow arrangement’ with their existing software vendors.

V. 

FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT
SEBI  notified  the  Foreign  Portfolio  Investors 
(FPIs)  Regulations  which  became  effective  from  June 
1,  2014.  Easier  entry  norms  and  an  operational 
framework  for  foreign  entities  in  the  new  FPI  regime 
have  made  the  Indian  market  a  more  attractive 
investment  destination.  During  the  year,  SEBI  issued 
details regarding the risk management framework for 
further development of  the FPI regime. Subsequently, 
FPIs were also allowed to participate in the exchange 
traded  currency  derivatives  segment.  Major  policy 
changes made during 2014-15 for bolstering the FPI 
segment are:

A. 

Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Regime 

a.  No Direct Registration with SEBI

applicants as FPIs on behalf  of  SEBI.

b.  Uniform Eligibility Criteria
 

A  uniform  eligibility  criterion  is  prescribed  for 
all  types  of   investors,  including  Category  III 
investors  (which  includes  foreign  individuals 
and foreign corporates).

c.  No  Requirement  of   being  Broad  Based  or 

 

Regulated
Funds  which  are  unregulated  and  not  broad 
based are eligible to register as Category III FPIs.

d.  No  Requirement  to  Register  Clients  as 

 

e. 
 

Broad Based FPIs
Investment  managers/investment 
advisors 
are  not  required  to  mandatorily  register  their 
clients as broad based FPIs.

Sharing of  KYC Documents with Banks
DDPs  can  share  relevant  KYC  documents 
of   FPIs  with  the  banks  concerned  based  on 
written  authorisation  from  the  FPIs.  This  will 
avoid duplication of  KYC for FPI.

subscription  through  the  ODI  route.  FPIs  shall 
issue  ODIs  only  to  those  subscribers  who  meet  the 
eligibility criteria as laid down in Regulation 4 of  the 
FPI Regulations, 2014. 

Further,  FPIs  shall  issue  ODIs  only  to  those 
subscribers  who  do  not  have  opaque  structure(s)  as 
defined under Explanation 1 of  Regulation 32(1)(f) of  
FPI Regulations, 2014.

Investment restrictions applicable to FPIs under 
Regulation 21(7) of  FPI Regulations, 2014 have been 
made  applicable  to  ODI  subscribers.  Two  or  more 
ODI  subscribers  having  a  common  beneficial  owner 
(BO)  shall  be  considered  together  as  a  single  ODI 
subscriber in the same manner as is being done in the 
case  of   FPIs.  Where  an  investor  has  investments  as

these 
investment  restrictions  shall  apply  on  the 
aggregate  of   FPI  investments  and  ODI  positions  held 
in  the  underlying  Indian  company.  In  other  words, 
investments  as  a  FPI  and  positions  held  as  an  ODI 
subscriber  will  be  clubbed  together  with  reference  to 
the said investment restrictions.

Developing  corporate  debt  markets  is  essential 
for India’s infrastructural financing needs and for the 
development  of   an  alternative  financing  mechanism 
for  corporates.  Through  various  policy  measures, 
SEBI  endeavours  to  spur  and  nurture  the  market 
and  encourage  issuers  and  investors.  A  regulatory 
framework  on

‘Security  based  Crowdfunding’

India  was  proposed  by  SEBI  in  2014-15  through  a 
consultation  paper.  The  paper  provides  for  access  to 
capital markets for start-ups and SMEs for their early 
stage funding needs and intends to balance this with 
investor  protection.  The  potential  of   the  market  can 
be  realised  on  the  back  of   policy  and  regulatory 
reforms  accompanied  by  initiatives  to  increase  retail 
investor  participation.  The  following  section  gives 
details  of   the  measures  taken  in  the  corporate  debt 
segment in 2014-15.

A.  Disclosure  of   Minimum  Subscription 

Amount
SEBI  has  made  it  mandatory  for  the  issuers  of  
debt  securities  to  disclose  the  minimum  subscription 
amount with respect to public issue of  debt issuances 
in  the  offer  document  and  this  is  specified  at  75 
percent.  If   the  issuer  does  not  receive  minimum 
subscription  of   its  base  issue  size  (75  percent),  then 
the  entire  application  monies  shall  be  refunded 
within  12  days  from  the  date  of   the  closure  of  
the  issue.  In  case  there  is  a  delay  by  the  issuer  in 
making  the  refund,  then  the  issuer  shall  refund  the 
subscription  amount  along  with  interest  at  the  rate 
of  15 percent per annum for the delayed period.

SEBI  has  provided  that  the  entities  coming  out 
with  public  issues  of   NCDs  shall  provide  granular 
disclosures  in  their  offer  documents  with  regard  to 
the  ‘object  of   the  issue’  including  the  percentage  of  
the  issue  proceeds  earmarked  for  each  ‘object  of   the 
issue.  Further,  the  amount  earmarked  for  ‘general 
corporate  purposes’  shall  not  exceed  25  percent  of  
the amount raised by the issuer in the proposed issue.

Issuers  coming  out  with  public 

issues  of  
NCDs  need  to  make  disclosures  in  accordance  with 
disclosure  requirements  as  specified  in  Schedule  II  to 
Companies  Act,  1956  and  disclosure  requirements 
as  specified 
in  Schedule  I  of   ILDS  Regulations, 
2008.  Since  Companies  Act,  1956  required  detailed 
disclosures,  these  have  not  been  repeated  in  ILDS 
Regulations,  2008.  However, 
it  has  now  been 
mandated  that  the  issuers  shall  make  additional 
disclosures  not  provided  for  in  the  Companies  Act, 
2013.  Some  of   these  additional  disclosures  pertain 
to  provisions  relating 
to  fictitious  applications, 
reservation  in  issues  and  utilisation  details  regarding 
previous issues.

It  is  understood  that  NBFCs  are  the  most 
frequent  users  of   the  debt  channel  and  most  of   the 
NBFCs  utilise  the  issue  proceeds  for  onward  lending. 
In  view  of   this,  NBFCs  shall  have  to  disclose  in  their 
offer  documents  details  with  regard  to  the  lending 
done  by  them  out  of   the  issue  proceeds  of   previous 
public  issues.  This  will  keep  the  investors  informed 
about  the  application/usage  of   the  money  borrowed 
from them by NBFCs.

B.  Amendments  to  the  SEBI 

(Issue  and 
Listing  of   Debt  Securities)  Regulations, 
2008
SEBI  has  amended 

(Issue  and 
Listing  of   Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008  vide 
notification  dated  March  24,  2015  to  provide 
enabling provisions for ‘consolidation and re-issuance 
of  debt securities’ and ‘right to call or redeem prior to 
maturity’.

VII.  INVESTOR PROTECTION AND AWARENESS
taking  various  regulatory 
investor 
measures  to  expedite  the  redressal  of  
grievances.  The  grievances 
investors 
lodged  by 
are  taken  up  with  the  respective  listed  company/
intermediary  and  are  monitored  on  a  regular  basis. 
SCORES  has  helped  investors  access  real  time  status 
of   their  grievances  since  they  can  log  onto  SCORES 
at any time and from anywhere and check the status 
of   the  grievance  with  the  help  of   a  username  and 
password  provided  to  them  at  the  time  of   lodging 
the  grievance.  Towards  the  mandate  of   investor 
protection,  a  major  thrust  during  2014-15  was  on 
enhanced  investor  awareness  and  education  and 
reaching out to more investors through a mass media 
campaign.  To  further  accentuate  retail  investors’ 
confidence  in  the  Indian  capital  market,  KYC  norms 
were simplified by introducing a one-time KYC policy. 
This  section  highlights  the  major  policy  initiatives 
taken  during  the  year  to  further  enhance  investor 
interest in securities markets.

A.  Rationalisation of  the KYC Process

a.  Rationalisation  of   KYC  norms  for  eligible 

foreign investors
Pursuant 

to 

the  report  submitted  by  a 
committee set up under the Chairmanship of  Shri K. 
M.  Chandrasekhar  on  ‘Rationalisation  of   Investment 
Routes  and  Monitoring  of   Foreign  Portfolio 
Investments’,  SEBI  rationalised  KYC  norms 
for 
eligible foreign investors investing under the portfolio 
investment scheme route.

Intermediaries  are  now  required  to 

follow 
risk  based  KYC  norms  depending  on  the  category 
of   the  investors.  Further,  clarifications  in  the  form 
of   a  FAQ  were  issued  on  May  23,  2014  based  on 
representations received from market participants.

b.  Amendment  to  SEBI  {KYC  (Know  Your 
Client)  Registration  Agency}  Regulations, 
2011
KRA  Regulations  were  amended  on  August 
11,  2014  to  provide  for  sharing  of   KYC  information 
with  other  regulators.  Entities  regulated  by  other 
regulators  in  the  financial  sector  may  access  the 
system  of   KRA  for  undertaking  KYC  of   their  clients 
who engage them for financial services.

c. 

Ticker on one-time KYC
To create awareness amongst investors on the one-
time KYC, SEBI has advised stock exchanges/depositories 
to display the following ticker on their websites:
 

‘KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities 
markets  -  once  KYC  is  done  through  a  SEBI 
registered  intermediary  (broker,  DP,  Mutual  Fund 
etc.),  you  need  not  undergo  the  same  process  again 
when you approach another intermediary.’

d. 

SARAL account opening form
With  a  view  to  facilitating  the  entry  of   new 
resident  individual  investors  and  encouraging  them 
to  participate  in  the  cash  market,  including  the 
disinvestment of  PSUs through the OFS process, SEBI 
has  prescribed  that  individual  investors  can  open  a 
trading and demat account by filling a simplified one 
page account opening form termed as ‘SARAL AOF’.

B. 

the 

Investor grievance handling mechanism
SEBI  has  been  taking  various  measures  to 
create  awareness  about 
investor  grievance 
handling mechanism and the various modes available 
to  an  investor.  To  increase  visibility  of   the  available 
mechanism,  SEBI  has  made  it  mandatory  for  all 
intermediaries  to  prominently  display  the  contact 
details  of   the  escalation  levels  in  all  their  offices. 
The  details  that  are  required  to  be  displayed  are 
the  contact  details  and  email  ID  of   the  compliance 
officer/key  management  person  of   the  intermediary, 
stock exchanges/depositories and SEBI.

Updation of  email IDs and contact details of  
investors

SEBI  has  been  taking  various  measures  to  curb 
unauthorised trading. One of  these initiatives requires 
stock exchanges to send SMS and email alerts directly 
to  investors  for  the  transactions  carried  out  in  their 
accounts  by  the  end  of   the  trading  day.  In  order  to 
ensure  that  clients  whose  mobile  numbers/email-IDs 
have not been updated in the exchange database, SEBI 
advised  the  stock  exchanges  to  direct  their  members 
to  obtain  these  updated  details  from  their  respective 
clients.  Accordingly,  NSE  and  BSE  issued  circulars  to 
their members advising them to update the email-IDs 
and mobile numbers of  their clients.

Further,  depositories  were  advised  to  instruct 
their  participants  to  ensure  that  a  separate  mobile 
number/email  address  was  uploaded  for  each  client. 
Under  exceptional  circumstances  the  participants 
may at the specific written request of  a client, upload 
the same mobile number/email address for more than 
one client provided such clients belong to one family.

VIII.  OTHER  POLICIES  AND  PROGRAMMES 
HAVING  A  BEARING  ON  THE  WORKING 
OF SECURITIES MARKET
During  2014-15,  regulatory  frameworks  were 
notified  with  a  view  to  bringing  in  more  participants 
under  the  regulatory  purview, 
introducing  new 
investment  avenues  to  investors  and  for  maintaining 
higher  standards  of   governance  and  transparency. 
This  section  throws  light  on  the  regulations  notified 
during  2014-15  to  further  widen  and  deepen  the 
capital market.

A. 

SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014 
A  consultative  paper  for  the  proposed  Research 
Analyst  Regulations  was  placed  on  the  SEBI  website 

into  effect 

for  public  comments  in  2013.  The  SEBI  (Research 
Analysts)  Regulations,  2014  were  notified  on 
September  1,  2014  and  came 
from 
December 1, 2014. These regulations seek to register 
and regulate individual research analysts and entities 
engaged  in  issuance  of   research  reports  or  research 
analyses and/or publication of  substance of  research 
reports or those who provide research reports or who 
make  ‘buy/sell/hold’  recommendations  of   a  security 
or who make recommendations on public offers such 
as  brokerage  houses,  merchant  bankers  and  proxy 
advisors.  These  regulations  specify  requirements 
to  foster  objectivity  and  transparency  in  research 
and  provide  investors  with  more  reliable  and  useful 
information  to  make  informed  decisions.  Also,  they 
seek  to  address  various  conflicts  of   interest  while 
making research recommendations as specified in the 
board  memorandum  and  in  the  consultation  paper 
published on RA Regulations. 

B.  Regulations on the Real Estate Investment 

Trust (REIT)
SEBI 
(Real 

Estate 

Investment 

Trusts) 
Regulations,  2014  were  notified  on  September  26, 
2014.  REITs  are  vehicles  which  enable  investments 
in  the  real  estate  sector.  A  REIT  in  India  is  allowed 
to invest mainly in completed and revenue generating 
assets  and  other  approved 
investments.  Further, 
REITs  will  have  to  distribute  a  majority  of   their 
income among unitholders.

C.  Regulations  on  Infrastructure  Investment 

Trust (InvIT)
SEBI notified the InvIT Regulations on September 
26,  2014.  InvIT  Regulations  provide  a  framework 
for  registration  and  regulation  of  
infrastructure 
investment  trusts  in  India.  Given  the  challenging 
phase of  infrastructure in the country today, InvITs are 
proposed  to  provide  a  suitable  structure  for  financing/
refinancing  of   infrastructure  projects  in  the  country. 
InvITs, as an investment vehicle, may aid:

i. 

ii. 

Providing  wider  and  long-term  refinance  for 
existing infrastructure projects.

Freeing  up  of   current  developer  capital  for 
reinvestment in new infrastructure projects.

iii.  Refinancing/takeout  of   existing  high  cost  debt 
with long-term low-cost capital and help banks

D. 

SEBI  (Foreign  Venture  Capital  Investors) 
Regulations, 2000
Amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Foreign  Venture 
Capital  Investors)  Regulations,  2000  were  notified 
on  December  30,  2014  allowing  FVCIs  to  invest  in 
a  core  investment  company  like  NBFCs  investing  in 
infrastructure  companies.  Allowing  investments  by 
FVCIs  in  infrastructure  core  investment  companies  is 
expected  to  boost  investments  in  the  infrastructure 
sector which will have further positive spillover effects 
on  the  economy.  Amendments  have  also  been  made 
for greater clarity and realignment of  the negative list 
in third schedule of  the Regulations.

In the current financial year SEBI, as a regulator, 
continued  to  pursue  its  prime  objective  of   investor 
assistance  and  investor  education  through  various 
policy 
investor  protection, 
market  development  and  effective  regulation.  Good 
corporate  governance  standards  are  essential  for  the 
integrity  of   corporations,  financial  institutions  and 
markets  and  they  also  have  a  bearing  on  the  growth 
and  stability  of   the  economy.  ‘Protecting  minority 
investors’  is  considered  an  important  indicator  of  
corporate  governance.  India  strengthened  minority 
investor  protections  by  requiring  greater  disclosure  of  
conflicts  of   interest  by  board  members  and  increasing 
the  remedies  available  in  case  of   prejudicial  related 
party  transactions.  According  to  a  World  Bank 
report,  India  ranked  seventh  globally  in  the  attribute

contributing  as  a  key  member  of   various 
international  standard  setting  bodies  and  global 
forums  in  their  on-going  work  programmes.  The 
major international engagement continues to be with 
IOSCO,  an  international  standard  setting  body  for 
securities  markets  and  with  the  Financial  Stability 
Board  (FSB),  a  body  set  up  to  promote  financial 
sector  reforms  in  the  world.  SEBI  plays  a  key  role  in 
IOSCO  committees  which  are  responsible  for  IOSCO 
principles  and  standards  across  IOSCO  membership. 
During  the  year,  SEBI  signed  MOUs  with  various 
counterparts  to  facilitate  mutual  cooperation  and 
ease in exchange of  information.

SEBI  believes  in  the  value  of   consultations 
with  all  the  stakeholders  and  has  set  up  advisory 
committees  in  all  major  areas  of   work  to  advice 
proactively  on 
the  development  and  regulation 
of   securities  markets.  Policy  decisions  are  taken 
after  consultations  with  the  stakeholders  and  by 
disseminating  policy  papers  for  public  comments. 
Further,  agenda  papers  submitted  to  the  board  and 
their decisions are also placed on the website. During 
the  year,  consultation  papers  on  areas  like  ‘security 
based  crowdfunding  in  India’  and  ‘revisiting  the 
capital  raising  process’  were  placed  on  the  SEBI 
website for public comments. With a view to enhance 
its  online  presence  and  disseminate 
information 
about  SEBI’s  international  engagements,  a  special 
section has been hosted on the SEBI website.

During 

the  year,  SEBI  was  vested  with 
additional  enforcement  powers  vide  the  Securities 
Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014. With these additional 
powers,  SEBI  has  been  empowered  to  call 
for 
information from any person, disgorge ill-gotten gains 
and  credit  them  in  IPEF  and  conduct  search  and 
seizure  operations.  SEBI  aims  to  focus  on  developing 
capabilities  to  effectively  utilise  the  new  powers  thus 
helping 
further  streamlining  the  enforcement 
process. 

in 

The  year  also  witnessed  the  launch  of   new 
investment  avenues  for  investors  with  notification 
of   appropriate  regulatory  framework.  Regulations 
on  REIT  and  InVIT  were  notified  during  the  year.  In 
addition,  SEBI  notified  new  regulations  on  research 
analysts 
to  promote  objectivity  and 
transparency  in  research  and  help  investors  to  make

point-to-point basis, the Sensex registered an increase 
of  5,571 points over 22,386 as on March 31, 2014, 
while  Nifty 
increased  by  1,787  points.  Further, 
during  the  year,  both  Sensex  and  Nifty  registered 
their  new  highest  level  of   29,682  on  January  29, 
2015 and peak of  8,996 attained by Nifty on March 
3,  2015.  The  turnover  and  market  capitalisation  of  
benchmark  indices  replicated  an  upward  trend  with 
a rise of  63.9 percent at BSE and 54.2 percent at NSE 
in  the  cash  segment  turnover.  During  the  year,  BSE 
and  NSE’s  market  capitalisation  increased  by  36.9 
and 36.4 percent respectively.

Apart from the large volumes attained in equity 
markets,  the  Indian  derivative  market  continued  to 
reflect  commendable  growth.  The  equity  derivatives 
segment  has  become  the  most  traded  segment  in 
India  with  a  total  volume  of   `  7.59  lakh  crore 
in  2014-15,  which  is  approximately  15  times  the 
turnover  of   the  cash  segment  in  the  corresponding 
year.  Nonetheless,  Indian  derivatives

an increase in volume of  exchange traded derivatives

In  recent  years,  the  capital  raising  trend  has 
shifted  towards  an  increased  use  of   the  private 
placement  route  by  the  corporate  sector.  Further, 
from  April  1,  2014,  the  reporting 
with  effect 
of   secondary  market 
in  corporate 
debt  market  was  discontinued  at  FIMMDA  and 
subsequently SEBI directed stock exchanges to report 
all  OTC  trades  in  corporate  bonds  on  any  one  of   the 
reporting  platforms  provided  in  the  debt  segment 
of   stock  exchanges.  In  the  wake  of   an  inactive 
primary  market,  private  placements  contributed  the 
maximum  share  in  the  total  resource  mobilisation 
during  the  year.  At  BSE  and  NSE  both  the  number 
and  amount  of   issues  raised  through  this  increased 
and  the  total  mobilisation  by  the  corporate  sector  in 
2014-15  stood  at  `  4,81,001  crore.  While  private 
placement  of   equity,  which 
includes  preferential 
allotments,  QIP  and  IPP,  raised  `  57,362  crore, 
private  placement  of   corporate  bonds

registered  an  increase  of   more  than  two  times  in 
2014-15,  while  capital  mobilisation  through  the 
OFS mechanism increased by nearly four times in the 
current year. In an endeavour to give further impetus 
to  the  primary  market,  SEBI  continued  to  usher  in  a 
series  of   reforms  in  this  year  as  well. To  further  ease 
the IPO process, the e-IPO facility is being introduced. 
E-voting  rights  to  shareholders  have  made  it  easier 
for  them  to  participate 
in  the  decision  making 
processes  of   companies  in  which  they  own  shares. 
To  address  the  funding  requirements  of   SMEs  and  to 
help  them  in  expansion,  SEBI  in  coordination  with 
SIDBI and the stock exchanges initiated an awareness 
programme.

With  the  commencement  of   the  FPI  regime, 
foreign  investments  too  strengthened  reflecting  the 
return  of   investor  confidence  in  the  markets.  The 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

cumulative  net  investment  of   FPIs  in  Indian  markets 
amounted  to  USD  226,103  million  at  the  end  of  
March  2015  compared  to  USD  180,405  million  in 
2013-14,  showing  an  increase  of   25.3  percent.  The 
assets  under  the  custody  of   custodians  across  the 
different  asset  classes  stood  at  `  61,87,619  crore  as 
at  March  31,  2015.  The  net  resource  mobilisation 
of  the mutual funds industry rose by 92.0 percent in 
2014-15 amidst new highs observed in the asset base 
of  the industry. 

SEBI’s persistent efforts to promote and regulate 
Indian  securities  markets  on  the  back  of   vigorous 
policy  reforms  were  evident  in  the  growing  statistics 
of   the  market.  During  the  year  SEBI  remained 
committed  to  its  approach  of   investor  protection 
and  empowerment.  While  the  market  fundamentals 
strengthened  as  the  year  progressed,  steadfast  policy 
measures encompassing all spheres of  market activity 
further emboldened the regulatory infrastructure and 
reposed investor confidence.

B.  PROSPECTS

The  world  economy  showed  signs  of   moderate 
growth  in  2014-15  with  uneven  prospects  across 
various  regions.  It  is  perceived  that  global  financial 
stability risks are shifting from advanced to emerging 
economies.  Against  the  backdrop  of   the  present 
global  scenario  Indian  securities  markets  continued 
to  evolve  on  the  back  of   various  policy  initiatives 
and  strengthened  macroeconomic 
fundamentals. 
The  impetus  was  instrumental  in  new  peaks  being 
achieved  by  certain  segments  of   securities  markets 
during the year.

A  developed  primary  market  is  essential  for 
providing  a  base  for  a  vibrant  secondary  market. 
SEBI  continued  the  on-going  process  of   reforms  in 
the  primary  market  to  improve  issuer  and  investor 
confidence.  In  2014-15,  SEBI  reviewed  the  extant 
Corporate  Governance  Framework  (Clause  49  of  
the  Listing  Agreement)  to  align  with  the  provisions 
of   the  Companies  Act,  2013  which  became  effective 
in  2014.  Renewed  focus  on  corporate  governance 
has  made  the  standards  dynamic,  evolved  and  in 
tune  with  the  times.  The  focus  in  the  coming  year 
will  be  on  supervising  the  implementation  of   these 
standards  by  listed  entities  along  with  monitoring 
of   listed  companies,  while  also  creating  awareness

listed  companies 

for  ensuring  a  better 
among 
compliance culture. To help investors understand the 
nuances  of   public  offers  and  ensure  adequate  and 
quality  disclosures,  SEBI  reviewed  the  disclosures 
and  application  form  in  public  issues.  While  SEBI 
implemented  the  concept  of   a  general  information 
document,  a  review  of   disclosure  requirements  in 
the Red Herring Prospectus is proposed to be realised 
in  the  next  year.  The  concept  of   system  driven 
disclosures is also proposed with a view to integrating 
disclosures  made  under  different  regulations  to 
reduce the number of  times that the same disclosure 
is  required  to  be  made  by  an  individual/company. 
Such  system-driven  disclosures  could  significantly 
help 
in  monitoring  compliance  on  a  real-time 
basis  while  reducing  the  burden  of   compliance  on 
individuals.

Indian  securities  markets  stand  at  par  with 
global standards in terms of  trading and surveillance 
mechanisms.  However,  challenges  persist  in  view  of  
on-going  technological  advancements  paving  the 
way  for  increased  innovations  and  complexities  in 
the  market  and  in  its  products.  In  the  face  of   these, 
SEBI  endeavours  to  maintain  the  integrity  of   the 
market  and  promotes  seamless  trading,  clearing  and 
settlement  processes  in  securities  markets.  In  view 
of   this,  the  key  reforms  implemented  include  Core 
SGF,  Default  Waterfall  and  Stress  Testing  norms  for 
risk  management,  measures  for  facilitating  exit  from 
stock  exchanges,  risk  management  policy  at  the 
depositories,  modified  IPF  guidelines  and  the  index 
based  circuit  breaker  mechanism.  In  the  coming 
year,  SEBI  is  planning  a  slew  of   initiatives  in  the 
secondary  market.  To  enable  raising  of   capital  by 
knowledge based start-ups, a consultative process has 
been  initiated  by  issuance  of   a  discussion  paper  and 
the  final  guidelines  on  this  are  under  preparation. 
Given the criticality of  cyber security among FMIs in 
Indian securities markets, SEBI assessed the adequacy 
of   the  technology  risk  management 
framework 
deployed by FMIs. SEBI intends to lay down the broad 
principles  that  FMIs  will  be  required  to  comply  with 
while  designing  and  implementing  their  IT/cyber 
security policies. Leveraging technology, SEBI is in the 
advanced stages of  introducing Aadhaar based e-KYC 
for  capital  markets  to  enable  simpler  processing  and 
for  setting  up  a  benchmark  KYC  across  the  financial 

33

sectors. To bring in index providers/activities of  index 
providers under the regulatory purview, a regulatory 
framework  with  Code  of   Conduct  and  disclosures 
and  transparency  is  being  reviewed  by  SEBI.  Further 
with  a  view  to  having  all  securities  related  benefits 
at  a  single  point,  a  proposal  for  enabling  depositories 
to  distribute  all  cash  benefits,  including  dividend, 
interest and redemption proceeds to their investors is 
under consideration.

In  its  effort  to  make  Indian  securities  markets 
more  attractive 
investors,  SEBI  has 
simplified  the  investment  and  registration  norms  for 
foreign  investors  by  notifying  FPI  Regulations  with 
focus on creating an investor conducive environment. 
With  a  view  to  improving  accessibility  of   mutual 
fund  products,  re-energising  the  distribution  system, 
ensuring  greater  transparency  and  addressing  issues 
concerning investor protection and efforts to increase 
their  awareness  levels,  SEBI  has  taken  a  number  of  
steps over the last few years. While being a regulator, 
SEBI  undertakes  a  continuous  regulatory  review;  it 
also  aspires  to  utilise  the  huge  potential  given  that 
industry has allowed enhanced participation of  larger 
categories  of   investors  and  introduced  innovative 
product-mixes.  In  an  attempt  to  bring  in  research 
analysts  under  the  regulatory  purview,  Research 
Analysts  Regulations  were  notified.  New  products 
have  been  launched  with  notification  of   real  estate

investment 
trusts.  Considering  its  nascent  stage,  the  regulatory 
frameworks  for  REITs/InvITs  will  be  followed  up 
during  2015-16  so  as  to  develop  market  interest. 
Introduction  of   debt  securities  by  municipalities  is 
underway  as  the  draft  regulations  for  these  have 
been  put  in  public  domain  as  part  of   the  public 
consultative process.

SEBI’s  surveillance  mechanisms  have  been 
effectively  monitoring  the  markets  and  aberrations 
have  been  investigated  to  ensure  a  free  and  fair 
market.  While 
surveillance 
capabilities  are  equipped  for  generating  alerts  to 
facilitate  detection  of   market  manipulations,  the 
dynamic  nature  of   securities  markets  calls 
for 
upgradation  of   surveillance  systems  with  enhanced 
skill  sets.  To  this  end,  SEBI  aims  to  conduct  a 
comprehensive  review  of   its  surveillance  systems 
by  engaging  external  expertise  in  order  to  make 

34

the  systems  more  transparent  and  competitive.  The 
process  for  a  comprehensive  upgradation  of   DWBIS 
through  a  world  class  data  centre  to  ensure  data 
storage  and  processing  requirements  is  proposed  for 
2015-16.

Over  the  years,  SEBI  has  built  a  reputation  of  
being a credible enforcement agency. In order to align 
with  international  standards,  SEBI  has  revamped  its 
insider  trading  regulations  and  notified  regulations 
on settlement of  administrative and civil proceedings. 
SEBI  has  been  taking  various  regulatory  actions 
especially  those  pertaining  to  ponzi  schemes/CIS 
to  make  Indian  securities  markets  more  secure  and 
regulated.  SEBI  aims  to  continuously  upgrade  its 
human  and  technological  potential  so  that  it  can 
effectively  utilise  the  additional  enforcement  powers 
vested  by  the  amendment  to  the  SEBI  Act  that  was 
carried out recently.

While protecting investors in securities markets, 
SEBI  is  also  committed  to  its  objective  of   promoting 
awareness  about  financial  markets  in  the  public 
domain  and  has  continued  its  efforts  at  educating 
and  protecting  investors  through  workshops,  the 
Grievance  Redressal  Mechanism  Centre,  seminars 
and  more  local  offices.  To  this  end,  SEBI  aims  to 
promote  financial  education

FSDC  to  create  a  financially  aware  and  empowered

In  addition,  SEBI  is  looking  at  adopting  other  media 

to

such  as  outdoor  media/advertising  as  well  as  social 
media to make learning about securities markets easy 
and  fun-based.  With  a  view  to  further  enhancing 
the  efficiency  and  reach  of   SCORES,  SEBI  aims  to 
conduct a user satisfaction survey and align SCORES 
with  comparable  systems  across  the  agencies.  The 
undergoing project of  having a new NISM campus at 
Patalganga with state-of-the-art education facilities in 
the  field  of   finance  is  expected  to  accelerate  capacity 
building  and  talent  acquisition  in  capital  markets.  It 
will  also  bolster  financial  education  initiatives  and 
further help in spreading the reach of  capital markets 
in India.

Pursuant  to  the  announcement 

in  Union 
Budget  2015-16  the  commodities  market  regulator 
FMC  is  being  merged  with  SEBI  so  as  to  strengthen

with  a  wide  range  of   products  to  participate  in  the 
commodities  space.  SEBI  has  initiated  an  assessment 
of  regulatory concerns and utilisation of  appropriate 
human,  infrastructure  and  technological  capabilities 
to ensure a smooth and timely transition.

Amidst  the  dynamic  and  developing  financial 
landscape, SEBI has the difficult and complex task of  
maintaining  market  integrity  and  investor  protection 
while being uncompromising in its strides to embrace 
new  market  developments.  In  the  coming  year, 
SEBI  will  continue  to  be  guided  by  its  mandate  and 
recently  acquired  powers  to  expand  its  regulatory 
ambit  and  provide  an  orderly  market  while 
simultaneously tackling the issues that have been the 
root  cause  of   investor  grievances  in  some  sections 
of   the  market.  While  embracing  international  best 
practices in some areas, SEBI will endeavour to make 
Indian securities markets global leaders in others.

was  higher  as  compared  to  38  in  2013-14.  Of   the 
46  IPOs,  39  have  been  listed  on  the  SME  platform. 
The  amount  raised  through  IPOs  in  2014-15  was 
higher  at  `  3,039  crore  as  compared  to  `  1,236 
crore  during  2013-14.  `  1,141  crore  was  mobilised 
through  offers 
for  sale  by  existing  shareholders 
and  seven  IPOs  and  FPOs  used  this  mechanism  to 
raise  resources.  There  was  no  FPO  in  2014-15  as 
compared to two FPOs worth `  7,457 crore in 2013-
14.  The  share  of   public  issues  in  the  total  resource 
mobilisation decreased to 64.8 percent during 2014-

share  of   rights  issues  increased  from  8.2  percent  in 
2013-14  to  35.2  percent  in  2014-15.  (Chart  2.1) 
The share of  debt issues in total resource mobilisation

Size-wise Resource Mobilisation
In  tandem  with  the  trend  observed  in  past 
years, issues above `  500 crore had a major share in 
the  primary  market  for  resource  mobilisation.  These 
larger issues had a share of  55.5 percent in resource 
mobilisation in 2014-15 as compared to 91.3 percent 
in 2013-14. (Table 2.4)

Part Two: Review of Working and Operations of the SEBI

The  average  size  of   an  issue  (including  public 
and  rights)  which  accessed  the  primary  market  in 
2014-15  decreased  to  `  218  crore  as  compared 
to  `  618  crore  in  2013-14.  In  2014-15,  the  mean 
public  issue  size  was  `  178  crore  as  compared  to 
`  681 crore in 2013-14. However, the mean IPO size 
increased from `  33 crore in 2013-14 to `  66 crore

II.  Resource  Mobilisation  through  QIP  and 

IPP

A.  QIP and IPP

The  process  of   qualified  institutions’  placement 
(QIP)  was  introduced  by  SEBI  in  2006  to  enable 
listed companies to raise capital in the form of  equity 
shares,  fully  and  partly  convertible  debentures  or 
any  securities  other  than  warrants  to  a  qualified 
institutional buyer (QIB).

The  IPP  route  was  introduced  by  SEBI  under 
Chapter  VIII-A  of   SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations,  2009 
during the financial year 2011-12 for the purpose of  
achieving  minimum  public  shareholding  in  terms  of  

Part Two: Review of Working and Operations of the SEBI

Rule  19(2)  (b)  and  19A  of   the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation)  Rules,  1957.  Under  Chapter  VIII-A 
of   the  ICDR  Regulations,  any  offer,  allocation  and 
allotment  of   securities  under  the  IPP  route  shall  be 
made only to QIBs.

During  2014-15,  51  issues  raised  a  total  of  
`  29,102  crore  through  the  QIP  and  IPP  route, 
which was more than twice from the `  13,663 crore 
raised in 2013-14. (Table 2.7)

There  was  one  IPP 

in  2014-15  as 
compared to 10 in 2013-14. The total amount raised 
through  the  IPP  issue  was  `  419  crore  in  2014-15 
as compared to `  4,101 crore in 2013-14.

B.  Offer for Sale through the Stock Exchange 

Mechanism
The  offer  for  sale  (OFS)  through  the  stock 
exchange  mechanism  was  introduced  in  February 
2012  in  order  to  facilitate  promoters  to  dilute  their 
holdings in listed companies in a transparent manner 
with  wider  participation.  In  2014-15,  promoters 

of   22  companies  used  this  route  through  BSE  and 
NSE  to  conform  to  public  shareholding  norms  as 
compared  to  71  companies  in  2013-14.  Twenty-
two  companies  came  out  with  26  OFS  issues  during 
2014-15.  The  allotted  value  through  offer 
for 
sale  increased  from  `  6,993  in  2013-14  crore  to 
`  26,875 crore in 2014-15. (Table 2.8)

III.  Resource 

Mobilisation 

through 

Preferential Allotment
allotment 
Preferential 

is 

the 

allotment 
of   securities/shares  on  a  preferential  basis  to  a 
select  group  of   investors  which  is  covered  under 
Chapter  VII  of   SEBI  (Issue  of   Capital  and  Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2009.  It  provides  the 
framework  for  preferential  issues  of   equity  shares/
fully convertible debentures (FCDs)/partly convertible 

debentures (PCDs) or any other financial instruments 
which  will  be  converted  to  or  exchanged  with  equity 
shares  at  a  later  date  by  listed  companies  whose 
equity share capital is listed on any stock exchange to 
any  select  group  of   persons  as  per  the  Section  62(1)
(c) of  the Companies Act, 2013.

During  2014-15,  419  preferential  issues  raised 
`  28,260  crore  compared  to  411  preferential  issues 
which raised `  46,463 crore in 2013-14. (Table 2.9)

placement  of   corporate  debt  has  been  increasingly 
used  by  corporate  entities 
in  recent  years.  In 

through 

2014-15,  2,611 
issues  were  made  and  a  total 
of   `  4,04,137  crore  was  raised  through  private 
placements  which 
is  46.4  percent  higher  as 
compared to `  2,76,054 crore raised through 1,924

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Global  markets  registered  moderate  growth 
in  2014-15,  similar  to  the  trend  observed 
in 
previous  years  though  they  received  a  boost  in  the 
form  of   lower  oil  prices.  US  experienced  stronger 
than  expected  growth  on  the  back  of   improved 
consumption  and  consumer  confidence.  While  the 
other  advanced  and  emerging  economies  exhibited 
weaker  performances,  the  markets  in  Asia  Pacific 
performed  modestly  better  than  the  others  on 
account  of   domestic  vulnerabilities,  effects  of   aging 
populations  and 
infrastructure  bottlenecks.  The 
growth  in  the  Euro  area  was  weaker  than  expected. 
Domestic  issues  in  Japan  and  China  that  surfaced 
last  year  resulted  in  diminished  growth  rates  with 
Japan 
in  Q3  of  
2014.  Lower  oil  prices  and  increased  geopolitical 
tensions hampered the growth in Russia and in other 
economies  in  the  Commonwealth  of   Independent 
States group.

While 

the  US  Federal  Reserve  ended 

its 
quantitative  easing  stimulus  programme  that  began 
in  2008  in  October  2014,  ECB  and  Japan  continued 
with  their  stimulus  programmes  in  the  second  half  
of   2014-15.  In  comparison  to  last  year,  a  majority 
of   the  indices  considered  showed  positive  returns. 
Among the emerging markets the year-on-year index 
change  was  the  highest  in  China  (83.1  percent) 
followed by Argentina (58.9 percent) and India (26.3 
percent) (Chart 2.5).

Among the developed equity markets, the year-
on-year  index  changes  were  the  highest  in  Japan 
(29.8  percent)  followed  by  Germany  (24.6  percent) 
and  Europe  (16.0  percent).  Declines  were  registered 
in  Russia  (29.4  percent),  Colombia  (28.0  percent) 
and Malaysia (0.9 percent).

Widening  the  geographical  reach  of   capital 
markets  is  one  of   the  important  aspects  of   developing 
of  securities markets in India (Table 2.16). About 60.5 
percent of  the total turnover of  BSE and 58.4  percent 
of   the  total  turnover  of   NSE  was  concentrated  in 
Mumbai  and  Thane.  In  addition,  at  NSE  the  highest 
turnover  was  recorded 
in  Delhi/Ghaziabad  which 
contributed  10.9  percent  and  in  Calcutta/Howrah 

which  accounted  for  6.6  percent  of   the  turnover.  On 
the  other  hand  at  BSE,  Kolkata  and  others  accounted 
for 9.6 and 7.2 percent of the total turnover respectively. 
The  top  five  cities  accounted  for  80.2  percent  of  the 
turnover  at  NSE  during  2014-15  compared  to  83.9 
percent  in  2013-14.  At  BSE,  85.3  percent  of  the 
turnover was contributed by top five cities during 2014-
15 compared to 78.2 percent in 2013-14.

IV.  Market Capitalisation

Market  capitalisation  is  the  total  value  of   a 
publicly  traded  company’s  outstanding  shares  at  any 
point. The  market  capitalisation  at  BSE  rose  by  36.9 
percent  to  `  1,01,49,290  crore  in  2014-15  from 
`  74,15,296  crore  in  2013-14.  (Table  2.19)  On  the 
other hand, at NSE market capitalisation increased by 
36.4 percent to `  99,30,122 crore in 2014-15 from 
`  72,77,720 crore in 2013-14. The increase at both 
BSE and NSE was the highest in May 2014.

At  BSE,  the  market  capitalisation  of   the  shares 
included  in  the  BSE  benchmark  index,  the  S&P  BSE 

Table 2.19: Market Capitalisation at BSE 

Sensex  increased  by  22.0  percent  in  2014-15  (Table 
2.19).  Among  the  sectoral  indices  considered,  the 
S&P  Bankex  observed  the  most  rise  of   42.2  percent 
in  market  capitalisation  as  compared  to  the  previous 
year.  During  the  year,  market  capitalisation  of   the 
shares  included  in  the  CNX  Nifty  index  increased 
by  31.1  percent  (Table  2.20).  Market  capitalisation 
increased  for  all  the  indices  analysed  for  NSE  in 
2014-15  as  compared  to  the  previous  year.  At  NSE, 
among  the  sectoral  indices  analysed,  the  increase  in 
market capitalisation was the highest for CNX Midcap 
(49.4 percent) followed by CNX Bank (48.1 percent).

Stock Market Indicators
Ratios  such  as  market  capitalisation  to  GDP 
(m-cap  ratio),  traded  value  to  GDP  (traded  value 
ratio) and price to earnings per share (P/E ratio) were 
observed  to  estimate  the  extent  of   development  of  
the  stock  market.  After  declining  for  three  successive 
years  market  capitalisation  ratios  had  improved  in 
2013-14. These continued to improve further during 
2014-15.  The  BSE  market  capitalisation  to  GDP 
ratio  increased  from  65.4  percent  in  2013-14  to 

Table 2.21: Select Ratios Relating to Stock Market

80.2  percent  in  2014-15.  Similarly,  at  NSE  the  ratio 
increased  from  64.1  percent  in  2013-14  to  78.5  in 
2014-15.  (Table  2.21)  The  all-India  cash  turnover 
to  GDP  ratio  increased  in  2014-15  in  contrast  to  a 
decline  that  was  observed  during  preceding  years. 
The  ratio 
from  29.5 
percent  in  2013-14.  In  the  derivatives  segment 
there  was  an  increase  in  the  turnover-GDP  ratio 
from  419.4  percent  in  2013-14  to  600.4  percent  in  
2014-15.

The  price-earnings  ratio  (P/E)  is  reflective  of  
the  valuation  of   shares  (Table  2.22).  As  on  March 
31,  2015  the  P/E  ratios  of   Sensex  and  Nifty  were 
19.5  and  22.7  respectively  as  compared  to  18.3  and 
18.9  respectively  on  March  31,  2014.  Month-wise 
data  indicate  that  the  P/E  ratios  of   the  Sensex  were 

the  lowest  in  May  2014  while  that  of   Nifty  were  the 
lowest in April 2014. During 2014-15, there was an 
increase  in  the  P/E  ratios  of   all  the  indices  analysed. 
The P/E ratio of  Nifty was high as compared to other 
sectoral and mid-cap indices.

VI.  Volatility in Stock Markets

In 2014-15, the Indian equity markets reached 
newer  heights  outshining  the  peaks  observed  in  the 
previous  year.  The  benchmark  indices  and  market 
capitalisation 
in  the  secondary  market  attained 
all-time  high  figures.  On  the  back  of   a  pick-up  in 
advanced  economies  and  a  slowdown  in  emerging 
markets  global  growth  remained  moderate.  Robust 
recovery figures in the US and outperformance in the 
markets  in  Asia  Pacific  as  compared  to  other  regions 

led global growth amid weak growth in Europe, Latin 
America,  the  Commonwealth  of   Independent  States 
and  the  Middle  East.  Strengthening  of   currency 
in  real  effective  terms,  policy  reforms,  a  pick-up  in 
investments  and  lower  oil  prices  all  propelled  India’s 
growth engine in 2014-15.

India  VIX,  India’s  first  volatility  index,  indicates 
investors’  perceptions  of   the  market’s  volatility  in  the 
next 30 calendar days. The India VIX index had closed 
at  21.6  on  March  31,  2014  compared  to  14.5  on 
March 31, 2015 registering a decline of  32.9 percent, 
indicating investors’ expectation of  falling volatility.

The  annualised  volatility  of  

the  Sensex, 
measured  by  the  standard  deviation  of   log  returns, 
decreased  to  13.5  percent  in  2014-15  from  17.5 
percent 
in  2013-14.  A  similar  trend  was  also 
observed  for  Nifty  which  moved  down  from  18.1  to 
13.5  percent  during  the  same  period  (Table  2.24). 
The  highest  volatility  among  the  other  indices  was

was  79.5  and  77.7  percent  respectively  (Table  2.27). 
The share of  the top 100 securities in the annual cash 
market’s  turnover  in  2014-15  at  NSE  and  BSE  was 
70.9  and  54.6  percent  respectively.  At  NSE,  the  share 
of   participants  in  the  annual  cash  market  turnover

exiting  exchanges,  the  turnover  in  subsidiaries  is 
considered  upto  the  date  of   the  exit  order.  During 
2014-15,  approximately  all  of

IX.  Dematerialisation

is 

the  process 

Dematerialisation 

through 
which  securities  in  physical  form  are  converted  to 
electronic form. Dematerialisation allows investments 
to  be  handled  in  an  effective  manner  by  investors. 
Dematerialisation  of   shares  has  been  an  important 
milestone in the record of  Indian capital markets as it 
has stirred the micro-structure of  markets in general 
and of  stock exchanges in particular.

At  the  end  of   March  2015,  there  are  137.1 
lakh  demat  accounts  at  NSDL  and  96.1  lakh  demat 
accounts  at  CDSL;  5,943  companies  had  signed  up 
for  dematerialisation  at  NSDL  and  6,486  at  CDSL 

56

as  on  March  31,  2015  (Table  2.31).  The  quantity 
of   dematerialised  securities  at  NSDL  increased  by 
9.0  percent  to  38,51,852  lakh  in  2014-15  from 
35,33,376  lakh  in  2013-14.  At  CDSL,  the  quantity 
of  dematerialised securities increased by 22.8 percent 
from  9,82,724  lakh  in  2013-14  to  12,06,908  lakh 
in  2014-15.  The  number  of   shares  settled  in  demat 
form  and  the  value  of   shares  settled  in  demat  form 
increased  at  both  NSDL  and  CDSL.  Similarly  the 
quantity  of   securities  in  demat  form  and  their  value 
observed  an  increase  at  both  NSDL  and  CDSL  in 
2014-15.  At  NSDL  the  total  value  of   demat  settled 
shares  increased  by  54.5  percent  from  `  13,39,802 
crore  in  2013-14  to  `  20,69,409  crore  in  2014-15. 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

However, at CDSL the value of  shares settled in demat 
increased  by  77.1  percent  from  `  3,09,767  crore  in 
2013-14  to  `  5,48,511  crore  in  2014-15. The  ratio 
of   dematerialised  equity  shares  to  total  outstanding 
shares of  listed companies was 85.0 percent at NSDL 
and 13.6 percent at CDSL at the end of  2014-15.

apart  from  equity  shares.  The  total  dematerialised 
value  of   commercial  papers 
increased  at  both

of   commercial  papers  at  CDSL  also 
increased 
from  `  143  crore  in  2013-14  to  `  413  crore  in 
2014-15.  The  number  of   active  instruments  and

X.  Derivatives Segment

in 

A  derivative  as  defined 

the  Securities 
Contracts (Regulations) Act is a security derived from 
a  debt  instrument,  share,  loan,  whether  secured  or 
unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences 
or  any  other  form  of   security.  With  Securities  Laws 
(Second  Amendment)  Act,  1999,  derivatives  have 
been  included  in  the  definition  of   securities.  During 
the  year,  in  the  currency  derivatives  segment  USE 
stopped  providing  trading  facilities  to  its  members 
from  December  29,  2014  vide  circular  number 
USE/CMPL/628/2014.  USE 
in  the  process  of  
amalgamating  with  BSE  Limited  subject  to  statutory 

is 

approvals.  The  equity  derivatives  market  contributes 
approximately 93 percent of  the total traded value in 
the secondary market.

A.  The Equity Derivatives Segment

In  recent  years  the  equity  derivatives  segment 
has  been  the  most  traded  and  valued  segment.  The 
turnover  to  GDP  ratio  for  2014-15  was  at  an  all-
time  high  of   600,  which  in  itself   illustrates  the 
kind  of   liquidity  that  this  market  has.  The  World 
Federation  of   Exchanges  (WFE)  in  its  2014  report 
said  that  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  global  equity 
derivative  volumes  (1.7  percent)  which  was  mainly 
due  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of   index  options 
traded in India. The total turnover in 2014-15 in the 
derivatives  segment  was  approximately  15  times  the 
turnover  in  the  cash  market  and  was  59.7  percent 
higher  than  the  total  turnover  recorded  in  2013-14. 
(Chart  2.10)  NSE  had  a  majority  share  in  trading 
volumes  at  73.2  percent  while  BSE  contributed  26.8 
percent.

The  total  number  of   contracts  traded 

in 
NSE’s  derivative  segment  increased  by  43.0  percent 
to  183.7  crore  in  2014-15  from  128.4  crore  in 
2013-14,  whereas,  at  BSE  the  number  of   contracts 
traded  increased  by  67.4  percent  from  30.2  crore 
in  2013-14  to  50.5  crore  in  2014-15.  The  value 
of   the  contracts  traded  in  the  derivative  segment  at 
NSE  increased  by  45.5  percent  to  `  5.56  crore  in 
2014-15  from  `  3.82  crore  in  2013-14,  whereas 

the  turnover  in  the  derivatives  segment  at  BSE  more 
than  doubled  to  `  2,03,62,741  crore  in  2014-15 
from  `  92,19,434  crore  in  2013-14.  MSEI  recorded 
a  negligible  turnover  of   `  95  crore  during  the 
year.  The  open  interest  in  NSE’s  derivative  segment 
increased by 44.2 percent to `  1,79,344 crore at the 
end of  2014-15 up from `  1,24,378 crore at the end 
of  2013-14 (Table 2.34).

The  monthly 

in  March  2015 

the  derivatives 
segment  at  NSE  recorded  an  encouraging  trend 
during  2014-15.  The  highest 
turnover  was 
(`  56,91,524  crore) 
recorded 
followed  by  January  2015  (`  55,89,904  crore) 
and  February  2015  (`  54,32,152  crore).  Growth 
in  BSE’s  derivatives  turnover  was  the  highest  in 
November  2014  (`  31,40,459  crore)  followed  by 
September 2014 (`  24,74,709 crore) and July 2014 
(`  22,54,389  crore).  The  average  daily  turnover  at 
NSE  in  2014-15  increased  by  50.3  percent  to  `  2, 
28,833  crore  from  `  1,  52,237  crore  in  2013-14 
while  at  BSE  it  more  than  doubled  from  `  36,371 
crore to `  83,797 crore.

Index  options  have  gained  a  share  among 
various  derivative  products  traded  in  the  Indian 
derivatives  market.  Calendar  year  2014  saw  a  surge 

in  turnover  in  index  options  to  the  extent  that  WFE 
contributed 
in  derivatives 
globally  to  this  growth  without  which  the  growth 
would have been negative (Table 2.35).

increase 

During  2014-15, 

index  options  accounted 
for  a  major  share  at  NSE  and  BSE  at  71.8  and  98.9 
percent respectively. The share of  single stock futures 
at NSE was 14.9 percent while it was 0.8 percent for 
the  MSEI  and  nil  for  BSE. The  share  of   index  futures 
constituted  7.4  percent  of   the  turnover  of   the  NSE 
derivatives  market  in  2014-15  while  it  contributed 
0.2  percent  at  BSE.  In  2014-15  the  share  of   stock 
options  at  NSE  was  5.9  percent  while  at  BSE  it  was 
0.9  percent  (Chart  2.11).Tables  2.35  and  2.36

15. The  percentage  share  in  traded  value  by  trading 
members  and  trading-cum-self   clearing  members 
was 34.9 and 28.0 percent respectively (Table 2.43).

Participant-wise share in NSE F&O turnover for 

2014-15 shows that proprietary trades accounted for 
an  average  50.9  percent  share  in  the  total  turnover 
(Chart  2.12).  While  FPIs  accounted  for  a  share  of  
11.4 percent in the total turnover the others category 
comprising  retail,  HNIs  and  private  and  public 
companies  had  an  average  share  of   37.4  percent 
in  the  total  turnover;  mutual  funds  constituted  a 
miniscule  share  of   0.3  percent.  In  the  BSE  F&O 
turnover, proprietary trades accounted for an average 
share  of   87.8  percent  followed  by  others  at  12.1

Trends in Interest Rates Derivatives
Interest  rate  futures  contracts  are  contracts 
based  on  a  list  of   underlying  as  may  be  specified  by 
the  exchange  and  approved  by  SEBI  from  time  to 
time.  The  underlying  asset  for  interest  rate  futures 
is  an  interest  bearing  instrument.  BSE,  NSE  and 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

MSEI  started  interest  rate  derivatives  trading  in  their 
respective exchanges during the last financial year.

The  trends  in  turnover  and  open  interest  in 
interest rate at NSE, BSE and MSEI are shown in Table 
2.40.  During  2014-15,  the  total  turnover  in  the 
interest rate derivative segment registered an increase 
of   nearly  10  times.  NSE  witnessed  a  turnover  of  
`  4,21,558  in  2014-15  as  compared  to  `  30,173 
crore  in  2013-14.  At  BSE  the  turnover  increased 
from  `  7,191  crore  in  2013-14  to  `  41,913  crore 
in  2014-15.  MSEI  also  recorded  a  surge  in  turnover 

63

from  `  2,580  crore  in  2013-14  to  `  10,312  crore 
in  2014-15.  NSE  contributed  a  major  share  to  the 
turnover  at  89.0  percent  while  BSE  contributed  8.8 
percent  and  MSEI  contributed  2.2  percent  (Table 
2.46).
D.  Trends in VIX Futures Segment

NSE  launched  trading  in  futures  contracts  on 
India  VIX  in  the  futures  and  options  segment  w.e.f. 
February  26,  2014.  India  VIX  is  a  volatility  index 

Table 2.47: Trends in VIX futures segment at NSE

based  on  index  options  prices  of   Nifty.  India  VIX  is 
computed  using  the  best  bid  and  ask  quotes  of   the 
out-of-the-money  near  and  mid-month  Nifty  options 
contracts  which  are  traded  on  the  F&O  segment  at 
NSE. India VIX indicates the investors’ perceptions of  
the market’s volatility in the near term. The turnover 
in India VIX was recorded at `  2,256 crore in 2014-
15  compared  to  `  2,193  crore  in  2013-14  (Table

3. MUTUAL FUNDS

The  Indian  mutual  fund  industry  has  been  one 
of  the fastest growing and most competitive segments 
of  the financial sector. Its net inflow has been highest 
since 2007-08 and the assets under management are 
at  an  all-time  high. This  growth  may  be  contributed 
both  to  a  positive  outlook  as  well  as  well-timed  and 
paced  initiatives  by  SEBI  to  re-energise  the  mutual

gross  resource  mobilisation  and  100.4  percent  in 
net  resource  mobilisation.  The  corresponding  share 
of   UTI  mutual  funds  and  other  public  sector  mutual 
funds  was  10.2  and  7.4  percent  respectively  in  gross 
resource  mobilisation.  While  other  public  sector 
mutual  funds  contributed  0.8  percent  to  the  net 
resource  mobilisation,  the  UTI  mutual  funds  had  net 
redemption of  1.2 percent.

In  absolute  terms,  gross  resource  mobilisation 
by  private  sector  mutual 
funds  rose  by  13.6 
percent  to  `  91,43,962  crore  in  2014-15  from

2014-15  compared  to  `  48,838  crore  in  2013-14. 
Net  resources  raised  by  other  public  sector  mutual 
funds  were  much  lesser  at  `  865  crore  in  2014-15 
representing a decline of  80.9 percent.

In  contrast  to  the  trends  observed 

in  the 
past,  during  2014-15,  while  open-ended  schemes 
witnessed  net  inflows  (except  UTI  mutual  funds), 
close-ended schemes recorded net outflows.

A  scheme-wise  pattern  reveals  that  net  inflows 
were  positive  for  all  the  scheme  categories  except  the 
fund  of   funds  investing  overseas  schemes.  Growth/
equity  oriented  schemes  registered  the  highest  net 
inflows  amounting  to  `  71,030  crore  followed  by 
income/debt  oriented  schemes  at  `  22,556  crore 
in  2014-15.  Other  schemes  under  growth/equity 
oriented  schemes  registered  an  inflow  of   `  68,121 
crore followed by balanced schemes at `  9,826 crore 
and  liquid/money  market  schemes  at  `  9,781  crore 
(Table 2.50).

AUM  was  the  highest  for  income/debt  oriented 
schemes  at  `  6,94,128  crore  with  a  growth  of  
15.5  percent  while  AUM  for  growth/equity  oriented 
schemes  increased  by  80.6  percent  to  `  3,45,139 
crore.  AUM  of   gilt  schemes  in  2014-15  increased  by 
139  percent,  followed  by  a  rise  of   84.6  percent  in 
‘others’  schemes  of   growth/equity  oriented  schemes 
and  a  78.0  percent  increase  in  ‘other’  ETF  schemes. 
Except  the  fund  of   funds  investing  overseas  schemes 
and gold ETFs, all the schemes registered an increase 
in  AUM  over  the  previous  year.  The  highest  decline 
in  AUM  was  registered  for  fund  of   funds  investing 
overseas schemes at 24.5 percent.

Over  the  past  years,  mutual  fund  investments 
in  equity  had  been  outweighed  by  investments  in 
debt.  During  2014-15,  combined  net  investments  by 
mutual  funds  in  debt  and  equity  were  `  6,27,741 
crore  as  compared  to  `  5,22,023  crore  in  2013-14, 
accounting  for  an  increase  of   20.3  percent  (Table 
2.52). Net investments by mutual funds in the equity 
segment  were  `  40,722  crore,  whereas  their  net 
investments  in  the  debt  segment  were  `  5,87,018 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

crore  during  the  same  period.  After  five  consecutive 
years, 2014-15 had positive flows by mutual funds in 
the equity segment. Net investments were the highest 
in March 2015 (`  81,240 crore) followed by August 
2014  (`  78,852  crore).  Net  investments  of   mutual 
funds in the debt and equity segment were positive for 
all the months during the year except for April 2014 
in the equity segment.

As  on  March  31,  2015,  97.3  percent  of   the 
total 
folios  were  subscribed  by  the

category, their share in the total net assets being 46.9 
percent.  On  the  other  hand,  corporate/institutions 
had  a  miniscule  share  of   0.9  percent  in  the  total 
number  of   folios  and  their  share  in  total  net  assets 
was  significant  at  47.6  percent.  In  comparison  to 
2013-14,  the  share  of   corporate  in  total  net  assets 
declined  while  their  share  in  folios  was  almost  the 
same. NRIs/OCBs with 1.8 percent share in folios had 
3.8 percent share in total net assets (Table 2.53).

Table  2.54  provides  data  on  private  and  public 
sector  sponsored  mutual  funds  wherein  it  can  be 
seen  that  private  sector  mutual  funds  dominated 
with  a  higher  number  of   folios  and  total  net  assets. 
While private sector mutual funds had a 65.2 percent 
share  in  total  folios  of   around  `  4.2  crore,  the 
corresponding  share  of   public  sector  mutual  funds 
was  34.8  percent  as  at  end  March  2015.  In  total 
net  assets  worth  `  10.8  lakh  crore  as  on  March  31, 
2015, the share of  private sector mutual funds stood 
at  84.8  percent  as  compared  to  15.3  percent  for 
public sector mutual funds.

INTERMEDIARIES  ASSOCIATED  WITH 
SECURITIES MARKET
Portfolio Managers
A portfolio manager is a body corporate which, 
pursuant to a contract or arrangement with a client, 
advises  or  directs  or  undertakes  on  behalf   of   the 
client  (whether  as  a  discretionary  portfolio  manager 
or  otherwise),  the  management  or  administration  of  
a portfolio of  securities or the client’s funds. Portfolio 
managers  are  registered  and  regulated  under  SEBI 
(Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993.

While  the  total  number  of   clients  declined  to 
46,706  in  2014-15  from  57,477  in  2013-14,  the 
assets  under  management  (AUM)  increased.  While 
the  number  of   clients  utilising  discretionary,  non-
discretionary  and  advisory  services  all  declined  in 
2014-15,  the  net  assets  managed  by  all  services 

Table 2.55: Assets managed by portfolio managers

Part Two: Review of Working and Operations of the SEBI

increased.  Among  the  clientele  base,  the  dominant 
share was that of  clients taking discretionary services 
and  constituted  86.8  percent  of   the  total  number  of  
clients (Table 2.55).

Assets  under  management  of   the  portfolio 
management 
industry  rose  by  20.7  percent  to 
`  9,27,385 crore in 2014-15 from `  7,68,326 crore 
in 2013-14. Discretionary services provided to EPFO/
PFs constituted 68.1 percent of  the total assets under 
management  of   the  portfolio  managers  whereas 
advisory  services  constituted  19.4  percent.  AUM  of  
discretionary  portfolio  managers  managing  EPFO/
PF  funds  increased  by  16.5  percent  in  2014-15  over 
the  previous  year.  The  AUM/GDP  ratio  of   portfolio 
managers  was  7.3  percent  in  2014-15  while  that  of  
the mutual fund industry was 8.6 percent, indicating 
a growth over their previous year’s ratios.

II.  Alternative Investment Funds

SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (AIF  Regulations)  on 
May  21,  2012  providing  for  three  categories  of   AIFs 
which  subsumed  the  existing  VCFs  and  FVCIs.  AIFs 
Regulations  endeavoured  to  extend  the  perimeter 
of   regulation  to  unregulated  funds  with  a  view 
to  systemic  stability,  increasing  market  efficiency, 
encouraging formation of  new capital and consumer 
protection.

Table 2.56: Cumulative amount mobilised by AIFs 

Since  the  implementation  of   the  regulations, 
135 AIFs have been registered with SEBI as on March 
31,  2015.  The  figures  show  that  while  Category  I 
made  an  investment  of   `  961  crore,  Category  III 
made  an  investment  of   `  1,528  crore.  Category  II 
comprising  of   private  equity  funds  and  debt  funds 
made  the  highest  investment  of   `  4,868  crore.  The 
total  investments  made  by  AIFs  in  2014-15  were 
`  7,357  crore. The  cumulative  amount  mobilised  by 
AIFs as on March 31, 2015 is shown in Table 2.56.

ON  THE  WORKING  OF  SECURITIES 
MARKET
Corporate Bond Markets
A  well-developed  corporate  bond  market 
is  supportive  of   the  economic  developments  in  a 
country.  In  the  Indian  context,  corporate  bond 
markets  have  steadily  shown  encouraging  trends  in 
recent  times.  In  2014-15  too,  in  line  with  previous 
years, the private placement of  debt issues out scored 
that  of   public  issues.  Private  placement  continued  to 
be  the  preferred  route  by  investors  for  its  perceived 
advantages  of   operational  ease,  minimal  disclosures 
and lower costs.

Reporting  platforms  for  corporate  bonds  were 
set  up  and  maintained  by  BSE,  NSE  and  FIMMDA. 
RBI  vide  its  circular  no.  RBI/2013-14/500/IDMD.
PCD.10/14.03.06/2013-14  dated  February  24, 
2014  directed  its  regulated  entities  to  report  their 
OTC  trades  in  corporate  bonds  and  securitised  debt 
instruments  on  any  one  of   the  stock  exchanges 

(NSE,  BSE  and  MSEI)  with  effect  from  April  1,  2014. 
However, reporting of  secondary market transactions 
in corporate bonds has been discontinued at FIMMDA 
with  effect  from  April  1,  2014.  MSEI  started  the 
reporting  in  July  2013,  but  the  volumes  reported  at 
the platform are insignificant for 2014-15.

NSE has hence emerged as the largest reporting 
platform  for  OTC  deals  in  corporate  bond  markets 
in  2014-15.NSE’s  share  in  total  reporting  increased 
from  28.4  percent  in  2013-14  to  81.3  percent  in 
2014-15.  The  number  of   trades  reported  at  NSE 
more  than  doubled  in  2014-15  to  58,073  and  the 
value of  trades more than tripled to `  8,86,788 crore 
over  the  previous  financial  year.  During  2014-15, 
the  total  value  of   corporate  bond  trades  reported  at 
BSE approximately doubled to `  2,04,506 crore from 
`  1,03,027  crore  in  2013-14,  while  the  number  of  
trades  increased  by  73.8  percent  over  the  previous 
financial year (Table 2.65).

Part Two: Review of Working and Operations of the SEBI

Box 2.1: Rejuvenating the Corporate Bond Market

 
The  corporate  Bond  market  in  India  has  received  constant  and  improved  policy  impetus  in  the  last  few 
years and from being in the nascent stage it has now turned into a vibrant market. However, scope of  the corporate 
bond market is still vast. A well-developed corporate bond market not only supports economic development but also 
balances excessive reliance on the bank finance sector for raising money. SEBI has injected a few procedural and 
strategic initiatives in the last few years that have provided the desired momentum to the corporate bond market.
 
SEBI notified the SEBI (Issue and Listing of  Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares), Regulations, 2013 
to provide a regulatory framework for public issuance of  non-convertible redeemable preference shares and also for 
listing of  privately placed redeemable preference shares. Considering the risks involved in the instrument, certain 
requirements like minimum tenure of  the instrument (three years) and minimum rating (AA  or equivalent) were 
specified in  case of  public issuances. For listing of  privately placed non-convertible redeemable preference shares, 
the minimum application size for each investor was fixed at `  10 lakh. The regulations were also made applicable 
to non-equity instruments such as perpetual non-cumulative preference shares and innovative perpetual debt in-
struments, issued by banks (as per Basel III norms), which are in compliance with the criteria specified by RBI for 
inclusion in additional tier I capital.
  As a further measure for cost effectiveness and timeliness, SEBI allowed listed entities, including non-banking 
financial institutions and issuers authorised by the Central Board of  Direct Taxes to file shelf  prospectuses for public 
issuance of  debt securities while limiting the number of  issuances to four to keep the issue of  fragmentation under 
control. As a step towards making the bond market more transparent, SEBI advised that with respect to public is-
sues of  debt securities, no person connected with the issue shall offer any incentive, whether direct or indirect, in 
any manner, whether in cash or kind or services or otherwise to any person making an application for allotment of  
such securities.
 
In August 2011, SEBI amended the regulations for mutual funds, permitting mutual funds to set up infrastruc-
ture debt funds under the mutual funds framework.   In September 2011, SEBI put in place conditions for issue of  
structured products. This was done with a view to enhancing disclosures for issue of  debt instruments with returns 
linked to various market indices. Additional norms included restricting eligible issuers to those who have a net-
worth of  `  100 crore, a minimum ticket size of  issue at `  1 lakh, selling practices, additional disclosures pertaining 
to riskiness of  such instruments, scenario analysis showing its value under various market conditions and the com-
mission structure embedded therein. Third party valuation by a credit rating agency was also made mandatory and 
this has to be disclosed to the public.  
 
To help develop the market of  securitised debt instruments (SDIs) and improving transparency, SEBI directed 
trades in SDIs to be reported within 15 minutes on the trade reporting platforms of  exchanges (NSE, BSE or MSEI). 
SDIs are instruments created out of  a pool of  loans with mutual funds, FPIs, AIFs, etc. As a measure to boost inves-
tor confidence in securitisation transactions, SEBI approved stricter norms for trustees managing SDI issuances.
In order to provide retail investors an opportunity to invest in corporate bonds on a liquid and transparent ex-
 
change platform, and institutions to buy and sell corporate bonds, a dedicated debt segment at the exchanges was 
provided for by SEBI. The segment intends to boost liquidity in the trading of  corporate bonds. In view of  the fact 
that historical data on all corporate bonds issued is very crucial for an investor to take informed investment deci-
sions, SEBI mandated  both the depositories, NSDL and CDSL  to  jointly create, host, maintain and disseminate the 
centralised database of  corporate bonds/debentures which are available in demat form.  The database can be ac-
cessed by the public or any other users without paying any kind of  fees or charges.
  As a significant step to fill the gap in urban infrastructure requirements, SEBI issued norms on issuance of  debt 
securities by municipalities (municipal bonds). This step also brings India in line with advanced nations which use 
this innovative segment for raising capital. With growth envisaged for the economy as a whole municipal bonds 
have a significant role to play in meeting the infrastructure needs of  urbanisation.
Issuances in the Corporate Bond Market: Trends
In the primary market, the total issuance amount increased from `  1,18,485 crore in 2007-08 to `  4,13,558 
 
crore in 2014-15 implying a CAGR of  19.5 percent. There was a gradual rise in the total number of  issues from 744 
to 2,611 during the same period. In the public issue market, the issuance amount increased from `  1,500 crore 
during 2008-09 to `  42,383 crore during 2013-14 and decreased to `  9,422 crore during 2014-15. The sudden 
increase in the amount raised through public issues during 2011-12 to 2013-14 was due to the issuance of  tax free 
bonds by infrastructure companies (see Table 1).
  Among the types of  issuers, financial institutions, housing finance companies and NBFC have been frequently 
tapping into the corporate bond market. During 2011-12 to 2013-14, there was an increase in the proportion of  
private sector companies tapping into the corporate bond market, which is a good signal.

With regard to rating of  issues, there has been an increase in issue depth as lower rated issues have been successful 
in accessing corporate bond market. In the public issue market, the proportion of  issues rated lower than the AAA 
rating grew from 12 percent in 2010-11 to 26 percent in 2013-14. In the private placement market, issues with 
ratings lesser than the investment grade have also been able to raise funds. (Tables 2 and 3).

  Since  2009,  all  trades  in  corporate  bonds 
between  specified  entities,  namely,  mutual  funds, 
foreign  institutional  investors,  venture  capital  funds, 
foreign  venture  capital  investors,  portfolio  managers 
and  RBI  regulated  entities  as  specified  by  RBI  have 
mandatorily  been  cleared  and  settled  through  the 
clearing houses of  exchanges on a DVPI basis namely 
the  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  Limited 
(NSCCL)  or  the  Indian  Clearing  Corporation  Limited 

(ICCL)  and  now  the  MSEI  Clearing  Corporation 
Limited  (MSEI  CCL).  This  provision  is  applicable 
to  all  corporate  bonds  traded  over  the  counter  or 
on  the  debt  segment  of   stock  exchanges  on  or  after 
December 1, 2009.

The  value  of   corporate  bond  trades  settled 
increased  by  7.4 
in  2014-15 
from 

through  clearing  corporations 
percent  to  `  6,93,903  crore

to  the  net  traded  value,  the  number  of   trades  at 

NSE’s  WDM  segment  witnessed  a  decline  in  2014-
15  to  18,789  from  21,143  in  2013-14.  At  BSE,  the

and stress testing which will bring greater clarity 
and uniformity as well as aligning the same with 
international  best  practices  while  enhancing 
the  robustness  of   the  present  risk  management 
system  in  clearing  corporations  to  enable  them 
to deal with defaults of  clearing members much 
more effectively by achieving the following:

Creating a core fund (called the Core Settlement 
Guarantee  Fund),  within  SGF  against  which 
no  exposure  is  given  and  which  is  readily  and 
unconditionally  available  to  meet  settlement 
obligations  of   clearing  corporations  in  case 
clearing  member(s)  fail  to  honour  settlement 
obligations.

c.  Trading  member  /  FPI-I  /  FPI-II  /  domestic 
institutional investors: Gross open positions of  
the trading member across all contracts not to 
exceed 15 percent of  the total open interest or

higher.

Further  domestic  clients  were  permitted  to  take  long 
or  short  positions  in  permitted  currency  pairs  upto 
USD 10 million per stock exchange without having to 
establish the existence of  any underlying exposure. To 
take positions in the permitted currency pairs in excess 
of   USD  10  million,  establishing  the  existence  of   an 
underlying exposure was made mandatory.

provision,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Stock  Exchange 
entered  into  a  MoU  with  BSE  and  NSE  and  the 
Madras  Stock  Exchange  and  Calcutta  Stock 
Exchange had MoUs with NSE.

However,  in  terms  of   provisions  of   para  4.2 
of   the  SEBI  circular  dated  May  30,  2012  (Exit 

VI.  Exit of  Stock Exchanges 

Circular), the MoU mechanism, if  any, between a 
stock exchange not having a nation-wide trading 
terminal and a stock exchange having a nation-
wide trading terminal, shall be discontinued.

Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the  voluntary  exit 
applications  by  Madras  Stock  exchange  and 
Madhya  Pradesh  Stock  Exchange,  the  MoU 
arrangement  between  Madras  Stock  Exchange 
and  National  Stock  exchange  discontinued 
with  effect  from  January  31,  2015  and  MoU 
arrangement  between  Madhya  Pradesh  Stock 
Exchange  and  BSE  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Stock 
Exchange  with  NSE  discontinued  with  effect 
from March 26, 2015.

SEBI  issued  circular  CIR/MRD/DSA/14/2012 
dated May 30, 2012, regarding the Exit Policy for 
de-recognised/non-operational stock exchanges. 
Subsequent to the Exit Circular being issued, SEBI 
received  applications  from  de-recognised/non-
operational  stock  exchanges  seeking  voluntary 
exit  as  a  stock  exchange.  In  order  to  facilitate 
the  exit  process  for  such  exchanges,  SEBI  took 
several  policy  initiatives.  It  inter-alia  issued  the 
following  instructions  to  the  non-operational 
stock exchanges/exclusively listed companies of  
such stock exchanges to comply with:

Exclusively  listed  companies  of   non-operational 
stock  exchanges  may  opt  for  listing  at  nation-
wide  exchanges.  Nation-wide  stock  exchanges 
have been advised to create dedicated cells to deal/
facilitate requests for listing from such companies.

SEBI  also  advised  the  exchanges  having  nation-
wide  trading  terminals  to  facilitate  shifting  of   such 
companies  to  the  dissemination  board  for  a  one-
time fee of  ` 5,000 per company. Further, in order to 

facilitate the listing of  companies which have already 
moved to the dissemination board and in the interest 
of  the investors in such companies, the SEBI Board in 
its  meeting  on  January  22,  2015  decided  to  allow  a 
timeline of  18 months within which such companies 
shall  obtain  listings  after  compliance  with  the  listing 
requirements  of   the  nation-wide  stock  exchange. 
Pursuant  to  these  measures,  12  de-recognised/non-
operational stock exchanges have exited as on March 
31, 2015. (Table 3.4)

VII.  Nation-wide  Awareness  Campaign 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

for 

SMEs  have  emerged  to  become  one  of   the 
 
most  vibrant  and  dynamic  sectors  of   the  economy 
which  play  a  crucial  role  in  providing  employment 
opportunities  across  the  country.  They  have  also 
catalysed  socioeconomic  growth  and  development.  In 
order to cater to the SMEs’ need of  funding and visibility, 
SEBI introduced a framework for a separate exchange/
platform for SMEs thereby facilitating fund raising from 
the market. Further, SEBI has also facilitated listing of  
securities through the institutional trading platform. 

 
SEBI  has  initiated  an  awareness  programme  in 
coordination with SIDBI and stock exchanges to interact 
with SMEs from different clusters and familiarise them 
with the various products that are being offered by the 
stock exchanges for the benefits of  SMEs in addition to 

84

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

showcasing the initiatives of  SIDBI for the SME sector. 
This  awareness  programme  is  being  carried  out  to 
create awareness about the availability of  the platforms 
provided by the exchanges which can help in addressing 
the  funding  requirements  of   SMEs  and  help  them  in 
their  expansion  plans.  The 
inaugural  programme 
in  this  series  was  held  at  Coimbatore  in  July  2014 
which was attended by representatives of  around 300 
SMEs.  Subsequently,  programmes  were  held  at  Rajkot, 
Ahmedabad,  Bhubaneswar,  Jamshedpur,  Pune  and 
Faridabad which received good response from the SME 
industry.

 
During  these  programmes,  technical  sessions 
were  held  wherein  officials  of   SEBI,  stock  exchanges, 
SIDBI  and  merchant  bankers  interacted  with  SMEs 
in  small  groups,  apprising  them  about  the  regulatory 
parameters  for  SMEs  and  addressed  their  queries  and 
apprehensions.  The  technical  sessions  were  followed 
by  the  main  event  in  which  the  senior  management 
of   SEBI,  SIDBI  and  the  stock  exchanges  addressed  the 
representatives  of   SMEs.  As  on  March  31,  2015,  BSE 
had  92  companies  listed  on  its  SME  platform  and  18 
companies in ITP and NSE had seven companies listed 
in the SME platform and nine companies in ITP.

VIII.  Measures  adopted  for  Regulation  of   Stock 

Exchanges

to 

During  2014-15,  with  a  view 

 
further 
strengthening  the  mechanism  of   index  based  market-
wide  circuit  breaker  implemented  by  stock  exchanges, 
the  exchanges  were  directed  to  compute  market-wide 
indices (Nifty and Sensex) after every trade in the index 
constituent  stocks  and  to  check  for  breach  of   market-
wide circuit breaker limits after every such computation 
of  the market-wide index. In the event of  a breach of  the 
market-wide circuit breaker limit, stock exchanges were 
asked to stop matching of  orders in order to bring about 
a trading halt.

 
Exchanges have also been advised to take necessary 
steps  to  ensure  that  ‘ISIN’  details  of   the  securities  are 
included  in  the  bills/contract  notes/statements  issued 
by  stock  brokers  to  their  clients  in  the  cash  segment. 
With a view to enhancing the visibility of  the investor 
grievance mechanism, it has been made mandatory for 
all the intermediaries to prominently display the contact 
details of  escalation levels in all their offices.

sets  qualifying 

Regulation  of   market  intermediaries  has  three 
 
objectives:  protecting  client  assets  from  insolvency  of  
the  intermediaries  and  guarding  against  defaults  and 
sudden  disruptions  in  the  market,  ensuring  that  the 
intermediaries are fair and diligent in dealing with their 
clients  and  reducing  conflicts  of   interest.  Regulation, 
therefore, 
standards,  prudential 
standards,  internal  controls  and  risk  management 
standards  and  enforces  a  code  of   conduct.  In  order 
to  enhance  investor  confidence,  it  is  necessary  that 
all  the  intermediaries  maintain  high  standards  of  
integrity and fairness and also act with due skill, care 
and  diligence  in  the  conduct  of   their  business  with 
high  levels  of   compliance.  Various  intermediaries’ 
regulations have been framed under the SEBI Act, 1992 
and the Depositories Act, 1996 for the registration and 
regulation  of   all  market  intermediaries.  Under  these 
Acts,  the  Government  and  SEBI  issue  notifications, 
guidelines and circulars that the market intermediaries 
need  to  comply  with.  SEBI  ensures  the  standard  and 
quality  of   services  to  clients  and  investors,  fair  and 
sound conduct and compliance practices.

I. 

Streamlining 
Initial/
Permanent Registration of  Intermediaries

the  Process  of  

 
The process for streamlining the registration and 
approvals by enhancing transparency continued during 
2014-15. With a view to rationalizing the time taken, 
documentation  involved  and  to  avoid  duplication  of  
efforts,  registration  requirements  for  stock  brokers/
clearing  members  were  simplified  and  the  SEBI  (Stock 
Brokers  and  Sub-Brokers)  Regulations,  1992  were 
amended and  
notified  vide  Notification  no.  LAD-
NRO/GN/2014-15/15/1671  dated  October  8,  2014. 
Similarly,  registration  requirements 
for  depository 
participants were simplified and the SEBI (Depositories 
and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996  were  amended 
and notified vide Notification no. LAD-NRO/GN/2014-
15/18/1952 dated December 24, 2014.

 
The  policy  of   sending  responses  to  applicants  in 
a time-bound manner, that is, within 30 days has been 
adhered to. The status of  processing of  each application

displayed on the SEBI website on a monthly basis. 

 
With  a  view  to  ensuring  a  higher  level  of  
transparency and accountability within SEBI, it is also 
mentioned on the website that in case any application 
remains unattended, the applicant should not hesitate 
to  approach  the  concerned  division  chief   or  the 
head  of   department  or  the  Executive  Director  of   the 
Market  Intermediaries  Regulations  and  Supervision 
Department.  The  respective  email  IDs  of   concerned 
officials are also displayed.

 
The  practice  of   seeking  details  of   corrective 
measures taken by the applicants where administrative 
and  quasi-judicial  actions  have  been  initiated  by  SEBI 
against  them  or  their  associate  companies  at  the  time 
of  processing the applications for registration or other 
approvals has greatly improved the compliance culture 
among intermediaries.

II.  Measures for Regulation of  Intermediaries 

 
In order to create awareness among investors on 
the  one-time  KYC,  stock  exchanges  have  been  advised 
to  display  a  ticker  on  their  websites.  Also  with  a  view 
to  simplifying  the  registration  requirements  for  stock 
brokers/clearing members, a single registration for stock 
brokers/clearing  members  for  operating  in  all  stock 
exchanges/clearing  corporations  has  been  approved 
by  SEBI.  A  single  registration  for  operating  with  both 
depositories  has  also  been  approved  for  depository 
participants. 

III.  Registration of  Stock Brokers

A.  Cash Segment

During  2014-15,  105  new  stock  brokers  and 
83  new  clearing  members  were  registered  with

IV.  Registration of  Sub-brokers 

 
The  number  of   registered  sub-brokers  declined 
by 18.4 percent from 51,885 as on March 31, 2014 to 
42,351 as on March 31, 2015. However, the number 
of  authorised persons (APs) as approved by the stock 
exchanges in accordance with SEBI guidelines increased 
by 13.5 percent during the year from 1,62,679 as on 
March 31, 2014 to 1,84,553 as on March 31, 2015. 
With a view to expanding the reach of  the markets for 
exchange  traded  products,  stock  brokers  along  with 
sub-brokers  were  allowed  to  provide  market  access 
to  clients  through  APs.  Thus,  while  the  number  of  
sub-brokers  declined,  the  increased  presence  of   APs 
ensured  that  the  reach  of   the  markets  for  exchange 
traded products increased (Table 3.12).

4.  PROMOTION  AND  REGULATION  OF  SELF-

REGULATORY ORGANISATIONS

 
SEBI  (Self-Regulatory  Organisations),  2004  was 
notified  on  February  19,  2004  with  the  objective  of  
promoting  organisation  of   intermediaries  representing 
a particular segment of  the securities market as a self-
regulated  entity/organisation.  For  recognition  of   an 
organisation  of   intermediaries  as  SROs,  SEBI  held 
discussions  with  various  bodies  like  the  Association 
of  Merchant Bankers of  India (AMBI), the Association 
of   NSE  Members  of   India  (ANMI)  and  the  Registrars 
Association of  India (RAIN). 

SEBI  has  decided  to  have  a  single  SRO  for 
 
distributors  of   mutual  fund  products  and  a  two-
stage  procedure  for  granting  recognition  as  SRO  for 
distributors of  mutual fund products, that is, grant of  
in-principle approval and grant of  recognition.

5. 

FRAUDULENT  AND  UNFAIR 
PRACTICES

TRADE 

 
To  protect  investor  interests  and  to  promote  a 
fair  and  orderly  securities  markets,  SEBI  ensures  the 
integrity  of   markets  by  detecting  market  frauds  on  a 
proactive  basis,  investigating  abusive,  manipulative  or 
illegal trading practices in securities markets and taking 
punitive  steps  to  punish  the  manipulators.  Market 
surveillance  helps  in  ensuring  integrity  of   markets  by 
enabling  a  safe  and  sound  environment  where  buyers 
and sellers are willing to participate confidently.

I. 

Types  of   fraudulent  and  unfair  trade 
practices observed:

 

 

A. A  company  and  its  directors  made  false  and 
misleading  reporting  of   financial  results 
amounting to manipulation of  the price of  the 
scrip.

B.  An  employee  of   a  big  client  group  who  was 
responsible  for  placing  orders  for  trading  in 
shares in his employer’s account was observed 

93

to be front-running the trades of  group entities 
of  his employer. Subsequently, such a position 
was  being  squared  off   with  the  employer  to 
make unfair gains. Further, the dealer who was 
placing  orders  for  the  front-runner  was  also 
observed to be front-running its clients.

C.  Certain connected entities were observed to be 
manipulating the price of  scrip of  a company. 
The  promoters  of   the  said  company  were 
observed to be paying money and transferring 
shares without consideration to certain entities 
who were manipulating the price of  the scrip. 

D.  Certain  group  of   entities  purchased  shares  in 
a  scrip,  transferred  them  to  its  group  entities 
in the off-market and bought the same shares 
from  the  market  thereby  creating  artificial 
volumes.

E.  Entities that had taken positions in call options, 
increased the price of  the scrip in the last few 
minutes of  trading hours thereby affecting the 
closing price of  the scrip on the day. Thereafter, 
the call options were exercised after closing of  
the market, which resulted in unlawful profits.

F.  Certain  entities  entered 

into  synchronised 
trades/reversal of  trades/circular trades within 
the  group  resulting  in  artificial  volumes  and  
price rise. 

G.  Certain entities increased the price of  the scrip 
by executing repeated self-trades resulting in no 
change in beneficial ownership. 

H. Certain  entities 

indulged 

in  order  book 
repeatedly  placing  and 
manipulation  by 
deleting orders so as to display false volumes in 
the order book.

Fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices 
cases during 2014-15
Interim  Order  in  respect  of   Mr.  Mansoor 
Rafiq  Khanda  (Proprietor  of   M/s  Indian 
Trading  Company,  M/s  Option  &  M.C.X. 
King,  M/s  A  To  Z  Solution  and  M/s  Fullon 
Corporation)  and  Mr.  Firoz  Rafiq  Khanda 
(Proprietor of  M/s Fullon Corporation)

 
SEBI passed an interim order on June 5, 2014, in 
the matter of  giving trading tips by  Mr. Mansoor Rafiq 
Khanda  proprietor  of   M/s  Indian  Trading  Company, 

94

M/s  Option  &  M.C.X  King,  M/s  A  to  Z  Solution  and  
M/s  Fullon  Corporation  and  Mr.  Firoz  Rafiq  Khanda 
(proprietor  of   M/s  Fullon  Corporation).The  directions 
passed  in  the  order  included  prohibiting  Mr.  Mansoor 
Rafiq Khanda and Mr. Firoz Rafiq Khanda from buying, 
selling  or  dealing  in  securities  markets  in  any  manner  
whatsoever  or  accessing  securities  markets,  directly  or 
indirectly,  till  further  direction;  ceasing  and  desisting 
from  acting  as  investment  advisors  and  not  to  solicit 
or  undertake  such  activities  or  any  other  unregistered 
activity  in  securities  markets,  directly  or  indirectly,  in 
any manner whatsoever; immediately withdrawing and 
removing all advertisements, representations, literatures, 
brochures, materials, publications, documents, websites, 
etc.  in  relation  to  their  investment  advisory  or  any 
unregistered activity in securities markets. 

B. 

Interim  Order  in  the  matter  of   M/s  Kelvin 
Fincap Ltd.

 
SEBI had carried out an examination in the scrip 
of   M/s  Kelvin  Fincap  Ltd.  (Kelvin)  pursuant  to  the 
detection of  a huge rise in the traded volumes and price 
of   Kelvin’s  shares.  It  was  observed  that  it  deliberately 
and  actively  concealed  the  actual  number  of   allottees 
so  as  to  avoid  compliance  of   issuance  of   prospectus 
and detailed disclosures therein. Further, the shares of  
Kelvin were transferred among M/s Kelvin Fincap Group 
entities in physical as well as dematerialised mode which 
started to trade heavily among themselves in Kelvin with 
huge trading volume concentration at BSE. This created 
artificial  volumes  and  significantly  exerted  an  upward 
pressure on the price, an act inconsistent with normal 
investor behaviour. 

 
Accordingly,  SEBI  passed  an  ad  interim  ex-parte 
order  dated  August  7,  2014,  restraining  M/s  Kelvin 
Fincap Ltd., its promoters Mr. Keyur M. Shah, Mr. Keyur 
M. Shah (HUF), Ms Kavita K. Shah and M/s Dahyabhai 
Shares  and  Stock  Brokers  Pvt.  Ltd.,  besides  seven 
directors and 13 other entities, from accessing securities 
markets  and  prohibiting  them  from  buying,  selling 
or  dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner  whatsoever  till 
further directions in the matter of  dealing in the scrip of  
M/s Kelvin Fincap Ltd. 

C. 

Interim Order in the matter of  M/s Rasoya 
Protein Ltd.

 
It was prima facie observed that M/s Rasoya Protein 
Ltd. (RPL) and persons in charge of  its affairs, created a 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

facade  of   GDR  issuance  in  connivance/collusion  with 
Mr. Arun Panchariya, Pan Asia, Vintage and Mr. Mukesh 
Chauradiya  wherein  global  depository  receipts  (GDRs) 
and  underlying  equity  shares  were  created  without 
receipt of  consideration by RPL. Such a facade apparently 
enabled them to, at least partly, induce and allure Indian 
investors  to  buy  additional  equity  created  in  the  form 
of   underlying  equity  shares.  Thus,  they  indulged  in 
employing  a 
fraudulent  plan/arrangement,  device, 
artifice and contrivance with regard to the subscription 
of   GDRs  and  creation  of   underlying  shares  using  the 
facade of  the GDR issue, monetizing those GDRs through 
the sale of  underlying shares of  the GDRs and inducing 
and alluring Indian investors to deal in shares of  RPL. 
RPL and persons in charge of  its affairs also made false/
misleading  disclosures  and  misrepresentations  and  did 
not co-operate with an inquiry during the preliminary 
examination  and 
to 
SEBI/BSE.

false 

 
Accordingly, SEBI passed an order dated September 
24,  2014  under  Sections  11(1),  11(4)  and  11B  of   the 
SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of  M/s Rasoya Protein Ltd. 
(RPL), its directors namely, Mr. Prashant Duchakke, Mr.

D. 

Interim  Order 
Transgene Biotek Ltd. (Transgene)

in  the  matter  of   M/s 

 
SEBI  received  certain  complaints  alleging,  inter-
alia,  fraud  in  the  global  depository  receipts  issued 
by  Transgene  and  mis-utilisation  of   the  proceeds 
thereof. These GDR proceeds of  USD 40.5 million were 
transferred to certain entities abroad for purposes other 
than informed to the shareholders. Thus, the disclosure 
in  the  2011-12  annual  report  that  the  fund  had  been 
paid  as  advances  out  of   GDR  proceeds  for  acquiring 
new  drug  technologies  and  getting  clinical  technology 
services from technology/strategic partners abroad was 
false and misleading. 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

 
Transgene  and  its  directors  had  deliberately 
shown a rosy picture to investors in Indian securities 
markets  by  making  a  GDR  issue  and  then  making 
false  and  misleading  disclosures  about  the  utilisation 
of   GDR  proceeds.  Further,  prima  facie,  they  actively 
concealed the fact that Transgene had never received 
the technology and other purportedly agreed services 
from  the  entities  to  which  the  GDR  proceeds  were 
transferred. The  false  and  misleading  disclosures  and 
active  concealment  of   material  information  as  prima 
facie  found  in  this  case  had  potential  to  influence 
investment  decisions  of   the  investors  in  shares  of  
Transgene and to induce them to buy or sell its shares. 

Accordingly,  SEBI  passed  an  ad 

 
interim  ex-
parte order dated November 20, 2014 in connection with 
GDR issues of  Transgene, restraining Mr. K. Koteswara 
Rao  and  other  directors/promoters  of   Transgene  from 
accessing securities markets and prohibiting them from 
buying,  selling  or  dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner 
whatsoever  till  further  directions.  Also,  Transgene 
was  restrained  from  issuing  any  securities  till  further 
directions.

Interim Order in the matter of  M/s Moryo 
Industries Ltd. 

Pursuant  to  the  receipt  of   a  complaint  in  the 
 
dealings  in  the  shares  of   M/s  Moryo  Ltd.  (Moryo), 
SEBI  undertook  a  preliminary  inquiry  for  the  period 
of   the  complaint.  It  was  found  that  Moryo  had  made 
preferential  allotments  to  42  persons.  The  shares 
allotted on a preferential basis to the aforesaid allottees 
were  locked-in  for  a  period  till  November  8,  2013.  On 
January 15, 2013, Moryo’s shares were split in the ratio 
of  1:2. On analysis, it was observed that the preferential 
allottees made a profit of  ` 141 crore on account of  sale 
in the shares of  Moryo to generate fictitious LTCGs (long 
term capital gains). It was observed that the profit was 
made on account of  the price rise contributed by a group 
of  suspected entities who were also the counterparties to 
the allottees. It was observed that this group of  suspected 
entities was also connected to M/s Moryo Industries Ltd.

 
Accordingly,  SEBI  passed  an  interim  order  dated 
December  4,  2014,  restraining  99  persons/entities 
(including  the  company  M/s  Moryo  Industries  Ltd.,  its 
directors, promoters, the preferential allottees who sold 
their  holdings  and  entities  connected  to  the  company) 
from accessing securities markets and buying, selling or

Interim  Order 
Radford Global Ltd. (RGL)

in  the  matter  of   M/s 

 
Pursuant  to  a  preliminary  examination  by  BSE 
in the dealings in the shares of  M/s Radford Global Ltd. 
(RGL),  SEBI  undertook  a  preliminary  inquiry  in  the 
dealings  in  the  shares  of   the  company  for  the  period 
January 28, 2013 to March 24, 2014. It was found that 
RGL allotted 91 lakh equity shares on a preferential basis 
(subject to a one year lock-in) to 48 allottees. RGL and its 
connected entities and/or suspected entities manipulated 
the price and volume in the scrip and then provided exit 
to  the  preferential  allottees  who  generated  huge  long 
term  capital  gains.  Just  prior  to  the  expiry  of   the  lock-
in  of   shares,  RGL  announced  a  stock-split  (1:5)  as  it 
would reduce the per share price and increase liquidity. 
On  expiry  of   the  lock-in,  the  46  preferential  allottees 
sold their holdings in RGL and made a collective profit of  
`  313 crore.

SEBI  passed  an  interim  order  dated  December 
 
12, 2014, restraining 108 persons/entities (including 
the company, its directors, promoters, the preferential 
allottees who sold their holdings and entities connected 
to the company) from accessing securities markets and 
buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly 
or  indirectly,  in  any  manner  till  further  directions. 
The  matter  was  also  referred  to  the  Enforcement 
Directorate, IT Department and FIU.

G. 

Interim  Order  in  the  matter  of   M/s  First 
Financial Services Ltd. (FFSL) 

 
SEBI  conducted  a  preliminary  inquiry  in  the 
dealings  in  the  scrip  pursuant  to  detection  of   a  huge 
rise  in  the  traded  volumes  and  price  of   the  shares  of  
FFSL on BSE during the period May 15, 2012 to March 
31,2014. It was found that FFSL made two preferential 
allotments (subject to a one year lock-in) to 83 persons/
entities.  FFSL  and  its  connected  entities  manipulated 
the price and volume in the scrip and then provided exit 
to the preferential allottees who generated huge long 
term capital gains; 80 of  the 83 preferential allottees 
sold their holdings in FFSL making a collective profit of  
` 172.21 crore. 

 
Accordingly,  SEBI  passed  an  interim  order  dated 
December  12,  2014,  restraining  152  persons/entities 
(including  the  company,  its  directors,  promoters,  the 

preferential  allottees  who  sold  their  holdings  and 
entities  connected  to  the  company)  from  accessing

H. 

Interim  Order  in  the  matter  of   GDR  issue 
of  M/s Cals Refineries Ltd.

 
SEBI passed a final order dated October 23, 2013, 
in the matter of  market manipulation using GDR issues 
against M/s Cals Refineries Ltd. (Cals). Cals was directed 
not  to  issue  equity  shares  or  any  other  instrument 
convertible into equity shares or any other security for a 
period of  10 years. 

 
SEBI  also  investigated  the  role  of   other  entities 
connected to Cals in the manipulations related to the GDR 
issuance by Cals. It was revealed that certain promoters 
of  Cals siphoned its funds to their accounts fraudulently 
and  certain  directors  and  promoters  of   Cals  enabled  it 
to provide financial assistance in the form of  guarantee 
to  create  an  illusion  of   successful  GDR  subscriptions. 
All these activities were done without the knowledge of  
other shareholders of  Cals.

 
In  view  of   the  fraudulent  activities  by  entities 
connected  with  Cals,  SEBI  vide  order  dated  December 
30,  2014,  prohibited  eight  entities  from  accessing 
the  capital  market,  directly  or  indirectly  and  dealing 
in  securities  or  instruments  in  Indian  securities  as 
underlying,  in  any  manner  whatsoever,  for  a  period 
of   10 years.

company, its directors, promoters and entities connected 
to the company) from accessing securities markets and 
buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or 
indirectly, in any manner till further directions.

 
SEBI  conducted  a  preliminary  inquiry  in  the 
dealings  in  the  scrip  pursuant  to  the  detection  of   a 
huge rise in the price of  the shares of  M/s Kamalakshi 
Finance  Corp.  Ltd.  at  BSE  during  January  15,  2014 
to December 26, 2014. It was found that KFCL made 
three  preferential  allotments  in  November  2013, 
February  2014  and  June  2014  thereby  allotting 

96

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

2,83,40,00,000 equity shares (in accordance with the 
provisions of  SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009) to 137 
persons/entities.  Prior  to  the  preferential  allotments, 
KFCL  had  a  share  capital  of   only  50,000  shares. 
Between  January  15,  2014  to  December  26,  2014, 
the  price  of   KFCL’s  shares  increased  from `  10.20  to 
` 489 (48 times) with an average of  2, 3 or 4 trades 
per day. There were no genuine reasons to justify the 
price rise. A group of  entities (connected to KFCL along 
with  some  suspected  entities)  had  contributed  to  the 
price rise by manipulating the price in the scrip when 
substantial number of  shares, were locked-in and were 
non-transferable/tradable. 

 
Accordingly  by  way  of   an  interim  order  dated 
February 20, 2015, the company, its directors, promoters 
and the entities connected to the company (24 entities) 
were  restrained  from  accessing  securities  markets  and 
buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or 
indirectly.  Also,  nine  suspected  entities  were  restrained

Kamalakshi  Finance  Corp  Ltd.  In  addition,  trading  in 
the securities of  M/s Kamalakshi Finance Corp Ltd. was 
suspended.

listed  at  BSE  and  NSE,  conducted  an  investigation  into

made  during  May  29,  2009  to  April  30,  2010.  It  was 
found  that  26  entities  were  connected  to  each  other 
by  one  way  or  the  other,  who  had  dealt  in  the  SIL 
scrip  through  multiple  brokers  in  a  fraudulent  and 
manipulative manner, without real change in ownership 
of   shares  by  indulging  in  number  of   synchronised 
trades  and  heavily  traded  amongst  themselves  thereby 
creating  artificial  volumes  and  price  rise  in  the  scrip. 
The  said  entities  were  also  observed  to  have  done  
off-market  transactions  among  themselves 
for  the 
purpose  of   meeting  the  settlement  obligations  of   one 
another. These entities were also found to have indulged 
in trades which were self-trades in nature while trading 
on  both  the  exchanges,  that  is,  BSE  and  NSE,  through 
multiple brokers, one of  them being M/s Arcadia Share

Global Infomedia Ltd. and three Others

 
SEBI, upon noticing wide fluctuations in the price 
of  the scrip of  M/s Bharatiya Global Infomedia Ltd. (BGIL) 
initiated  a  preliminary  investigation.  It  was  noticed 

98

that  BGIL  had  come  out  with  an  initial  public  offering 
(IPO) during the period July 11, 2011 to July 14, 2011. 
It  was  prima  facie  revealed  that  BGIL  had  suppressed 
material  facts  in  the  offer  document  like  utilisation  of  
IPO proceeds, payment for inter corporate deposits (ICD), 
payment to vendors etc. Upon scrutiny of  the Red Herring 
Prospectus  (RHP)/prospectus  and  the  fund  utilisation, 
certain  discrepancies/manipulations  were  observed:  1) 
wrong/inadequate disclosures with respect to utilisation 
of   IPO  proceeds  as  stated  in  RHP  and  prospectus;2) 
Non-disclosure  of   source  of   funds  already  deployed 
and to be repaid from the IPO proceeds;3) Investments 
done  in  contradiction  with  RHP/prospectus;  4)  Non-
disclosure of  related party transactions; 5) Diversion of  
IPO proceeds to promoters and promoter related entities; 
6) Funding certain clients out of  the IPO proceeds who 
had in turn indulged in creation of  false and misleading 
appearance of  trading in securities markets by creating 
artificial volumes in the scrip of  BGIL on the listing day 
by  indulging  in  structured/synchronised/reversal  and 
circular  trades  and  giving  exit  to  certain  allottees  and 
other  entities;  and  7)  Wrong  certification  by  the  audit 
committee.

17, 2014 imposed a consolidated monetary penalty of  
`  15.5 crore on BGIL and its three directors for violation 
of  Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of  the SEBI Act, 1992 
read with Regulations 3(a),(b), (c),(d), 4(1), 4(2) (a), (d),

O.  Adjudication  Order  against  M/s  Taksheel 

Solutions Ltd. and 15 Others

 
SEBI  conducted  an  investigation  into  the  alleged 
irregularity  in  the  IPO  of   M/s  Taksheel  Solutions  Ltd. 
(TSL).  Trading  in  TSL’s  scrip  commenced  on  October 
19, 2011, and witnessed major fluctuations in the price 
during the first day of  its listing. Further, it was found 
that TSL had tried to fraudulently project a misleading 
picture by suppressing vital information from prospective 
investors  and  made  incorrect  statements  in  the  offer 
document which were highly misleading for the investing 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

public. TSL had siphoned off  the IPO proceeds to vendors 
Kyros Tech Systems Inc., CYMA Network Solutions Inc., 
Crest  Solutions  Inc.  and  Helia  Software  Solutions  Inc. 
and  then  transferred  to  its  clients  and  received  back 
revenue from its clients. Also, TSL had manipulated its 
books  of   accounts  by  accounting  the  transfers  to  its 
vendors as expenditure, which was then circulated to its 
clients and transferred back to it and shown as revenue, 
thereby  inflated  its  books  of   accounts.  TSL  diverted 
the funds of  the IPO through different entities namely, 
Silverpoint Infratech, and also diverted the proceeds of  
the IPO to M/s Baba Bhoothnath Trade and Commerce 
Pvt.  Ltd.,  M/s  Shreya  Multitrade  Pvt.  Ltd.,  M/s  Rose 
Valley Merchandise Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Overall Financial 
Consultants Pvt. Ltd. to deal in the shares of  TSL on the 
day of  listing and supporting the demand and thereafter 
the  price  of   the  scrip.  Further,  TSL  had  also  diverted 
the  IPO  proceeds  to  certain  entities,  namely,  Asiarich 
Ventures, KTP Exports, Brindille Holdings Inc. and M/s 
East  Fortune  Industrial  Ltd.,  located  outside  India.  It 
was also noted that TSL had not complied with the SEBI 
ad-interim  ex-parte  order  dated  December  28,  2011. 
TSL  was  also  associated/created/incorporated  fictitious 
entities  as  vendors/clients  in  the  US.  These  entities  in 
the US were used for transfer of  funds/IPO proceeds and 
accounted these transfers as expenditure and revenue. 
 
The adjudicating officer vide order dated June 30, 
2014,  imposed  a  consolidated  monetary  penalty  of   ` 
76  crore  on  M/s Taksheel  Solutions  Ltd.  and  15  other 
entities  for  violation  of   Sections  12A(a),  (b)  and  (c) 
of   SEBI  Act  read  with  Regulations  3(a),(b),(c),(d)  and 
Regulations  4(1),  (2)  (a),(d),(e),  (f),  (k)  and  (r)  of   SEBI

the 
allegations  levelled  by  the  complainant,  Mr.  Kimsuk 
Krishna  Sinha  in  respect  of   M/s  DLF  Ltd.  and  M/s 
Sudipti  Estates  Pvt.  Ltd.  The 
inter-

investigation 

alia  revealed  that  the  M/s  DLF  Ltd.  and  seven  other 
entities  (its  directors/CEO/CFO)  (noticees)  employed 
a  scheme  by  camouflaging  the  association  of   M/s 
Sudipti Estates Pvt. Ltd. with DLF as dissociation. They 
failed to ensure that the RHP/prospectus contained all 
material  information  which  was  true  and  adequate 
so  as  to  enable  the  investors  to  make  informed 
investment  decisions  with  respect  to  the  issue.  The 
noticees  actively  and  knowingly  suppressed  material 
information  and  facts  in  the  RHP/prospectus  leading 
to  mis-statements  in  the  RHP/prospectus  so  as  to 
mislead and defraud investors in securities markets in 
connection with the issue of  shares of  DLF. 

SEBI  vide  order  dated  October  10,  2014 
(impugned  order)  had  restrained  M/s  DLF  Ltd.,

Mr.  Vadlamani  Srinivas  (chief   finance  officer),  Mr. 
G  Ramakrishna  (vice-president,  finance)  and  Mr. 
Prabhakar  Gupta  (head  –  internal  audit).  They  were 
deliberately conveying a false picture about the financials 
of  the company to the public and concerned authorities. 
Further, these persons had taken advantage of  the inside

privy to and sold their holdings in M/s Satyam Computers 
at a high price when its financials did not warrant such 
high valuation. 

 
Therefore, SEBI vide order dated July 15, 2014 held 
that these persons had violated Section 12A of  the SEBI 
Act and Regulations 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) and Regulations

accessing  securities  markets  and  prohibited  them  from 
buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly 
or indirectly or being associated with securities markets 
in any manner whatsoever for a period of  14 years. They 
were  also  directed  to  disgorge  the  wrongful  gain  made 
by them from their contraventions with simple interest 
at 12 percent per annum from January 7, 2009, till the 
date of  payment.

orders dated March 12, 2015 imposing a total penalty 
of   `  4.82  crore  for  violation  of   Regulations  3  (a),

were  controlling  the  entire  shareholding  of   Sudipti 
and  that  all  the  three  companies  (DHDL,  DEDL  and

and  seven  others  (noticees)  had  employed  a  scheme 
by  camouflaging  the  association  of   Sudipti  with  DLF

X.  Adjudication  order  against  M/s  Teakwood 
Management  Services  Ltd.  in  the  matter  of  
M/s Edserv Softsystems Ltd.

  SEBI has conducted an investigation into M/s 
Edserv  Softsystems  Ltd.’s  (ESL)  IPO. The  investigation 
report  observed  that  M/s  Nirman  Management 
Services  Pvt.  Ltd.  –  currently  known  as  M/s 
Teakwood  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd.  (noticee/
company) was a major trader in the shares of  ESL at 
NSE  and  BSE.  The  investigation  period  in  ESL’s  scrip 
was  taken  from  March  2,  2009  to  March  13,  2009. 
After  considering  the  evidence,  it  was  observed  by 
the AO that the noticee had executed buy orders at a 
higher  price  than  the  prevailing  market  price  despite 
the  availability  of   sufficient  sell  orders  at  the  lower 

price  in  the  market  at  NSE  and  thereby  manipulated 
the  price  of   the  scrip.  The  noticee  executed  self-
trades/fictitious  trades  which  resulted  in  no  change 
in  beneficial  ownership  of   shares.  The  noticee  had 
created  an  artificial  volume  in  the  shares  of   ESL 
by  placing  purchase  and  sale  orders  of   the  same 
number of  shares at the same price within negligible 
time  at  the  lower  circuit  limit  and  thereby  created  a 
misleading  appearance  of   trading.  In  view  of   this,  a 
penalty  of   `  one  crore  was  imposed  on  the  noticee 
for  violations  of   Regulations  3  (a)  &  (d)  and  4  (1), 
4  (2)  (a),  (e)  &  (g)  of   the  SEBI  (PFUTP)  Regulations,

Box 3.1: Empowering Investors

 
Investors  are  the  bedrock  of   capital  markets. The  primary  mandate  of   SEBI  is  to  protect  the  interests  of  
investors  in  securities  markets.  SEBI’s  investor  protection  mandate  as  stated  under  Section  11  of   the  SEBI  Act 
provides for a three pronged strategy: proactive investor protection measures and enforcement, investor grievance 
redressal mechanisms and investor awareness programmes.
 
In the recent period, there has been a focused endeavour towards implementing innovative methods to make 
investors  aware,  foster  policies  for  the  protection  of   investor  interests,  simplify  the  processes  to  attract  increased 
participation and launching technologically advanced modes of  grievance redressal mechanisms.
Protecting the interests of  investors is embedded in almost all the laws, rules and policies enacted by SEBI for 
 
promoting, developing and regulating markets.  A step further in this direction has been envisioned through recent 
policy measures  which include inter-alia single KYC for securities markets, increase in the cash investment limit by 
mutual funds, basic services demat accounts, e-voting facility, mandatory authentication of  listed companies on the 
SCORES platform, Saral account opening form for resident individual investors, interim monetary relief  for investors 
from IPF of  stock exchanges, simplification of  processes in securities markets, enhanced disclosures and transparency 
by listed companies and exchanges, revised corporate disclosure norms, product labelling in mutual funds and IPEF 
regulations. 
 
While investor interests are ensured through various policies, checks and balances, the expeditious redressal 
of   their  grievances  is  a  pre-requisite  for  retaining  their  confidence  in  markets  and  for  regulation.    In  2011,  SEBI 
commenced a new web-based centralised grievance redress system, SCORES (SEBI complaints redress system) which 
has now emerged as the cornerstone of  SEBI’s efforts to redress the grievances of  investors in a time-bound manner. 
The SCORES system has been working satisfactorily and has helped in making the complaint handling and redressal 
mechanism more efficient. Additional safeguards include mandating intermediaries to put systems in place to address 
investor complaints and make investor grievance redressal mechanism centres functional in various cities across the 
nation. Apart from the assistance provided to investors through traditional modes like emails and letters, SEBI also 
launched two dedicated toll free helpline numbers available to investors from all over India in 14 languages on all days 
from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. throughout the week except on declared holidays in Maharashtra.
 
Knowledge empowers investors. The focus on inclusive policy recognises that financial literacy and education play 
a crucial role in financial inclusion. Since 2011-12, SEBI has gone a step further by altering the modes of  awareness 
and by relying more on the media and also involving schools and colleges to spread financial education.
 
SEBI maintains a comprehensive website for educating investors to guide and enlighten investors and to make 
them  aware  of   their  rights  and  remedies.  (http://investor.sebi.gov.in). The  education  material  designed  by  SEBI  is 
periodically updated and the schedules of  various programmes such as workshops for investor education/financial 
education  are  uploaded  on  the  investor  website.  SEBI  also  grants  financial  assistance  to  15  recognised  investor 
associations for investor education.
A financial education drive was launched through the creation of  a separate class of  information disseminators 
 
called resource persons (RPs), where teachers and lecturers were trained and empanelled for conducting financial 
education workshops. The study material developed for this target group is presently available in English, Hindi and 
11 vernacular languages. Another mode of  spreading awareness was the ‘Visit to SEBI’ programme, wherein students 
from schools, colleges and professional institutes who are interested in learning about SEBI and its role as a regulator of  
securities markets, visited SEBI.  Educational institutions from 20 states, three union territories and 60 districts visited 
SEBI under this programme.
 
As a measure to protect investors, since December 2012 SEBI has been pursuing a massive investor education 
and awareness campaign through mass media on relevant topics of  investor awareness. As a part of  the campaign, 
advertisements on relevant topics of  investor awareness are released through popular media vehicles TV, radio and 
print on a pan-India basis in Hindi, English and 11 major regional languages. Through such campaigns, investors 
are  cautioned  not  to  rely  on  schemes  offering  unrealistic  returns  and  not  to  invest  by  hearsay  and  do  proper  due 
diligence. In addition, the regional seminars initiative was started in 2011-12 which has expanded its scope and reach 
significantly in terms of  investor population and geographical landscape. At present it primarily concentrates on Tier 
II and Tier III cities. Further, to create more awareness regarding unauthorised collective investment schemes (CIS), 
a CD containing media campaigns has been sent to all resource persons and all offices of  SEBI.  In order to develop 
a pan-India securities market, SEBI embarked on a policy to strengthen its regional offices and open local offices in 
various state capitals. It was felt that physical proximity of  a SEBI office to investors and intermediaries would promote 
deepening and broadening of  securities markets.
As  envisaged  in  the  National  Strategy  for  Financial  Education,  with  a  vision  of   ‘a  financially  aware  and 
 
empowered  India’,  the  National  Centre  for  Financial  Education  (NCFE)  incubated  in  the  National  Institute  of  
Securities  Markets  (NISM)  continues  to  undertake  various  activities  for  financial  education. These  include  the

SEBI’s  role  as  investor  protector  is  not  limited  to  educational  programmes  and  redressal  mechanisms.  SEBI  also 
has  vigorous  and  comprehensive  enforcement  mechanisms,  particularly  against  unregulated  collective  investment 
schemes defrauding millions of  investors in the country. SEBI aggressively pursues violators of  securities laws, imposes 
severe monetary penalties, imposes disgorgement and prevents them from operating in securities markets.

programmes  on  securities  operations,  risk 
management  and  equity  derivatives.  For 
adequacy  of   CPE  trainers  across  all  modules 
(including the newly launched CPE modules)
and  across  the  country,  NISM  undertook 
an  exercise  to  approve  and  empanel  CPE 
trainers.  Accordingly,  88  individuals  were 
approved/empanelled 
trainers

new  70  acre  state-of-the-art,  NISM  campus 
is coming up at Patalganga near Panvel. The 
estimated cost of  construction is `325 crore. 
Since  NISM  is  a  public  private  partnership, 
`225  crore  is  being  contributed  by  SEBI  and 
`100  crore  is  being  mobilised  from  other 
regulators  and  market  participants.  The 
campus  will  be  a  green,  energy  efficient  and 
environment friendly one. The commemorative 
plaque  launching  the  campus  was  unveiled 
by  the  then  Hon’ble  Prime  Minister  of   India 
Dr  Manmohan  Singh  on  24th  May,  2013  at 
SEBI’s silver jubilee function. Among the main 
features of  the campus are modern classrooms 
equipped with latest technology, a 400 seater 
auditorium, 
library,  amphitheatre  and  a 
recreational  block.  Having  the  potential  of  
accommodating 5,000 students, the campus 
is being developed for 900 students in the first 
phase.  The  ‘Financial  Markets  Conclave  on 
Capacity Building and Talent Acquisition’ was 

held at Patalganga on 20 February, 2015. As 
per present projections, work on the campus is 
likely to be completed by December 2015.

Chart 3.3: Districts Represented by Resource Persons

Through  these  resource  persons,  around  7,702 
financial education workshops in around 450 districts 
covering  28  states  and  six  union  territories  were 
conducted  during  2014-15;  there  have  been  over 
24,000 programmes since 2010.

 
With  a  view  to  addressing  issues  related  to 
conducting  workshops,  difficulties  and  constraints 
faced  by  RPs,  refresher  training  was  organised  in 
February  2015  in  Hyderabad  for  existing  resource 
persons  in  the  southern  region  and  in  Maharashtra. 
Refresher training updated all RPs on the content of  the 
study material and also about the new developments in 
SEBI’s policies regarding financial education initiatives 
and investor protection.

B.  Visit to SEBI

SEBI  hosts  2-3  hour  programmes  for  students 
from schools, colleges and professional institutes who 
are  interested  in  learning  about  SEBI  and  its  role  as 
a  regulator  of   securities  markets.  The  programme 
was  started  in  February  2011  and  has  been  quite 
popular.  Till  date,  SEBI  had  hosted  336  such  visits 
with  participants  visiting  from  different  parts  of  
the  country  and  from  different  courses  (company 
secretaries,  management,  commerce,  banking,  law, 
arts,  science,  etc.).  Further,  visits  have  also  been 
initiated  in  SEBI’s  various  local  and  regional  offices 
(Table 3.25).

D.  National Strategy for Financial Education

 
With  a  vision  of   ‘a  financially  aware  and 
empowered India’, the National Strategy for Financial 
Education  is  under  implementation  by  the  National 
Centre  for  Financial  Education  (NCFE).  As  envisaged 
in  the  strategy,  a  national  financial  inclusion  survey 
(NFLIS)  has  been  completed.  A  national  level  exam 
for  school  students,  the  national  financial  literacy 
assessment test (NFLAT) was conducted for the second 
year which was taken by over one lakh students. The 
results have been published on the NCFE website.

NCFE-Financial Education Website (NCFE-FEW):

 
A  portal,  www.ncfeindia.org,  which  has 
information about various aspects of  financial markets 
including  banking,  pension,  insurance  and  securities 
markets  with  content  inputs  from  various  regulators 
including SEBI has been launched. The first phase of  
the NCFE website has been completed. Content related 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

to  financial  literacy  developed  by  all  financial  sector 
regulators  is  made  available  on  the  website.  This 
is  updated  with  videos,  audio  and  other  materials. 
Unbiased  product  and  company  neutral  content 
developed  by  the  private  sector  has  also  been  made 
available on the website. Efforts are on to make content 
available  in  various  regional  languages  in  a  phased 
manner.

NCFE-  Financial  Literacy  and  Inclusion  Survey 
(NCFE-FLIS):

The NCFE financial literacy and inclusion survey 
 
has been completed and draft reports submitted to the 
technical  group  on  financial  inclusion  and  financial 
literacy  of   the  FSDC  sub-committee  for  review. These 
reports  are  expected  to  provide  valuable  inputs  to 
the  government,  regulators  and  other  stakeholders 
of   the  financial  sector  as  well  as  academicians  about 
the  current  state  of   financial  literacy  and  financial 
inclusion  in  the  country,  paving  the  way  for  policy 
interventions  at  the  micro  level  to  address  specific 
issues and challenges. 

IV. 

Investor Grievance Redressal

 
SEBI has been taking various regulatory measures 
to  expedite  the  redressal  of   investor  grievances.  The 
grievances  lodged  by  investors  are  taken  up  with  the 
respective  listed  company  or  intermediary  and  are 
continuously  monitored.  Grievances  pertaining  to 
stock brokers and depository participants are taken up 
with the concerned stock exchange and depository for 
redressal and monitored by the concerned department 
through  periodic  reports  obtained 
them. 
Grievances pertaining to other intermediaries are taken 
up  with  them  directly  for  redressal  and  continuously 
monitored by the concerned department at SEBI.

from 

 
The company/intermediary is required to respond 
in a prescribed format in the form of  an action taken 

is 

insufficient/inadequate, 

report  (ATR).  Upon  the  receipt  of   ATR,  the  status  of  
grievances is updated. If  the response of  the company/
intermediary 
follow  up 
action is initiated. SEBI takes appropriate enforcement 
actions (adjudication, 11B directions, prosecution etc.) 
as provided under the law where progress in redressal 
of  investor grievances is not satisfactory.

SCORES has helped investors in getting real time 
 
information about the status of  their grievances since 
investors  can  log  onto  SCORES  at  any  time  and  from 
anywhere  and  check  the  status  with  the  help  of   a 
username and password provided to them at the time 
of   lodging  the  grievance.  Alternatively,  investors  can 
also call the SEBI helpline to check the status of  their 
grievances.

 
Since  SCORES  has  made  it  possible  to  receive 
grievances  online  this  helps  SEBI  to  take  up  issues 
fast, including those that may require a policy change. 
Further,  since  companies  are  required  to  file  ATRs 
within 30 days of  receipt of  complaint, in case of  any 
failure  SEBI  can  initiate  action  against  the  company 
depending on the merit of  the case.

The 

 
following  paragraphs  highlight  SEBI’s 
performance  and  measures  taken  in  2014-15  for 
expediting the redressal of  investor grievances.

A. 

SEBI Complaints Redress System

 
SEBI  received  38,442  complaints  during  2014-
15  and  resolved  35,090  grievances  cumulatively  as 
compared to 33,550 grievances received and 35,299 
grievances  resolved  in  2013-14.  The  number  of  
investor complaints received by SEBI on a cumulative 
basis increased from 28,86,074 as on March 31, 2014 
to 29,24,516 as on March 31, 2015. During the same 
period  the  number  of   pending  actionable  complaints 
reduced  from  9,147  to  5,736  (Table  3.26  and  Chart 
3.4 and 3.5).

Chart 3.4: Redressal rate of  SCORES (in percent)

Chart 3.5: Cumulative Pending Grievances on SCORES

SCORES  enables 

investors  to  directly 

 
lodge 
complaints online and such complaints are considered as 
‘e-complaints’. During 2014-15, 23,035 e-complaints 
were  received  compared  to  18,811  received  during 
2013-14.  While  investors  can  lodge  e-complaints  on 
SCORES, any physical complaint received against any 
of  the entities in the SCORES database is also uploaded 
on SCORES and thus converted into an e-complaint and 
action similar to that with regard to an e-complaint is 
taken.

The  SCORES 

 
system  has  been  working 
satisfactorily and has helped in making the complaint 
handling and redress mechanism more efficient. SEBI 

conducted a sample survey on SCORES in March 2015 
when feedback was sought from investors. Some of  the 
important findings of  the survey are:

(cid:114)(cid:1)

B. 

Companies raising capital through public issues 
 
of  securities are required to deposit one percent of  the 
issue amount with the designated stock exchange. This 
deposit is released by the stock exchange only after No 
objection certificate is received.

111

SEBI  issues  NOCs  to  companies  after  satisfactory 
redressal  of   complaints  received  by  SEBI  against  the 
companies. During 2014-15, NOCs were issued to 70 
applicant companies. NOCs to 25 companies were not 
issued  as  the  applications  were  incomplete  or  due  to 
unsatisfactory redressal of  investor grievances.

C. 

SEBI Toll Free Helpline

 
SEBI launched toll free helpline service numbers 
1800  22  7575/1800  266  7575  on  December  30, 
2011. The helpline service is available every day from 
9:30  a.m.  to  5:30  p.m.  (except  on  declared  public 
holidays  in  Maharashtra)  to  investors  from  all  over 
India.  During  2014-15,  SEBI  attended  1,60,081 
calls on the toll free helpline. Feedback from the calls 
answered during 2014-15 is given in Chart 3.6.

Chart 3.6: Trends in Investor Feedback for Calls Received in SEBI Helpline ( in percent)

 
Towards  the  mandate  of   investor  protection,  a 
major  thrust  in  2014-15  was  on  enhanced  investor 
awareness  and  education  and 
in  spreading  the 
reach  to  include  more  investors  through  mass  media 
campaigns. 

VII.  Regulatory  action  against  companies  and 
their directors for non-redressal of  investor 
grievances 

SEBI takes appropriate enforcement actions when 
 
progress in redressal of  grievances is not satisfactory. 
Enforcement  actions  include  adjudication,  directions 
and  prosecution.  During  2014-15,  SEBI 
levied 
penalty  of   `  34.25  lakh  against  17  entities  through 
adjudication proceedings for failure to redress investor 
grievances. 

Further, regulatory actions were initiated against 
 
620  entities  in  2014-15  for  their  failure  to  redress 
investor grievances.

turn  passed  it  to  another  person  and  to  the 
son-in-law of  a connected person, who traded 
in  the  scrip  while  in  the  possession  of   UPSI 
and made unlawful gains.

B.  The  Managing  Director  of   a  company  and 
his  wife  sold  shares,  trading  before  the 
announcement  of   quarterly  results  while 

112

Insider Trading Cases during 2014-15

Interim  Order  in  the  matter  of   M/s  L&T 
Finance Holdings Ltd. 

 

 

 

 

II. 

A. 

 
On  March  11,  2014,  M/s  L&T  Finance  and 
Holdings  was  up  by  almost  5  percent  on  the  news 
of   its  inclusion  in  the  F&O  segment  from  March  13, 
2014. On March 13, 2014 after moving to a high of  
` 88, it closed at ` 79.20 with volumes doubling the 
previous  day.  In  the  evening,  a  release  by  M/s  L&T 
and M/s L&T Finance to stock exchanges announced 
that M/s L&T would offer sale of  5.55 crore shares (or 
a  3.23  percent  stake)  in  M/s  L&T  Finance  to  comply 
with  SEBI’s  minimum  public  holding  norms.  Within 
minutes of  the release, the floor price (for the offer for 
sale) was announced at ` 70 a share. On examination, 
a hedge fund was suspected of  executing trades based 
on  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  regarding 
the floor price thereby taking undue advantage of  the 
price  disparity  between  F&O  and  the  cash  segment. 
The fund cornered more than 85 percent of  the market 
volume and locked a substantial profit.

 
It was also observed that the fund took a reverse 
position  of   nearly  the  same  number  of   shares  in  the 
cash segment by subscribing to OFS on the very next day 
thus locking a profit for itself, prima facie suggesting a 
device or artifice by M/s Factorial to deceive investors in  
securities  markets  and  make  a  profit  in  a  manner 
which was disruptive to the market equilibrium. Thus, 
in  order  to  protect  the  interest  of   the  investors  and 
the integrity of  securities markets, SEBI passed an ad 
interim ex-parte order dated June 5, 2014, restraining 

M/s  Factorial  Master  Fund  from  dealing  in  securities 
in Indian securities markets (including through ODIs) 
and/or  accessing  Indian  securities  markets,  directly 
or  indirectly,  in  any  manner  whatsoever  till  further 
orders. 

B. 

Interim  Order  in  respect  of   Mr.  Abhijit 
Rajan, Ex-Chairman and Managing Director 
of   M/s  Gammon  Infrastructure  Projects 
Ltd. (GIPL)

 
During  a  preliminary  inquiry,  it  was  observed 
that on September 3, 2013, M/s GIPL made a disclosure 
to  the  stock  exchanges  regarding  termination  of  
shareholders  agreement  dated  April  26,  2012  with 
M/s  Simplex  Infrastructures  Ltd.  (SIL).  Prior  to  this 
announcement,  on  August  9,  2013,  the  decision  to  
terminate  the  shareholders  agreement  was  approved 
in  the  board  meeting  chaired  by  Mr.  Abhijit  Rajan. 
Thereafter,  on  August  22,  2013,  Mr.  Abhijit  Rajan, 
the  then  CMD  of   M/s  GIPL  sold  1,43,81,246  shares 
held  by  him  in  GIPL  at  BSE  and  NSE.  Mr.  Abhijit 
Rajan,  being  an  insider  traded  in  GIPL  shares  while 
he  was  in  possession  of   unpublished  price  sensitive  
information. Therefore,  Mr.  Abhijit  Rajan  had,  prima 
facie,  violated  provisions  of   Sections  12A  (d)  and  (e) 
of   the  SEBI  Act,  1992  and  Regulation  3(i)  read  with 
Regulation 4 of  the SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992.

 
Accordingly, SEBI passed an ad interim ex-parte 
order  dated  July  17,  2014  restraining  Mr.  Abhijit 
Rajan  from  buying,  selling  or  dealing  in  securities 
and  accessing  the  securities  markets,  either  directly 
or  indirectly,  in  any  manner  whatsoever  till  further 
directions  in  the  matter  of   dealing  in  the  scrips  of  
M/s  GIPL.

C.  Orders  against  M/s  PVP  Energy  Pvt.  Ltd. 
(Now  known  as  M/s  PVP  Global  Ventures 
Pvt.  Ltd.)and  Mr.  Prasad  V  Potluri  in  the 
matter of  M/s PVP Ventures Ltd.

investigation 

  SEBI  conducted  an 

in  the 
scrip  of   the  M/s  PVP  Ventures  Ltd.  (PVP)  for  the 
period  September  1,  2009  to  October  30,  2009. 
It  was  observed  from  PVP’s  quarterly  results  for 
the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2009,  published  
by  the  exchanges  on  October  31,    2009,  that  it  had 
suffered  a  net  loss    of   `  599.12  crore  as  against 
a  net  loss  of   `  4.48  crore  for  the  quarter  ending  
June  30,  2009.  An 
investigation  revealed  that

(noticee  no.1) 

the  value  of  

loss  was  mainly  due 

to  exceptional 
the  net 
items  of   `  593.65  crore  representing  a  write-
off  
in  equity 
shares  and  debentures  amounting  to  `  542.05  
crore  and  advances  amounting  to  `  51.60  crore 
extended  to  its  subsidiary  M/s  PVP  Energy  Pvt. 
Ltd. 
for  which  provisions  were 
made  by  PVP  on  September  30,  2009.  The 
investigation  also  revealed  that  notice  no.  1  was  a 
wholly  owned  subsidiary  of   PVP  and  Mr.  Prasad 
V.  Potluri  (noticee  no.  2)  was  the  CMD  of   PVP  and 
also  director  of   noticee  no.  1.  Since  the  financial 
results  of   PVP  for  the  quarter  ended  September  
2009 were published on the NSE  website on October 
31,  2009,  the  period  of   September  30,  2009  to 
October  30,  2009  was  taken  as  the  period  of   UPSI. 
Investigations revealed that 1,89,09,881 shares were 
sold  during  the  period  of   UPSI  by  noticee  no.  1  and 
noticee no. 2 traded on behalf  of  noticee no. 1 during 
the UPSI period. 

 
The  adjudicating  officer  passed  an  order  dated 
March 27, 2015 imposing a penalty of  ` 15 crore each 
on M/s PVP Energy Pvt. Ltd. and Mr. Prasad V. Potluri 
under  Section  15G  of   SEBI  Act,  1992  for  violation 
of   Sections  12A  (d)  and  (e)  of   SEBI  Act,  1992  and 
Regulations 3(i) and (ii) read with Regulation 4 of  PIT 
Regulations, 1992.

III.  Steps  initiated  to  curb  Insider  Trading 

practices

 

 

A. SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992 and SEBI (PIT) 

Regulations, 2015 are in place.

B.  Actions are initiated in terms of  provisions of  
SEBI Act, 1992 which also include adjudication 
and proceedings for levy of  monetary penalty. 
These also act as a deterrent.

The 

total  penalty 

imposed  by  SEBI 

in 
 
adjudication  proceedings  for  violations  of   SEBI  (PIT) 
Regulations, 1992 was ` 37.6 crore in 2014-15 compared 
to ` 20.4 crore in 2013-14. The total penalty imposed for 
2014-15 includes ` 34.1 crore imposed under SEBI (PIT) 
Regulations,1992  &  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  1997  as 
common  orders  were  passed  in  certain  matter  during 
2014-15 as against ` 0.45 crore in 2013-14.

8. 

SUBSTANTIAL  ACQUISITION  OF  SHARES 
AND TAKEOVERS

 
The  existence  of   an  efficient  and  smooth-
functioning  market  for  takeovers  plays  an  important 

role  in  the  economic  development  of   a  country. 
Existence  of   an  efficient  and  well-administered  set  of  
takeover regulations ensures that the takeover markets 
operate in a fair, equitable and transparent manner. The 
SEBI  Act,  1992  expressly  mandates  SEBI  to  regulate 
substantial  acquisition  of   shares  and  takeovers  by 
taking suitable measures. Accordingly, SEBI provided a 
legal framework by notifying the Takeover Regulations 
in  1994.  The  new  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations  were 
notified in 2011.

Open Offer
I. 
During the financial year 2014-15, 87 draft letters

INFORMATION 
FROM, 
INSPECTIONS  UNDERTAKEN,  INQUIRIES 
AND  AUDIT  OF  STOCK  EXCHANGES  AND 
INTERMEDIARIES CONDUCTED BY SEBI

Regulation  of   intermediaries  is  an  essential 
 
part  of   the  framework  for  regulation  of   securities 
markets. The basic objective of  prudential supervision 
of   market  intermediaries  is  to  safeguard  the  stability 
of   the  financial  system,  protect  client  interests  from 
undue  risks  of   losses  that  may  arise  from  failure, 
fraud or any opportunist behaviour on the part of  the 
intermediaries,  promote  the  efficient  performance  of  
intermediaries and markets and ensure compliance by 
market  intermediaries.  Supervision  of   intermediaries 
through  on-site  and  off-site  inspections,  enquiries 
and  adjudications  in  case  of   violations  of   rules  and 
regulations  and  administrative  and  statutory  actions 
are essential features of  effective enforcement by SEBI. 

SEBI 

conducts 

inspections 

of   market 
 
intermediaries  directly  as  well  as  through  institutions 
like stock exchanges and depositories. Inspections were 
conducted  during  the  year  to  verify  the  compliance 
levels of  intermediaries. Special purpose (theme based) 
inspections were also conducted on the basis of  investor 
complaints, references, surveillance reports and specific 
concerns.  Special  purpose  inspections  of   major  stock 
exchanges as well as the depositories were also carried 
out in order to examine the effectiveness and quality of  
their audits/inspections and action taking processes.

Inspection of  Market Intermediaries

The  inspection  process  of   intermediaries  has 
been  further  streamlined  with  a  view  to  improving 
quality  such  as  selection  of   themes  for  inspections, 
questionnaire for inspections and follow up action. 

Based  on  the  findings  of   the  inspections  after 
considering  the  comments  of   intermediaries,  they 
were  specifically  advised  about  the  areas  where 
improvements were required. They were also required 
to  report  to  SEBI  about  the  corrective  steps  taken 
and  also  place  these  before  their  board/partners/
proprietor,  as  the  case  may  be.  These  steps  taken  by 
SEBI  have  improved  the  level  of   compliance  among 
the  intermediaries.  Administrative  and  quasi-judicial 
actions  were 
initiated  based  on  the  deficiencies 
and  seriousness  of   the  violations  committed  by  the 
intermediaries.

During  2014-15,  202  stock  brokers  and  sub-
brokers  were  inspected.  The  focus  of   the  inspections 
included  themes  such  as  compliance  of   norms 
regarding  anti-money 
investor 
redressal  mechanism,  handling  funds  and  securities 
of  clients, settlement of  accounts of  clients on a timely 
basis,  segregation  of   clients  and  proprietary  funds/

with specific-purpose, single-theme inspections during 
2014-15,  30  comprehensive  inspections  of   stock 
brokers  were  ordered  out  of   which  20  inspections 
were  carried  out.  During  inspections,  compliance  of  
specific  provisions  of   SEBI  regulations/circulars  was 

verified. The details of  inspections of  stock brokers and

The  stock  exchanges  carried  out  risk  based 
inspections as per the new policy adopted by them in 
consultation  with  SEBI.  Additionally,  stock  brokers/
clearing members are required to carry out complete 
internal audits on a half  yearly basis; these audits have 
to be done by independent auditors. Stock exchanges 
levy penalties for delay in filing internal audit reports 
by stock brokers. The system of  internal audits of  stock 
brokers  by  outside  professionals,  inspections  by  stock 
exchanges and by SEBI has improved compliance levels 
of  stock brokers.

Box 3.2. Regulatory Actions against Registered and Unregistered Intermediaries

In addition to the various policy measures undertaken by SEBI to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for 
intermediaries, SEBI, during the course of  financial year 2014-15, has passed a series of  ex-parte - ad-interim orders against 
various entities/intermediaries for serious violations and misconducts.
Interim  orders  have  been  passed  against  M/s  Kassa  Finvest  Pvt.  Ltd,  M/s  Wasankar  Wealth  Management  Limited  and  Mr. 
Sameer S. Joshi for raising funds by way of  promising high assured returns to their clients ;against M/s Unickon Securities 
Pvt. Ltd. for mis utilising the clients funds and securities for own purposes; against M/s Shri Balaji Investments, for indulging 
in illegal trading and settlement and carrying out transactions outside the stock exchange platform; and against Mr.Vaibhav 
Gandhi  &  Others  for  claiming  themselves  to  be  stock  brokers  and  depository  participants  as  per  their  websites  and  making 
misrepresentations thereby inducing investors to deal in securities.
It was prima facie observed that the entities concerned were acting / conducting their business which was not in accordance with 
the regulatory framework governing them as well as was detrimental to the interest of  investors. In order to prevent such above 
mentioned entities from causing further damage to the market and investors at large, SEBI passed ad-interim orders against the 
entity, its Promoters / Directors inter-alia directing, restraining them from accessing the securities market, prohibiting it from 
buying, selling or dealing in securities market, dispose off  or alienate any assets, mobilizing or pooling funds from its clients etc.

III.  Prevention of  Money Laundering

Money  laundering  is  considered  one  of   the 
serious  issues  facing  the  financial  systems  around 
the  world.  Combined  with  the  financing  of   terrorist 
activities,  the  issue  of   money  laundering  has  been 
at  the  heart  of   regulations  worldwide  to  ensure 
transparent, 
fair  and  smooth  financial  markets. 
Last  year  SEBI  made  modifications  to  its  anti-money 
laundering/countering 
terrorism 
norms.  Intermediaries  were  permitted  to  depend 
on  third  parties  for  carrying  out  due  diligence  of  
their  clients.  Policy  measures  coupled  with  a  robust 
surveillance  mechanism  ensured  smooth  functioning 
of  the financial markets.

During  2014-15,  similar 

 
trends, 
SEBI  continued  its  focused  efforts  to  strengthen 
the  regulatory  framework  and  minimise  the  risks 
emanating  from  money  laundering  and  terrorist 
financing  in  securities  markets.  The  following  steps 
were taken in this regard:

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

A. 

Inspections on AML/CFT related issues

 
SEBI  has  appropriately  included  AML/CFT  risks 
as part of  its inspection of  intermediaries such as stock 
brokers,  depository  participants  and  mutual  funds. 
SEBI also carried out specific theme based inspections 
of   intermediaries  focusing  on  compliance  with  KYC 
norms (which includes client due diligence) and AML/
CFT  guidelines.  In  2014-15,  with  respect  to  stock 
brokers  SEBI  carried  out  35  and  24  special  purpose 
inspections to check their compliance with AML/CFT 
and  KYC  norms  respectively.  Further,  with  respect 
to  depository  participants,  21  and  15  inspections 
were  carried  out  to  verify  compliance  with  AML/
CFT  and  KYC  norms  respectively.  With  regard  to 
portfolio  managers,  SEBI  officials  visited  the  entities 
for verification of  compliance with KYC norms before 
granting  registration/renewal  of   registration.  With 
respect  to  mutual  funds,  30  inspections  were  carried 

out  wherein  compliance  with  AML/CFT  and  KYC 
related norms was reviewed.

 
In  addition  to  these  special  purpose  inspections 
conducted  by  SEBI,  compliance  with  AML/CFT 
norms  is  also  verified  by  the  stock  exchanges  and 
depositories  during  their  inspections  of   stock  brokers 
and depository participants and also at the time of  half  
yearly  internal  audits  by  independent  professionals. 
Depository  participants  are  also  required  to  undergo 
concurrent  audits  with  respect  to  their  operations, 
which  includes  account  opening/KYC/AML  norms. 
Appropriate  sanctions  are  applied  where  AML/CFT 
violations/ discrepancies are observed. 

 
Table  3.35  provides  data  on  the  number  of  
members/participants against whom action for AML/
CFT  discrepancies  were  taken  by  exchanges  and 
depositories in 2014-15.

towards  the  significance  of   the  AML/CFT  framework 
and the need to ensure continuous compliance with it.

B.  Risk  Assessment  for  Securities  Markets  to 

identify ML/TF risks
 
The  Ministry  of   Finance  has  set  up  different 
working groups to carry out risk assessments of  every 
financial sector in India to identify the various money 
laundering  and  terrorist  financing  risks  faced  and  to 
suggest measures to mitigate these risks. A group for 
the  securities  sector  has  also  been  set  up  comprising 
of   representation 
from  SEBI,  stock  exchanges, 
depositories,  associations  of   intermediaries  and  FIU-
IND. Work on risk assessment is expected to be carried 
out in the 2015-16.

International  Co-operation  on  AML/CFT 
related issues

 
SEBI has consistently been in touch with global 
bodies and other Indian regulators in its attempt to keep 
the regulatory framework for AML robust in the Indian 
securities markets. As part of  the Indian Government 
delegation  SEBI  officials  participated  in  the  plenary 
and working group meetings of  FATF and the Eurasian 
Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing 
of  Terrorism (EAG), which is a FATF-style regional body 
(FSRB),  for  setting  standards  and  promoting  effective 
implementation  of   legal,  regulatory  and  operational 
measures  for  combating  money  laundering,  terrorist 
financing and other related threats to the integrity of  
the international financial system.

In  order  to  protect  the  international  financial 
system  from  money  laundering  and  financing  of  
terrorism  (ML/FT)  risks  and  to  encourage  greater 
compliance  with  AML/CFT  standards,  FATF  identifies 
jurisdictions 
that  have  strategic  deficiencies  and 
works  with  them  to  address  those  deficiencies  that 
pose  a  risk  to  the  international  financial  system. 
The  names  of   these  jurisdictions  are  made  public 
as  part  of   FATF  public  statements.  As  required  by 
FATF  recommendations,  the  Ministry  of   Finance, 
Government of  India circulates FATF public statements 
to  all  regulators  with  an  advice  to  disseminate  them 
to  all  financial  institutions  under  their  supervision 
for  applying  enhanced  due  diligence  measures  when 
dealing  with  clients  from  these  high-risk  jurisdictions. 
In  2014-15,  SEBI  circulated 
three  FATF  public 
statements  dated  June  27,  2014,  October  24,  2014 
and  February  27,  2015  to  registered  intermediaries 
for  their  compliance.  A  special  public  statement  dated 
October  24,  2014  regarding  the  ‘Islamic  State  of  
Iraq  and  Levant’  was  also  issued  by  FATF,  which  was 
circulated by SEBI to all registered intermediaries. 

10.  DELEGATED POWERS AND FUNCTIONS

 
Section 29A of  SCRA, 1956 permits the central 
government to delegate powers exercisable by it under 
any  provision  of   SCRA,  1956  to  SEBI  also  by  order 
published  in  the  official  Gazette  except  the  power  to 
make  rules.  The  Central  Government  has  delegated 
certain  powers  to  SEBI  with  respect  to  regulation 
of   contracts  in  securities  and  stock  exchanges  and 
clearing corporations.

 
The  delegated  powers  with  respect  to  contracts 
in  securities  include  the  power  to  notify  permissible 
contracts  in  securities,  power  to  prohibit  contract 
in  securities  in  certain  cases  and  power  to  extend 
the  application  of   Section  17  with  respect  to  spot 
delivery contracts. To prevent undesirable speculation 
in  securities  markets  in  exercise  of   such  delegated 
powers, SEBI vide notification dated October 3, 2013 
superseded the notification dated March 1, 2000 and 
declared that no person in the territory to which the 
SC (R) Act extends, shall, save with the permission of  
the board, enter into any contract for sale or purchase 
of   securities  other  than  a  contract  falling  under  any 
one  or  more  categories  specified  therein.  The  said 
notification,  inter-alia,  permitted  contracts  for  pre-
emption  including  right  of   first  refusal,  tag-along 

120

or  drag-along  rights  contained  in  the  shareholders 
agreements  or  articles  of   association  of   companies. 
SEBI has also permitted contracts containing an option 
for purchase or sale of  securities subject to:

 

 

 

(cid:122)  The  title  and  ownership  of   the  underlying 
securities are held continuously by the selling 
party to such a contract for a minimum period 
of  one year from the date of  entering into the 
contract;

(cid:122)  The price or consideration payable for the sale or 
purchase of  the underlying securities pursuant 
to the exercise of  any option contained therein, 
is in compliance with all the laws for the time 
being in force, as applicable; and

(cid:122)(cid:3)The contract has to be settled by way of  actual 

delivery of  the underlying securities.

the 

The  contracts  permitted  under 

 
said 
notification  are  mandated  to  be  in  accordance  with 
the  provisions  of   the  Foreign  Exchange  Management 
Act,  1999.  Further,  it  was  declared  that  the  said 
notification would not affect or validate any contract 
which has been entered into prior to the date of  the said 
notification. The  said  notification  is  also  in  line  with 
the  proviso  to  Section  58(2)  of   the  Companies  Act, 
2013 which states that ‘any contract or arrangement 
between two or more persons in respect of  transfer of  
securities shall be enforceable as a contract.’

Delegated  powers  to  SEBI  with  respect  to  stock 
 
exchanges  and  clearing  corporations  include  the 
power  to  grant  or  withdraw  recognition,  power  to 
approve  additional  trading  floor,  new  segments  and 
new  products  in  stock  exchanges,  power  to  enquire 
into the affairs of  a stock exchange, licensing of  dealers 
in securities, power to direct rules to be made or make 
rules, power to supersede or reconstitute the governing 
board and suspend the business.

12.  RESEARCH AND STUDIES

SEBI’s  research  function  is  delineated  under 
Section  11(2)  (l)  of   the  SEBI  Act,  1992.  The  major 
research  activities  undertaken  by  SEBI  during  2014-
15 encompassed the following: 

I. 

The  Reporting  Mandate  and  maintenance 
of  Repository of  Information/Statistics

A.  Regulatory Reporting: SEBI Annual Report

In  accordance  with  Section  18(2)  of   the  SEBI 
Act,  SEBI  is  mandated  to  submit  to  the  government 
a  report  providing  a  full  and  true  account  of   its 
activities  undertaken  during  a  particular  financial 
year  within  90  days  of   the  completion  of   the 
financial  year.  Accordingly,  the  annual  report  for 
2013-14was  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  Ministry 
of  Finance within the specified timelines.

Besides  the  annual  report,  three  quarterly 
reports  detailing  all  the  policy  developments  and 
information  for  Indian  securities  markets  for  each 
quarter  was  presented  before  the  respective  SEBI 
board meeting for information.

B.  Handbook of  Statistics on Indian Securities 

Markets: Repository of  Data

As  a  regulator,  SEBI  has 

the  onus  and 
obligation  to  maintain  a  repository  of   data  for  the 
entire  capital/securities  markets  by  collecting  data 
from  various  sources,  verifying  their  accuracy  and 
continuously  maintaining/updating 
the  data.  In 
keeping  with  its  responsibility  of   disseminating  data 
and  ensuring  transparency  within  its  regulatory 
purview,  SEBI  published  the  Handbook  of   Statistics 
the on Indian Securities Market 2014. This handbook 
serves as a central repository of  data on the securities 
markets  providing  historical  data  on  multifarious 
parameters.

II. 

Information Support to various Authorities

Apart from the publications, SEBI is responsible 
for  providing  regular  information  to  the  Ministry  of  
Finance  (MoF),  the  Reserve  Bank  of   India  (RBI),  the 
Ministry of  Corporate Affairs and the Government of  
Maharashtra  for  their  updation  and  for  supporting 
informed  policy  decisions.  The  information  support 
includes  contributions  in  the  preparation  of   GoI’s 
Economic  Survey,  Government  of   Maharashtra’s 
Economic  Survey,  the  IMF  Redbook,  etc.  Inputs  and 
suggestions  were  also  provided  to  the  working  group 
constituted  by  RBI  to  study  the  rationalisation  and 
harmonisation  of   taxation  practices  of   financial 
instruments in India.

III.  SEBI Investor Survey

SEBI, in its short journey of  25 years, has made 
a  remarkable  impression  on  investors  as  well  as  the 
securities  markets.  The  Indian  securities  markets 
have  evolved  manifold 
in  terms  of   size,  reach, 
diversity  of   investors  and  product  complexity.  SEBI 
has  conducted  three  investor  surveys  till  now  in 
1998-99, 2001-02 (quick survey) and 2008-09.

The  2008-09  investors’  survey  was  conducted 
immediately  after  the  global  recession.  Since  2008-
09,  the  markets  have  undergone  changes. There  has 
been  an  upswing  in  the  markets  which  has  resulted 
in  the  growth  of   the  markets.  Further,  several  policy 
initiatives and new products have been introduced in 
the  securities  markets. These  developments  are  likely 
to  have  an  influence  on  the  investment  pattern  and 
investment  behaviour  of   households.  Thus,  during 
2014-15  SEBI  initiated  an  exercise  to  conduct  a 
comprehensive 
investor  survey  and  a  survey  of  
market  participants  for  the  base  year  2014-15.  The 
survey will cover the entire country, that is, 29 states 
and  seven  union  territories.  The  sample  size  will  be

VIII.  Regulatory Impact Assessment

One  of   the  six  major  recommendations  of   the 
report  of   the  high  powered  expert  committee  on 
making  Mumbai  an  international  financial  centre 
was conducting a rational cost-benefit analysis in the 
form  of   regular  ‘regulatory  impact  assessments  or 
RIAs’  (standard  practice  in  most  OECD  countries)  to 
compare  the  cost  of   inefficient  resource  allocations. 
In  this  regard,  comments  on  RIA  were  prepared  for 
the  IOSCO  Annual  Conference  in  Brazil  in  October 
2014.  Similarly,  comments  on  RIA  in  SEBI  were 
prepared and submitted to the Ministry of  Finance for 
its use. 

IX. 

Internal Knowledge Support

A.  Academic Interactions: SEBI invites renowned 
scholars  and  financial  market  practitioners 
to  deliver  lectures/talks  on  topics  related  to 
securities  markets,  economics,  finance  etc. 
Interactions between the speaker and SEBI staff  
help SEBI officials to gain insights and enhance 
their knowledge about the latest developments in 
the  marketplace,  including  market  movements, 
policy requirements and regulations. During the 
year, SEBI invited experts to speak on topics such 
as:  ‘Do  capital  inflows  and  inward  remittances 
affect  exchange  rate  and  economic  activity  in 
India?’, ‘Financial Inclusion in the Indian Capital 
Markets’,  ‘Navigating  Professional  Challenges’ 
and

This endeavour is aimed at keeping the SEBI staff  
informed  of   the  latest  regulatory  changes  and 
market  developments  at  the  international  level. 
During  2014-15,  12  issues  of   this  review  were 
prepared.

13.  SURVEILLANCE 

A  strong  and  robust  surveillance  mechanism 
is  one  of   the  prime  requirements  for  the  proper 
functioning  of   securities  markets.  This  mechanism 
is  needed  in  order  to  safeguard  the  integrity  of   the 
markets  and  to  ensure  that  the  markets  perform  in 
accordance  with  stipulated  norms  and  practices. 
Surveillance  is  a  vital  link  in  the  chain  of   activities 
performed  by  the  regulator  to  protect  investors  and 
for  developing  the  markets.  The  stock  exchanges,  as 
a  primary  regulator,  are  entrusted  to  act  as  the  first 
level  source  of   detecting  market  frauds,  suspicious 
activities  and  any  aberrations 
the  market 
movement; these are then reported to SEBI for further 
examination.

in 

At SEBI, the integrated surveillance department 
(ISD)  monitors  market  activity  through  its  market 
alert  systems  and  is  in  charge  of   overall  market 
surveillance. The  various  processes  and  systems  that 
help in detecting FUTP are now discussed.

A.  An  Integrated  Market  Surveillance  System 

(IMSS)

An 

integrated  market  surveillance  system 
(IMSS)  keeps  track  of   market  aberrations  and 
generates  alerts  on  a  daily  basis.  The  alerts 
are  analysed  periodically  so  as  to 
identify  any 
manipulative  trading  in  the  market.  During  the 
year,  SEBI  redesigned  the  IMSS  system’s  software  to 
handle  more  than  two  billion  messages  in  a  day  by 
implementing  the  market  splitting  and  streaming 
mechanism.  To 
system’s 
capability  and  performance  of   alert  generation 
process, 
implementation  of   alerting  on  multiple 
market stream are underway.

B.  Data  Warehousing 

and 

Business 

Intelligence System (DWBIS)

DWBIS  comprises  of   a  data  warehouse,  data 
mining  and  business  intelligence  tools.  Presently, 
DWBIS has three phases:

c. 

d. 

e. 

a.  Phase I: A single source of  market data which 
enables  users  to  generate  multi-dimensional 
reports dynamically (fully operational).

b.  Phase II: Several pattern recognition modules 
and  predictive  modelling  scenarios  (fully 
operational).

c.  Phase  III:  Various  reports  to  help  research 
initiatives  (released  for  user  acceptance  test 
(UAT)).

Surveillance Measures

Alert  generation  based  upon  the  data  on 
disclosures  by  members  regarding  their  and 
group entities holdings in various scrips.

Revision in the criteria for shifting scrips to trade 
for trade. The key changes implemented are:

1.  Period  of   review  of   shifting  scrips  into  and 
out  of   the  TFT  segment  standardised  to  a 
frequency of  one month.

2.  Price  variation  to  be  compared  to  the  price 
variation  observed  in  the  respective  sectoral 
index of  the industry to which the concerned 
scrip  belongs  or  the  price  variation  observed 
in a broader based index representative of  the 
market as a whole.

3.  Scrips coming out of  the TFT segment will be 
placed under a fixed price band until the next 
review.

Implementation  of   RBI’s  mandate  for  NBFCs 
with  an  asset  size  of   `  100  crore  and  above  to 
disclose  to  stock  exchanges  the  shares  pledged 
with them.

Suspension  of   companies  by  exchanges  which 
satisfies more than one of  the criteria of: (a) non-
existent on the addresses mentioned, (b) misuse 
of  preferential allotment, (c) weak fundamentals 
not supporting price rise. 

Exchanges  were  mandated  to  put  an  advisory 
on  their  websites  for  investors  with  respect  to 
trading in equity derivatives.

ISD  preparedness  for  expected  volatility 
during General Elections 2014 

  Considering  the  need  for  coordinated  action 
by  RBI  and  SEBI  in  case  of   excessive  volatility  or 
market  disruptions  due  to  the  general  elections 
and  their  outcome,  a  joint  committee  of   RBI-SEBI 
was  constituted.  SEBI  prepared  a  comprehensive 
report,  ‘Contingency  Measures  for  General  Election 
2014’  highlighting  a  historical  perspective,  data 
analysis  and  action  plan  for  addressing  the  concerns 
arising  out  of   unexpected  volatility  during  general 
elections  2014.  Additionally,  a  high 
level  crisis 
management  group  was  constituted  within  SEBI  to 
develop  a  comprehensive  plan  under  various  market 
scenarios  and  stress  conditions  so  as  to  address 
any  eventuality.  Two  cross-functional  operational 
teams  were  also  constituted  to  keep  a  close  watch 
on  market  developments  in  India  as  well  as  abroad 
during  the  pre-  and  post-election  period.  Extensive 
consultations  were  also  held  with  RBI,  exchanges, 
clearing  corporations,  brokers  and  other  relevant 
market 
identify  all  possible 
scenarios in the aftermath of  exit polls/results. Based 
on  these,  corresponding  measures  to  strengthen  the 

intermediaries 

to 

risk  management  framework  and  the  surveillance 
mechanism  so  as  to  address  any  possible  disruptions 
to the market were put in place. 

  During  the  election  process,  especially  after 
the  last  phase  of   the  elections,  the  control  room  at 
ISD  kept  constant  vigil  over  markets  and  took  stock 
of   the  situation  (including  international  markets, 
especially SGX Nifty at Singapore) at regular intervals 
during  the  day.  The  exchanges  were  also  involved  in 
the process. 

E. 

Surveillance Actions

  During  2014-15,  NSE  and  BSE  initiated 
preliminary examination and investigation of  53 and 
1,325  cases  respectively.  In  addition,  as  surveillance 
action during 2014-15 NSE shifted 472 scrips to the 
trade  to  trade  (T  to  T)  segment,  BSE  shifted  1,371 
scrips to the T to T segment and the MSEI shifted 315 
scrips to the trade to trade segment. In this segment, 
scrips  are  traded  and  settled  through  mandatory 
delivery and no netting off  positions are allowed. This 
leads  to  reduction  in  the  amount  of   speculation  as 
only  those  who  can  deliver  the  securities  can  enter 
into  sale  transactions  thereby  reducing  day  trading 
(Table 3.37).

With  a  view  to  dampening  the  amplitude  of  
prices,  scrips  that  have  shifted  to  the T  to T  segment 
attract  applicable  circuit  filters.  NSE  reduced  circuit 
filters  in  889  instances,  BSE  in  3,604  instances  and 
the MSEI in 863 instances. NSE and BSE verified 187 
and  191  rumours  respectively  (Table  3.39).  Further, 
as  a  soft  enforcement  measure,  NSE  and  BSE  issued 

observation letters to 1,136 entities and caution letter 
to two entities. Interim orders were passed pursuant to 
surveillance monitoring and detection.

During 2014-15, ISD issued 12 interim orders barring 
465  entities  from  accessing  securities  markets  or 
dealing  in  securities  markets  till  further  directions 
(Table 3.38).

Box 3.3: Cases of  Misuse of  Stock Exchange Mechanism for Tax Evasion

 
During  the  surveillance  of   the  markets  abnormal  price  rise  was  noticed  in  shares  of   some  companies  with  weak 
fundamentals. Detailed examination of  dealing in shares of  these companies uncovered similar pattern of  price movement, 
corporate  actions,  behaviour  of   participants,  etc.  revealing  the  modus  operandi  wherein  certain  entities  misused  the  stock 
exchange mechanism to create bogus Long-term Capital Gains to take advantage of  the tax concessions as the long term capital 
gains are exempt from capital gain tax. The detailed examination also revealed that many of  these companies were only paper 
compliant companies.

 
To protect the interests of  investors, preserve the safety and integrity of  Indian securities market and at the same time to 
send a strong deterrent signal to the market, SEBI, based on the prima-facie evidence, took swift proactive action by passing four 
ex-parte Interim orders against 392 entities including 18 listed companies, 30 promoters/directors, five trading members and 
108 private corporate bodies restraining them from accessing the securities market and buying, selling or dealing in securities, 
either directly or indirectly, till further directions. Considering possible case of  tax evasion and money laundering, the same 
have also been referred to Income Tax department, Enforcement Directorate, Financial Intelligence Unit and the Ministry of  
Corporate Affairs.

In addition, trading in the shares of  36 companies where similar violations are suspected has been suspended by SEBI/

 
Stock Exchanges.

purposes as mentioned in the company’s special resolution for preferential allotment.

During the lock-in period, a group of  connected entities contribute significantly to the volume traded and pushes the price 
up by contributing to positive Last Traded Price through first trades with negligible order quantity like even 1 or 2 shares. 
Astronomical price rise was observed in the shares of  the identified companies even extended to 7000 percentage in a case.

shares at such increased price. In many instances, it was observed that some of  the entities forming part of  the group 
appeared to be lacking the means for their purchases made. There was significant layering by way of  funds transfer in 
order to hide the real owners of  fund. Further, fund flow examination indicates routing of  money by the preferential 
allottees through various channels to the exit providers.

14.  INVESTIGATION

 
Timely  completion  of   investigation  cases  and 
effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  action  in  case 
of   violations  of   securities  laws  are  important  for 
the  protection  of   investors’  interests  and  ensuring 
fair,  transparent  and  orderly 
functioning  of   the 
markets.  It  is  also  vital  for  improving  the  confidence 

in the integrity of  securities markets. SEBI is therefore 
constantly  striving  to  upgrade  its  investigative  skills 
by  making  use  of   information  technology  (IT)  and 
other  latest  investigative  tools.  The  importance  of  
effective  and  credible  use  of   investigations  has  also 
been  underscored  by  IOSCO  in  its  ‘Principles  for  the 
Enforcement of  Securities Regulation’.

these 

objectives 

and 

Keeping 

in  view,  SEBI 

principles 
 
of   securities  regulations 
initiates 
investigations to examine alleged or suspected violations 
of  laws and regulations relating to securities markets. 
Possible  violations  may  include  price  manipulation, 
creating  an  artificial  market,  insider  trading,  capital 
issue related irregularities, takeover related violations, 
non-compliance  of   disclosure  requirements  and  any 
other misconduct in securities markets.

A. 

Initiation of  Investigation

integrated 

There  are  various  sources  of   information  for 
 
initiating an investigation. SEBI initiates investigations 
based  on  references  received  from  sources  such  as 
stock  exchanges,  SEBI’s 
surveillance 
department,  other  government  departments  and, 
information  submitted  by  market  participants  and 
complainants. In appropriate cases, investigations may 
also be initiated suo-moto, where there are reasonable 
grounds  to  believe  that  investors’  interest  are  being 
adversely affected or there are suspected violations of  
the provisions of  securities laws.

B.  Process of  Investigation

The  steps 

involved  during  an 

 
investigation 
include an analysis of  market data (order and trade log, 
transaction statements, etc.) and the existing database 

(KYC  documents  obtained  from  brokers,  depository 
participants,  etc.,  bank  records,  financial  results, 
events around major corporate developments, etc.) The 
purpose of  such investigations is to gather evidence and 
to identify the persons/entities behind irregularities and 
violations so that appropriate and suitable regulatory 
action can be taken wherever required. The outcome of  
the investigation in the form of  enforcement action is a 
clear signal to market players to comply with existing 
legal provisions and expected standards of  conduct in 
the market.

C. 

Trends in Investigation Cases

 
During 2014-15, 70 new cases were taken up for 
investigation and 122 cases were completed compared 
to 108 new cases taken up and 120 cases completed in 
2013-14 (Table 3.39). Apart from enforcement action, 
an  important  attendant  benefit  resulting  from  such 
investigations  is  their  contribution  to  policy  changes 
with  a  view  to  further  strengthening  the  regulatory 
and enforcement environment.

Box 3.4: US SEC appreciates assistance provided by SEBI

A website was offering a high-yield investment programme (HYIP) with extraordinary returns of  180, 
210, or 240 percent in 120 business days which far exceeded the returns that investors could reasonably expect on 
legitimate investments. The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) requested SEBI for assistance in establishing 
the identities of  the entities responsible for setting up and running the website offering the HYIP. SEC informed 
SEBI that the details provided while registering the website were fictitious and therefore prevented the discovery of  
persons who were responsible for it.

SEC  investigations  revealed  that  certain  entities  were  using  fictitious  names  and  they  were  responsible 
for the website. These entities had created various email ids to disguise their association with the website and for 
concealing their identities. Based on the information obtained and forwarded by SEBI to SEC and the inputs provided 
by SEBI, SEC passed an order instituting administrative and cease and desist proceeding pursuant to Section 8A of  
The Securities Exchange Act,1933. SEC, in its press release dated November 12, 2014, appreciated the assistance 
provided by SEBI in the matter.

D.  Nature of  Investigation Cases Taken Up

During  2014-15,  59  percent  (41  out  of   70)  of  
 
the cases taken up for investigation pertained to market 
manipulations and price rigging compared to 62 percent 
(67 out of  108) cases in 2013-14. Insider trading and 
takeover  violation  cases  accounted  for  14  percent  (10 
cases)  and  4  percent  (three  cases)  respectively.  ‘Issue’ 

related  manipulation  and  other  violations  of   securities 
laws accounted for 4 percent (three cases) and 19 percent 
(13 cases) respectively(Table 3.40 and Chart 3.7). 

Since,  several 

investigation  cases 

 
involved 
multiple  allegations  of   violations,  a  water-tight 
classification  under  a  specific  category  becomes 
difficult. Therefore, cases were classified on the basis of  
main charge/violations.

Regulatory Action Taken

 
After completing the investigation, penal action 
is  initiated  as  approved  by  the  competent  authority 
wherever violations of  laws and obligations relating to 
securities markets are observed. Action is decided based 
on the principles of  objectivity, consistency, materiality 
and  quality  of   evidence  available  after  a  thorough 

analysis and appreciation of  facts. The actions include 
issuing warning letters, initiating enquiry proceedings 
for  registered  intermediaries,  initiating  adjudication 
proceedings  for  levy  of   monetary  penalties,  passing 
directions under Section 11 of  the SEBI Act, 1992, and 
initiating prosecution and referring the matter to other 
regulatory agencies (Table 3.41).

ENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS

 
Effective enforcement lies at the heart of  ensuring 
integrity,  transparency  and  fairness  in  the  market. 
It  not  only  leads  to  a  better  compliance  culture,  but 
also  underscores  the  point  that  market  misconduct 
and  abuse  will  not  go  unpunished.  A  credible 
enforcement  strategy  underpins

of   consistent,  timely  and  transparent  regulatory 
outcomes,  which  are  proportionate,  dissuasive  and 
effective. Under the SEBI Act, 1992, SCRA, 1956 and 
the Depositories Act, 1996, SEBI broadly pursues two 
streams of  enforcement actions: administrative/civil or 
criminal.  Administrative/civil  actions  include  issuing 
directions  such  as  remedial  orders,  cease  and  desist 

orders,  suspension  or  cancellation  of   certificates  of  
registration and imposition of  monetary penalty under 
the  respective  statutes.  Proceedings  of   a  criminal

Box 3.5: Reinventing Enforcement Processes

 
Effective  enforcement  lies  at  the  heart  of   ensuring  market  integrity,  transparency  and  fairness.  It  not  only  leads 
to  better  compliance  culture,  but  also  underscores  the  point  that  market  misconduct  and  abuse  will  not  go  unpunished.  A 
credible enforcement strategy underpins the importance of  consistent, timely and transparent regulatory outcomes, which are 
proportionate, dissuasive and effective. As a measure to improve effectiveness of  enforcement, SEBI has completely revamped its 
enforcement processes during 2014-15. 
 
This important step was taken pursuant to a recommendation made by M/s Oliver Wyman (consultant) for complete 
handing  over  of   enforcement  matters  to  the  Enforcement  Department  (EFD)  by  the  Investigation  Department  (IVD)  upon 
completion  of   investigation  and  approval  of   the  recommended  enforcement  actions.  The  same  principle  of   handover  for 
enforcement proceedings to EFD has also been extended to the enforcement matters initiated by other departments as well.
 
An internal task force set out the framework, process and roadmap for the transfer of  all enforcement matters by all 
departments concerned to EFD. The handing over process, which began in April 01, 2014, involved transfer of  11,406 files 
relating to 776 cases and involving 10,537 entities as on March 31, 2015. 
 
Under the new arrangement, the issue of  show cause notice, analysis of  responses to notices, organization of  hearing 
before  the  competent  authority  etc.  is  exclusively  handled  by  EFD  as  compared  to  the  earlier  system  which  involved  dual 
responsibility and significant overlaps between EFD and operations department. Strict timelines have also been prescribed for 
completion of  various activities within EFD to push towards fast disposal of  cases. The reorganized EFD represents a major shift 
in handling of  enforcement. The new enforcement processes have already started showing significant increase in operational 
efficiency. The new system has inter alia;
(cid:120)(cid:3)

Imparted  greater  objectivity  to  the  enforcement  processes,  as  the  department  (EFD)  taking  forward  the  enforcement 
actions is different from the one (IVD) proposing the same.
Brought about clearer ownership and accountability for enforcement actions to EFD as against lack of  clarity on ultimate 
responsibility in the previous arrangement.
Enabled  greater  focus  by  EFD  and  IVD  on  their  respective  core  areas  i.e.  enforcement  and  investigation,  without  any 
overlaps leading to qualitative improvements in their work
Facilitated creation of  a central database of  all approved enforcement actions singularly by EFD for efficient follow-up and 
monitoring of  the progress of  such actions. 
Having been fortified with statutory powers, the recovery wing in EFD has taken up an intensive drive to recover unpaid 
 
penalties and other dues. About 600 cases were taken up, out of  which full recovery has been made in 127. Further, 1,927 
attachment orders have been issued and even some defaulters have been detained or committed to civil imprisonment.

Enforcement Mechanisms

There  are  five  enforcement  mechanisms  that 
SEBI uses in case of  any violation(s) pertaining to the 

laws regulating securities markets. 

a. 

Section 11/11B Proceedings

Under  Section  11/11B/11D  of   the  SEBI  Act, 
1992,  SEBI  may 
issue  directions  or  prohibitive 
orders  such  as  debarment  from  accessing  securities 
markets  or  not  to  deal  in  securities.  While  exercising 

powers  under  Section  11,11B/11D  of   the  SEBI 
Act,  1992,  SEBI  restrains/prohibits  entities  from 
doing  certain  activities  or  directs  the  entities  to  act 
in  a  particular  manner  in  the  interest  of   investors 
and  securities  markets.  During  2014-15,  670 
actions  under  Section  11/11B  were  disposed  by 
SEBI.  In  the  same  year,  1,808  fresh  actions  under 
the  Section  11/11B  of   the  SEBI  Act,  1992  were 
initiated  by  SEBI.  The  cumulative  pending  actions 
as  on  March  31,  2015  were  2,558  (Table  3.42  and  
Chart 3.9).

Box 3.6 : Action against Illegal Money- Raising Activities 

 
(Companies  collecting  money  in  violation  of   SEBI  (Collective  Investment  Schemes)  Regulations,  1999,  SEBI  (Disclosure  and 
Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000,  SEBI  (Issue  of   Capital  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009,  SEBI  (Issue  and 
Listing  of     Debt  Securities),    Regulations,  2008  and    SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of     Non-Convertible    Redeemable  Preference  Shares), 
Regulations, 2013 read with Companies  Act, 1956 and the Companies Act, 2013)
 
The  illegal  money-raising  activities  in  past  few  years  have  been  a  major  source  of   concern.  During  2014-15,  SEBI 
promptly and vigorously pursued this matter and took punitive and preventive actions against companies found to be falling 
within its purview.
 
It  is  seen  that  because  of   such  prompt  action  by  SEBI,  there  is  huge  expectation  among  people  and  as  a  result,  SEBI 
is  receiving  complaints  against  companies/activities  not  falling  under  its  jurisdiction  but  that  warranting  action  under 
Protection of  Interest of  Depositors Act (PID) / Prize Chit and Money Circulation Banning Act (PCMCB) / IPC which comes 
under  the  domain  of   State  Governments  or  relating  to  mobilization  of   deposits  which  comes  under  the  domain  of   Reserve 
Bank  of   India  /  Ministry  of   Corporate  Affairs.  Since  overwhelming  majority  of   complaints  were  seen  to  be  falling  within 
PCMCB Act with inter-state ramifications, SEBI took up the matter with Department of  Financial Services (DFS) and Inter-
Ministerial Group (IMG- formed to identify gaps in the regulatory framework for deposit taking activities) for effective policy 
on inter-state complaints under PCMCB Act, 1978.
 
SEBI faces a slew of  difficulties while dealing with these illegal money raising schemes. The first being, the artful way 
in  which  the  perpetrators  camouflage  their  nefarious  designs  under    layers  of   sale  of   goods  or  services  to  make  the  issues 
look  like  innocent  business  activities  but  actually  raise  the  money  through  deposit/investment  instrument.  This  makes  it 
difficult  to  uncover  the  true  nature  of   their  activities  and  ascertain  the  correct  jurisdictional  regulator.  Second  being  the 
lack of  information. The activities (pooling of  money from public) of  such companies are spread in small towns and remote 
parts  of   the  country  and  there  is  limited  information  flow  from  such  areas.  Further,  the  companies  most  often  close  down 
after  collection  of   monies  and  become  traceless/  incommunicable.  Many  companies  also  do  not  file  their  annual  report/ 
financial  statements  with  Registrar  of   Companies.  Cooperation  during  enquiry  is,  of   course  non-existent,  though  it  is  not 
even expected. Yet, this shows that most of  these companies are on wrong side of  law as they employ every trick in the trade 
to avoid giving information. Third, these outfits flush with funds, go to extreme lengths in fighting legal battles. One famous 
case has still not attained finality, even after 16 years. In other cases, the companies have managed to get injunctions from 
lower courts. Even though it was without jurisdiction, it took SEBI considerable time and effort to get them vacated.
 
It  is  also  seen  that  many  companies,  subsequent  to  passing  of   directions  by  SEBI,  start  operating  as  a  Single-State/
Multi-State Co-operative Society/Producer company (co-operative business in corporate framework). In this regard, wherever 
it comes to the notice of  SEBI, suitable references are made to the State Government concerned or the Central Registrar of  
Co-operative Societies, Ministry of  Agriculture or RoC as applicable.
 
To deal with this menace, SEBI proposed reconstitution of  State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC) in FSDC-SC on 
August  07,  2013  with  the  Chief   Secretary  of   the  state  chairing  the  inter-regulator  coordination  meeting  in  state  for  more 
effective  action  upon  such  illegal  money  mobilization.  Thus  far  71  meetings  of   the  reconstituted  SLCC  have  taken  place 
across different states, state machineries have been appraised of  their prominent role in tackling this menace and taking the 
battle against these companies right to their countryside offices.
Deemed Public Issues
 
One of  the techniques that such companies have adopted is to issue equity shares, preference shares and debentures 
on ostensibly private placement basis. These are marketed to large number of  people, even crores, with a disclaimer that the 
offer is on private placement basis. Even though the Companies Act restricted such placement to 49 (now 200) persons. The 
issues are made in flagrant violation or under a fig leaf  of  repeated issues to 49 persons or more. Gullible people are taken 
in by impressive norms as ‘non convertible debenture’ or ‘cumulative redeemable preference shares’ and part their monies in 
exchange for a piece of  glossy paper, worth nothing.

The  interim  order  inter-alia  debars  the  entities  and  their  directors  from  collection  of   any  fresh  money  from  investors

returns due to the investors and also, debar them from accessing capital market for a specified time period.
 
SEBI  also  issued  caution  notes  to  investors  informing  them  not  to  subscribe  to  issues/schemes  floated  by  such 
companies against whom SEBI had taken action and also cautioning the companies not to issue securities/mobilize monies 
from the public without complying with the relevant provisions of  law.

Enquiry Proceedings

SEBI  may  suspend  or  cancel  the  certificate  of  
registration  of   an  intermediary  through  enquiry 
regulations  on  the  recommendation  of   the  enquiry 
officer/designated  authority  appointed 
that 
purpose. It may also issue a warning to an intermediary 
if   it  considers  that  the  violations  committed  by 
the 
intermediary  do  not  warrant  suspension  or 
cancellation of  registration.

for 

During  2014-15,  11  actions  were  disposed  by 
 
SEBI after the due completion of  enquiry proceedings. 
Further, 23 fresh actions were initiated where enquiry 
proceedings  are  being 
followed.  The  cumulative 
pending actions as on March 31, 2015 stood at 125.

Box 3.7: Fortifying Enforcement

As we preserve healthy markets, it is also crucial to promote fair practices that align with the best in class through stronger 
enforcement measures and in harmony with technological developments worldwide. Over the years, SEBI has built its reputation 
as a credible enforcement agency. Enforcement actions taken by SEBI are designed to be appropriate in a holistic sense. SEBI 
has used warnings and letters of  deficiency to address findings from inspection reports which are trivial. In other cases severe 
measures  such  as  suspension  or  cancellation  of   registration,  prohibitory  orders,  disgorgement,  criminal  prosecution  and 
adjudication for imposition of  monetary penalty have also been resorted to.

At the same time, SEBI has provided a mechanism for settlement of  administrative and civil proceedings except in cases 
of  certain serious violations like insider trading. The settlement mechanism refers to the settlement of  securities laws violations 
as  per  the  SEBI  (Settlement  of   Administrative  and  Civil  Proceedings)  Regulations,  2014  without  the  individual  or  company 
involved admitting or denying guilt. As per these regulations, settlements of  violations are arrived at by issuing a settlement 
order on conclusion of  the settlement process. The alleged party gets absolved of  the charges by paying a settlement amount 
and/or non-monetary terms as per the settlement order. Further, in order to avoid delay in concluding enforcement proceedings, 
augmenting administrative efficiency and for optimizing resources, SEBI has enabled submission of  settlement applications even 
prior to receipt of  detailed show cause notices in certain securities laws violations.

 In order to make securities markets safe and a level playing field and to align them with the best practices globally, SEBI 
reviewed the insider trading regulatory regime. On the basis of  the recommendation of  the high level committee appointed in this 
regard, the new regulations on prohibition of  insider trading were notified on January 15, 2015.

Further, the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, inter-alia, conferred powers on SEBI to call for information from 
any person in relation to matters under investigation or enquiry, powers of  attachment and recovery. The Amendment Act also 
enabled establishing special courts for speedy trial of  offences relating to securities laws.

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

With  these  special  powers  and  improved  human  and  technological  capabilities,  SEBI  aims  to  further  streamline  the 
enforcement process by focusing on increasing the efficiency of  enforcement proceedings across the organisation. During 2014-
15, there was a significant increase both in the number of  orders and penalty amounts. SEBI issued a large number of  orders in 
cases of  deemed public issues and illicit fund-raising activities. The total penalty imposed by SEBI in adjudication proceedings for 
the violations of  SEBI (Prohibition of  Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, went up by 84.3 percent to ` 37.6 crore in 2014-15 
as compared to ` 20.4 crore in 2013-14 and by 1943.5 percent compared to ` 1.84 crore in 2012-13. For violations under SEBI 
(PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 the total penalty imposed increased by 79.5 percent to ` 241.7 crore in 2014-15 compared to ` 
134.65 crore in 2013-14 and by 504.6 percent compared to ` 39.98 crore in 2012-13.

Armed with increased powers under Section 28A of  the SEBI Act, the regulator is empowered to recover money from persons 
who fail to pay the penalty imposed by the AO or fail to comply with any direction of  SEBI for refund of  money or fail to comply with 
a direction of  disgorgement order or fail to pay any fees due to SEBI. A recovery and attachment cell has been created in SEBI for 
enforcing this. As on March 31, 2015, notices for attachment were issued against 822 bank lockers, 1,087 demat accounts and 
18 other asset categories. In two cases, the defaulters were arrested and kept in detention and in one case civil imprisonment was 
awarded. Recovery was completed in 127 cases and the amount recovered as on March 31, 2015 was ` 27 crore.

SEBI constituted a special enforcement cell to handle work related to the matter of  Sahara India, against which SEBI had 
passed a final order in 2011. The case relates to optional fully convertible debentures (OFCDs) that the two unlisted companies 
issued  in  2008,  collecting  around  `  25,000  crore  from  30  million  investors. The  other  major  enforcement  action  taken  by 
SEBI was in the matters of  M/s DLF Ltd. and M/s Satyam Computer Services Ltd. While the DLF case was for alleged active and 
deliberate suppression of  material information so as to mislead and defraud investors in securities markets in connection with 
DLF’s IPO, the latter case was a sophisticated white collar financial fraud with a premeditated and well thought out plan and 
deliberate design for personal gains and to the detriment of  the company and investors in its securities.

Effective enforcement lies at the heart of  ensuring integrity, transparency and fairness in the market. It not only leads to a 
better compliance culture, but also underscores the point that market misconduct and abuse will not go unpunished. To sum up, 
the way forward for securities markets is in creating an atmosphere of  trust in the market, confidence in investors and efficiency 
in  the  system.  SEBI  continues  its  endeavours  towards  stricter  and  prompter  enforcement,  spreading  financial  education  and 
upgrading technology to meet these objectives. 

Important  Adjudication  Orders  passed 

B. 
during 2014-15

A.  Order  in  the  matter  of   Initial  Public  Offer 
of  M/s Credit Analysis and Research Ltd. (CARE) 
against  six  Book  Running  Lead  Managers 
(BRLMs)

 
In  the  matter  of   Initial  Public  Offer  of   M/s 
Credit  Analysis  and  Research  Ltd.  (CARE),  the  book 
running lead managers (BRLMs) M/s Kotak Mahindra 
Capital  Company  Ltd.,  M/s  DSP  Merrill  Lynch  Ltd., 
M/s Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd., ICICI Securities 
Ltd., M/s IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. and M/s SBI 
Capital Market Services Ltd. had filed the Red Herring 
Prospectus (RHP) of  CARE with SEBI on November 27, 
2012  for  an  initial  public  offer  of   7,199,700  equity 
shares  of   a  face  value  of   `  10  each  of   the  company 
through an offer for sale (the Offer). The Offer opened 
for  subscription  to  public  on  December  7,  2012  and 
closed on December 11, 2012.

 
SEBI  observed  that  CARE  had  received  a  letter 
dated September 26, 2012 from the Reserve Bank of  
India (RBI), in response to CARE’s letter dated August 
31,  2012  agreeing  to  exempt  non-resident  investors 
participating in the offer for sale from the requirement 

of  obtaining a no objection certificate (NoC) from their 
respective regulators in relation to their participation 
in the Offer, subject to certain conditions. One of  the 
conditions  stipulated  by  RBI  while  exempting  non-
resident  investors  participating  in  the  Offer  from 
obtaining  NoCs  from  respective  regulators  was  that 
minimum  capitalisation  norms  applicable  to  non-
banking  financial  companies  (NBFCs)  were  strictly 
adhered  to  by  CARE.  SEBI  observed  that  inadequate 
disclosures  were  made  in  CARE’s  RHP  with  respect 
to the conditional exemption granted by RBI vide the 
aforementioned letter. Hence, adjudication proceedings 
were initiated against the six BRLMs. 

The  adjudicating  officer  vide  order  dated 
 
November  28,  2014  imposed  the  maximum  penalty 
prescribed  under  Section  15  HB  of   the  SEBI  Act:  ` 
1crore on the BRLMs/noticees viz. M/s Kotak Mahindra 
Capital Company Ltd., M/s DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd., M/s 
Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd., M/s ICICI Securities 
Ltd.,  M/s  IDBI  Capital  Market  Services  Ltd.  and  M/s 
SBI Capital Market Services Ltd. (to be paid jointly and 
severally)  for  the  violation  of   Clause  1  of   Form  C  of  
Schedule VI of  Regulation 8(2)(b), Regulation 57 (1), 
Regulation 57(2)(a)(ii) and Regulation 64(1) of  ICDR 
Regulations and Regulation 13 of  Merchant Bankers

B.  Orders  in  the  matter  of   M/s  Alderbrooke 
Portfolio Management Services Pvt. Ltd.

for 

 
SEBI on receipt of  a complaint came to know that 
a  company,  M/s  Alderbrooke  Portfolio  Management 
Services  Pvt.  Ltd.  (APMS)  was  offering  financial 
products/services 
individual/corporate  clients 
with guaranteed returns. A preliminary examination 
of   the  matter  revealed  that  APMS  was  not  registered 
with SEBI in any capacity. APMS was a private limited 
company incorporated on March 3, 2010 and investors 
interested in availing the services of  APMS were made 
to enter into a MoU with APMS, enabling it to manage 
their funds. Trading activities were carried out either 
through the trading account of  APMS or through the 
individual  account  of   the  client.  Having  prima  facie 
found that APMS was collecting funds and indulging 
in  unauthorised  portfolio  management  activities  by 
entering into an agreement/MoU with the clients and 
managing  their  portfolios/funds  without  obtaining 
registration  from  SEBI,  SEBI  issued  an  ad  interim  ex-
parte order dated December 20, 2013 (interim order) 
against  APMS  and  its  directors  Mr.  Jalpesh  Kumar 
Amrutlal  Makwana  (Jalpesh  Kumar)  and  Mr.  Anand 
Kumar Kanubhai Ravat (Anand Kumar). Subsequent 
to the interim order and submissions by APMS, Jalpesh 
Kumar and Anand Kumar SEBI issued an order dated 
April  1,  2014  (final  order)  in  which  APMS,  Jalpesh 
Kumar  and  Anand  Kumar  were  directed  to  cease 
and  desist  from  acting  as  an  unregistered  portfolio 
manager and not to solicit or undertake such activity 
or any other activities in the securities markets, directly 
or  indirectly,  in  any  manner  whatsoever  without 
proper  authorisation/registration.  In  the  said  final 
order, APMS, Jalpesh Kumar and Anand Kumar were 
restrained  from  accessing  the  securities  markets  and 
further prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in the 
securities markets, either directly or indirectly or being 
associated with the securities markets in any manner 
whatsoever  for  a  period  of   five  years.  In  view  of   the 
seriousness of  the violations, adjudication proceedings 
were  also  initiated.  The  adjudicating  officer  held 

that  APMS  was  carrying  out  its  activity  of   portfolio 
management  services  without  obtaining  registration 
from SEBI. Therefore, APMS was held to have violated 
provisions  of   Section  12(1)  of   the  SEBI  Act,  1992 
read  with  Regulation  3  of   SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers) 
Regulations,  1993.  Vide  three  separate  orders  dated 
September 24, 2014; a penalty of  ` one crore each was 
imposed on APMS, Anand Kumar and Jalpesh Kumar.

C.  Adjudication  Order  in  respect  of   M/s 
Reliance Industries Ltd.(RIL)

 
Pursuant to the special resolution passed by the 
members  of   RIL  on  12  April,  2007,  RIL’s  board  of  
directors allotted 12 crore warrants on a preferential 
basis  exercisable  into  an  equal  number  of   equity 
shares  of   `  10  each  of   RIL  to  the  entities  belonging 
to the promoter group of  RIL. The said warrants were 
exercisable  at  any  time  during  18  months  from  the 
date of  issue (12th April 2007) at an exercise price of  
`1,402 per share (exercise price).On 3 October, 2008, 
RIL’s board of  directors allotted 12 crore equity shares 
of  ` 10 each to the allottees, upon exercise of  warrants 
at the exercise price.

 
RIL  in  its  quarterly  financial  results  for  the 
quarters  ended  June  2007  to  September  2008 
disclosed the basic earnings per share (EPS) and diluted 
earnings  per  share  (DEPS)  which  were  allegedly  in 
violation  of   Section  23  A  (a)  Section  23  E  of   SCRA, 
1956, hence adjudication proceedings were initiated. 
The  adjudicating  officer  after  due  compliance  of  
the  procedure  found  that  RIL  should  have  disclosed 
separate  figures  for  basic  and  DEPS  in  the  quarterly 
financial  statements  for  the  aforesaid  period  and 
imposed a monetary penalty of  ` 13 crore. 

D.  Adjudication  Order  against  M/s  Varun 
Shipping  Company  Ltd.  for  non-redressal  of  
investor grievances.

 
M/s  Varun  Shipping  Company  Ltd.  (VSCL) 
had  not  redressed  34  investor  grievances  pending 
on  SCORES,  out  of   which  one  investor  grievance 
was  pending  against  it  for  more  than  two  years. The 
complaints were regarding non-payment of  dividends 
by the company. During the adjudicating proceedings, 
VSCL  undertook  to  resolve  the  pending  complaints 

140

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

regarding  the  non-receipt  of   dividend.  Thereafter, 
VSCL deposited ` 4,66,58,106 in the dividend account 
for payment of  dividend to non-promoter shareholders 
of  the company to resolve the 32 investor grievances. 
VSCL  also  sent  letters  to  the  complainants  of   two 
complaints  in  response  to  their  complaints  seeking 
clarifications.

 
It was concluded by the adjudicating officer that 
VSCL had delayed taking steps to resolve the investor 
grievances  and  therefore  had  failed  to  redress  their 
grievances within the stipulated time. The adjudicating 
officer passed an order on March 25, 2013 and levied 
a penalty of  ` 5 lakh on VSCL for violation of  Section 
15C of  the SEBI Act, 1992. 

E.  Adjudication  Order  in  the  matter  of   M/s 
RDB  Rasayans  Ltd.  against  Mr.  Mohib  Noman 
Khericha and Mr. Manoj Kumar Ramrakhyani

 
SEBI  conducted  an  investigation  of   the  IPO  of  
M/s  RDB  Rasayans  Ltd.  (RDB)  and  its  subsequent 
trading on and around the listing days as the RDB scrip 
witnessed wide fluctuations in price at BSE. 

 
It was observed that RDB had failed to disclose in 
the  prospectus  the  proposal  and  approval  for  passing 
on the IPO proceeds in the form of  an inter-corporate 
loan to a group company. Further, RDB had not only 
violated  the  statements  made  in  the  prospectus  but 
also mis-utilised the IPO proceeds by giving away the 
entire IPO proceeds as a loan to a group company. It 
was also alleged that a part of  the IPO proceeds were 
routed in a circuitous manner by RDB to four trading 
clients  in  order  to  enable  them  to  make  payments  to 
their  stock  brokers  on  time.  Moreover  it  was  alleged 
that Mr. Sandeep Baid being the whole time director for 
RDB chaired the audit committee meeting.

 
The  adjudicating  officer  passed  an  order  dated 
August 6, 2014 imposing a penalty of  `3.05 crore on 
five  entities/persons  for  violations  of   the  provisions 
of  Regulations 57 (1) and (2) (a) read with Schedule 
VIII Part A (16) (b) and Regulation 60 (4) (a) of  ICDR 
Regulations, 2009 and Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of  
the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), 
(d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a), (d) and (e) of  PFUTP Regulations, 
2003 and Section 23H of  SCRA, 1956.

Adjudication  Order  against  M/s  Apollo 
F. 
Tyres Ltd. (ATL) in the matter of  buyback shares 
of  M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. (ATL)

 
SEBI received complaints wherein it was alleged 
that shares of  M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. (ATL) were bought 
back  by  ATL  and  its  promoters  in  contravention  of  
Section  77A  of   the  Companies  Act,  1956  and  SEBI 
(Buyback of  Securities) Regulations, 1998.

 ATL was supposed to take out a public advertisement 
regarding buyback of  shares before May 11, 2003 but 
the public notice was issued on May 13, 2003, hence 
ATL failed to comply with Regulation 19 (7) of  the SEBI 
Buyback Regulations. It was further observed that in 
the  said  public  notice,  ATL  had  failed  to  disclose  the 
pre- and post-shareholding pattern as specified under 
Regulation 19 (7) (v) of  the SEBI Buyback Regulations. 
Hence the noticee has failed to comply with Regulation 
19 (7) (v) of  the SEBI Buyback Regulations. 

 
The  adjudicating  officer  passed  an  order  dated 
July 9, 2014 imposing total penalty of  `1.03 crore on 
ATL in terms of  the provisions of  Section 15HB of  the 
SEBI Act, 1992.

G.  Order against Mr. Sendhaji J Thakor in the 
matter of  M/s SEL Manufacturing Co. Ltd.

SEBI  conducted  an  investigation  into  the  alleged 
 
irregularity  in  the  trading  of   the  shares  of   M/s  SEL 
Manufacturing  Co.  Ltd.  The  investigating  authority 
(IA)  served  summonses  on  the  entity  to  appear  before 
him  and  submit  books  of   accounts/documents/reports/
information/records. However, the entity neither appeared 
before  the  IA  nor  provided  documents/information/
records  as  sought  during  the  investigation  within  the 
stipulated  timeline,  hence  it  had  failed  to  comply  with 
the  same. The  said  non-appearance  before  IA  and  non-
furnishing  of   the  information/documents  resulted  in 
violation of  the provisions of  Section 11C(3) and Section 
11C(5) of  the SEBI Act,1992. Adjudication proceedings 
were initiated. The entity neither replied to the SCN nor 
attended  any  of   the  personal  hearings  granted  by  the 
adjudicating officer inspite of  service of  the notices.

  The  adjudicating  officer  passed  an  order  dated 
March 25, 2015 under Section 15A(a) of  SEBI Act, 1992 
imposing a penalty of  ` 50 lakhon the entity for violation 
of   Section  11C  (3)  and  also  a  penalty  of   `  50lakh  for 
violation of  Section 11C (5) of  the SEBI Act, 1992.

after making or causing to be made such inquiry as it deems necessary, pass an order enhancing the quantum of  penalty, if  the 
circumstances of  the case so justify.’
 
In the matter of  Bharatiya Global Infomedia Ltd.’s IPO, adjudication proceedings were initiated inter-alia against Crosseas 
Capital Services P. Ltd., Adroit Financial Services Ltd. and AKG Securities and Consultancy Ltd. for executing self-trades. The 
adjudicating officer vide orders dated April 30, 2014 disposed of  the proceedings without any monetary penalty.

SEBI  vs.  M/s  Timberworld  Resorts  & 
Plantations  India  Ltd.  &  Ors.  -  Before  Ld. 
Additional  Sessions  Judge,  Tis  Hazari  Courts, 
Delhi 

 
A  complaint  was  lodged  for  violation  of   the 
provisions  of   Section  12  (1B)  of   the  SEBI  Act  and 
Regulations  5  (1),  68(1),  68(2),  73  and  74  of   SEBI 
(CIS)  Regulations  wherein  it  was  alleged  that  M/s 
Timberworld Resorts & Plantations India Ltd. (accused 
company)  had  floated  collective  investment  schemes 
(CIS) and raised an amount of  approximately ` 22 crore 
from the general public in violation of  the provisions of  
the SEBI Act and SEBI (CIS) Regulations.

 
The  accused  raised  a  common  contention  that 
the  present  criminal  complaint  was  bad  due  to  lack 
of   jurisdiction  because  as  per  the  Securities  Law 
(Amendment)  Ordinance  2013,  all  the  offences  were 
exclusively  triable  by  the  special  court  and  where  the 
special  court  had  not  been  constituted,  the  offences 
shall be triable by the court of  sessions. It was contended 
that since all evidence was recorded by the court of  the 
learned ACMM, the proceedings conducted by learned 
ACMM  were  void  ab-initio.  It  was  contended  that  the 
matter required a fresh trial.

 
The court held that from perusal of  Section 26B of  
the SEBI Act which was inserted by way of  Amendment 
Act  27  of   2014,  it  became  clear  that  all  the  offences 
whether committed prior to the commencement of  the 
Amendment Act or after the date of  its commencement, 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

143

shall  be  triable  by  the  special  court,  that  is  court  of  
sessions. Thus, by virtue of  Section 26B of  the SEBI Act, 
all SEBI cases whether instituted prior to the enactment 
of  Amendment Act 27 of  2014 or thereafter become 
triable by the court of  sessions. Accordingly, this case 
was transferred to this court.

 
Mr. Sanjeev Sood, Accused No.3 admitted that he 
was one of  the directors of  accused company but took 
the  plea  that  he  had  resigned  from  the  directorship 
in February 1995 and denied all other incriminating 
evidence led by SEBI. 

 
The Hon’ble court held that the resignation letter 
was  on  non-judicial  stamp  paper  and  bore  the  date 
February  24,  1995  below  the  signature  of   accused 
Mr.  Sanjeev  Sood.  This  meant  that  he  had  tendered 
his  resignation  on  February  24,  1995  whereas  the 
counsel had contended that accused No.3 ceased to be 
a director w.e.f. March 24, 1995. At the left side of  the 
said letter, the word ‘accepted’ and below the said word 
‘accepted’, ‘R. Sud’ were written. But this resignation 
letter nowhere bore the seal of  the company accused or 
the designation seal of  Rajesh Sud (Managing Director). 
Even the date of  acceptance of  said resignation letter 
was  not  mentioned.  Perusal  of   the  resignation  letter 
further revealed that the same was not even addressed 
to anyone; rather it was in the form of  a declaration. 
From  the  resignation  letter  it  became  clear  that  it 
neither bore the seal of  the accused company nor the 
seal of  the MD of  the company. It even did not have the 
date when it was accepted. Nor was it addressed either 
to the company or to the MD of  the company or to the 
board  of   directors.  As  already  stated  that  a  director 

can  be  removed  only  by  way  of   passing  an  ordinary 
resolution  but  during  the  trial  no  such  evidence  was 
produced before the court that any such resolution was 
ever passed. 

 
In  these  circumstances,  the  Hon’ble  court  was 
of   opinion  that  no  reliance  could  be  placed  on  the 
resignation letter. In other words, accused No. 3 failed 
to establish that he had ceased to be a director. 

In view of  the aforesaid discussion, the Hon’ble 
court  sentenced  accused  No.  2  Ashwani  Sud  and 
accused No.3 Sanjeev Sood to rigorous imprisonment 
for  a  period  of   one  year  and  a  fine  of   `  5  crore  each 
in default further three months simple imprisonment 
for the offence punishable under Section 24(1) of  SEBI 
Act. A fine of  ` 15 crore was imposed on accused No.1 
M/s Timber World Resort & Plantation (I) Ltd.

SIGNIFICANT COURT PRONOUNCEMENTS

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA 

SEBI vs. Akshya Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.

 
The  issue  of   law  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  was  whether  ‘an  open  offer  voluntarily  made 
through  a  public  announcement  for  purchase  of  
shares  of   the  target  company  can  be  permitted  to  be 
withdrawn  at  a  time  when  the  voluntary  open  offer 
has  become  uneconomical  to  be  performed,’  which  it 
answered in the negative.

 
M/s  Akshya  Infrastructure  Pvt.  Ltd.,  which 
is  part  of   the  promoter  group  of   M/s  MARG  Ltd. 
(the  target  company),  made  certain  acquisitions  of  
further shares in the target between 2006 and 2011 
that  caused  it  to  breach  the  creeping  acquisition 
limits  under  the  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  1997  (the 
Takeover  Regulations).  Subsequently,  on  October  20, 
2011  Akshya  made  a  voluntary  open  offer  under 
Regulation  11  of   the Takeover  Regulations  at  a  price 
of   `  91  per  share,  which  represented  a  10  percent 
premium over the prescribed floor price. Upon making 

146

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

the public announcement, Akshya filed the draft public 
offer document with SEBI for its comments. There was 
an  exchange  of   correspondence  between  SEBI  and 
Akshya that primarily related to Akshya’s prior trigger 
of  the mandatory offer requirements due to its breach 
of  the creeping acquisition limits. Due to this, there had 
been a delay of  13 months in SEBI’s clearance of  the 
offer documents. After SEBI conveyed its comments on 
November 30, 2012, Akshya challenged them before 
SAT, including on the ground that the delay in SEBI’s 
response  rendered  the  offer  unviable  and  academic. 
By its order, SAT allowed Akshya’s appeal and allowed 
it to withdraw the open offer and the escrow amount 
deposited in support thereof.

On appeal by SEBI, the Supreme Court reversed 
 
SAT’s order and disallowed Akshya from withdrawing 
its  open  offer,  thereby  once  again  upholding  the 
sanctity  of   an  open  offer  made  under  the  Takeover 
Regulations. The Supreme Court relied extensively on 
the  ruling  in  M/s  Nirma  Industries  to  interpret  Reg. 
27 again limiting the circumstances in which an open 
offer, once made, can be withdrawn.

ii.  M/s Discovery Wealth Management Services 
Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. vs. M/s Padmini Engineering Pvt. 
Ltd. & Ors 

 
M/s  Hella  India,  a  public  limited  company  had 
shares  listed  at  BSE  and  the  Delhi  Stock  Exchange 
(DSE) pursuant to a Listing Agreement dated October 
17,1986. The promoter of  Hella India held 51 percent 
of  its share capital. In July 2005, Hella India decided to 
have its shares delisted from both the stock exchanges 
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  contained  in  the 
SEBI  (Delisting  of   Securities)  Guidelines,  2003  (the 
guidelines).  In  January,  2006,  a  voluntary  offer  was 
made  to  public  shareholders  to  acquire  their  shares 
as per the guidelines. The offer was made by a public 
announcement through M/sPadmini Engineering Pvt. 
Ltd.(respondent No. 1), which is an affiliated entity of  
the promoter of  Hella India.

 
The promoter of  Hella India determined the floor 
price of  ` 52.39 per share, which later turned out to be 
the exit price for delisting of  securities in accordance 
with  the  book  building  process  prescribed  by  the 
guidelines.  Pursuant  to  the  exercise,  the  quantity  of  
shares accepted by the said respondent together with 
the  holding  of   the  promoters  came  to  81.37  percent 

of   the  total  equity  share  capital  of   Hella  India,  as  a 
consequence of  which, the level of  public shareholding 
in Hella India was brought down to 18.63 percent.

 
After accepting the shares at the price aforesaid, 
respondent  No.  1  through  merchant  banker  UTI 
Securities approached the BSE by a letter dated February 
15, 2006 for completing the settlement of  transactions 
and permission was sought to release advertisements 
regarding  the  final  price  as  discovered  by  the  reverse 
book  building  process.  BSE  declined  to  proceed  with 
the  merchant  banker  by  a  communication  dated 
February  15,  2006.  Vide  the  said  communication,  it 
was informed that the threshold limit for delisting on 
the exchange would be triggered only if  the acquirers’ 
holdings  together  with  promoters’  holdings  exceeded 
90 percent .

 
Being aggrieved by the aforesaid communication, 
respondent  No.  1  preferred  the  appeal  before  SAT. 
SAT  referred  to  Section  30  of   the  SCRA,  1956,  Rule 
19 (2) (b) of  the SCRR, 1957, which was substituted 
w.e.f.  June  7,  2001.  While  allowing  the  appeal,  SAT 
proceeded on the presumption that there was no clause 
w.r.t.  maintaining  of   minimum  continuous  public 
shareholding in the Listing Agreement. 

Being  aggrieved  by  the  SAT  order  an  appeal 
 
was  preferred  by  the  appellant,  who  was  one  of   the 
shareholder  though  it  was  not  before  SAT  preferred 
appeal  before  Supreme  Court.  The  issue  before  the 
Supreme Court was whether the company, Hella India, 
was required to maintain a 10 percent benchmark for 
public  shareholding  to  remain  a  listed  company. The 
Supreme  Court  while  dismissing  the  appeal  inter-alia 
held as follows:

(cid:122) 

Clause  8.8  of   the  2003  Guidelines  stipulates 
that  required  level  of   public  shareholding  must 
fall below the level of  continuous listing. Clause 
12.1 of  the 2003 Guidelines states that the offer 
of  delisting would fail if  the public shareholding 
does not fall below the minimum limit specified by 
the listing conditions or the Listing Agreement. 
It  is  quite  clear  that  the  2003  Guidelines  do 
not  prescribe  or  fix  the  required  level  of   public 
shareholding  of   continuous  listing  though  the 
said limit must be breached for an offer of  delisting 
to succeed. It is condign to note that Clause 12.1 
refers  to  the  minimum  limit  specified  by  the 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Listing condition or the Listing Agreement. Since 
the  amended  rule  19(2)  (b)  read  with  Listing 
Agreement require a listed company to maintain 
minimum  public  shareholding  at  the  level  of  
public shareholding required at the time of  initial 
listing which is 25 percent in the matter. Hence, 
it would not be proper to hold that company M/s 
Hella India was required to maintain 10 percent 
benchmark to remain listed.

(cid:122)(cid:3) The  opening  words  of   sub-rule  (2)  of   Rule  19 
gives primacy to the terms and conditions as may 
be  laid  down  by  the  recognised  stock  exchange 
and  the  company  in  question  must  satisfy  the 
condition imposed by the stock exchange in that 
regard.

ii.  BSE vs. Kandalgaonkar & Ors.

 
The  matter  was  filed  against  the  order  dated 
March  27,  2003  passed  by  Hon’ble  High  Court  of  
Bombay (the High Court). The matter arose as a result 
of   a  member  of   a  stock  exchange  being  declared  a 
defaulter.  The  income  tax  department  claimed  that 
it  had  priority  over  all  debts  owed  by  the  defaulter 
member, whereas the stock exchange, Bombay claimed 
otherwise.

The  High  Court  held  that  the  assets  deposited 
 
(securities  and  cash)  by  the  member  at  the  time  of  
granting membership were attachable and recoverable 
under  provisions  of   Section  226(3)(i)(x)  read  with 
Rule 26(1)(a)(c) of  Schedule II to the Income Tax Act. 
Government  dues  had  priority  over  the  exchange’s 
dues  as  per  Section  73(3)  of   Civil  Procedure  Code. 
The High Court further held that a defaulting member 
had no interest in a membership card and that the IT 
department was not right in attaching the sale proceeds 
of  such card, still money which was likely to come in 
the  hands  of   the  garnishee,  that  is,  the  exchange  for 
and  on  behalf   of   the  assesse  was  attachable  because 
the  requisite  condition  was  the  subsistence  of   an 
ascertained debt in the hands of  the garnishee which 
was due to the assesse. 

 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court allowed the appeal. 
The important findings of  the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
are:

(cid:122)(cid:3) The  proceeds  of   the  broker  membership  card, 
which  has  been  auctioned  cannot  be  paid  to 
the  income  tax  department  for  the  dues  of   the 

148

member as such member at no point owns any 
property capable of  attachments.

(cid:122)(cid:3) The  exchange  is  a  secured  creditor  and  has 

precedence over the income tax department. 

(cid:122) 

(cid:122) 

The rules made by stock exchanges in exercise of  
power conferred by SCRA,1956 are equally rules 
and  therefore  subordinate  legislation.  The  lien 
spoken of  by Rule 43 is a lien, conferred by rules 
under a statue.

Rules made under Section 7-A, 8 or 30 of  SCRA 
are statutory in nature.

(cid:122)(cid:3) The  Income  Tax  Act  does  not  provide  for  any 

paramountcy of  dues by way of  income tax. 

(cid:122) 

The  stock  exchange  being  a  secured  creditor, 
would have priority over government dues. 

iv.  M/s  Alchemist  Infra  Reality  Ltd.  &  Anrvs. 
SEBI;  M/s  Alchemist  Infra  Reality  Ltd.&  Anrvs. 
SEBI; and Mr. P. Nanda Kumar vs. SEBI

 
SEBI passed an order dated June 21, 2013 inter-
alia  restraining  M/s  Alchemist  Infra  Reality  Ltd.  (the 
company)  from  collecting  money  from  investors  or 
launching or carrying on any scheme which had been 
identified as a collective investment scheme in the said 
order. The said order also directed the company and its 
directors to wind up the collective investment schemes 
and  refund  the  money  collected  under  the  schemes 
with  the  returns  due  to  its  investors  within  a  period 
of   three  months  from  the  date  of   the  said  order. The 
company applied for consent, which was returned. The 
rejection  of   consent  application  was  also  challenged 
before the Hon’ble SAT by the company along with the 
order dated June 21, 2013. The Hon’ble SAT disposed 
of   both  the  appeals  and  upheld  the  finding  of   SEBI. 
However, a timeframe of  18 months was given to the 
company  to  wind  up  its  schemes  and  file  half   yearly 
reports to SEBI. 

 
The order of  the Hon’ble SAT has been challenged 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of  India by way of  
captioned appeals. However, the appeals were dismissed 
as withdrawn vide order dated September 5, 2014. 

v.  M/s I.P. Holding Asia Singapore Pvt. Ltd. & 
Anr.vs. SEBI 

 
The  matter  was  filed  assailing  the  order  dated 
September  12,  2014  of   the  Hon’ble  SAT.  SEBI  had 
directed the appellants who were the acquirers of  M/s 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

Andhra  Pradesh  Paper  Mills  Ltd.,  to  revise  the  offer 
price by adding `  130.73, paid as non-compete fees to 
the sellers in excess of  the price which is to be paid to 
all public shareholders. The said letter was challenged 
before the Hon’ble SAT. However, the said appeal was 
dismissed  by  the  Hon’ble  SAT.  Aggrieved  by  this,  the 
appeal  was  filed  under  Section  15  Z  of   the  SEBI  Act, 
1992. 

 
The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  while  allowing  the 
appeal vide its order dated August 20, 2014 observed 
the following: 

(cid:122) 

(cid:122) 

Jurisdiction  of   SAT  is  triggered  only  when  the 
non-compete fee is in excess of  25 percent of  the 
offer price. 

consideration  paid 

Ordinarily  when  there  is  a  gap  of   25  percent 
between 
to  outgoing 
promoters and non-compete fee, SEBI ought not 
to conduct any inquiry. However, if  it appears to 
SEBI  that  the  difference  between  the  offer  price 
and the non-compete fee is less than 25 percent 
but that is nevertheless a disguise or a camouflage 
for  reducing  the  cost  of   acquisition  through  a 
public offer, then SEBI can certainly delve further 
into the matter.

(cid:122)(cid:3) If  the non-compete fee is less than 25 percent of  
the offer price, the jurisdiction of  SEBI would be 
exercisable  only  in  an  extremely  rare  case  and 
only if  SEBI was in a position to ex-facie conclude 
that the transaction involving the takeover of  the 
target company was not bona fide.

(cid:122)(cid:3) The  threat  perception  of   giving  competition  in 
future  cannot  be  decided  on  the  basis  of   SEBI’s 
hindsight  (unless  the  perception  is  found  to  be 
perverse)  but  must  be  left  to  the  commercial 
wisdom of  the players on the field.

vi.  M/s React Investment & Financial Pvt. Ltd. 
vs. SEBI; M/s Seed Securities & Services Pvt. Ltd. 
vs. SEBI; M/s Epitome Holdings Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI; 
Liquid Holdings Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI; Scope Credit & 
Financial vs. SEBI

 
The  appellant  companies  were  promoter/
promoter group of  M/s Blue Coast Hotels and Resorts 
Ltd.  (the  company).  Shares  of   the  company  were 
pledged  by  the  appellant  companies  with  two  banks. 
The  bank  invoked  the  pledge  and  the  shares  kept  as 

collateral  for  the  loan  were  transferred  to  the  banks’ 
demat  account.  Pursuant  thereto,  the  companies 
entered  into  communication  with  the  banks  and  as 
result of  a settlement, the shares of  the company were 
transferred  back  by  the  banks  to  the  demat  account 
of  the appellants , resulting in triggering provision of  
SEBI (SAST) Regulations 1999 (Takeover Code). 

Accordingly,  adjudication  proceedings  were 
initiated.  After  compliance  of   the  due  procedure,  the 
adjudicating  officer  (AO)  imposed  a  penalty  of   `  3 
lakh each on the appellants for violation of  provisions 
of  the Takeover Code. The Hon’ble SAT dismissed the 
appeal  filed  challenging  the  order  passed  by  the  AO. 
The  appellants  preferred  appeals  before  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of  India against the order dated March 
11, 2013 passed by the Hon’ble SAT, which came to be 
dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of  India vide 
order dated September 10, 2014 observing that there 
were no merits in the appeal. Hence, the order passed 
by the AO was upheld and attained finality. 

vii.  M/s  Rose  Valley  Hotels  and  Entertainment 
Ltd. 

 
SEBI  issued  an  interim  order  cum  show  cause 
notice  dated  July  10,  2013,  against  the  company  for 
prima facie violation of  the SEBI Act and the SEBI (CIS) 
Regulations, 1999. The company challenged the said 
order before the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court by filing 
a writ petition no. 4298 of  2013. The Hon’ble Gauhati 
High  Court  vide  an  ex-parte  order  dated  August  1, 
2013,  imposed  a  stay  on  the  said  order  of   SEBI. The 
said stay is in continuance till date. An SLP (3725 of  
2014)  was  filed  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 
seeking directions for the High Court to dispose of  the 
writ petition or to vacate the interim order. The Hon’ble 
Supreme Court vide order dated April 15, 2014 while 
dismissing the SLP requested the Gauhati High Court 
to  expeditiously  dispose  the  matter.  Despite  the  said 
order of  the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the hearing in the 
matter  was  being  adjourned  by  the  Hon’ble  Gauhati 
High Court on some ground or the other. 

Another  SLP  (34105  of   2014)  was  filed  before  the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court to appraise the Hon’ble court 
about  this  and  to  seek  a  direction  for  expeditious 
disposal of  the matter by the Hon’ble High Court. Vide 
order  dated  January  6,  2015  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  directed  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  to  dispose  the

viii.  M/s  Videocon  International  Limited  vs. 
SEBI

 
The  appellant  had  filed  an  appeal  before  the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  against  the  common  order 
dated October 13, 2003, passed by the Hon’ble Bombay 
High Court in the following appeals:
i. 

SEBI vs. M/s Sterlite Industries (India) and Anr. 
(SEBI Appeal No. 1/2002)
SEBI  vs.  M/s  Videocon  International  Ltd.  and 
Anr. (SEBI Appeal No. 9/2002)

ii. 

iii.  Mr.  Pravin  Kumar  Tayal  vs.  Mr.  Ram  Prasad 

iv. 

Somani and Ors. (SEBI Appeal No. 10/2002)
SEBI  vs.  Mr.  Roopam  Sharma  (SEBI  Appeal  No. 
1/2003)
 
In  terms  of   the  said  order,  the  abovementioned 
appeal  nos.  1/2002  and  9/2002  were  held  to  be 
maintainable  as  they  were  filed  prior  to  coming  into 
force of  the amendment (October 29, 2002) to Section 
15Z  of   the  SEBI  Act.  However,  with  regard  to  appeal 
nos.  10/2002  and  1/2003,  the  Hon’ble  High  Court 
observed that the same were not maintainable as they 
were filed after the coming into force of  the amendment. 
Subsequently,  appeal  no.  10/2002  was  dismissed 
as  not  maintainable  and  1/2003  was  allowed  to  be 
withdrawn for being presented in the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court.
 
Supreme Court decided on the following questions:

While  deciding  on  the  appeal,  the  Hon’ble 

i)  Whether  an  order  passed  by  SAT  before 
October  29,  2002  would  be  appealable  under 
the  unamended  provision  of   Section  15Z  of  
the  SEBI  Act  before  the  Hon’ble  High  Court 
or  alternatively,  whether  the  same  would  be 
appealable  under  the  amended  provision  of  
Section 15Z of  the SEBI Act before the Supreme 
Court?

ii)  Whether  the  date  on  which  SEBI  had  preferred 
the appeals, was a relevant consideration in the 
facts and circumstances of  the present case.

 
On the first question, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
observed that the amended Section 15Z, while altering 
the appellate forum from the High Court to the Supreme 

Court, curtailed and restricted the scope of  the appeal 
against  an  order  passed  by  SAT,  by  expressing  that 
the  remedy  could  be  availed  of   ‘...on  any  question 
of   law  arising  out  of   such  order.’  Further,  the  court 
observed  that  ‘...the  amendment  to  Section  15Z  of  
the  SEBI  Act,  having  reduced  the  appellate  package, 
adversely  affected  the  appellate  right  vested  of   the 
concerned litigant. The right of  appeal being a vested 
right,  the  appellate  package,  as  was  available  at  the 
commencement  of   the  proceedings,  would  continue 
to vest in the parties engaged in a lis, till the eventual 
culmination of  the proceedings. Obviously, that would 
be  subject  to  an  amendment  expressly  or  impliedly, 
providing  to  the  contrary.  Section  32  of   the  SEBI 
(Amendment)  Act,  2002,  which  has  been  extracted 
in paragraph 12 hereinabove reveals, that the “repeal 
and saving” clause, neither expressly nor impliedly, so 
provides.’ Therefore, it concluded that appellate remedy 
available  to  the  respondent  prior  to  the  amendment 
must continue to be available despite the amendment 
and  accordingly,  all  the  appeals  preferred  by  SEBI 
before the High Court were maintainable in law. 

 
On  the  second  question,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court observed that ‘...neither the date of  filing of  the 
second  appeal,  nor  the  date  of   hearing  thereof,  is  of  
any relevance. Legal pursuit of  a remedy, suit, appeal 
and second appeal, are steps in a singular proceeding. 
All these steps are deemingly connected by an intrinsic 
unity,  which  are  treated  as  one  singular  proceeding. 
Therefore, the relevant date when the appellate remedy 
(including  the  second  appellate  remedy)  becomes 
vested  in  the  parties  to  the  lis,  is  the  date  when  the 
dispute/lis  is  initiated.’  Therefore,  it  was  held  that  in 
the  appellant’s  matter,  the  order  was  passed  by  SAT 
well  before  the  amendment  and  hence,  the  dispute 
between the parties, out of  which the second appellate 
remedy was available, came to be initiated before the 
amendment.

 

It was contended by the appellant that in the 
absence  of   a  saving  clause,  the  pending  proceedings 
(and  the  jurisdiction  of   the  High  Court),  cannot 
be  deemed  to  have  been  saved.  While  rejecting  the 
contention  of   the  appellant,  the  court  observed  that 
a  law  which  brought  about  a  change  in  the  forum 
would not affect pending actions unless the intention 
was  clearly  shown.  It  held  that  since  the  amending 
provision  herein  does  not  so  envisage  it  had  to  be 

150

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

concluded  that  the  pending  appeals  (before  the 
amendment of  Section 15Z) would not be affected in 
any manner. 

ix.  Mr. Subrata Roy vs. UoI and Ors 

 
The petitioner impugned the order dated March 
4,  2014  passed  in  contempt  proceedings  initiated  by 
SEBI,  directing  that  the  petitioner  be  held  in  judicial 
custody to ensure compliance of  its earlier order dated 
August 31, 2012 passed against the Sahara. 

 

The court held as follows:

That  there  was  no  merit  in  the  contention  that 
 
the judges should recuse themselves from the hearing 
of  this case and that calculated psychological offensives 
and  mind  games  adopted  to  seek  recusal  of   judges 
needed to be strongly repulsed. While deprecating such 
tactics the bench recommended a similar approach to 
other courts when they experience such behaviour.

 
In  support  of   the  principle  that  imprisonment 
under  contempt  jurisdiction  can  be  a  mode  for 
compliance of  its orders, the court relied upon its order 
in  the  Mr.  Maninderjit  Singh  Bitta  vs.  UoI  case  and 
noted that this principle has been applied in the United 
States and Australia as well.

 
The court noted that the two companies of  which 
the petitioner was a promoter, flouted orders passed by 
SEBI, SAT, the High Court and the Supreme Court, with 
impunity.  Facts  and  information  solicited  were  never 
disclosed. The position adopted by the two companies 
was  always  projected  on  the  basis  of   unverifiable 
material. The court referred to its order dated August 
31,2012  in  which  it  was  recorded  that  the  factual 
assertions  made  on  behalf   of   the  two  companies 
seemed  to  be  totally  unrealistic  and  could  well  be 
fictitious, concocted and made up, and that the affairs 
of  the two companies seemed to be doubtful, dubious 
and  questionable.  It  noted  that  this  position  had 
remained  unaltered  since  no  authentic  and  verifiable 
material  sought  had  ever  been  furnished  by  the  two 
companies  which  remained  adamant  while  frittering 
away  repeated  opportunities  granted  by  this  court  to 
comply  with  the  orders  dated  August  31,  2012  and 
December 5, 2012 and instead adopted a demeanour 
of   defiance  constituting  rebellious  behaviour  not 
amenable to the rule of  law.

 
It  noted  that  after  the  order  dated  August  31, 
2012, the bench had heard the contempt applications 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

etc.  on  approximately  36  occasions,  issued  a  notice 
on February 6, 2013 and dispensed with the personal 
appearance  of   the  petitioner,  but  Sahara  abused  the 
judicial process by approaching SAT and the Lucknow 
Bench for relief, which were subsequently transferred 
to  it.  The  attempt  to  furnish  properties  as  security 
could  only  have  been  with  the  petitioner’s  express 
approval and the stance now adopted showed that the 
petitioner  was  in  absolute  charge  of   all  the  affairs  of  
the  companies  and  nothing  could  move  without  his 
active involvement. In the affairs of  the Sahara Group, 
Mr.  Subrata  Roy  Sahara  was  the  only  person  who 
mattered and therefore the other individual directors, 
may  hardly  have  any  say  in  the  matter.  In  view  of  
the  rejection  of   the  defence  of   alleged  redemption  by 
the  full  bench  headed  by  the  CJI  vide  its  order  dared 
December  5,  2012,  it  was  not  permissible  in  law  for 
the  Sahara  to  raise  the  defence.  However,  to  ensure 
that  no  injustice  was  done  the  court  permitted  them 
to  substantiate  the  factum  of   redemption.  Yet,  no 
material worth the name was ever produced before the 
court to establish the defence of  redemption. The two 
companies had not been able to pay anything for the 
last one and a half  years from the court’s order dated 
December 5, 2012, whereas in a period of  three/four 
months, SIRECL claimed to have unilaterally refunded 
`  17,443 crore and SHICL claimed to have on its own 
redeemed `  5,442 crore, to their investors and that if  
the  money  could  be  easily  collected  and  disbursed  to 
the investors then why not now?

 
The court referred to Section 51 of  the Code of  
Civil  Procedure,  1908,  which  expressly  contemplates 
arrest and detention for the enforcement of  a money 
decree by the executing court and that Sections 125-
128 of  the Code of  Criminal Procedure, 1973, envisage 
arrest and detention as a mean for enforcing financial 
liability  to  discount  the  argument  of   the  petitioner 
that execution of  a money decree or enforcement of  a 
financial liability by way of  arrest and detention was a 
procedure unknown to law. The court also noted that 
arrest  and  detention  were  only  to  coerce  compliance 
and  that  the  liability  to  pay  would  stand  discharged 
only by actual payment of  the amount due. Remaining 
in jail would not discharge the liability to pay. 

 
The court noted that SEBI had filed interlocutory 
application  nos.  68  and  69  of   2013  in  Civil  Appeal 
no.  9813  of   2011,  inter-alia,  seeking  the  arrest  and 

151

detention of  the petitioner and two other contemnors 
and  deposit  of   the  contemnors’  passports. The  court 
noted that the petitioner filed a personal reply by way 
of   an  affidavit  in  which  all  possible  legal  and  factual 
defences  were  raised.  Different  orders  were  passed 
from time to time in furtherance of  the prayers made 
in  the  aforementioned 
interlocutory  applications, 
including the order preventing the petitioner (and the 
other contemnors) from leaving the country, as also an 
order restraining the two companies from parting with 
any  movable  or  immovable  property  in  view  of   the 
false  evaluation  report  and  the  order  of   the  Bombay 
High  Court  depicting  the  main  properties  to  be  in  a 
‘no  development  zone’,  where  no  construction  was 
possible.  A  number  of   opportunities  of   hearing  were 
given to prove the source of  alleged redemptions and to 
furnish the required bank statements in view of  their 
averments  in  SAT  appeals  48-49/13  in  which  they 
had placed reliance upon the bank accounts of  Sahara 
India. Finding the attitude of  the contemnors defiant 
and  non-cooperative,  the  petitioner,  was  directed  to 
be present on February 26,2014, but he did not make 
a  personal  appearance.  His  personal  presence  was 
enforced through non-bailable warrants on March 4, 
2014.  During  the  course  of   their  personal  presence 
in  court,  the  petitioner  and  the  other  contemnors 
were afforded an opportunity of  oral hearing. Hence, 
the  impugned  order  was  passed  after  following  the 
rules of  natural justice and affording the petitioner an 
opportunity of  hearing.

The  court  noted  that  all  along,  most  ridiculous 
 
and absurd defences were raised. It was even contended 
that the earlier position adopted by the two companies in 
the two appeals was the result of  a typographical error 
which  was  done  to  avoid  furnishing  the  information 
sought and perhaps there was no information to supply.

The court noted that the order dated August 31,2012 
read with the order dated December 5, 2012 was final 
and  binding  and  no  proceedings  were  pending  before 
this court either at the hands of  the two companies or 
the petitioner herein, for their reconsideration on merits 
and that the court had neither the jurisdiction nor the 
authority  to  relax  the  terms  and  the  court  would  be 
committing contempt if  it were to, on its own, interfere 
with these directions. As a matter of  fact, it is not open 
to the court, to relax the order dated December 5, 2012, 
which  was  passed  by  a  three-judge  division  bench, 

requiring the contemnors to deposit the first instalment 
of  `  10,000 crore, in the first week of  January 2013.
The  court  further  noted  that  as  of   now  the  amount 
payable in furtherance of  the directions issued by this 
court  (on  August  31,  2012  and  December  5,2012), 
had swelled up to `  36,608 crore.

 
The defence raised by the petitioner that the two 
companies  had  already  substantially  redeemed  the 
OFCDs, was examined under two different perspectives. 
Firstly,  the  above  defence  was  unavailable  to  the  two 
companies  in  law,  after  the  same  was  rejected  on 
December  5,  2012  by  a  three-judge  division  bench. 
Secondly,  the  said  defence  had  been  examined  from 
various  factual  perspectives  and  had  been  found  to 
be  untenable.  Sole  reliance  on  general  ledger  entries 
without any other authentication had been held to be 
insufficient proof  of  the refunds claimed to have been 
made by the two companies to the investors, especially 
because such cash redemptions had not been affirmed 
in the certificates dated January 31, 2014 issued by a 
firm of  chartered accountants, which had audited the 
accounts of  the two companies. The firm of  chartered 
accountants,  therefore,  did  not  choose  to  confirm 
the  redemption  of   OFCDs  made  by  way  of   cash. This 
action  must  be  deemed  to  be  conscious,  otherwise  it 
was  not  necessary  even  to  confirm  the  redemptions 
made by way of  cheque. The court observed that either 
the  submissions  made  to  the  court  on  the  subject  of  
refunds  made  by  the  two  companies  were  false  or 
the  present  projection  of   the  two  companies  of   their 
inability  to  pay  the  investors  was  false  considering 
they had collected monies from other group concerns 
and redeemed almost `  15,500 crore on a single day. 
The  court  noted  that  its  interim  order  dated  January 
9, 2012 stayed only the direction to refund contained 
in the order of  WTM dated June 23, 2011 but did not 
vary the manner of  making the refunds. Since WTM 
had  clearly  directed  that  such  repayment  could  only 
be made ‘in cash through demand draft or pay order’, 
hence  cash  conversion  in  any  other  format  was  not 
permitted. 

 
The court pointed out that the very submission 
now  made  by  the  companies  that  the  investors  were 
refunded  their  deposits  by  way  of   cash,  was  another 
tactic  in  a  series  of   manoeuvres,  adopted  by  the  two 
companies  to  defeat  the  process  of   law.  Only  one 
bond  of   SIRECL  was  redeemable  before  the  year

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

2013 and that too, only to the extent of  `  351 crore. 
No  company  can  unilaterally  redeem  debentures 
before  the  prescribed  period  and  hence  the  theory  of  
redemption propounded by the two companies was in 
clear violation of  law. The court noted that SEBI had 
pointed out that Sahara did not furnish the details of  
the  source  of   funds  of   the  alleged  repayment  sought 
by  it.  The  court  observed  that  the  audacity  and  the 
fearlessness of  the two companies was apparent from 
the  reason  expressed  to  the  court  for  not  furnishing 
this  information. The  court  was  informed  that  it  had 
not  passed  any  express  direction  to  the  companies  to 
furnish the information. Therefore the companies were 
not  obliged  to  provide  the  information  to  SEBI.  The 
court observed that ordinarily, an honest person would 
immediately provide the information sought to obviate 
any adverse impression. Moreover, SEBI had not only 
the  authority,  but  also  every  reason  to  seek  the  said 
information. Even after the court vide its order dated 
January 9, 2014 directed that bank account details be 
furnished,  the  position  remained  the  same.  The  two 
companies never provided any authentic information. 
SEBI,  SAT  and  the  Supreme  Court,  were  required  to 
accept  the  factum  of   redemption  just  because  the 
companies were asserting the factum of  redemption. 

the  petitioners:(i) 

The  court  noted  the  divergent  views  of   the 
counsels  of  
the  petition  was 
maintainable  under  the  maxim  of   ex  debito  justitiae 
(in  the  interest  of   justice),  and  not  under  any  article 
of   the  Constitution,  (ii)  the  petition  was  maintainable 
under  Article  32  of   the  Constitution  (writ  jurisdiction 
for  violation  of  
fundamental  rights),and  (iii)  the 
petition was maintainable under Article 129 (Supreme 
Court’s power to punish for contempt) r/w Article 142 
(power of  the Supreme Court to do complete justice in 
the matter). 

 
The  court  held  that  as  a  ‘superior  court’,  no 
matter  could  be  held  to  be  beyond  the  jurisdiction  of  
the  Supreme  Court.  Since  this  was  not  the  case  of  
the  petitioner  that  some  legislative  or  constitutional 
provision  had  curtailed  the  jurisdiction  of   this  court 
from passing an order of  the nature which is impugned 
through  this  criminal  writ  petition,  there  can  be  no 
doubt that the order sending the petitioner to judicial 
detention had been passed by this court in legitimate 
exercise of  its jurisdiction. The court further noted that 
the  principles  of   natural  justice  had  been  followed  to 

the  hilt  in  the  present  matter  and  hence  prejudice  to 
the petitioner by reason of  the judicial order was not 
made out and hence the principle of  ex debito justitiae 
could  not  be  invoked.  The  court  further  held  that 
it  is  well  settled  that  a  writ  petition  under  Article  32 
r/w  Article  21  is  not  maintainable  against  the  order 
of   imprisonment  passed  by  a  court  of   competent 
jurisdiction. The  court  further  rejected  the  argument 
that  the  petition  was  maintainable  under  Article 
129  r/w  142  as  inherent  powers  could  have  only 
been  invoked  by  way  of   a  curative  petition.  Since 
the  petitioner  had  placed  reliance  on  the  aforesaid 
judgment, the court held that the petitioner was aware 
of  the jurisdiction of  this court under Article 137 of  
the Constitution of  India for filing a review petition, as 
also the permissibility of  filing a curative petition after 
the concerned party had not succeeded in the review 
petition. Unfortunately, the petitioner had not chosen 
either  of   the  jurisdictions.  The  instant  petition  had 
been styled as a criminal writ petition. Thus the court 
rejected the petition as not maintainable. 

On  the  basis  of   these  reasons  the  court  held 
 
that there was no merit in the petition and it was not 
maintainable and dismissed it accordingly.

b.  HIGH COURT

i.  Mr.  Nikhil  T.  Parikh  &  Ors.  vs.  Union  of  
India & Ors.

The  petitioners, 

inter-alia,  challenged 

 
the 
legality and validity of  SEBI circulars on exit policy for 
stock  exchanges  dated  May  30,  2012  and  December 
13,2012  and  SECC  Regulations,  2012  in  a  writ 
petition  before  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  Gujarat,  that 
the  impugned  circulars,  regulations,  etc.,  were  ultra 
vires  the  Constitution  of   India  and  were  contrary 
to  the  provisions  of   SCRA,  1956  and  the  Companies 
Act,  1956  and  were  unreasonable,  unconstitutional, 
discriminatory,  inequitable,  unjust,  harsh  and  illegal. 
The Hon’ble court in this regard held that:

The  circular  issued  by  SEBI,  had  been  issued  in 
 
exercise of  powers conferred under Sections 11(1) and 
11(2)(j) of  the SEBI Act, 1992, read with Section 5 of  
SCRA. Whether a circular issued by a statutory authority 
would  be  binding  or  not,  or  whether  the  same  had  a 
statutory  force  or  not,  would  depend  upon  the  nature 
of   the  statute.  For  the  said  purpose,  the  intention  of  
the legislature must be considered. It was clear that the 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

153

circular dated May 30,2012 issued by SEBI which was 
the subject matter of  challenge in this petition, could be 
termed as a statutory circular having a force of  law and 
binding to all the stock exchanges in the country. 

 
The  scope  of   Regulation  11(1)  was  sufficiently 
wide to meet situations for which measures were not 
specifically provided in the regulation. Merely because 
in  Section  11(2)  it  is  provided  that  ‘the  measures 
referred  to  therein  may  provide  for’  cannot  be  taken 
to  mean  that  such  measures  have  to  be  laid  down  in 
advance. It is a matter of  common knowledge that SEBI 
has to regulate a speculative market and in the case of  
a speculative market varied situations may arise and all 
such exigencies and situations cannot be contemplated 
in  advance  and,  therefore,  looking  to  the  exigencies 
and  the  requirement,  it  has  been  entrusted  with  the 
duty and function to take such measures as it thinks fit.

SECC  Regulations,  2012  as  well  as 

the 
impugned  Exit  Circular  dated  May  30,  2012  were 
issued  by  SEBI  after  due  consultations  with  all 
including  the  recognised  stock 
the  stakeholders 
exchanges  although  there 
is  no  such  statutory 
mandate  for  SEBI  to  make  such  consultations  before 
framing regulations or issuing circulars. 

SCRA and the SEBI Act are special acts and have 
 
an over-riding effect over some of  the provisions of  the 
Companies Act.

 
There  should  be  judicial  restraint  in  fiscal  and 
economic regulatory measures. The state should not be 
hampered by the court in such measures unless they 
are clearly illegal or unconstitutional. The state must 
therefore be left with wide latitude in devising ways and 
means of  imposing fiscal or regulatory measures, and 
the court should not, unless compelled by the statute or 
by the Constitution, encroach into this field. 

 
The  denial  of   right  to  be  on  the  board  of  
management  and/or  denial  of   right  to  vote  for 
shareholders’ directors is because with the experience 
gained  it  has  been  found  by  SEBI  that  there  is  total 
conflict  of   interest  if   trading  members  are  on  the 
board of  directors. It was found that trading members 
were  influencing  the  decision  making  process.  The 
importance  of   net  worth  has  been  explained  in 
the  Bimal  Jalan  report.  Even  as  a  shareholder,  the 
petitioner’s other rights are protected. Petitioners have 
a right to attend the general meeting, special meeting, 

and  by  majority,  can  also  participate  in  the  decision 
making  policy  in  the  general  board.  Public  interest 
directors are independent directors and it is erroneous 
to suggest that only trading members can provide for 
greater turnover and/or net worth.

For the said reasons, the petition was dismissed. 

Indian  Council  of   Investors  vs.  Union  of  

ii. 
India & Ors.

The  petitioner  filed  a  public  interest  litigation 
alleging  violation  of   the 
fundamental  right  of  
citizens  to  privacy  by  SEBI  for  intercepting  and 
monitoring  calls  and  calling  for  call  data  records 
(CDRs)  and  details  of   tower  locations  from  telecom 
service  providers  (TSPs).  It  was  also  alleged  by 
the  petitioner  that  SEBI  was  prevented/prohibited 
from  calling  CDR  from  any TSP  by  virtue  of   Section 
5(2)  of   the  Indian  Telegraph  Act,  1885.  The 
Hon’ble  Bombay  High  Court  held  that  SEBI’s  power 
is  very  wide  even  de  hors  the  amendments  by  the 
ordinances  and  it  is  entitled  to  take  such  measures 
as it deems fit to protect investors. The power in SEBI 
to  call  for  CDRs  from TSPs  was  always  available  and 
in  case  there  was  any  doubt  or  ambiguity,  the  same 
was  removed  by  the  Securities  Law  (Amendment) 
Ordinances  issued  in  2013  and  2014.  The  calling  of  
static  information  like  CDRs  from  a  TSP  did  not 
in  any  manner  violate  Section  5(2)  of   the  Indian 
Telegraph  Act,  1885.  SEBI  is  authorised  under  SEBI 
Act  to  call  for  CDRs  from TSPs  but  such  information 
can  be  called  under  certain  safeguards  such  as  only 
by  an  officer  duly  authorised  by  SEBI  to  call  for 
information  and  such  a  power  cannot  be  exercised 
by  SEBI  for  conducting  a  fishing  enquiry,  therefore 
this power can only be exercised by SEBI with respect 
to  any  person  against  whom  any  investigation  or 
enquiry is being conducted. 

iii.  UPSE Brokers Association and Ors. vs. SEBI 
& Anr.

The  petitioners  challenged  SEBI  circulars  on 
 
exit policy for stock exchanges and SECC Regulations, 
2012  and  sought  restraint  on  SEBI  from  interfering 
in  any  manner  with  the  management  of   the  stock 
exchanges  and  their  governing  boards  in  pursuance 
of  the SECC Regulations, 2012 in a writ petition before 
the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court. The Hon’ble court 
while dismissing the writ petition held as follows:

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

SCRA,  as  it  was  originally  enacted,  conferred 
 
over-arching  regulatory  powers  upon  the  central 
government.  With  the  establishment  of   SEBI  and  the 
enactment  of   the  SEBI  Act,  1992,  the  Parliament 
envisioned  that  SEBI  would  be  an  expert  regulator 
for the regulation of  the markets in securities and for 
defining  and  regulating  the  activities  of   stakeholders 
who  had  a  vital  bearing  on  the  transparent  and 
accountable functioning of  the securities markets.

from  the  function  of   being  market  organisers,  stock

through their listing rules; and (iv) at an institutional 
level, business enterprises.

The  Jalan  Committee  was  set  up  on  January 
6,  2010.  The  committee’s  report  was  submitted  on 
November 22, 2010 after a wide ranging consultation 
involving  all  stakeholders.  The  report  was  placed  on 
SEBI’s website on November 23, 2010. The Federation 
of   Indian  Stock  Exchanges  furnished  its  response  on 
December 25, 2010 to SEBI. The agenda for the SEBI 
board  meeting  of   April  2,  2012  included  comments 
made  by  the  Jalan  Committee  and  the  responses  of  
various stakeholders. SEBI made its recommendations 
and eventually the regulations were notified with effect 
from June 20, 2012. 

Viewed  in  this  background,  it  was  not  possible 
 
to accede to the submission that the SECC Regulations 
supplanted or were ultra vires SCRA, 1956 or the rules 
which had been framed under it. The regulations which 
had  been  framed  by  SEBI  were  in  exercise  of   powers 
conferred  by  Sections  4,  8A  and  31  of   SCRA,  1956. 
Section  31  of   SCRA,  1956  expressly  confers  power 
upon  SEBI  to  make  regulations  which  are  consistent 
with the Act and the rules, to carry out the purposes. 
SEBI, in framing the SECC Regulations, 2012 acted in 
pursuance  of   the  statutory  powers  conferred  upon  it 
and had not travelled beyond the bounds of  the statute.

Where  an  expert  body 

the  maker  of  
delegated  legislation,  the  experience  which  it  gains 
particularly in areas such as financial administration 
and  resource  allocation,  enables  it  to  cope  with 
myriad  different  situations  which  may  emerge  in  the 
practical  implementation  of   the  legislation.  It  is  left 
to  the  delegate  of   the  legislature  to  find  answers  to 

strategies  which  are  utilised  to  defeat  the  norms  laid 
down  by  law  in  order  to  secure  public  interest.  The 
reason  why  courts  grant  a  degree  of   autonomy  and 
discretion  to  the  financial  regulator  is  because  of  
the  realisation  of   the  enormous  challenges  before 
the  regulator 
in  designing  regulatory  measures 
and  continuously  updating  them  in  the  light  of  
experiences  gained, 
challenges  presented  and 
developments  envisioned  for  the  future.  So  long  as 
the  regulator  has  kept  within  the  bounds  of   the 
statute, the court would defer to its expertise.

 
Regulations  such  as  those  which  have  been 
framed by the SECC Regulations, insofar as they define 
the conditions for recognition, of  minimum net worth, 
composition of  the board of  directors and dispersal of  
ownership and norms for governance, do not infringe 
the  right  under  Article  19(1)(c).  The  regulations 
govern the antecedents of  the business or activity and 
do not infringe the right to form the association under 
Article 19 (1) (c).

 
Once, it is held as a matter of  principle that the 
imposition of  a minimum net worth requirement is not 
unreasonable or ultra vires, the fixation of  a particular 
threshold  in  terms  of   value  must  lie  in  the  expert 
determination  of   SEBI  when  it  made  the  subordinate 
legislation. Nothing had been indicated before the court 
to establish that the determination of  the threshold or 
the manner of  its computation was untenable and was 
so disproportionately high so as to constitute the very 
negation of  the right to carry on business.

have  a  serious  bearing  on  the  objective,  transparent

SEBI  rejected  an  application  for  want  of   satisfaction 
of   the  fit  and  proper  criterion,  it  must,  record 
reasons  which  would  be  amenable  to  the  appellate

iv.  BTL Holding Company Ltd. vs. SEBI 

 
Vide  an  order  passed  by  the  Delhi  High  Court 
on  March  16,  2012,  22  promoter/promoter  group 
companies  of   SRS  Ltd.  merged  with  BTL  Industries 
Ltd. As a result of  the merger, shares of  SRS Ltd. held 
by 20 out of  the 22 promoters/promoter groups stood 
vested in BTL Industries Ltd. As per the merger scheme, 
all  liabilities  and  duties  of   the  22  merged  companies 
were to be transferred to BTL Industries Ltd. On April 
19, 2013 name of  BTL Industries Ltd. was changed to 
SRS  Holding  India  Ltd.  Further,  vide  an  order  passed 
by the Delhi High Court on July 18, 2013 SRS Holding 
India Ltd. merged with BTL Investments and Securities 
Ltd. In the said order it was specifically recorded that all 
liabilities and duties of  SRS Holding India Ltd. would 
stand transferred to BTL Investment and Securities Ltd. 
Thereafter, the name of  BTL Investment and Securities 
Ltd.  was  changed  to  BTL  Holding  Company  Ltd.  (the 
appellant).  Therefore,  due  to  successive  mergers,  the 
obligations arising out of  merger of  the 22 promoter/
promoter  group  companies  with  BTL  Industries  Ltd./
SRS  Holding  India  Ltd.,  were  to  be  discharged  by  the 
appellant.

 
It  was  observed  by  the  Hon’ble  SAT  that  while 
approving  the  merger  of   the  22  entities  with  BTL 
Industries  Ltd.,  the  Hon’ble  Delhi  High  Court  had 
expressed that the rights and obligations of  the merged 
entities shall be the responsibility of  BTL Industries Ltd.. 
Thereafter, the name of  BTL Industries was changed to 
SRS Holding India Ltd.. Later on, while approving the 
merger of  SRS Holding India Ltd. with BTL Investments 
and Securities Ltd., the Hon’ble Delhi High Court once 
again expressly recorded that the rights and obligation 
of  SRS Holding India Ltd. shall be discharged by BTL 
Investments  and  Securities  Ltd.  The  Hon’ble  SAT 
noted  that  the  shares  of   SRS  Ltd.,  that  were  held  by 
the  merging  promoter/promoter  group  companies, 
were transferred to SRS Holding India Ltd., that is, the 
merged entity after the effective date of  merger. It was 
held by the Hon’ble SAT that the obligation to disclose 
arising on account of  such transfer of  shares had to be 
discharged  by  SRS  Holding  India  Ltd.  Further,  it  was 
observed that SRS Holding India Ltd. has accepted its 
obligation to make the disclosure and had in fact, made 
disclosures belatedly. Therefore, it was not open to the 
appellant, which was a subsequently merged entity of  
SRS Holding India Ltd., to deny obligation to discharge 

the penal liability imposed on SRS Holding India Ltd. 
for the delayed disclosures.

c. 

SECURITIES APPELLATE TRIBUNAL 

 

i.  M/s Nitta Gelatin India Ltd. vs. SEBI 
 
The issue under consideration was whether SEBI 
was justified in not favourably considering the request 
of   the  appellant  company  for  grant  of   extension  of  
time  for  the  allotment  of   bonus  shares  to  one  of   the 
promoters of  the appellant company under Regulation 
109  read  with  Regulation  95  of   the  SEBI  (ICDR) 
Regulations, 2009.

 
The  facts  of   the  matter  are  that  the  appellant 
company decided to increase the public shareholding 
to  the  required  25  percent  level  of   its  total  equity 
shareholding. The board of  directors of  the appellant 
company  M/s  Nitta  Gelatin  India  Ltd.  vide  resolution 
dated May 3, 2013 for complying with the minimum 
public  shareholding  requirements  resolved  the  issue 
of   1,00,000  equity  shares  under  the  Employee  Stock 
Purchases Scheme–I to the employees of  the company 
and  additionally  issued  5,79,160  equity  shares  in 
the  ratio  of   1:3  to  the  existing  shareholders  of   the 
company other than the promoters. However, the only 
other  promoter  Kerala  State  Industrial  Development 
Corporation  decided  not  to  forego  its  entitlement  of  
bonus  issue  of   shares  and  it  intended  to  subscribe  to 
it. The appellant vide its letter dated August 31, 2013 
sought  relaxation  from  SEBI  under  Regulation  109 
of   the  SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations,  2009  with  respect 
to  Regulation  95,  that  is,  extension  of   time  for  the 
allotment  of   bonus  shares  to  one  of   the  promoters. 
SEBI  turned  down  the  request  by  its  letter  dated 
February 14, 2014 by stating that the said allotment 
to bonus shares constituted modification of  the earlier 
resolution, the said resolution also had an implication 
on the price movement of  the shares of  the company 
and trades had been executed on the stock exchanges 
based on the disclosures already made by the company 
and if  the request of  the company was granted then the 
interest  of   the  investors  would  be  adversely  affected. 
SEBI’s  letter  was  challenged  by  the  appellant  in  the 
captioned appeal. 

The Hon’ble SAT after hearing both the parties at 
 
length vide its order dated November 5, 2014 dismissed 
the  said  appeal  by  recording  inter-alia  the  following 
reasons :

categories  under  Regulation  109  of   the  ICDR

it was for the development of  securities markets.

SEBI  turned  down  the  request  of   the  appellant 
in  order  to  achieve  the  objective  of   various 
provisions like Section 19 A (a) of  the SCRR, SEBI 
circular  and  the  amended  Clause  40  A  of   the 
Listing Agreement.

Granting  of   the  extension  of   the  time  to  the 
appellant company for the purpose of  extending 
the benefit of  bonus issue to one of  the promoters 
would amount to permitting it to circumvent the 
abovementioned provisions of  law.

 
The  Hon’ble  SAT  in  its  order  also  recorded 
that SEBI had exercised the powers conferred to it by 
Sections  59  to  84  of   the  Companies  Act,  1956  read 
with  relevant  provisions  of   ICDR  Regulations  as  well 
as SC(R)R, 1957 in an objective and fair manner. The 
appeal was dismissed. 

ii.  M/s Pancard Clubs Limited vs. SEBI and Ms. 
Shobha Ratnakar Barde and others vs. SEBI 

It was held by the Hon’ble SAT that if  a prompt 
 
decision, be it judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative, 
needs to be taken in a given case, excluding the duty 
of  giving an opportunity of  pre-decisional hearing to 
the person affected by the said decision, then it must 
be shown that there is an imminent act to be prevented 
or  a  danger  to  be  averted,  which  necessitated  the 
dispensation of  the requirement of  the pre-decisional 
hearing. In the absence of  such urgency, exercising the 
discretion under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of  the 
SEBI Act, 1992, to pass an ex-parte interim order will 
be unfair. Further, it was observed by the Hon’ble SAT 
that where a decision has to be reached by a body acting 
judicially, there must be a balance between the need for 
expedition and the need to give full opportunity to the 
person against whom the charges had been levelled.

iii.  M/s SICOM Limited vs. SEBI 

SICOM,  a  public  financial  institution  (PFI),  had 
 
provided  financial  assistance  to  Raj  Oil  Mills  (ROM) 
in  2010  by  way  of   bill  accounting  facility  up  to  a 
limit of  `  15 crore (facility) for which the promoter/
director of  ROM had pledged equity shares of  ROM as 

security  towards  the  facility.  As  ROM  failed  to  repay 
the  amounts  due  under  the  facility,  SICOM  invoked 
the  pledge  on  September  28,  2011  aggregating  6.39 
percent of  the total share capital and on February 24, 
2012  aggregating  15.35  percent  of   the  total  share 
capital requiring disclosure under Regulation 29(2) of  
SAST, 2011.

The  question  dealt  with  by  SAT  related  to  the 
 
interpretation of  Regulation 29(4) of  SAST, 2011 and 
the  proviso  thereto,  specifically  whether  a  scheduled 
commercial  bank  (SCB)  or  a  PFI  are  exempted  from 
disclosure  pursuant  to  the  invocation  of   a  pledge  or 
with the exemption restricted to the deemed acquisition 
of  shares, that is, creation and release of  pledge.

 
SICOM  submitted  to  SAT  that  the  exemption 
under the proviso to Regulation 29(4) was available to 
a PFI even when shares were acquired by the PFI on 
invocation of  pledge in the ordinary course of  business. 
SCB/PFI  in  the  ordinary  course  of   business  acquired 
shares  on  invocation  of   pledge  to  recover  their  loan 
and  not  to  take  over  the  management/control  of   the 
company and hence Regulation 10(1)(b)(viii) of  SAST, 
2011  exempted  SCB/PFI  from  making  an  open  offer 
on the invocation of  the pledge and the same principle 
applied for exemption for disclosure under Regulation 
29(4) of  SAST, 2011.

 
SAT  in  its  order  upheld  SEBI’s  orders  and  held 
that  exemption  to  SCB/PFI  under  Regulation  10(1)
(b)(viii) of  SAST, 2011 was for making an open offer 
and  exemption  under  Regulation  29(4)  was  specific 
to  the  disclosures  pursuant  to  deemed  acquisitions, 
that  is,  creation  and  release  of   a  pledge  and  not  to 
actual acquisition of  shares pursuant to invocation of  
the  pledge.  Regulation  29(4)  creates  legal  fiction  -  to 
assume existence of  a fact which does not exist, by a 
deeming fiction the pledgee is treated to have acquired 
shares  and  is  required  to  make  disclosures.  Where 
the  shares  are  acquired  on  invocation  of   a  pledge, 
the  question  of   introducing  deeming  fiction  would 
not  arise  because  in  such  a  case  shares  are  actually 
acquired  on  the  invocation  of   a  pledge.  Further  the 
proviso  to  Regulation  29(4)  exempts  SCB/PFI  from 
such deemed acquisition since shares are acquired by 
it in ordinary course of  business and not when there is 
actual acquisition of  shares pursuant to invocation of  
the pledge.

iv.  Mr. Kimsuk Krishna Sinha in respect of  DLF 
Ltd. and Sudipti Estates Private Ltd. against DLF 
Ltd. and 7 other entities

 
SEBI conducted investigation into the allegations 
levelled by complainant Mr. Kimsuk Krishna Sinha in 
respect of  DLF Ltd. and Sudipti Estates Private Ltd. The 
investigation inter-alia revealed that the DLF Ltd. and 
seven other entities (its directors/CEO/CFO) (noticees) 
employed  a  scheme  by  camouflaging  the  association 
of   Sudipti  with  DLF  as  dissociation.  They  failed  to 
ensure that the RHP/prospectus contained all material 
information  which  was  true  and  adequate  so  as  to 
enable the investors to make an informed investment 
decision  in  respect  of   the  issue. The  noticees  actively 
and  knowingly  suppressed  material  information  and 
facts in the RHP/prospectus leading to mis-statements 
in  the  RHP/prospectus  so  as  to  mislead  and  defraud 
investors in securities markets in connection with the 
issue of  shares of  DLF. 

  SEBI  vide  order  dated  October  10,  2014 
(impugned  order)  restrained  DLF  Ltd.,  its  directors/
CEO/CFO 
from  accessing  securities  markets  and 
prohibited  them  from  buying,  selling  or  otherwise 
dealing  in  securities,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  any 
manner  whatsoever  for  a  period  of   three  years  for 

violations  of   the  provisions  of   Clauses  6.2,  6.9.6.6., 
6.10.2.3, 6.11.1.2, 6.15.2 and 9.1 of  DIP Guidelines 
read  with  Regulation  111  of   ICDR  Regulations 
and  Section  11  of   the  SEBI  Act,  1992  and  also  the 
provisions of  Section 12 A(a), (b) and (c) of  SEBI Act 
read with Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4 (2)(f) 
and (k) of  PFUTP Regulations.

DLF Ltd. and six others filed appeals challenging 
 
the impugned order before SAT. SAT vide its order dated 
March 13, 2015 set aside the impugned order against 
DLF and others. However, the presiding officer (PO) of  
SAT, while upholding the impugned order, reduced the 
debarment  to  six  months  from  three  years.  Presently 
the matter is pending in the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 

IV.  CONSENT AND COMPOUNDING

 
During 2014-15, SEBI received 108 applications

VI.  SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT CELL

SEBI  constituted  a  cell  (the  special  enforcement 
cell)  to  specifically  handle  work  relating  to  the 
verification process of  documents submitted in terms of  
the directions of  the Hon’ble Supreme Court and also to 
handle matters connected therewith. Developments in 
the matter of  M/s Sahara India Real Estate Corporation 
Ltd.,  (SIRECL)  and  M/s  Sahara  Housing  Investment 
Corporation Ltd. (SHICL) are given below:

A.  Background:
SEBI  is  implementing  the  order  of   Hon’ble 
 
Supreme Court dated August 31,2012 which upheld 
SEBI  directions  to  both  the  companies  to  forthwith 
refund  the  money  collected  by  them  through  RHPs 
with  15  percent  interest  from  the  date  of   receipt  of  
money till the date of  payment.

 
SEBI  has  been  acting  in  accordance  with  the 
directions  contained  in  the  said  order  of   the  Hon’ble 
Supreme Court and its actions are overseen by Justice 
(retd.) B. N. Agrawal. SEBI has filed 11 status reports 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in this respect which 
have also been furnished to Sahara.

160

B.  Developments in the Matter during 2014-15:

 
Vide  order  dated  June  4,  2014,  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme Court declined interim bail to the contemnors 
or permission to use a guest house. Vide the same order, 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia permitted Sahara 
to  encash  certain  bank  accounts/deposits/bonds,  etc., 
for depositing the proceeds with SEBI’s designated bank 
account.  The  Hon’ble  court  also  permitted  Sahara  to 
sell/charge certain immovable properties, to enable it to 
comply with the orders of  the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 

Accordingly,  Saharas  sold  properties  situated 
 
in  Gurgaon,  Vasai,  Ahmedabad  and  Jodhpur  and 
a  total  amount  of   `  3,647.9  crore  was  credited  to 
the  designated  bank  account  of   SEBI.  In  addition, 
post-dated  cheques  worth  `  812.23  crore  were  also 
furnished to SEBI for realisation on the respective due 
dates. These post-dated cheques were furnished to SEBI 
by  the  purchasers  of   the  immovable  properties  from 
Sahara towards consideration for sale in terms of  the 
order  dated  June  4,  2014.  With  this  amount,  total 
amount deposited by Saharas as on March 31, 2015 
stands at `  8,790.08 crore.

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of Matters Specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

Subsequently,  Sahara  filed  another  application 
 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court seeking its permission 
for  selling  foreign  properties.  The  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  after  hearing  the  application  regarding  foreign 
properties, allowed the application to the extent that the 
three offshore hotel properties owned by Sahara were 
allowed to be transferred, sold or encumbered subject 
to the condition that the entire consideration received 
by  Sahara  after  repayment  of   the  loan  outstanding 
towards  the  Bank  of   China  be  deposited  with  SEBI 
towards  compliance  with  the  directions  contained 
in  the  conditional  bail  order  dated  March  26,  2014 
passed by the court. The excess amount, if  any, shall 
be deposited by Sahara in a separate account to await 
orders from the court regarding their utilisation. The 
Hon’ble  Court  also  appointed  Mr.  Shekar  Naphade, 
Senior Advocate, as amicus curiae in the matter.

the  Hon’ble  court 

Sahara  also  filed  an  application 

seeking 
permission  of  
for  financial 
arrangement  outside  India  wherein  a  ‘junior’  loan, 
over  and  above  the  loan  outstanding  payable  to  the 
Bank  of   China  with  whom  the  three  offshore  hotel 
properties  are  mortgaged,  would  be  availed  from 
Messrs Mirach Capital Group, USA, and the proceeds 
of   which  would  be  remitted  to  SEBI  towards  the  bail 
condition.  Sahara  also  filed  a  copy  of   a  letter  dated 
January  5,  2015  from  Bank  of   America  certifying/
confirming  that  funds  of   USD  1.05  billion  has  been 
earmarked  for  this  transaction  and  the  same  was 
free  from  any  lien  or  encumbrance. This  transaction 
subsequently  failed  to  go  through  due  to  mutual 
difference between Saharas and Mirach.
 
After  hearing  the  application,  the  Hon’ble 
court,  on  January  9,  2015,  directed  Sahara  to  seek 
clarifications  regarding  the  permissibility  of   the 
transaction  regarding  foreign  properties  proposed  by 
it  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of   India  (RBI),  and  in  the 
meantime  allowed  the  foreign  leg  of   the  transaction 
to  be  completed.  The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  also 
Table 3.63: Status of  Refunds made by SEBI
S.No.

permitted SEBI to file an additional affidavit setting out 
the  details  of   the  expenditure  under  different  heads 
and disbursement thereof  as claimed by SEBI in terms 
of  orders dated August 31, 2012 and June 4, 2014.

During  the  proceedings  before  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  on  March  13,  2015,  Sahara  was 
directed  to  submit  before  the  court  the  various 
actions  taken  by 
it  vis-a-vis  the  offers  received 
from  various  parties  in  connection  with  sale  of  
foreign  properties.  The  matter  is  pending  before  the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court.  Accordingly,  Sahara  filed 
an  application  containing  details  of   the  proposed 
arrangement  to  raise  funds,  which  was  taken  for 
hearing on March 23, 2015 when the court granted 
three months’ time and conference facilities to enable 
Sahara  to  comply  with  the  orders,  failing  which,  the 
Hon’ble  court  held,  a  receiver  would  be  appointed 
for  selling  Sahara  properties.  The  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  also  permitted  Sahara  to  sell  certain  domestic 
properties at a rate lesser than the circle rates.
Status of  Refunds Made By SEBI
C. 
Pursuant  to  the  order  of   the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
 
Court  dated  May  8,  2013  permitting  SEBI  to  make 
refunds  to  those  genuine  investors  who  lodged  their 
claim with SEBI, a press release was issued on May 28, 
2012 followed by two series of  advertisements released 
in August 2014 and December 2014 and a format of  
application for refund was put on SEBI’s website. 
As  on  June  3,  2015,  SEBI  has  received 
 
refunds  with 
10,456  applications  and  made 
respect  to  7,296  applications 
for  an  aggregate 
amount  of   `  42,42,36,472  including  interest  of  
`  18,04,58,872.  About  1,527  applications  are 
referred to applicants for removal of  discrepancies and 
the remaining (approximately 3,000 cases) fall in the 
disputed  category,  which  need  to  be  looked  into  and 
decided upon individually by the Competent Authority.

VII.  MONITORING OF LISTED COMPANIES

 
During  2014-15,  SEBI  put  in  place  a  division 
to  monitor  listed  companies  with  respect  to  various 
disclosure  requirements  stipulated  under  the  Listing 
Agreement. Broadly, the purpose of  the division was to 
monitor the implementation of  SEBI prescribed norms 
for  stock  exchanges  to  monitor  compliance  with  the 
provisions  of   the  Equity  Listing  Agreement  by  listed 
companies. 

 
Accordingly,  the  division  performed  various 
activities related to the implementation of  the aforesaid 
circular  including  the  scrutiny  of   periodic  reports 
filed  by  stock  exchanges  on  the  compliance  status  of  
companies  in  the  top  500  positions  on  the  basis  of  
market  capitalisation  with  respect  to  Clauses  35,  41 
and 49 on shareholding pattern, financial results and 
corporate governance respectively. Towards enhancing 
the quality of  disclosures being made by the companies 
on  the  occurrence  of   significant  material  events,  the 
division  conducted  an  inspection  of   BSE  and  NSE  on 
the  monitoring  being  done  by  the  stock  exchanges 
with respect to Clause 36 filings. The objective was to 
monitor  whether  the  stock  exchanges  were  ensuring 
adequacy and accuracy of  corporate announcements 
filed by the top 500 companies under Clause 36 of  the 
Listing Agreement and news clarifications. 

 
In  terms  of   Section  149  of   the  Companies  Act,

issuing  notifications.  Every  rule  and  every  regulation 
made  under  this  Act  shall  be  laid  before  each  House 
of  Parliament. During 2014-15, the SEBI Board took 
various  regulatory  measures  to  protect  the  interests 
of  investors in securities markets, for the development 

162

and regulation of  securities markets. In this regard, the 
SEBI  Board  notified  various  new  regulations.  Various 
amendments  to  the  existing  regulations  were  also 
notified. The summary of  regulatory changes made is 
as follows:

A.  New Regulations
a. 

(Prohibition  of   Insider  Trading) 

SEBI 
Regulations, 2015 w.e.f. May 15, 2015.

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  new  regulations  strengthen  the  legal  and 
enforcement framework, align the Indian regime 
with international practices, provide clarity with 
respect to definitions and concepts and facilitate 
legitimate  business  transactions.  The  salient 
features of  these regulations are:

i.  The definition of  insider has been made wider 
by  including  persons  connected  on  the  basis 
of   being  in  any  contractual,  fiduciary  or 
employment  relationship  that  allows  such  a 
person  access  to  unpublished  price  sensitive 
information (UPSI). Directors, employees and 
all  other  persons  in  the  deeming  category 
covered  under 
the  1992  Regulations 
continued  to  be  covered.  Insiders  will  also 
include a person who is in possession or has 
access  to  UPSI.  Further,  immediate  relatives 
are presumed to be connected persons. 

ii.  In the case of  connected persons, the onus of  
establishing that they were not in possession 
of  UPSI shall be on them.

iii. Prohibition  on  communication  of   UPSI  has 
been provided except for legitimate purposes, 
performance  of   duties  or  discharge  of   legal 
obligations.

iv.  Advance disclosure of  UPSI at least two days 
prior to trading has been made mandatory in 
case of  permitted communication of  UPSI.

v.  UPSI  has  been  defined  as  information  not 
generally  available  and  which  may  impact 
the  price.  The  definition  of   UPSI  has  been 
strengthened  by  providing  a  test  to  identify 
price sensitive information, aligning it with the 
Listing  Agreement  and  providing  a  platform 
for  disclosure.  Earlier,  the  definition  of   price 
sensitive  information  referred  to  a  company 
only; now it is in reference to both company 
and securities.

been  provided  and  trading  window  norms 
have  been  made  uniform  to  other  connected 
persons.

xii. In  given  cases,  certain  circumstances  which 
can be demonstrated by an insider to prove his 
innocence have been provided.

xiii. Repeated  disclosures  have  been  removed  so 
as to ease the compliance burden and to align 
with  the  Takeover  Code.  Disclosure  of   any 
change  of   two  percent  for  persons  holding 
more than five percent shares or voting rights 
has been removed as they are prescribed under 
the Takeover Code.

xiv. Principle  based  Code  of   Fair  Disclosure  and

such  disclosures.  The  focus  of   the  disclosure  is 
transparency in the working and functioning of  SEBI. 
In this regard, SEBI has put in place various effective 
systems  and  procedures:  policy  decisions  and  reform 
measures  taken  by  SEBI  generally  emanate  through 
extensive  consultative  processes  through  various 
advisory  committees.  While  evolving  policy  changes, 
SEBI endeavours to seek valuable comments from the 
investing public and stakeholders at large through the 
public comments process.

to  their  on-going  work  programmes.  With  the  ever-
evolving and dynamic nature of  capital markets, it is 
important to be abreast of  global developments while 
introducing  and  implementing  regulatory  measures 
domestically. In this context, and in furtherance of  its 
regulatory  objectives,  SEBI  engages  with  a  range  of  
international organisations, foreign regulators and law 
enforcement agencies. In 2014-15 also SEBI continued 
to actively engage and contribute to on-going work in 
the international arena. 
engagement 
primary 
 
continues to be with the International Organisation of  
Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the globally recognised 
international standard setter for securities markets. SEBI 
played a key role in various meetings and committees of  
IOSCO and further strengthened its position in the global 
space. SEBI also actively co-operated in investigations/
enforcement/supervisory  matters  with  other  overseas 
regulators under the framework of  mutual collaboration 
provided under the IOSCO multilateral memorandum of  
understanding (MMoU). 
 
In addition to its engagement with IOSCO, SEBI 
continued  to  make  a  meaningful  contribution  to  the 
on-going work of  the Financial Stability Board (FSB), 
the  international  body  that  has  been  mandated  by 
the  G20  to  promote  implementation  of   financial 
sector  regulatory  reforms  in  the  world,  and  of   the 
Joint  Forum  (JF),  a  co-operative  cross-sector  group 
established in 1996 to deal with issues common to the 
banking,  securities  and  insurance  sectors,  including 
the regulation of  financial conglomerates.
 
As  a  part  of   its  other  varying  commitments  as 
securities  markets’  regulator,  on  several  occasions 
SEBI  provided  inputs  to  the  Government  of   India 
on  international  issues/treaties  and  financial  sector 
dialogues,  hosted  and  organised  visits  of   foreign 
delegates  and  conducted  international  seminars  and 
training programmes.

At the bilateral engagement front, SEBI entered 
 
into  several  bilateral  MOUs  with  other  securities 
regulators  to  promote  mutual  co-operation  and 
technical assistance. 
With a view to disseminating information about 
 
SEBI’s international activities as well as on the recent 
developments in the international regulatory sphere, a 
separate section was hosted on SEBI’s website with the 
following broad objectives:

The IOSCO board, that is, the governing body of  
IOSCO, is made up of  33 securities regulators. SEBI is 
one of  the members of  the IOSCO board.
in  IOSCO’s  various  work 
 
streams  and  makes  contributions  to  policy  decisions 
on  different  issues  pertaining  to  securities  markets. 
SEBI  has  its  representation  on  six  of   the  eight  policy 
committees  of   IOSCO.  SEBI  endeavours  to  implement

Box 3.9: Thematic Review of  Money Market Funds (MMFs)

 
Pursuant to the request from FSB, IOSCO initiated a thematic review of  the implementation of  money market reforms 
published by IOSCO in October 2012. The objective of  the review was to identify the progress made in adopting legislations, 
regulations and other policies in relation to MMFs in reform areas. Thirty IOSCO members participated in the review including 
SEBI, India. 
 
The key preliminary findings of  the review were reported to the G20 in November 2014. These findings were made on the 
basis of  the self-assessments provided by participating jurisdictions. This report sets out the findings of  the progress in adopting 
legislations, regulations and other policies in relation to MMFs in the reform areas: scope of  regulatory reforms, limitations to 
asset types and risks taken, valuation, liquidity management, MMFs that offer a constant NAV, use of  ratings and disclosure to 
investors and repos.  
 
With regard to India, the report found that SEBI had requisite measures in place much before the publication of  the policy 
framework by IOSCO (before October 1, 2012) with respect to all the reform areas. It is worthy to highlight that SEBI has been 
ahead of  many jurisdictions including some large, developed markets which are yet to publish draft implementation measures 
for MMFs. The full report can be accessed at:

February  2012  to  drive  IOSCO’s  key  strategic  goal  of  
being  the  recognised  standard  setter  for  securities 
regulations. The main objectives of  AC are identifying 
and  assessing  implementation  of   IOSCO  principles 
and  standards  and  promoting  the  full,  effective  and 
consistent  implementation  of   IOSCO  principles  and 
standards  across  IOSCO  membership.  The  main 
responsibilities  of   AC  are:  (a)  conducting  thematic 
reviews  of   particular  IOSCO  principles  and  IOSCO 
standards across IOSCO’s membership; (b)conducting 
country  reviews  and  reviewing  self-assessments 
prepared by IOSCO members about the implementation 
of  
(c)  maintaining  and 
periodically updating IOSCO principles and the related 
methodology.

SEBI,  as  vice-chair  of   AC,  has  been  involved  in 
setting the agenda, leading the discussions on some of  
the  areas  and  actively  participating  and  contributing 
to the on-going work of  the AC. 

 
During  2014-15,  the  AC  initiated  thematic 
reviews  of   different  areas.  Out  of   these,  SEBI 
participated in thematic reviews which were relevant 
for  it.  Further,  SEBI  also  participated  in  the  review 
team in some of  the thematic reviews.

c.  Asia-Pacific Regional Committee 

APRC 

is  one  of  

 
four  regional  committees 
constituted  by  IOSCO  to  focus  on  regional  issues 
relating to securities regulations. APRC comprises 24 
members representing securities regulators from Asia-
Pacific jurisdictions.

During 2014-15, APRC met two times. The first 
 
meeting  was  held  on  September  28,  2014  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro during the IOSCO annual conference. The next 
meeting was held on March 10–12, 2015 in Tokyo. 

 
IOSCO APRC took steps to enhance cooperation 
among  the  region´s  securities  regulators  and  develop 
capacity  building  initiatives.  APRC  agreed  on  an 
APRC  roadmap  that  provides  a  strategic  framework 
for making a meaningful contribution to the region’s 
development. The roadmap outlines certain key areas 
for  greater  cooperation  among  APRC´s  29  members,

d.  Growth and Emerging Markets Committee 

 
IOSCO’s  Growth  and  Emerging  Markets  (GEM)
Committee  comprises  88  members  representing 
75  percent  of   IOSCO’s  ordinary  membership.  GEM 
members  also  represent  the  world’s  fastest  growing 
economies and include 10 of  the G20 members. SEBI 
is a member of  the GEM committee.

 
During  2014-15,  the  GEM  committee  met  two 
times. The first meeting was held in Mauritius on April 
23-25, 2014. The members of  the GEM committee had 
a market development workshop on ‘Demutualisation 
and its impact on exchange regulation and supervision’. 
GEM  members  also  had  a  roundtable  on  emerging 
risks. A GEM public conference was held on the topic 
‘Long  Term  Financing  through  Capital  Markets’ 
where  several  participants  shared  insights  and  their 
experiences. 

 
The  second  meeting  of   the  GEM  committee 
was  held  on  September  29,  2014  during  the  IOSCO 
annual conference held in Rio de Janeiro. The members 
discussed several issues relevant for emerging markets 
such  as  capacity  building,  SME  financing  through 
capital markets and market-based long term financing. 

In  order  to  ensure  that  the  GEM  committee  is 
 
effective in achieving its strategic objectives, including 
strengthening  market  development  and  capacity 
building  of   its  members,  deepening  regulatory  policy 
work on emerging market issues and having a much 
stronger  voice  at  global  regulatory  discussions, 
a  steering  committee  within  the  GEM  committee 
was  formed.  SEBI  is  a  member  of   the  GEM  steering 
committee and participates in its various work streams. 
SEBI played a leadership role for developing a proposal 
on improving the capacity building efforts of  IOSCO.

Committee  on  Payments  and  Market 
Infrastructures (CPMI)-IOSCO 

 
CPMI-IOSCO  issued  a  comprehensive  set  of   24 
principles  and  five  responsibilities  in  a  report  titled 
‘Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure’ (PFMI) 
which was published in April 2012. CPSS and IOSCO 
are monitoring the implementation of  PFMIs both for 
the principles and responsibilities. 

 
The  implementation  monitoring  involves  three 
phases:  (1)  Level  1  to  assess  whether  jurisdictions 
have completed the process of  adopting the legislation, 
regulations  and  other  policies  that  will  enable  them 
to  implement  the  principles  and  responsibilities;  (2) 
Level 2 to assess whether the content of  the legislation, 
regulations and policies is complete and consistent with 
the  principles  and  responsibilities;  and  (3)  Level  3  to 
assess whether there is consistency in the outcomes of  
implementation of  the principles and responsibilities.

 
The  initial  Level  1  assessments  (covering  27 
jurisdictions) were conducted in mid-2013. The results 
of   the  assessments  were  published  in  August  2013. 
The first update to the initial Level 1 assessments was 
conducted in early 2014 and the report was published 
in  May  2014  (the  report  is  available  at:  http://www.
iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD440.pdf). 

 
India  participated  in  the  Level  1  assessments. 
India  has  been  given  a  rating  of   ‘4’  in  Level  1 
assessments  for  all  types  of   FMIs  and  with  respect  to 
responsibilities in the Level 1 update published in May 
2014.  Rating  ‘4’  indicates  that  final  implementation 
measures are in force.

CPMI-IOSCO also initiated a Level 2 and a Level 
 
3  assessment  against  the  implementation  of   the 
responsibilities  in  2014-15.  SEBI  participated  in  this 
review as well.
B.  Association  With  G20/Financial  Stability 

Board

The  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB) 

 
is  an 
international  body  established  to  address  financial 
system  vulnerabilities  and  to  drive  the  development 
and implementation of  strong regulatory, supervisory 
and other policies in the interest of  financial stability. 
One of  the main mandates of  the FSB is to implement 
G20 policy announcements on financial regulation. 

  SEBI is a member of  the plenary and regional 
committee  group  (RCG)-Asia  of   FSB.  During  2014-

172

15,  the  FSB  plenary  met  two  times.  FSB  met  in 
Cairns  on  September  17-18,  2014,  and  in  Frankfurt 
on  March  26,  2015.  At  its  meetings,  FSB  discussed 
vulnerabilities  affecting  the  global  financial  system 
and discussed work plans for completing core financial 
reforms  such  as 
(a)  Building  resilient  financial 
institutions;  (b)  Ending  too-big-to  fail;  (c)  Market 
based finance (d) Making derivatives markets safer; (e) 
Benchmark reforms; and (e) Accounting and auditing.

 
The  FSB  regional  consultative  group  for  Asia 
held its meetings on April 23, 2014 in Cebu, August 
27, 2014 in Kyoto and on March 4, 2015 in Bohol and 
reviewed FSB’s policy priorities and work plan. 

 
SEBI  participated  in  FSB  meetings  and  FSB-
RCG for Asia meeting held in 2014-15. Further, SEBI 
provides  comments  to  the  Ministry  of   Finance  on 
various FSB issues since the MoF is also a member to 
FSB from India. 

 
Since the onset of  the global financial crisis, the 
G20  has  established  core  elements  of   a  new  global 
financial  regulatory  framework  that  will  make  the 
financial system more resilient and better able to serve 
the  needs  of   the  real  economy.  National  authorities 
and  international  bodies,  with  FSB  as  a  central 
locus  of   coordination,  have  further  advanced  this 
financial reform programme based on clear principles

report  included  a  detailed  assessment  report  on 
implementation of  IOSCO objectives and principles of  
securities regulation (IOSCO principles). 

C. 

Joint Forum 

 
The  Joint  Forum  is  a  cooperative  cross-sector 
group  which  was  established  in  1996  by  its  three 
parent  bodies,  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking 
Supervision (BCBS), the International Organisation of  
Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International 
Association  of   Insurance  Supervisors  (IAIS),  to 
deal  with  issues  common  to  the  banking,  securities 
and  insurance  sectors,  including  the  regulation  of  
financial conglomerates. SEBI is a member of  the Joint 
Forum  since  February  2012.  The  Joint  Forum  has 
recently been working on areas relating to credit risk 
management across sectors and asset encumbrance.

D.  Regulatory  policy  initiatives  pursuant  to 

global developments

 
On  numerous  occasions  the  vast  and  varying 
international experience gathered by SEBI through its 
international engagements with global bodies has been 
carefully applied to its domestic policy formulation. The 
deliberations and valuable knowledge sharing efforts at 
the international level translate to the formulation and 
adoption of  global standards. Such standards are, time 
and again, adopted by SEBI in its domestic rule-making. 
While  on  the  one  hand,  this  demonstrates  SEBI’s 
commitment  towards  the  international  community, 
on the other hand it enhances and lends the necessary 
breadth and depth to SEBI’s own policy formation. 

 
Given this, SEBI has been proactive in developing 
policies based on issues discussed at the global level. For 
instance,  international  discussions  and  deliberations 
in  key  areas  such  as  money  market  funds,  high 
frequency  trading,  risk  based  supervision  of   market 
intermediaries,  corporate  governance,  cyber  security 
and regulation of  central counter parties (CCPs) have 
provided  very  useful  inputs  and  have  been  used  by 
SEBI  in  its  domestic  regulations.  Particularly,  during 
2014-15,  SEBI  published  a  consultation  paper  on 
Crowdfunding in India.

In addition to forming policy, SEBI continues to 
 
aim at improving the regulatory framework based on 
feedback  at  the  international  level  received  pursuant 
to  assessments  and  reviews.  Some  instances  of   such 
evaluations are the IMF-World Bank’s Financial Sector 
Assessment  Programme  (FSAP),  IOSCO’s  thematic 
reviews and FSB reviews. 

E. 

International Advisory Board (IAB)

 
SEBI constituted the IAB in September, 2011, as 
part of  the measures initiated by SEBI to respond to the 
challenges arising out of  the global financial crisis. The

Bilateral Engagements 

SEBI  has  signed  bilateral  MoUs  with  various 
 
securities  regulators 
for  enhancing  cooperation 
and  exchange  of   information  for  regulatory  and 
enforcement purposes. The objective of  such bilateral 
MoUs  is  to  strengthen  cross-border  cooperation  in 
the area of  securities regulations. The bilateral MoUs 
facilitate  mutual  assistance,  contribute 
towards 
efficient  performance  of   supervisory  functions  and 

enable  effective  enforcement  of   laws  and  regulations 
governing the securities markets.
 
These bilateral arrangements mark a crucial step 
in  SEBI’s  commitments  towards  enhancing  mutual 
cooperation  with  the  securities  markets’  regulatory 
authorities the world over. As of  March 31, 2014 SEBI 
had signed 18 bilateral MoUs and a letter of  intent for 
mutual assistance and cooperation. 
 
MoUs for bilateral cooperation.
a.  MoU with Non-Bank Financial Institutions 

During 2014-15, SEBI entered into the following 

Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA), Botswana

 
On  May  22,  2014  SEBI  signed  a  bilateral  MoU 
with  the  Non-Bank  Financial  Institutions  Regulatory 
Authority (NBFIRA), Botswana. The MoU was signed 
by Mr. U.K. Sinha, Chairman, SEBI and Mrs M. Dube, 
chairperson,  NBFIRA  at  the  SEBI  headquarters, 
Mumbai.

 
The  MoU  between  SEBI  and  NBFIRA  seeks 
to  promote  mutual  assistance  and  exchange  of  
information  between  the  two  jurisdictions.  The  MoU 
also  seeks  to  establish  and 
implement  technical 
assistance  and  a  training  programme  with  a  view  to 
facilitating  the  development  of   a  deeper  and  broader 
capital  market,  enhancing  greater  cross-border 
activities  and  attaining  closer  regulatory  cooperation 
between  two  jurisdictions  in  a  mutually  beneficial 
manner. It is notable that this MoU signed with SEBI is 
NBFIRA’s first MoU with a regulator outside Africa.

b.  MoU with 27 securities regulators

SEBI  and  securities  market  regulators  of   27 
member states of  the European Union (EU)/European 
Economic  Authority  (EEA)  signed  bilateral  MoUs 
concerning  consultation,  cooperation  and 
the 
exchange of  information related to the supervision of  
alternative  investment  fund  managers  (AIFMs).  The 
bilateral MoUs were signed on July 28, 2014.

 
The  MoUs  were  signed  in  pursuance  of   the  EU 
Alternative  Investment  Fund  Managers  Directive 
(AIFMD)  that  was  adopted  by  the  European  Council 
and  Parliament  in  July  2011  which  requires  that 
adequate 
supervisory  cooperation  arrangements 
be  put  in  place  between  EU  and  non-EU  supervisory 
authorities including SEBI.

Through  these  MoUs  SEBI  and  EU  authorities 
 
expressed their willingness to cooperate with each other 
in  the  interest  of   fulfilling  their  respective  regulatory 
mandates,  particularly 
investor 
protection, fostering market and financial integrity and 
maintaining confidence and systemic stability.

c. 

Engagement with ESMA on EMIR

 
The  European  Parliament  and  Council  adopted 
the  European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulations 
(EMIR)  effective  from  August  2012.  As  per  Article 
25(1)  of   EMIR,  ‘A  Central  Counter  Party  (CCP) 
established  in  third  country  may  provide  services  to 
clearing members or trading venues established in the 
Union  only  where  the  CCP  is  recognised  by  ESMA.’ 
Therefore, the securities markets CCPs established and 
operating in India have to seek recognition from ESMA 
for clearing trades of  entities which originate from EU.

 
In 2014, SEBI received a draft MoU from ESMA 
which is a prerequisite of  recognition under EMIR for 
all  future  supervisory  activities.  Subsequently,  SEBI 
provided information to ESMA about its regulatory laws 
and rules which helped ESMA issue technical advice to 
EC that ‘CCPs are subject to effective supervision and 
enforcement in India’ (October 2013). Both SEBI and 
ESMA have further revised the MoU and it was at an 
advanced stage of  discussion between the authorities 
as on March 31, 2015.

focus  on  listed  property  development  REITs.  In 
this regard, SECL developed a draft framework for 
Sri Lankan REITs and requested SEBI’s assistance 
in reviewing it. SECL requested SEBI’s assistance 
through a suitable official with sufficient exposure 

to REITs in India, who was also conversant with 
rational  and  technical  details  about  REITs. 
Accordingly,  SEBI  provided  technical  assistance

During  the  year  the  Audit  Committee  through 
its  review  as  above  helped  in  bringing  improvements 
in the internal control systems. 

Throughout  the  year  the  Audit  Committee 
has  reviewed  and  discussed  the  annual  statement 
of   accounts  of   SEBI  for  the  year  2014-15  with  the 
management  of   SEBI  and  internal  auditors.  Relying 
on  the  review  and  discussions  conducted  with 
the  management  and  internal  auditors,  the  Audit 
Committee  believes  that  SEBI’s  annual  statements 
of   accounts  are  fairly  presented  in  conformity  with 
the  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles 
(GAAPs)  in  all  material  aspects.  The  Committee 
also  reviewed  the  internal  control  systems  put  in 
place  and  expressed  its  satisfaction  with  the  same. 
The  members  of   the  Committee  discussed  among 
themselves, without the management or the internal 
auditors  being  present,  the  information  disclosed  in 
the  Annual  statement  of   Accounts.  The  Committee 
fulfilled  its  responsibilities  in  compliance  with  its 
charter.

3.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE(PMO)

SEBI  had  engaged  an  independent  consultant 
M/s  Oliver  Wyman  to  revisit  the  structural  and 
organisational  issues,  re-prioritise  areas  of   focus  and 
to  look  at  its  technological  and  manpower  needs.  A 
project  management  office  was  set  up  to  look  after 
the implementation of  the recommendations made by 
the consultant. 

SEBI Annual Report 2014-15

The  PMO  has  initiated  steps  to  implement 
various  recommendations 
in  a  phased  manner. 
During  2014-15,  PMO  drove  implementation  of   the 
following recommendations:

I. 

Enforcement Handover
An  enforcement  task  force  was  constituted 
for  strengthening  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  
enforcement  actions  and  to  promote  better  synergy 
and  coordinated  efforts  in  the  enforcement  process. 
The  task 
force  recommended  handing  over  of  
enforcement  matters  from  operational  departments 
to 
enforcement  department.  Accordingly, 
the  enforcement  matters  are  being  handed  over 
from  operational  departments  to  the  enforcement 
department.

the 

Taking 

account 

increased 
requirement  of   staff   in  supervision  activities  and  the 
recommendation  of   the  consultant,  staff   strength 
in  supervision  activities  has  been  strengthened 
significantly. 

II.  Transition  to  a  Risk  Based  Supervision 

Approach
To  evolve  towards  a 

formalised  risk  based 
supervision  approach,  a  risk  based  supervision  task 
force  (RBSTF)  was  constituted.  RBSTF  submitted 
its  report  laying  down  a  detailed  mechanism  to 
be  adopted  by  the  departments.  Based  on  the 
mechanism  laid  down  by  RBSTF,  the  concerned 
operational  departments  are  working  on  the  process 
of   transition  to  a  formalised  risk-based  supervision 
approach.

III.  Focused  Efforts  for  Financial  Literacy  and 

Investor Engagement
On  the  lines  of   the  recommendations  by  the 
consultant,  specific  investor  education  programmes 
were  undertaken  in  the  identified  86  districts  across 
the  country.  Further,  a  broad  classification  of  
investors  namely,  Level1  –  Basic  (first  time  investor); 
Level2  –  Intermediate  (those  who  have  invested,  but 
not  very  often)  and  Level3  –  Sophisticated  (learned 
investors)  has  been  done  and  material  developed 
accordingly. 

IV.  Revision of  Delegation of  Power 

The consultant recommended that there should 
be  a  revision  of   the  existing  delegation  of   powers  in 
SEBI  and  broadly  recommended  that  there  should  be 
further  downward  delegation  of   powers.  Based  on 
the  experience  of   administering  the  earlier  structure 
of   delegation  of   powers  and  taking  into  account  the 

VI.  Revamping Performance Appraisal System

An  overhaul  of   the  performance  management 
system  for  staff   members  has  been  undertaken. 
Under this, the performance review process has been 
redesigned  to 
include  normalisation  and  ensure 
discipline  of   the  performance  management  process 
through an annual cycle.

VII.  Usage 

of  

Common 

Taxonomy 

of  

Designations Across Streams

To  ensure  consistency  in  taxonomy  of   grades 
across all streams it has been decided to use common 
designations  across  all  streams  (General,  Legal, 
Research, IT, Engineering, Official Language, Protocol 
& Liaison and Communications).

VIII.  Realignment of  Reporting Structure

In  order  to  develop  better  team  management 
and  team  building  skills  and  improving  the  average 
management  span,  the  reporting  structure  has 
been  realigned.  Accordingly,  reporting  of   assistant 
managers  has  been  realigned  to  assistant  general 
managers.

Further,  to  drive 

implementation  of   other 
recommendations  involving  multiple  departments, 
several task forces have been set up: (i) Policy Design 
Task  Force  on  Regulatory  Approach;  (ii)  Policy 
Design Task Force on Omnibus Licensing; and (iii) IT 
Strategy and Governance Task Force.

To  ensure  alignment  with  domestic  peers 
and  other  enforcement  agencies,  the  designation 
of   an  officer  in  charge  of   a  regional  office  has  been 
redefined as ‘Regional Director’.

VII.  Usage  of   Common  Taxonomy  of   Grades 

Across All Streams

to  encourage 

SEBI  always  endeavours 

its 
employees to pursue higher studies and upgrade their 
skills.  As  such,  collaborations  have  been  done  with 
the CFA Institute, USA, whereby the CFA programme 
is  offered  at  concessional  rates  to  employees;  27 
enrolments were made for the CFA course during the 
financial year under this collaboration.

SEBI  also  collaborated  with  the  Japan-IMF 
Scholarship  Programme  for  Asia  (JISPA)  and  the 
Temasek  Regional  Regulators  Scholarship  (TRRS) 
Programme,  wherein  suitable  staff   members  get  an 
opportunity  to  study  at  renowned  global  institutes 
for  various  academic  programmes  in  the  field  of  
economics, finance, governance and public policy. 

X.  Training and Development

In  order  to  enhance  and  widen  the  knowledge 
base  and  perspective  as  well  as  ‘soft  skills’  (including 
motivation and communication skills), staff  members 
across  all  grades  have  been  nominated  for  various 
behavioural  and  functional  training  programmes, 
both domestic and foreign. Several training initiatives 
were  undertaken  during  the  year  to  enhance  the 
skills  and  efficiencies  of   staff   members,  brief   details 
of  which are: 

a.  Domestic Trainings/Workshops

Human  resources 

in  organisations  require 
inputs  on  motivation  and  behavioural  attributes  so 
that  they  behave  positively  in  a  team  and  contribute 
to  organisational  success.  Officers  in  senior  positions 
require  sound  soft  skills  as  they  have  to  deal  with 
various  stakeholders  and  are  involved  in  decision 
making.  It  is  in  this  background  that  SEBI  organised 
two-day  outbound  workshops  on 
‘Motivation, 
Team  Building  and  Leadership’  for  assistant  general 
managers  (AGMs);246  AGMs  participated  in  seven 
batches  of   such  behavioural  workshops  organised 
during 2014-15. 

In  addition,  751  nominations  were  made  for 
various  other  domestic  training  programmes  during 
the year. Some of  the workshop/training programmes 
arranged/conducted  for  staff   members  during  the 
financial year are:

LOCAL OFFICES
The  SEBI  Board  in  its  meeting  held  on  March 
25,  2011  had  suggested  that  SEBI  should  explore 
the  scope  of   strengthening  its  regional  offices  and 
open  local  offices  in  various  state  capitals  for  the 
development  of   a  pan-India  securities  market.  It  was 
felt  that  physical  proximity  of   a  SEBI  office  to  investors 
and 
intermediaries  would  promote  deepening  and 
broadening  of   securities  markets.  The  proposal  was 
approved  by  the  board  on  July  28,  2011  and  the 
implementation of  the decision to open local offices was 
done in phases, with Phase I starting from 2011-12.
