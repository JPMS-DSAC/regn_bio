I  Introduction 

I.1  Financial  inclusion  is  increasingly  being  recognized  as  a  key  driver  of  economic  growth 
and poverty alleviation the world over. Access to formal finance can boost job creation, reduce 
vulnerability to economic shocks and increase investments in human capital. Without adequate 
access to formal financial services, individuals and firms need to rely on their own limited resources 
or  rely  on  costly  informal  sources  of  finance  to  meet  their  financial  needs  and  pursue  growth 
opportunities. At a macro level, greater financial inclusion can support sustainable and inclusive 
socio-economic  growth  for  all.

I.2  There  has  been  a  growing  evidence  on  how  financial  inclusion  has  a  multiplier  effect  in 
boosting overall economic output, reducing poverty and income inequality at the national level. 
Financial inclusion of women is particularly important for gender equality and women’s economic 
empowerment. With greater control over their financial lives, women can help themselves and their 
families to come out of poverty; reduce their risk of falling into poverty; eliminate their exploitation 
from the informal sector; and increase their ability to fully engage in measurable and productive 
economic  activities.  An  inclusive  financial  system  supports  stability,  integrity  and  equitable 
growth. Therefore, financial exclusion because of several barriers like physical, socio-cultural and 
psychological, warrants attention from the policy makers. Some of the key reasons resulting in 
involuntary  exclusion  are:

Financial Inclusion and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 

I.3 
It  is  also  noteworthy  to  state  that,  seven1  of  the  seventeen  United  Nations  Sustainable 
Development  Goals  (SDG)  of  2030  view  financial  inclusion  as  a  key  enabler  for  achieving 
sustainable  development  worldwide  by  improving  the  quality  of  lives  of  poor  and  marginalized 
sections  of  the  society.  (Home-  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  2018)

Defining Financial Inclusion in the Indian Context

I.4  Financial inclusion has been defined as “the process of ensuring access to financial services, 
timely and adequate credit for vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low-income groups 
at  an  affordable  cost”.  (Committee  on  Financial  Inclusion  -  Chairman:  Dr  C  Rangarajan,  RBI, 
2008).  The  Committee  on  Medium-Term  Path  to  Financial  Inclusion  (Chairman:  Shri  Deepak 
Mohanty, RBI, 2015) has set the vision for financial inclusion as, “convenient access to a basket 
of  basic  formal  financial  products  and  services  that  should  include  savings,  remittance,  credit, 
government-supported insurance and pension products to small and marginal farmers and low-
income households at reasonable cost with adequate protection progressively supplemented by 
social cash transfers, besides increasing the access of small and marginal enterprises to formal 
finance with a greater reliance on technology to cut costs and improve service delivery, ….” 

Financial Inclusion Strategy - Rationale

I.5  While  a  lot  of  efforts  have  been  undertaken  to  increase  financial  inclusion  in  the  country 
(See Chapter III- Status of Financial Inclusion in India) a lot of steps are further needed to ensure 
adequate access to financial services and usage of these services by various segments of under-
served and un-served population in India, so far. Anchored in the country’s development priorities, 
the  NSFI  2019-2024  seeks  to  address  the  inherent  barriers  of  access  to  a  gamut  of  financial 
products  and  services.  An  inclusive  financial  system  (ably  supported  through  sound  financial 
inclusion policies, focus on financial education and customer protection) is not only pro-growth 
but  also  pro-poor  with  the  potential  to  reduce  income  inequality  and  poverty,  promote  social 
cohesion and shared economic development. Financial exclusion, on the other hand, leaves the 
disadvantaged and low- income segments of society with no choice other than informal options, 
making them vulnerable to financial distress, debt, and poverty.

1  Eliminating extreme poverty; Reducing hunger and promoting food security; achieving good health and well-being, 
promoting  gender  equality;  promoting  sustained,  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  full  and  productive 
employment and decent work; building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and 
foster  innovation;  reduce  income  inequality  within  and  among  countries.

I.6  The  National  Strategy  for  Financial  Inclusion  for  India  2019-2024  has  been  prepared  by 
RBI under the aegis of the Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee and is based on the inputs 
and  suggestions  from  Government  of  India,  other  Financial  Sector  Regulators  viz.,  Securities 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) 
and  Pension  Fund  Regulatory  and  Development  Authority  of  India  (PFRDA).  This  document 
also reflects various outcomes from wide-ranging consultation held with a range of stakeholders 
and market players, including National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), 
National  Payments  Corporation  of  India  (NPCI),  Commercial  Banks  and  Corporate  Business 
Correspondents etc. It includes an analysis of the status and constraints in financial inclusion in 
India, specific financial inclusion goals, strategy to reach the goals and the mechanism to measure 
progress.

Introduction

II Cross Country Analysis and Lessons

II.1  With  increased  recognition  globally  and  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals 
(SDGs) emphasising financial inclusion as a key enabler for achieving sustainable development 
worldwide, countries across the globe are developing suitable strategies and policies to increase 
access and usage of formal financial services. Achieving Universal Financial Access by 2020 (UFA 
2020) has been one of the key developmental agenda of the World Bank which aims to provide 
adults who currently aren’t part of the formal financial system, with access to a transaction account 
to store money, send and receive payments to manage their financial lives. (Universal Financial 
Access  2020,  2018)  To  achieve  this  ambitious  goal,  the  World  Bank  Group  has  committed  to 
enable one billion people to gain access to a transaction account through targeted interventions. 
It  also  works  with  countries  to  strengthen  the  following  key  building  blocks:  public  and  private 
sector  commitment,  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  and  bolstering  financial  and  ICT 
infrastructure,  and  globally,  through  engagement  with  standard-setting  bodies  to  come  up  with 
recommendations and guidelines that will advance access to transaction accounts. 

II.2  Each  country’s  strategy  and  progress  towards  financial  inclusion  is  unique  because  of 
significant variations in the Government’s priorities, institutional capacity to implement reforms, 
evolution of financial markets, payments infrastructure, financial capability of people, and cultural 
beliefs that drive financial behaviour. Therefore, a mere review of various countries’ financial inclusion 
policies without understanding their socio-economic background, political system, and culture and 
beliefs,  will  not  be  sufficient  to  draw  insights  for  designing  and  developing  our  own  Financial 
Inclusion strategy. It would nevertheless still be meaningful to look into and draw inferences based 
on the experiences and feedback of the financial inclusion policies of other countries. Similar to 
National Identity System put in place by various countries, India has also introduced Aadhaar in 
2009. Recognizing the importance of financial education, the current Strategy considers Financial 
Education as one of the important pillars of the NSFI as visualized by other countries.

II.3  Globally, the adoption of a formal National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) has accelerated 
significantly in the past decade. By mid-2018, more than 35 countries, including Brazil, China, 
Indonesia, Peru and Nigeria have launched a NFIS and another 25 countries are in the process 
of developing a strategy. Further, several countries have also updated their original NFIS (World 
Bank  Group,  2018).  Some  of  the  important  commonalities  observed  in  the  strategies  of  a  few 
countries have been reviewed and are summarised below.

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

Leadership

II.4  A  strong  leadership  (visionary  or  charismatic)  is  important  to  achieve  financial  inclusion 
goals. Financial inclusion policies require time to realize their full potential. Therefore, having a 
long-term  vision  and  a  well-coordinated  approach  is  essential. 

Target Based Approach

II.5  Financial  inclusion  policies  are  generally  targeted  towards  specific  sectors  like  MSME, 
Agriculture or specific regions like Aspirational Districts. It is important to develop sector specific 
action  plans  and  monitor  targets  and  review  the  progress. 

Regulatory Framework

II.6  There should be a strong regulatory and legal framework aimed at protecting the interests 
of  the  customers,  promoting  fair  practices  and  curbing  market  manipulations.  Further,  the 
regulations should have adequate space to allow flexibility and openness for innovations. This 
calls for incorporating a Test and Learn Approach in the form of Regulatory Sandboxes along with 
encouraging  Pilot  projects  to  reach  long  term  viability  and  mitigate  losses. 

Market Development

II.7  Market development and deepening thereof, through various regulatory initiatives for catering 
to the needs of the target groups is vital. While a Universal Banking system can continue to provide 
services to existing clientele, there may also be a case for permitting differentiated entities that 
leverage technology to provide low cost, high volume services. The process of market development 
can be in the form of expansion of rural networks and access points; allowing preferential prudential 
rules  to  encourage  lending  to  rural  areas  and  setting  up  special  sub-branches  in  rural  areas; 
digitising large-scale payment streams like pension, insurance, and subsidies for rural households 
etc. as also proliferation of new institutions, products and services.

Strengthening Infrastructure

II.8  Development of an ecosystem with requisite infrastructure, including credit infrastructure, 
receipt  and  payment  infrastructure  etc.,  are  essential.  Providing  a  national  level  identification, 
setting up a credit registry database, creation of open and inclusive payment systems are some 
of the key steps in this direction. Putting in place a suitable framework for using national level 
identification  number  for  cashless  and  paperless  financial  transactions,  based  on  customer 
consent can simplify customer on-boarding and also ease in operations. Further, this facilitates a 
large volume of Government to Person (G2P) transactions and vice-versa (P2G), directly through

bank accounts. Development of robust payments infrastructure coupled with regulations can foster 
competition and orderly growth which result in more customer centric products, increased choices 
and  convenience.  Developing  a  robust  credit  database  also  helps  lenders  to  take  an  informed 
decision on the credit proposals. 

Last Mile Delivery

II.9  Focus on Last Mile Delivery has been one of the major thrust areas in various countries. 
Since the typical rural customer would not be willing to forego his/ her day’s wage to visit a financial 
service provider, it is important that distance and resulting time taken to visit the service provider 
does not act as a deterrent. To achieve this, various countries have come up with policies to extend 
the  receipt  infrastructure  including  permitting  formal  financial  institutions  to  engage  services  of 
agents  and  Business  Correspondents  (BCs).  While  the  Business  Correspondents  have  been 
able to reach out to the last mile customer, the issue of customer protection, providing suitable 
products, increasing financial awareness, having a proactive oversight over the activities of the 
agents and sustainability of the agent/BC network are some of the areas which now require policy 
interventions. 

Innovation and Technology

II.10  Innovation and Technology in the overall landscape have resulted in rise of fin-tech entities 
which leverage technology to offer financial services. While these new entities have the potential 
to increase competition and provide the customer with greater choice through suitable products 
and  easier  processes,  they  may  also  exclude  those  customers  who  do  not  have  the  basic 
infrastructure like internet connectivity and access to smart phones. It is therefore imperative to 
have a balance between technology and agents to provide customers with adequate handholding. 
Since technology evolves very rapidly, oversight on the technology led institutions is of utmost 
importance and their regulation needs constant upgradation. 

Financial Literacy and Awareness

II.11  Financial literacy continues to gather global attention as it is increasingly being realised that 
only an informed customer will be able to take proper financial decisions. Financial literacy enables 
a customer to have necessary awareness about the available products, ability to choose the right 
product and available mechanism for grievance redressal. Emphasis is now on to increase the 
financial awareness among various vulnerable groups in the society viz., women, youth, children, 
elderly, small entrepreneurs, etc. who require handholding. Focus has been on the development 
of various scientific tools and design approaches combining concept literacy with process literacy. 
With more and more usage of digital mode of transactions, financial literacy in the realm of digital 
financial services has assumed importance.

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

Consumer Protection

II.12  Considering that the new entrants to the financial system are likely to be more vulnerable, 
customer  protection  and  grievance  redressal  has  become  an  important  pillar  for  furthering 
sustainable  financial  inclusion.  This  is  further  accentuated  by  the  fact  that  there  has  been  a 
steep increase in access to digital financial services which calls for a robust customer protection 
framework.  Some  of  the  measures  undertaken  include  increased  market  monitoring,  creation 
of a strong enforcement machinery to redress customer grievances and improved coordination 
between the financial sector supervisors, particularly relating to cross-product and cross-market 
issues. 

Monitoring and Evaluation

II.13  Periodic monitoring and evaluation of the progress made in financial inclusion sphere can 
help in identifying the bottlenecks and also initiate corrective measures. Countries and various 
institutions are recognizing the need for reliable financial inclusion data, to get an overview on 
parameters relating to access, usage, and quality of financial services rendered. 

II.14  Financial inclusion is a much-cherished policy objective for India and its economic policy 
has always been driven by an underlying intent of a sustainable and inclusive growth. The next 
chapter summarises the initiatives undertaken in India in the financial inclusion domain and our 
achievements especially in the light of the foregoing learnings. The chapter also highlights some 
of the critical challenges that act as barriers for financial inclusion.

III Status of Financial Inclusion in India

III.1  The  policy  makers  in  India  have  been  aware  of  the  implications  of  poverty  for  financial 
stability and have continually endeavoured to ensure that poverty is tackled in all its manifestations 
and that the benefits of economic growth reaches the poor and excluded sections of the society. 

III.2 
India began its financial inclusion journey as early as in 1956 with the nationalisation of 
Life Insurance companies. This was followed by nationalisation of banks in 1969 and 1980. The 
general insurance companies were nationalised in 1972. A review of the status of financial inclusion 
in India indicates that a host of initiatives have been undertaken over the years in the financial 
inclusion  domain.

III.3 
India has also been actively engaged with other countries and multilateral fora viz. Global 
Partnership  for  Financial  Inclusion  (GPFI)  and  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development (OECD). India is one of the co-chairs along with Indonesia and United Kingdom in 
the GPFI Subgroup on Regulation and Standard Setting Bodies. India has been actively involved 
in preparation of relevant research and policy guides in Digitalisation, Regulation and Financial 
Inclusion  that  are  published  by  GPFI  from  time  to  time.  Further,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  is 
currently a member of four working groups viz. Standards, Implementation and Evaluation, Digital 
Financial Literacy, Financial Education for MSMEs and Core Competencies for Financial Literacy 
under the International Network for Financial Education (INFE), set up under OECD. Keeping in 
view the various developments in the global front, India has also initiated the process of preparing 
its  National  Strategy  for  Financial  Inclusion  (NSFI)  in  June  2017  under  the  aegis  of  Financial 
Inclusion Advisory Committee (FIAC). The document has been formulated, based on the feedback 
received from various stakeholders viz., Department of Financial Services (DFS), and Department 
of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance (MoF), Govt of India, RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, PFRDA, 
NABARD and NPCI. 

Leadership

III.4  A strong leadership (either a visionary or charismatic) is a prerequisite to drive financial 
inclusion in a mission mode. Indian policy making has shown unswerving resolve for inclusive 
growth which culminated in the National Mission for Financial Inclusion, namely the Pradhan Mantri 
Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). Launched in August 2014, it was a watershed in the financial inclusion 
movement in the country. The programme leverages on the existing large banking network and 
technological  innovations  to  provide  every  household  with  access  to  basic  financial  services, 
thereby bridging the gap in the coverage of banking facilities.

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

III.5  Under PMJDY, 34.01 crore2 accounts have been opened with deposits amounting to ₹89257 
crore upto January 30, 2019 within a short span of five years. The achievement of opening the 
largest number of accounts (1,80,96,130 nos.) under PMJDY, in one week has found a place in 
the Guinness Book of World Records. A bouquet of products viz., overdraft of ₹10,000, accidental 
death cum disability insurance cover, term-life cover and old age pension have been made available 
under PMJDY to the account holders. The focus has also shifted from opening account for “every 
household to every adult”. 

III.6  Under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) a renewable one- year accidental 
death cum disability cover of ₹2 lakhs is offered to all subscribing bank account holders in the 
age group of 18 to 70 years for a premium as low as ₹12/- per annum per subscriber. Another 
insurance product with one-year term life cover of ₹2 lakhs under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti 
Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is made available to all subscribing bank account holders in the age group 
of 18 to 50 years, for a premium of ₹330/- per annum per subscriber. 

III.7  To  take  care  of  the  financial  needs  in  old  age,  a  pension  product  named  Atal  Pension 
Yojana (APY) guaranteed by the Government of India has also been made available to the newly 
included bank account holders. Under APY, a subscriber (in the age group of 18 to 40 years) will 
receive fixed monthly pension in the range of ₹1,000 to ₹5,000 after completing 60 years of age, 
depending on the contributions made by the subscriber. 

Target based approach for specific sectors / regions

A.  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) 

III.8  MSMEs  are  considered  the  engines  of  growth  of  the  Indian  economy.  They  contribute 
nearly 31% to India’s GDP, 45% to exports and provide employment opportunities to more than 
11.1  crore  skilled  and  semi-skilled  people.  There  are  approximately  6.33  crore  MSMEs  in  the 
country. A number of initiatives have been undertaken for facilitating credit off take in this sector. 
In  order  to  bring  about  an  attitudinal  change  in  the  mindset  of  the  bankers  while  dealing  with 
entrepreneurs from MSME sector, a special capacity building programme named ‘National Mission 
for  Capacity  Building  of  Bankers  for  financing  MSME  Sector’  (NAMCABS)  was  put  in  place  to 
familiarise bankers with the entire gamut of credit related issues of the MSME sector. 

III.9  A  Certified  Credit  Counsellors  (CCC)  scheme  was  launched  for  creating  a  structured 
mechanism  to  assist  the  entrepreneurs  in  preparing  financial  plans  and  project  reports  in  a 
professional  manner,  thus  facilitating  the  banks  to  make  informed  credit  decisions.

Web portals like the ‘Udyami Mitra’ and ‘psbloanin59minutes’ have also been launched to provide 
easy access to credit. Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms have been set up 
to address the problem of delayed payments to MSMEs. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)3, 
a scheme to finance small business enterprises has been launched in April 2015 whereby lending 
institutions would finance to micro entrepreneurs up to ₹10 lakh. Interest subvention scheme has 
been launched for MSMEs to reduce cost of borrowings. 

B.  Agriculture

III.10  India’s agrarian economy is the source of around 15 percent of GDP, 11 per cent of exports 
and  provides  livelihood  to  about  half  of  India’s  population.  The  importance  of  the  sector  from 
a  macroeconomic  perspective  is  also  reflected  in  a  significant  flow  of  bank  credit  to  finance 
agricultural  and  allied  activities  relative  to  other  sectors  of  the  economy. 

III.11  To give a thrust to agriculture financing from the formal sector, banks have been mandated 
specific targets under priority sector scheme. Currently the target for agriculture lending under 
priority sector for all domestic scheduled commercial banks and foreign banks having more than 
20 branches is 18 per cent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent Amount of 
Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEAOBE), whichever is higher. Within the 18 per cent target for 
agriculture, a sub-target of 8 percent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent Amount of Off-Balance Sheet 
Exposure, whichever is higher is prescribed for Small and Marginal Farmers. The banks have been 
advised to extend collateral free loans to small and marginal farmers upto ₹1.6 lakh. To provide 
adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window to the farmers 
for their cultivation & other needs an innovative product viz., Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) 
was introduced in August 1998 as a revolving cash credit for ease of access and delivery. The 
scheme covers tenant farmers, oral lessees and share croppers and has now been extended to 
cover animal husbandry and fisheries. The scheme provides for sanction of the limit for 5 years 
with simplified renewal every year. 

C.  Aspirational Districts

III.12  In order to address regional disparity in inter-state and inter-district variations in development, 
‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme was launched in January 2018. This initiative 
focuses on the strengths of each aspirational district which has been identified by a team of Senior 
Government officials through analysis of the district’s performance on a composite index of key 
data  sets  that  included  deprivation  enumerated  under  the  Socio-Economic  Caste  Census,  key 
health and education sector performance and state of basic infrastructure. Under this programme, 
a set of attainable outcomes for immediate improvement have been identified while measuring 

3  See https://www.mudra.org.in/

10  

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

progress and ranking the selected districts on the basis of their performance. This programme 
focuses on expeditiously transforming 117 identified districts across 28 states and driven primarily 
by the State Governments. This initiative focuses closely on improving people’s ability to participate 
fully in the rapidly growing economy. The baseline ranking for the Aspirational Districts is based 
on 49 indicators across five sectors that include health and nutrition (30% weightage) through 13 
indicators, education (30%) through 8 indicators, agriculture and water resources (20%) through 
10  indicators,  financial  inclusion  and  skill  development  (10%)  through  10  indicators,  and  basic 
infrastructure (10%) through 7 indicators. 

Regulatory Framework

(i)  Banking

III.13  To  protect  the  interest  of  the  customers,  promote  fair  business  processes  and  prevent 
unhealthy practices by the market players, supporting regulatory and legal framework has been 
put in place. 

III.14  RBI has adopted a bank-led model to deepen financial inclusion. The banks were mandated 
to  open  branches  nationwide  especially  in  underbanked  pockets  which  led  to  a  considerable 
increase  in  bank  branches  and  later Automated  Teller  Machines  (ATMs)  in  the  1990s  to  early 
2000. The banks were advised to draw up a roadmap for having banking outlets in villages with 
population more than 2000 (in 2009) and less than 2000 (in 2012). Subsequently the banks were 
advised to open brick and mortar branches in villages with population more than 5000. The banks 
were also advised to prepare Financial Inclusion Plans for a period of three years comprising key 
parameters viz., modes of delivery of financial services, access to Basic Savings Bank Deposit 
Accounts (BSBDAs) and transactions through the BC Channel. 

III.15  To strengthen financial inclusion, RBI has relaxed the branch authorisation guidelines in 
2017 wherein fixed-point Business Correspondent outlets serving for more than 4 hours a day 
and five days a week are treated on par with physical brick and mortar branches. An exclusive 
fund viz., Financial Inclusion Fund (FIF) has been created to support adoption of technology and 
capacity building with an initial corpus of ₹2000 crore. 

III.16  To  widen  financial  inclusion,  RBI  has  issued  differentiated  banking  license  viz.,  Small 
Finance Banks (SFBs) and Payments Banks in 2015. The objective of setting up of SFBs was to 
further financial inclusion by provision of a savings vehicle and supply of credit to small business 
units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and other unorganized sector entities, 
through high technology-low cost operations. Payments Banks have been set up to provide small 
savings  accounts  and  payments/remittance  services  to  migrant  labour  workforce,  low  income 
households, small businesses and other unorganised sector entities / other users. 

Status of Financial Inclusion in India 

11

III.17  In  order  to  strengthen  the  BC  model  of  delivery  and  help  prospective  users  to  identify 
BC  having  good  service  track  record,  the  BC  Registry  has  been  launched  under  the  aegis  of 
Indian Banks’ Association (IBA). For capacity building and to ensure certain minimum standards 
of service rendered by the BCs, a BC Certification course through Indian Institute of Banking and 
Finance  (IIBF)  has  also  been  introduced.

(ii)  Insurance

III.18  In addition to the initiatives / insurance products mentioned above, some of the other key 
initiatives undertaken in insurance sector4 include increasing awareness among citizens on the 
benefits and appropriateness of insurance and enabling greater availability of insurance products 
(including micro-insurance) through increasing the number of delivery channels including corporate 
agents and Common Service Centers. 

III.19  Further,  leveraging  on  technology,  Web  Aggregators  and  Insurance  Repositories  have 
been set up, which facilitate access and storage of insurance policy details and enable issuance 
of  insurance  policies  in  an  electronic  form. 

III.20  For the protection of interests of policy holders and also in building their confidence in the 
system, the institution of Insurance Ombudsman has been created. This will ensure quick disposal 
of the grievances of the insured customers and also mitigate their problems involved in redressal 
of their grievances. To safeguard the interests of policyholders and customers catered to by the 
insurance companies / intermediaries under Health Insurance segment, separate guidelines have 
been issued.

(iii)  Pension

III.21  To regulate the National Pension System (NPS) and any other pension scheme not regulated 
by  any  other  enactment,  the  Pension  Fund  Regulatory  and  Development  Authority  (PFRDA)5 
was  set  up  under  the  PFRDA Act,  2013.  Besides  the  initiatives  /  pension  products  mentioned 
above, some of the other key initiatives undertaken in the pension sector include expansion of 
NPS  through  increasing  the  channels  of  distribution,  developing  capacity  of  the  officials  of  its 
intermediaries and increasing awareness on old age income security and retirement planning. It 
has also leveraged on technology to drive efficiencies & improve ease of access to NPS for the 
subscribers  and  service  providers.

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

Market Development

III.22  While the current model of Universal banking may continue to provide financial services 
to  the  existing  clientele  there  has  been  a  need  for  differentiated  banking  to  cater  to  various 
niche  segments. Accordingly,  RBI  has  issued  differentiated  banking  license  for  Small  Finance 
Banks (SFBs) and Payments Banks in 2015. To increase access points and rural network, RBI 
has rationalised the branch authorisation guidelines in 2017. To ensure accurate targeting of the 
beneficiaries, de-duplication and reduction of fraud and leakage, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)6 
has started on 1st January 2013. The first phase of DBT had been introduced in 43 districts and 
subsequently extended to 78 more districts under 27 schemes pertaining to scholarships, women, 
child  and  labour  welfare.  DBT  has  been  further  extended  across  the  country  since  December 
2014. 7 new scholarship schemes and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Act  (MGNREGA)  has  been  brought  under  DBT  in  300  identified  districts  with  higher Aadhaar 
enrolment.

III.23  Jan Dhan Accounts, Aadhaar biometric ID and Mobile (JAM) are enablers which provide a 
unique opportunity to implement DBT in all welfare schemes across the country including States 
&  UTs.  The  DBT  has  enabled  efficiency,  effectiveness,  transparency  and  accountability  in  all 
Government  to  Persons  (G2P)  transfers.

Strengthening Infrastructure

III.24  To operate and introduce any payment system related entity / product, authorisation from 
RBI under The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 is essential. While RBI operates the 
large-value payment system (RTGS) and retail payment systems (NEFT), other retail payment 
system products (CTS, AEPS, NACH, UPI, IMPS etc.) are operated by National Payments Council 
of India (NPCI). With the popularisation of these retail payment system products, digital transactions 
have increased manifold. 

III.25  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)7 has been created with the objective to 
issue Unique Identification numbers (UID), named as “Aadhaar”, linked to biometric identification, 
to all residents of India to eliminate duplicate and fake identities. The UIDAI has so far issued more 
than 120 crore  Aadhaar numbers to the residents of India and has enabled use of technology 
to implement large-scale real-time Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs) to bank accounts in order to 
improve economic lives of India’s poor beneficiaries.

III.26  A Public Credit Registry (PCR) would enable better and faster underwriting standards for 
credit assessment and pricing by banks; risk-based, dynamic and counter-cyclical provisioning at 
banks; supervision and early intervention by regulators; and help in restructuring stressed assets 
effectively. 

III.27  To  solve  the  problem  of  delayed  payment  to  MSMEs,  RBI  had  laid  down  guidelines  for 
operationalisation of Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS)8. TReDS was put in place to 
facilitate Electronic Bill Factoring Exchanges, which could electronically accept and auction MSME 
bills  so  that  MSMEs  could  realize  their  of  receivables  without  delay.  Government  of  India  has 
mandated that all companies with a turnover of more than ₹50 crore have to compulsorily register 
under TReDS. 

Last Mile Delivery

III.28  To bridge the gap in the last mile connectivity, RBI permitted banks to engage Business 
Correspondents  /  Business  Facilitators  (2006).  This  has  resulted  in  cost  effective  delivery  of 
services through ICT based solutions. Another step to deepen financial inclusion in the country 
has been the launching of India Post Payments Bank (IPPB)9 in September 2018. IPPB is also 
leveraging the vast network of Department of Posts with 1.55 lakh Post Offices, more than 3 lakh 
postmen and Grameen Dak Sewaks to further scale up financial inclusion initiatives in the country. 

Financial Literacy and Awareness

III.29  In order to spread financial education among the populace in the country, RBI has issued 
guidelines  for  financial  literacy  through  Financial  Literacy  Centres  (FLCs)  and  rural  branches 
of banks. It has also advised banks to observe a “Financial Literacy Week” across the country 
simultaneously every year. Centres for Financial Literacy (CFLs) have been set up at block level, 
involving community participation in association with banks to spread financial literacy. Work is 
under progress to incorporate financial education in school curriculum in association with State 
Governments and also National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT). Further, 
National Centre for Financial Education (NCFE) has been set up by the financial sector regulators 
viz.,  RBI,  SEBI,  IRDAI  and  PFRDA  as  a  Section  (8)  Company  under  Companies Act,  2013  to 
undertake co-ordinated efforts in disseminating basic financial literacy.

Consumer Protection

III.30  To strengthen the grievance redressal system, among other measures, suitable mechanisms 
in the form of Ombudsman Scheme by RBI, IRDAI and PFRDA have been put in place. Further, 
SEBI has also instituted a SEBI Complaints Redressal System (SCORES). 

Challenges 

III.31  Despite  the  various  measures  that  have  been  undertaken  by  various  stakeholders  in 
strengthening financial inclusion in the country, there are still critical gaps existing in the usage 
of financial services that require attention of policy makers through necessary co-ordination and 
effective  monitoring. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Inadequate  Infrastructure:  Limited  physical  infrastructure,  limited  transport  facility, 
inadequately trained staff etc., in parts of rural hinterland and far flung areas of the Himalayan 
and North East regions create a barrier to the customer while accessing financial services. 

Poor  Connectivity:  With  technology  becoming  an  important  enabler  to  access  financial 
services, certain regions in the country that have poor connectivity tend to be left behind in 
ensuring access to financial services thereby creating a digital divide. Technology could be 
the best bridge between the financial service provider and the last mile customer. Fintech 
companies can be one of the best solutions to address this issue. The key challenge that 
needs to be resolved would be improving tele and internet connectivity in the rural hinterland 
and achieving connectivity across the country.

Convenience and Relevance: The protracted and complicated procedures act as a deterrent 
while on-boarding customers. This difficulty is further increased when the products are not 
easy to understand, complex and do not meet the requirements of the customers such as 
those receiving erratic and uncertain cash flows from their occupation. 

Socio-Cultural Barriers: Prevalence of certain value system and beliefs in some sections 
of  the  population  results  in  lack  of  favourable  attitude  towards  formal  financial  services. 
There are still certain pockets wherein women do not have the freedom and choice to access 
financial services because of cultural barriers. 

Product Usage:  While  the  mission-based  approach  to  financial  inclusion  has  resulted  in 
increasing access to basic financial services including micro insurance and pension, there 
is a need to increase the usage of these accounts to help customers achieve benefits of 
relevant financial services and help the service providers to achieve the necessary scale 
and sustainability. This can be undertaken through increasing economic activities like skill 
development and livelihood creation, digitising Government transfers by strengthening the 

Status of Financial Inclusion in India 

15

digital transactions’ eco-system, enhancing acceptance infrastructure, enhancing financial 
literacy and having in place a robust customer protection framework. 

6. 

Payment Infrastructure: Currently, majority of the retail payment products viz., CTS, AEPS, 
NACH, UPI, IMPS etc. are operated by National Payments Council of India (NPCI), a Section 
(8) Company promoted by a group of public, private and foreign banks. There is a need to 
have more market players to promote innovation & competition and to minimize concentration 
risk in the retail payment system from a financial stability perspective.

Leveraging technology and adopting a multi-stakeholder approach for sustainable  

financial inclusion

To achieve the vision of ensuring access to an array of basic formal financial services, a set of 
guiding objectives have been formulated with special relevance in the Indian context. This chapter 
elaborates on each of the objectives, lays down action plans and milestones and suggests broad 
recommendations to achieve the same. 

Strategic Objectives 

17

IV.1  Universal Access to Financial Services
Every village to have access to a formal financial service provider within a reasonable distance 
of 5 KM radius. The customers may be on boarded through an easy and hassle-free digital 
process and processes should be geared towards a less-paper ecosystem. 

Providing Universal Access to Financial Services by expanding the outreach is the key foundation 
for a successful financial inclusion strategy. Over the last five years, especially with the launch of 
the PMJDY in 2014, the total number of access points have increased in the country. However, 
there are a few parts in the country including difficult to reach terrain in the North Eastern Region, 
Left Wing Extremists affected districts and the Aspirational Districts in the country wherein the 
number of access points need to be increased to improve coverage. 

Recommendation

In  order  to  achieve  the  objective  of  providing  universal  access  to  financial  services, 
it  is  important  to  provide  a  robust  and  efficient  digital  network  infrastructure  to  all  the 
financial service outlets / touch points for seamless delivery of the financial services. It is 
also recommended to extend the digital financial infrastructure to co-operative banks and 
other specialised banks (Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks) as well as other non-bank 
entities such as Fertilizer Shops, Office of the Local Government bodies / Panchayats, Fair 
Price Shops, Common Service Centres, Educational Institutions etc. to promote efficiency 
and  transparency  in  the  services  offered  to  customers.  Banks  may  endeavour  to  sort 
out issues relating to remuneration, need for furnishing cash-based collaterals and cash 
retention limits, etc. to strengthen the BC network.

Action Plan and Milestones

	 � 

	 � 

	 � 

Increasing  outreach  of  banking  outlets  of  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks  /Payments 
Banks/ Small Finance Banks, to provide banking access to every village within a 5 KM 
radius/  hamlet  of  500  households  in  hilly  areas  by  March  2020. 

Strengthen eco-system for various modes of digital financial services in all the Tier-II 
to Tier VI centres to create the necessary infrastructure to move towards a less cash 
society  by  March  2022. 

Leverage  on  the  developments  in  fin-tech  space  to  encourage  financial  service 
providers to adopt innovative approaches for strengthening outreach through virtual 
modes  including  mobile  apps  so  that  every  adult  has  access  to  a  financial  service 
provider  through  a  mobile  device  by  March  2024. 

	 �  Move towards an increasingly digital and consent-based architecture for customer on-

boarding  by  March  2024.

18  

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

IV.2  Providing Basic Bouquet of Financial Services
Every adult who is willing and eligible needs to be provided with a basic bouquet of financial 
services that include a Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account, credit, a micro life and non-life 
insurance product, a pension product and a suitable investment product.

The  National  Mission  for  Financial  Inclusion,  namely  the  PMJDY  has  created  the  requisite 
infrastructure  for  providing  every  adult  with  access  to  a  basic  bouquet  of  financial  services. 
However, it is found that efforts are still needed to provide access to insurance, pension and credit 
to  the  PMJDY  account  holders.

Recommendation

The objective of providing a basic bouquet of financial services can be achieved through 
designing and developing customized financial products by banks and ensuring efficient 
delivery of the same through leveraging of Fin-tech and BC networks. It is recommended 
that banks should strive for capacity building of their BCs so that they can be utilised for 
delivery of a wider range of financial products such as life/ non-life insurance products, 
pension products, mutual funds etc. 

Action Plan and Milestones: 

	 � 

Every willing and eligible adult who has been enrolled under the PMJDY (including 
the young adults who have recently taken up employment) to be enrolled under an 
insurance  scheme  (PMJJBY,  PMSBY,  etc.),  Pension  scheme  (NPS,  APY,  etc.)  by 
March  2020.

	 �  Capacity building of all BCs either directly by the parent entity or through accredited 

institutions  by  March  2020. 

	 �  Make  the  Public  Credit  Registry  (PCR)  fully  operational  by  March  2022  so  that 
authorised financial entities can leverage on the same for assessing credit proposals 
from  all  citizens. 

Strategic Objectives 

19

IV.3  Access to Livelihood and Skill Development
The new entrant to the financial system, if eligible and willing to undergo any livelihood/ skill 
development programme, may be given the relevant information about the ongoing Government 
livelihood programmes thus helping them to augment their skills and engage in meaningful 
economic activity and improve income generation. 

Globally, it is found that sustainable livelihood generation can bring people out from the clutches of 
poverty. Through adequate coordinated and collaborative effort between the banks, Government and 
Skill Development Agencies, new entrants to financial sector may be provided requisite information 
on the ongoing skill development programmes and livelihood missions of the Government.

Recommendation

While  ensuring  access  to  livelihood  and  skill  development  requires  multi-dimensional 
efforts,  it  is  recommended  to  attain  convergence  of  objectives  of  various  employment 
generation  and  skill  development  programmes  like  National  Rural  Livelihoods  Mission 
(NRLM), National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 
(PMKVY) and other state level programmes through an integrated approach. New entrants 
to the formal financial system should be informed about such programmes and provided 
assistance  through  information  dissemination  and  coordination.

Action Plan and Milestones: 

	 � 

	 � 

All  the  relevant  details  pertaining  to  the  ongoing  skill  development  and  livelihood 
generation  programmes  through  RSETIs,  NRLM,  NULM,  PMKVY  shall  be  made 
available to the new entrants at the time of account opening. The details of the account 
holders  including  unemployed  youth,  and  women  who  are  willing  to  undergo  skill 
development and be a part of the livelihood programme may be shared to the concerned 
skill  development  centres/  livelihood  mission  and  vice  versa  by  March  2020. 

Keeping in view the importance of handholding for the newly financially included SHGs/ 
Micro entrepreneurs, a framework for a focused approach ensuring convergence of 
efforts from civil society/ banks/ NGOs to increase their awareness on financial literacy, 
managerial skills, credit and market linkages needs to be developed by National Skill 
Development Mission by March 2022. 

20  

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

IV.4  Financial Literacy and Education
Easy to understand financial literacy modules with specific target audience orientation (e.g. 
children, young adults, women, new workers/ entrepreneurs, family person, about to retire, 
retired etc. in the forms of Audio-Video/ booklets shall be made available for understanding the 
product and processes involved. It is also expected that these modules would help the new 
entrants.

On  account  of  the  financial  inclusion  efforts  made  by  Government  of  India,  RBI  and  other 
stakeholders, there has been considerable progress in increasing the number of banking outlets 
and bank accounts. Financial Literacy is an important component to enable customers to use their 
accounts to their advantage and thereby enhance their financial well-being. 

Initially from a bank led model for propagating financial literacy in the country, over the years several 
steps have been taken to make financial literacy a multi-stakeholder community led approach to 
reach out to various groups of population who require financial literacy.

Recommendation

Since  financial  literacy  and  education  are  bedrocks  of  a  vibrant  financial  system,  it  is 
important to make sustained efforts in this direction. It is recommended that the existing 
mechanism of SLBC/ DCC/ DLRC be leveraged and coordinated efforts are made by RBI, 
NABARD, NRLM Resource Persons, NGOs, PACS, Panchayats, SHGs, Farmers’ Clubs etc. 
to promote financial literacy at grassroots levels.

Action Plan and Milestones:

	 �  Develop  financial  literacy  modules  through  National  Centre  for  Financial  Education 
(NCFE) that cover financial services in the form of Audio-Video content/ booklets etc. 
These modules should be with specific target audience orientation (e.g. children, young 
adults,  women,  new  workers/  entrepreneurs,  senior  citizens  etc.)  by  March  2021. 

	 � 

Focus on process literacy along with concept literacy which empowers the customers 
to understand not only what the product is about, but also helps them how to use the 
product by using technology led Digital Kiosks, Mobile apps etc. through the strategy 
period  (2019-2024).

	 � 

Expand the reach of Centers for Financial Literacy (CFL) at every block in the country 
by  March  2024. 

Strategic Objectives 

21

IV.5  Customer Protection and Grievance Redressal
Customers shall be made aware of the recourses available for resolution of their grievances. 
About storing and sharing of customer’s biometric and demographic data, adequate safeguards 
need to be ensured to protect the customer’s Right to Privacy.

With a large number of new customers included in the ambit of formal financial services, and with 
the emerging risks from digital financial services due to the incidents of cloning, hacking, phishing, 
vishing, SMiShing, pharming, malware etc. a strong customer protection architecture is vital. Data 
Protection and Information/Cyber Security are also the new frontiers that needs to be addressed 
under the customer protection framework.

Recommendation

Since  financial  system  acts  as  a  conduit  in  channelizing  capital  from  the  savers  to  the 
entrepreneurs  who  need  it,  and  in  turn  meets  the  transactional  and  financial  needs  of 
the individuals, the importance of trust in the system remains paramount. Therefore, it is 
imperative to have a robust customer grievance redressal mechanism at different levels. 
It is recommended that internal audits should also assess the qualitative efficacy of the 
customer  grievance  redressal  mechanism  already  in  place  in  the  banking  system  viz., 
Internal  Ombudsman  Scheme. 

Action plans and Milestones: 

	 � 

Strengthening  the  Internal  Grievances  Redressal  Mechanism  of  financial  service 
providers 

timely  response  by  March  2020.

for  effectiveness  and 

	 �  Develop  a  robust  customer  grievance  portal/  mobile  app  which  acts  as  a  common 
interface  for  lodging,  tracking  and  redressal  status  of  the  grievances  pertaining  to 
financial  sector  collectively  by  all  the  stakeholders  by  March  2021. 

	 �  Operationalize  a  Common  Toll-Free  Helpline  which  offers  response  to  the  queries 
pertaining to customer grievances across banking, securities, insurance, and pension 
sectors  by  March  2022. 

	 �  Develop a portal to facilitate inter-regulatory co-ordination for redressal of customer 

grievance  by  March  2022. 

22  

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

IV.6  Effective Co-ordination
There needs to be a focused and continuous coordination between the key stakeholders viz. 
Government, the Regulators, financial service providers, Telecom Service Regulators, Skills 
Training  institutes  etc.  to  make  sure  that  the  customers  are  able  to  use  the  services  in  a 
sustained manner. The focus shall be to consolidate gains from previous efforts through focus 
on improvement of quality of service of last mile delivery viz., capacity building of Business 
Correspondents, creating payments system ecosystems at village levels to deepen the culture 
of digital finance leading to ease of use and delivery.

India  has  come  a  long  way  in  the  advancement  of  financial  inclusion  and  the  role  of  effective  
co-ordination cannot be over emphasised. Over the years, financial inclusion has moved from a 
bank led model to a multi-stakeholder led approach with the role of Telecom Service Providers and 
Fin-Tech companies emerging as important stakeholders in the pursuit of inclusive growth.

Recommendation

The  sheer  size  and  diversity  of  India  makes  it  imperative  for  policymakers  to  follow  a 
coordinated  approach  in  meeting  various  objectives  of  financial  inclusion.  While  fora 
like  SLBC/  DCC/  BLBC  are  in  place  for  coordination  among  various  stakeholders,  it 
is  recommended  that  members  of  the  same  leverage  such  platforms  to  the  maximum 
through assigning specific responsibilities to all. Further, promoting co-ordination through 
technology and adopting a decentralized approach to planning and development by creating 
separate  smaller  forums  will  help  accelerate  local  level  financial  inclusion.

Action Plans and Milestones: 

	 �  Clearly articulate the responsibilities/ expectations of each of the stakeholders at the 
grass-root level to ensure convergence of action between the Government/ Regulators/ 
financial service providers/ Civil Society etc. With the Lead Bank Scheme completing 
50 years in 2019, SLBCs may review and implement the vision, action plans and the 
milestones to be achieved during the NSFI period (2019-24). 

	 �  With  advancements  in  Geo-Spatial  Information  Technology,  a  robust  monitoring 
framework leveraging on the said technology can be developed for monitoring progress 
under financial inclusion with special emphasis given to Aspirational Districts, North 
Eastern Region and Left -Wing Extremist affected Districts. A monitoring framework 
and  a  GIS  dashboard  to  be  developed  by  March  2022. 

Strategic Objectives 

23

V Recommendations

This chapter is a broad summary of the previous chapter and lists down the key recommendations 
that are to be achieved under each of the strategic pillars for which the action plans have been 
outlined in the previous chapter. 

V.1  Universal Access to Financial Services

	 � 

	 � 

The digital infrastructure in the country needs to be expanded through better networking 
of bank branches, BC outlets, Micro ATM, PoS terminals and stable connectivity etc. 
coupled  with  electricity.  Efforts  are  needed  to  be  undertaken  through  co-ordination 
with various stakeholders to ensure creation of the requisite infrastructure for moving 
towards  completely  digital  on-boarding  of  customers. 

Encourage  adoption  and  acceptance  for  digital  payments  and  bringing  people  into 
the fold of formal financial system. In addition to the traditional banking outlets, efforts 
may also be taken to involve Co-operative Banks, Payments Banks, Small Finance 
Banks and other non-bank entities such as Fertilizer Shops, Fair Price Shops, Office 
of the Local Government Bodies, Panchayat, Common Service Centres, Educational 
institutions, etc., to promote efficiency and transparency through digital transactions.

	 � 

Some of the issues such as remuneration to the BCs, need for furnishing cash-based 
collaterals, cash management issues and lack of insurance for cash in transit which act 
as deterrents in smooth functioning of the BC network, need to be redressed by banks 
in a timely manner. 

V.2  Providing Basic Bouquet of Financial Services

	 � 

The  banks  may  undertake  periodic  review  of  their  existing  products  and  adopt  a 
customer  centric  approach  while  designing  and  developing  financial  products. 

	 � 

Ensure efficient delivery by leveraging on Fin-tech and BC network. 

	 � 

Initiate  measures  for  capacity  building  of  the  BCs  by  encouraging  and  incentivizing 
them to acquire requisite certifications and enabling them to deliver a wide range of 
financial  products. 

24  

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

V.3  Access to Livelihood and Skill Development

	 � 

There should be convergence of objectives of the National Rural Livelihood and Urban 
Livelihood  Missions  to  deepen  Financial  inclusion  through  an  integrated  approach. 

	 � 

Inter-linkages may be developed between banks and other financial service providers 
with ongoing skill development, and livelihood generation programmes through RSETIs, 
NRLM,  SRLM,  Pradhan  Mantri  Kaushal  Vikas  Yojana  etc.

V.4  Financial Literacy and Education

	 �  Customers  need  to  be  explained  in  simple  language  the  nature  of  the  product,  its 

suitability 

to 

their  requirements  and 

the  cost  vis-à-vis  return.

	 �  Concerted  efforts  are  needed  to  ensure  coordination  among  the  ground  level 
functionaries viz. Lead District Manager (LDM), District Development Manager (DDM) 
of NABARD, Lead District Officer (LDO) of RBI, District and Local administration, Block 
level officials, NGOs, SHGs, BCs, Farmers’ Clubs, Panchayats, PACS, village level 
functionaries  etc.  while  conducting  financial  literacy  programmes. 

V.5  Customer Protection and Grievance Redressal

	 � 

A robust customer grievance redressal mechanism at different levels helps banks in 
timely  redressal  of  grievances. 

	 �  Develop a portal to facilitate inter-regulatory co-ordination for redressal of customer
 

grievance.

 

V.6  Effective Co-ordination 

	 � 

Strengthen the various fora under Lead Bank Scheme viz., SLBC / DCC / BLBC to 
ensure  the  achievement  of  the  vision  of  the  strategy  at  the  ground  level.

	 � 

Leverage on the emerging developments in technology to promote effective stakeholder 
co-ordination  by  having  in  place  a  digital  dashboard/  MIS  monitoring.

	 � 

Encourage decentralized approach to planning and development by creating a forum 
to  actively  involve  Gram  Panchayats/  Civil  Society/  NGOs  to  accelerate  financial 
inclusion  using  various  tools  like  social  audit. 

A  review  on  the  action  taken  on  the  recommendations  may  be  conducted  in  March  2021  and 
accordingly,  course  corrections  may  be  introduced.

VI Measurement of Progress of  

Financial Inclusion 

VI.1  Periodic evaluation of financial inclusion policies through monitoring of financial inclusion 
parameters provides policy makers and stakeholders with necessary insights to understand the 
achievements made in the country and to address issues and challenges through a coordinated 
approach. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) is the Apex forum which also 
looks after Financial Inclusion and Literacy through the Technical Group on Financial Inclusion 
and Financial Literacy (TGFIFL) under the aegis of FSDC Sub-Committee (FSDC-SC). Financial 
Inclusion  Advisory  Committee  (FIAC)  undertakes  review  of  the  policies  on  financial  inclusion 
amongst  its  other  objectives.  Further  at  the  state  level,  the  SLBC  is  the  apex  monitoring  and 
coordinating forum to discuss issues pertaining to Financial Inclusion and Development. 

VI.2  As  regards  the  design  of  the  Financial  Inclusion  Indicators,  there  has  been  substantial 
research on various methodologies and tools to quantitatively monitor financial inclusion progress. 
The G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators serve as a useful guide and starting point for the design of 
country specific indicators and targets. Some of the key global data sources measuring financial 
inclusion across countries include Financial Access Survey of IMF, Global Findex Database by 
World Bank and Enterprise Surveys.

VI.3  In India, RBI collects data from banks on Financial Inclusion Plans, credit flow under priority 
sector, credit flow to minorities, and progress made under major Government Schemes. In addition 
to the above data collected by RBI, NABARD collects data from Rural Cooperatives and Regional 
Rural Banks. Other Financial Sector Regulators also capture necessary data pertaining to their 
regulated entities. Ministry of Finance, Government of India is also preparing an Index of Financial 
Inclusion.

VI.4  To make the whole data collection process meaningful and provide inputs for future policy 
interventions,  the  following  approach  may  be  considered  for  adoption: 

i. 

ii. 

 

 

26  

Data should be captured electronically, and directly from the systems that store these 
data  sets  through  an Automated  Data  Extraction  method.  Such  a  collection  of  data 
would result in seamless processes, minimal human intervention and enhanced data 
integrity. 

The integration of data among all the financial sector regulators should be presented in 
the form of a Digital MIS Dashboard that can be analyzed granularly so as to understand 
the issues hampering financial inclusion progress at the grassroots level. These issues 

National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024

can be suitably taken up in the relevant forum for being addressed and progress may 
be monitored thereof. 

 

iii.  Going  forward,  the  availability  of  consistent,  reliable  and  internationally  comparable 
gender disaggregated data is vital to focus attention on policies that could help close the 
gender gap on women’s access to formal financial services. Further, an understanding 
of the existence of regional variation and imbalances on women’s access to financial 
services  across  the  country  would  also  help  in  coming  up  with  suitable  policy 
interventions  that  can  eventually  help  women  achieve  economic  wellbeing  through 
managing  their  household  finances  optimally. 

VI.5  Quantifying financial inclusion progress is usually undertaken across the three dimensions 
of access, usage and quality.

VI.6  Access Indicators show the details pertaining to access points in the form of Banking Outlets 
(Bank Branches, Business Correspondent outlets), Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Point 
of Sale (PoS) terminals. The access parameters can be represented both in terms of geography 
(e.g number of banking outlets per 1000 sq km) as well as demography (e.g number of banking 
outlets per 100000 adult population). Typically, data for access indicator is obtained from the data 
available with the Government/ Regulators.

VI.7  Usage Indicators show how the products are being used by the target customers. Data for 
usage can be collected through primary and secondary sources. While data on number of accounts, 
products, etc. can be collected from financial service providers, insights into the usage of different 
financial products and services may be obtained through surveys/ feedback from customers.

VI.8  The Quality indicators describe the supporting pillars that ensure that the customers can 
use the financial services to their satisfaction. For example, financial literacy and capability is an 
important enabler to help customers make right choices. However, lack of proper service by the 
provider may result in dissatisfaction to the customer which may result in financial exclusion. Since 
quality  also  involves  the  dimension  of  subjectivity,  it  is  essential  to  have  a  well-defined  metric 
that allows for certain flexibility while capturing data. Measuring quality under financial inclusion 
can include financial literacy and capability, clarity and transparency in the communication of the 
service  provider,  customer  satisfaction,  availability  of  grievance  redressal  process  and  timely 
redressal  mechanisms.

Conduct of Studies/ Surveys

VI.10 In addition to data collected from financial service providers, there is also a need to seek 
views and insights from the end users of the products themselves, namely the customers. There 
are a lot of demand side surveys including the Global Findex Demand Side Data and Enterprise 
Survey of the World Bank, the Fin-Scope, the Inclusix of CRISIL etc. While these may serve as 

Measurement of Progress of Financial Inclusion 

31

broad indicators and tool kits for understanding the macro level progress under financial inclusion, 
it is also essential to design surveys based on region specific issues to critically understand the 
issues and problems pertaining to regional disparity, demand peculiarities resulting in inequality 
and exclusion. 

VI.11 To  begin  with,  a  base  line  survey  can  be  undertaken  to  assess  the  issues  that  hamper 
progress under financial inclusion efforts of the stakeholders. The issues that are recommended 
to be covered may inter alia include the following aspects:

b. 

c. 

d.

VII Conclusion

VII.1  The document highlights the major issues that act as impediments to financial inclusion 
and comes up with a set of recommendations and action plans to support sustainable financial 
inclusion over the next 5 years. 

VII.2  Substantial  efforts  are  needed  not  only  from  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  but 
also from an array of other stakeholders including civil society. As a result, the document views 
universal  access  to  financial  services  and  providing  bouquet  of  basic  financial  services  as  the 
starting point of the strategy. Over the next few years, it is envisaged that ubiquitous physical and 
digital  connectivity  coupled  with  full  financial  inclusion  is  possible  owing  to  the  focused  efforts 
being undertaken by the respective stakeholders. The issues like customer centric approach for 
product design and delivery, focus on financial literacy and strengthening the customer protection 
framework as described in the relevant chapters need adequate focus to ensure that the momentum 
generated by the Government’s PMJDY needs to be taken forward to ensure better delivery and 
choices available to the end customers with active involvement from the service providers including 
private sector players. 

VII.3  A discussion on financial inclusion policies would be incomplete if digital financial inclusion 
and the role of fin-tech is not meaningfully integrated in the policy discourse. While, India has 
largely  benefited  from  the  Jan  Dhan-Aadhaar-  Mobile  trinity  over  the  last  few  years,  adequate 
measures are needed to strengthen the digital financial services’ eco-system including increased 
awareness  on  usage  of  digital  modes  of  transactions,  increased  access  points/  acceptance 
infrastructure  and  a  safe  environment  incorporating  the  principles  of  consent  and  privacy.  It  is 
expected that over the next few years, fin-tech may evolve from its present structure, calling for 
adequate understanding among regulators, financial service providers and most importantly the 
customers availing financial services through the digital mode. It is, therefore, important to first 
address  the  newly  digitally  included  customers  through  adequate  awareness  and  literacy. 

VII.4  The need for an objective and a scientific assessment of the progress made in financial 
inclusion cannot be overlooked. While a lot of data collection efforts are underway, there is a need 
to go beyond data collected from financial service providers alone. Surveys and feedback from the 
customers, leveraging on Big Data sets and importantly collecting and analyzing granular data to 
gather a holistic perspective on the coverage and also the usage of financial services is essential. 
Insights on the quality of financial services delivered to various target groups would be very useful 
to see the impact of financial inclusion policies on overall financial wellbeing.
