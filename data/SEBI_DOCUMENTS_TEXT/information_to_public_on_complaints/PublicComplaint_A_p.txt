How investor complaints are handled in SEBI? 
 
SEBI  has  a  dedicated  department  viz.,  Office  of  Investor  Assistance  and  Education 
(OIAE) to receive investor grievances and to provide assistance to investors by way of 
education and complaints are handled by all operational departments pertaining to their 
areas.  Investors  who  are  not  satisfied  with  the  response  to  their  grievances  received 
from  the  Stock  Exchanges/Depositories  can  lodge  their  grievances  with  SEBI. 
Grievances  pertaining  to  stock  brokers  and  depository  participants  are  taken  up  with 
respective stock exchange and depository for redressal and monitored by SEBI through 
periodic  reports  obtained  from  them.  Grievances  pertaining  to  other  intermediaries  are 
taken  up  with  them  directly  for  redressal  and  are  continuously  monitored  by  SEBI.  
Grievances against listed company are taken up with the respective listed company and 
are continuously monitored. The company is required to respond in prescribed format in 
the  form  of  Action  Taken  Report  (ATR).  Upon  the  receipt  of  ATR,  the  status  of 
grievances is updated. Where the response of the company is insufficient / inadequate, 
follow  up  action  is  initiated.  If  the  progress  of  redressal  of  investor  grievances  by  an 
entity,  is  not  satisfactory,  appropriate  enforcement  actions  (adjudication,  direction, 
prosecution etc.) are initiated against such entity 
 
 
What are the limitations in dealing with the complaint? 
 
Sometimes a complaint is successfully resolved and the entity is advised to send reply 
to complainant.  But in certain cases, the entity or company denies wrongdoing, and it 
remains  unclear  as  to  who  is  wrong  or  whether  any  wrongdoing  occurred  at  all.  If  this 
happens, SEBI cannot act as a judge or an arbitrator and force the entity or company to 
resolve the complaint.  Further, SEBI cannot act as personal representative or attorney 
of  the  complainant.  Securities  laws  and  other  laws  provide  important  legal  rights  and 
remedies if an investor has suffered wrongdoing.  On their own, investors can also seek 
to resolve their complaint through the courts, consumer courts, or arbitration. 
 
Investor Grievance Redressal facility at Stock Exchanges/Depositories 
 
Investors who are not satisfied with the response to their grievances received from the 
brokers/Depository  Participants/listed  companies,  can  lodge  their  grievances  with  the 
Stock Exchanges or Depositories.  The grievance can be lodged at any of the offices of 
the  BSE/NSE  located  at  Chennai,  Mumbai,  Kolkata  and  New  Delhi.    In  case  of 
unsatisfactory redressal, the exchanges have designated Investor Grievance Redressal 
Committees (IGRCs), or Regional Investor Complaints Resolution Committees (RICRC), 
This forum acts as a mediator to resolve the claims, disputes and differences between 
entities  and  complainants.  Stock  Exchanges  provide  a  standard  format  to  the 
complainant  for  referring  the  matter  to  IGRC.  The  committee  calls  for  the  parties  and 
acts as a nodal point to resolve the grievances. For any detailed information please visit 
the website of the respective stock exchange.  
 
In case the investor is not satisfied with the conciliation done by IGRC, he/ she can go 
for  arbitration  and  file  arbitration  under  the  Rules,  Bye  –  laws  and  Regulations  of  the 
respective Stock Exchange/Depository.  
 
When can a case be referred for arbitration?  

 
If the  grievance  is  not  resolved  by  the  Stock  Exchange/Depository  due  to  disputes, an 
investor  can  file  arbitration  subject  to  the  Bye-laws,  Rules  and  Regulations  of  the 
exchange  /  Depository.    All  claims,  differences  or  disputes  between  the  investors  and 
stock  brokers/depository  participants  can  be  filed  for  arbitration.  To  obtain  information 
about when and how to file an arbitration claim, investors may visit the websites of the 
Stock Exchanges or the Depositories.  
 
Simplified arbitration can be a less costly alternative to legal recourse before the courts 
of  law.  If  the  investor  has  an  account  with  the  broker  or  a  depository  participant  (DP), 
he/she  can  choose  arbitration  to  settle  disputes.  The  investor  generally  cannot  pursue 
an  issue  through  arbitration  if  it  is  barred  by  limitation  prescribed.  When  deciding 
whether to arbitrate, the investor has to bear in mind that if the broker or DP goes out of 
business or declares bankruptcy, he/she might not be able to recover money even if the 
arbitrator or court rules in his/her favor. However, with certain restriction to the nature of 
transactions, Stock Exchanges may settle on case to case basis the claim of an investor 
up  to  a  limit  prescribed  in  the  “Investor  protection  fund”  guidelines  of  the  respective 
Stock Exchange.  
 
The  claimant  is  required  to  carefully  review  the  rules  governing  simplified  arbitration 
before filing a claim and should also weigh the costs of arbitrating against the likelihood 
of being able to collect any award in favor. An investor, who has a claim / counter claim 
up  to  `10  lakh  against  a  broker  and  files  arbitration  reference  for  the  same,  need  not 
make any deposit for filing arbitration.  
 
Arbitration process at Stock Exchanges :  
 
The arbitration process at Stock Exchanges is given below:  
 

•  Applicant submits arbitration application to Exchange  
•  Application is verified and sent to Respondent  
•  Arbitrator appointed and documents forwarded to arbitrator  
•  Hearings held by arbitrator  
•  Arbitrator  passes award  
•  Award debited if in favor of constituent  
•  Appeal filed by aggrieved party  
•  Hearings held and appeal award passed  
•  Petition filed u/s 34 of the Indian Arbitration Act in Court  

 
If  the  applicant  is  not  satisfied  with  award  passed  by  arbitration  panel,  he  can  go  for 
appeal against the award to Appellate mechanism in the exchange itself. 
 
 
Arbitration mechanism made simpler  
 
Based  on  inputs  received  from  investors  regarding  functioning  of  the  arbitration 
mechanism  at  the  Stock  Exchanges,  the  following  changes  have  been  made  to  the 
arbitration mechanism by SEBI.

When can SEBI take action for non resolution of the complaint? 
 
SEBI  follows  up  with  companies  who  do  not  redress  investor’s  grievances  by  sending 
reminders  to  them,  having  meetings  with  them  and  issuing  pre-enforcement  letters  for 
pending  complaints.  While  the  entity  is  directly  responsible  for  redressal  of  the 
complaint,  SEBI  initiates  action  against  recalcitrant  entities  on  the  grounds  of  their 
unsatisfactory  redressal  of 
investor  complaints  as  a  whole.  
Enforcement  actions  as  provided  under  the  Securities  laws  (including  launch  of 
Adjudication,  Prosecution  proceedings,  Directions  u/s  11B  of  SEBI  Act,  1992)  are 
initiated  against  the  companies  and/or  its  directors  whose  progress  in  redressal  of 
investors’ grievances is not satisfactory 
 
Situation/s  where  SEBI  has  closed  a  complaint  after  due  consideration  but 
complainant keeps repeating it.  
 
Sometimes  a  complaint  is  addressed  and  disposed  off  by  SEBI  advising  the 
complainants  to  adopt  appropriate  course  of  action  but  the  complainants  have  been 

large  number  of 

writing to SEBI repeatedly without choosing to avail of the appropriate legal remedy from 
the competent forum. 
 
For  e.g.  A  complainant  raises  the  issue  of  incorrect  information  provided  by  broker 
regarding his exposure limits and squaring off positions without his consent. The broker 
replies that as there was a debit in client's account and due to unavailability of funds, his 
positions  were  squared  up. The  complainant  is  advised  to approach  Stock  Exchanges'  
Investor Grievance Resolution Panel/Committee as the matter is that of a dispute. The 
complainant refuses to approach/attend meetings and continues to send frequent mails 
to  various  levels  in  SEBI.  In  such  cases,  SEBI  will  not  respond  to  any  such  mail/letter 
etc.
