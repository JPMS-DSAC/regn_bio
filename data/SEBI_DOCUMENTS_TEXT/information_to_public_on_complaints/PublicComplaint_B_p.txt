side do not help the system  
 
Challenges before SEBI for resolving complaints 
 
Despite  the  best  efforts  of  SEBI,  many  grievances  cannot  be  resolved  by  SEBI  or 
resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant. It is, therefore, possible that a grievance 
has  been  closed  in  SEBI’s  records  while  the  complainant  still  feels  aggrieved.  For 
example,  a  grievance  cannot  be  resolved  because  the  matter  is  sub-judice.  Similarly, 
resolution  of a  grievance  may  require  dispute  resolution  through  arbitration. The  Stock 
Exchange / Depository may have advised the complainant to go for arbitration. Instead 
of doing so, he may still be seeking a resolution from SEBI.   

 

Disputes cannot be handled by SEBI

in 

In  cases  of    non-redressal  of  investor  grievances  against  brokers,  adjudication 
under  Sections  15HB  and  15C  of  SEBI  Act  and  Section  23I  of  the  SCR  Act  may 
result 
imposition  of  monetary  penalty  on  determination  of  violation  of 
Act/Regulation by the Adjudicating Officer as per the provisions of the SEBI & SCR 
Act/  (Procedure  for  holding  inquiry  and  imposing  penalties  by  the  Adjudicating 
Officer)  Rules,  1995  &  2005.  SEBI  Act,  and  SCR  Act  do  not  provide  for  settling 
disputes  awarding  compensation  by  SEBI.  Therefore,  the  complaint/application 
towards  obtaining  a  direction  for  compensation/damages  suffered  by  the  investors 
or  contractual  disputes  regarding  any  claims  or  monetary  payment  cannot  be 
adjudicated  by  SEBI.  Such  disputes 
claims  or 
compensation/damages  have  to  be  adjudicated  either  by  a  court  of  competent 
jurisdiction i.e. Civil Court and an Arbitrator.

regulation and control of contracts  providing therein for the method and procedure 
for settlement of claims/disputes, including settlement by arbitration. 

 
3.  Further, Hon'ble SAT has also held in the following cases that contractual disputes 

cannot be adjudicated by SEBI viz.:  
 

Case 1: Ibrahim Ahmed vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 40 of 2009) 
 
Facts  of  the case:    SEBI    received  complaints from  the  shareholders  of  the  company 
inter-alia about the rejection of request to dematerialize shares held by them in physical 
form. One of the grievances was that the person was holding 7,78,000 shares issued by 
the  company  and  that  company  was  not  dematerializing  these  shares.  The  company 
took the stand that the share certificates produced by the appellant were forged and on 
the  basis  of  those  certificates,  the  shares  could  not  be  transferred  in  his  name.  In  the 
light  of  the  stand  taken  by  the  company,  the  appellant  filed  a  petition  before  the 
Company  Law  Board  under  Section  111  of  the  Companies  Act  for  the  rectification  of 
registration of members of the company and that is still pending. In view of the pendency 
of  the  petition  before  the  Company  Law  Board,  SEBI  did  not  decide  on  merits  the 
complaint filed by the appellant and left it to the Company Law Board to adjudicate on 

those  issues. The  appellant  also felt aggrieved  against the SEBI  order  dated  February 
20, 2009 by which the company and its whole time directors had been restrained from 
accessing the capital market and filed the appeal. 
 
SAT  Judgement:  “This  dispute  between  the  parties  cannot  be  gone  into  by  the 
Board which is a statutory regulator meant to protect the interest of the investors 
and  to  regulate  the  securities  market.  The  appellant  should  pursue  his  remedy 
elsewhere.”

Case 2: MCS Ltd vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 107 of 2008)  
 
Facts of the case:  SEBI received complaints from some issuer companies alleging that 
on the termination of their agreement with the MCS as Share Transfer Agent (STA), the 
latter did not hand over the records/data and other relating documents which were in its 
possession  in  its  capacity  as  STA.  The  complaints  were  forwarded  to  the  appellant  to 
make necessary compliance.  
 
SEBI  vide  order  dated  August  11,  2008  held  that  the  MCS  had  acted  contrary  to  the 
code  of  conduct  prescribed  for  STAs  and  issued  directions  to  MCS  to  transfer  all 
data/records and issue no objection certificates to the companies and the depository, if 
not already done, failing which strict action would be taken against it.  
 
However,  it  was  contended  by  MCS    that  SEBI  while  directing  it  to  transfer  all 
data/records to the issuer companies should have also directed Companies to pay the 
dues to the MCS which, according to it, are due under the contract.  
 
SAT  rejected  this  contention    of  MCS  as  the  code  of  conduct  prescribed  for  STAs 
requires  that  as  an  when  the  contract  with  the  issuer  companies  is  terminated,  the 
former should handover to the latter the data/records and other documents that may be 
in  their  possession.  Since  this  was  not  done,  the  Board  rightly  directed  the  MCS  to 
return the records and the data. 
 
SAT  observed  that  SEBI's  direction  has  been  complied  with  and  as  regards  the  dues 
which  the  MCS  is  claiming,  it  would  be  open  to  it  to  resort  to  proceedings  in  an 
appropriate forum in accordance with law to receive those dues. The Board cannot take 
upon it to adjudicate such contractual disputes between the parties.  
 
SAT Judgement: The Board rightly directed the appellant to return all the data/records 
and the same has been complied with by the appellant. As regards the dues which the 
appellant  is  claiming,  it  would  be  open  to  it  to  resort  to  proceedings  before  an 
appropriate  forum  for  recovering  the  same.  The  Board  cannot  take  upon  itself  to 
adjudicate such contractual issues.”

CASE 3 : Mr. Hameed Ullah Lalji alias Tony Ullah vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 123 of 2008) 
 
Facts of the case:  Orbit Construction and Realtors Private Limited a subsidiary of the 
company  which  has  since  been  amalgamated  with  it.  The  company  came  out  with  a 

public  issue  and  in  the  Red  Herring  Prospectus  vetted  by  the  Board,  the  company 
assured  the  public  investors  that  it  had  made  all  reasonable  inquiries  and  accepts 
responsibility  for  all  that  was  stated  in  the  prospectus.  It  had  also  given  an  assurance 
that all statements and information contained therein were true and correct in all material 
aspect  and  were  not  misleading  in  any  manner  and  that  the  opinions  and  intentions 
expressed therein were honestly held by the company.  
 
The public issue went through and shares were allotted to the public shareholders and 
listed  on  the  NSE  and  BSE  in  April,  2007.  The  shares  of  the  company  are  also  being 
traded in the market for nearly two years.  
 
Long  after  the  public  issue  had  gone  through,  the  appellant  made  a  complaint  to  the 
SEBI  alleging  a  wrong  statement  in  the  prospectus  to  lure  the  public  to  invest  in  the 
shares  of  the  company.  The  prayer  made  in  the  complaint  was  that  the  Board  should 
prosecute  the  directors  of  the  company  and  that  the  company  should  be  permanently 
debarred  from  accessing  the  capital  market  and  that  the  shares  be  delisted.  The 
residuary prayer made in the complaint was that the Board may take such other further 
action  against  the  company  as  may  be  deemed  appropriate.  The  complaint  was 
considered by the Board along with the relevant statements made by the company in the 
prospectus  along  with  the  documents  furnished  therewith  and  came  to  the  conclusion 
that the  issues  raised by  the  appellant  were  disputes  of a  civil  nature  and  that  it  could 
not  settle  those  issues.  The  appellant  was  advised  to  approach  the  Civil  Court. 
Aggrieved, the investor filed an appeal in SAT.  
 
 
SAT  Judgement:    The  appeal  is  wholly  misconceived  and  that  the  appellant  has  no 
locus  standi  to  file  the  same.  It  must  be  understood  that  the  Board  is  a  statutory 
regulator set up under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for short 
the  Act)  primarily  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the 
development  of  and  to  regulate  the  securities  market.  In  the  very  nature  of  things,  it 
cannot adjudicate civil disputes which have to be settled by the Civil Courts in terms of 
section  9  of  Code  of  Civil  Procedure.  The  appellant  before  us  is  not  an  investor.  He 
claims  to  be  the  owner  of  the  property  which,  according  to  the  company,  is  in  the 
process  of  being  conveyed  to  it  through  the  documents  which  have  been  executed 
between  the  company  and  the  duly  constituted  attorneys  of  the  appellant.  ……  If  the 
appellant feels that his property is being usurped by the company the remedy is not by 
way of a complaint to the Board. These disputes are obviously of a civil nature and can 
appropriately be decided by a Civil Court.

CASE 4: Mrs. Ramkishori Gupta vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 207 of 2012) 
 
Facts  of  the  case:    Appellants  appealed  to  SAT  seeking  a  direction  to  SEBI  to  pay 
them  compensation  to  the  tune  of  Rs.51,53,190/-  for  the  loss  suffered  by  them  in  the 
process  of  purchasing1,71,773  shares 
from  M/s.  Vital  Communication  Limited, 
hereinafter  referred  to  as  “VCL”,  which  is  a  listed  company  on  the  Bombay  Stock 
Exchange Ltd., hereinafter referred to as “BSE”.  
 
The  case  of  the  Appellants  was  that  they  were  impressed  by  the  allegedly  misleading 
advertisements  published  in  various  newspapers  particularly  as  regards  issue  of  buy-

back as well as bonus shares. It is contended by the Appellants that both the schemes 
of  buy-back  and  bonus  shares  did  not  materialize  at  all.  In  the  process  they  suffered 
huge  losses. Therefore,  they  requested for a  direction  to SEBI  to consider their prayer 
for grant of compensation for the loss suffered by them in the course of the transaction. 
They  are  seeking  a  direction  to  get  compensation  in  respect  of  1,71,773  shares  in 
question @ Rs.30 per share at least. 
 
The  Appellants  approached  the  consumer  forum  under  the  Consumer  Protection  Act, 
1986 for redressal of their grievances and payment of alleged compensation suffered by 
the  Appellants  due  to  the  above  facts.  The  National  Consumer  Disputes  Redressal 
Commission, New Delhi, while hearing the appeal of the Appellants on 17/1/2010 simply 
opined  that  the  complaint  of  the  Appellants  was  not  within  the  purview  of  Consumer 
Protection Act, and if the Appellants wished to pursue their remedy, they might approach 
SEBI for the redressal of their grievance as per law. The petition was filed in respect of 
complaints  regarding  announcements  relating  to  buyback  of  shares,  preferential 
allotment and bonus issue etc. 
 
SEBI declined the request of the Appellants for grant of compensation stating, inter alia, 
that  they  do  not  have  such  jurisdiction  to  consider  and  grant  compensation  to  the 
investors who incidentally suffer losses in the process of purchasing/selling shares in the 
open market.  
 
SAT  Judgement: "… We deal with the  issue  as  to  whether any  compensation  can  be 
granted by SEBI to an investor who loses money in the process of sale and purchase of 
certain securities, etc. We have minutely perused the scheme of the SEBI Act, 1992 and 
we note that its express object is to protect the interest of investors in securities and to 
promote the development of the securities market and also its regulation so as to have 
an  orderly,  systematic  and  a  more  organised  capital  market.  …Section  11(2)  [of  the 
SEBI Act, 1992], … enumerates around 15 directives to SEBI to be undertaken by it in 
the  discharge  of  its  duties  to  attain  the  objectives  for  which  it  has  been  established. 
There is no directive or mandate in any of the 15 or 16 measures empowering SEBI to 
undertake  the  task  of  considering  and  granting  compensation  to  an  investor  for  the 
alleged  losses  he  might  have  suffered  due  to  certain  misleading  or  fraudulent 
advertisements by a company. In fact, the Appellants’ prayer for compensating him for 
the  alleged  loss  is  in  the  nature  of  a  claim  for  damages  on  account  of  such  alleged 
fraudulent  and  misleading 
through  various 
advertisements.  This  aspect  needs  to  be  looked  into  by  a  civil  court  of  competent 
jurisdiction in a trial and not by SEBI under the SEBI Act, 1992 for the simple reason that 
SEBI has neither the expertise nor infrastructure for this purpose. There is no mandate 
in law requiring SEBI to do so in case any investor suffers loss on account of trading in 
shares  etc.  Such  jurisdiction  is  not  envisaged  anywhere  in  the  entire  scheme  of  the 
SEBI Act, 1992. In fact, the law of damages/compensation is a complex area and SEBI 
is not supposed to undertake the same for reasons stated hereinabove."
