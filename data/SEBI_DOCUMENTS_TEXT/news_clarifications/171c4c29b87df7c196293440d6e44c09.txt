Dear Sir,
Sub:   Clarification 
           
This has reference to the editorial  “Just don’t do it, MFs IPOs can do without quotas”  published in the Mumbai edition of The Economic Times today,        (July 11, 2006). It has, inter-alia, been mentioned, in the editorial, that “the regulator is also apparently considering capping the exposure of corporates  in new fund offerings (NFOs).”
 
In this connection, we would like to clarify as follows:
 
“The observation in the editorial that SEBI is considering capping the exposure of corporates in new fund offerings (NFOs) is baseless. SEBI has no proposal to cap exposure of corporates in NFOs. Editorialising on non-existent matters will only help to add confusion among investors.”
 
It is requested that the above clarification may be published in your newspaper for the benefit of your esteemed readers.
           
Thanking you,
                                                                                               
Yours faithfully,
for Securities and Exchange Board of India
