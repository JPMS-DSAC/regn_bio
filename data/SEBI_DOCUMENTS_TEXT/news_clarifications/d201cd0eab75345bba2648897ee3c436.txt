Dear Sir,
Sub:   Clarification 
           
Please refer to the news items headlined “FM wants compensation for IPO scam victims” and “SEBI will find it tough to pay back investors” published in your newspaper on October 11, 2006,  wherein it has been indicated that “regulator and other market participants  may perhaps may be sceptical of this, but it appears that the Government is determined to make an example of this case.” 
 
This is to inform you that there is no difference of opinion whatsoever between the Ministry of Finance and SEBI regarding the need for disgorgement or exercising the powers of the disgorgement. 
 
We would advise you not to publish such news items which have the effect of misleading readers many among whom may be investors in the stock market.
 
Thanking you,
                                                                                               
Yours faithfully,
for Securities and Exchange Board of India
