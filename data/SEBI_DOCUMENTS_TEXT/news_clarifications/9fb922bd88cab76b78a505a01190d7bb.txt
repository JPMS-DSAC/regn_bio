Sir,
Sub: Clarification
 
This is with reference to the story headlined “FII short selling under Sebi lens” published in the Mumbai edition of Financial Chronicle on October 17, 2008. In this connection, we would like to clarify as follows:
 
“Mr. M.S. Sahoo, Whole Time Member, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) did not make any statement to the effect that SEBI was investigating into short sales by FIIs or blanket action would extend to every one in India. In order to lend more transparency to the market, SEBI has decided to collect and disseminate the position of the securities lent if any, by FIIs abroad on a consolidated basis twice a week i.e. on Tuesday and Friday of every week.” 
 
It is requested that the above clarification may be published in your newspaper to put the record straight.
 
Thanking you,
 
Yours faithfully,
for Securities and Exchange Board of India

Manager
