News Clarifications

Madam,
Sub:   Clarification 
           
This has reference to the news item  “SEBI steps up vigil, plans to grade merchant bankers” appearing in the Mumbai edition of The Economic Times today.
 
In this connection, we would like to clarify as follows:
 
“The news item that SEBI plans to grade merchant bankers is completely baseless. SEBI has no plans to grade merchant bankers.
 
It would be in the interest of your readers if you could ascertain SEBI’s official position on these matters before publishing such items, so prominently”.
 
It is requested that the above clarification may be published in your newspaper for the benefit of your esteemed readers.
           
Thanking you,
                                                                                               
Yours faithfully,
for Securities and Exchange Board of India
