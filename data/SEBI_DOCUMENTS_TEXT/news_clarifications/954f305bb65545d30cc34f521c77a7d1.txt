Sir,
Sub:   Clarification 
           
This has reference to PTI’s, New Delhi datelined news item, published by various newspapers across the country on May 15, 2006, which inter-alia stated that “SEBI is exploring various options including doing away with quota system for public offers…”
In this connection, we would like to clarify as follows:
“The news item that SEBI is exploring various options including doing away with quota system for public offers is completely baseless. SEBI has no plans to do away with the existing systems for Initial Public Offerings. It would be in the interest of your readers if you could ascertain SEBI’s official position on these matters before publishing such items.”.
 
It is requested that the above clarification may be published immediately.
Thanking you,
                                                                                               
Yours faithfully,
for Securities and Exchange Board of India
