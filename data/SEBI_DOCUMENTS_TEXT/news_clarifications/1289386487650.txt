Shri M K Razdan 
Editor-in-Chief 
Press Trust of India 
New Delhi. 
 
Dear Sir, 

Sub:   Clarification  

 

 

 

 

 

 
This  has  reference  to  news  report  titled  “MNS  asks  SEBI  to  provide  Marathi 
option  on  website”  carried  by  PTI,  Mumbai  on  November  21,  2009.  This  news 
report has been published by a section of media also. 
 
In this regard, we would like to clarify as follows: 
 
“SEBI does not have any officer with designation Deputy Chief Executive officer 
or  by  the  name  of  Ashish  Kumar  Chauhan.  SEBI  has  neither  relaunched  its 
website recently nor does it have a Gujarati website. 
 
The news report is erroneous. “ 
 
It is requested that the above clarification may be carried on PTI immediately to 
put the record straight. 
 
Thanking you, 
 
 
Yours faithfully, 
for Securities and Exchange Board of India 
 
 
(N.Hariharan) 
General Manager (Communications)
