A.  Objective 

 

 

To  solicit  public  comments  /  views  on  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred as “LODR 
Regulations”  or  “LODR”)  inter-alia  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  practices  and 
disclosure  requirements,  ease  compliance  burden  on  listed  entities,  harmonize  with  the 
Companies Act, 2013 and maintain consistency within the LODR Regulations.  

B.  Review of the LODR and proposed amendments: 
 

 

The LODR Regulations were notified on September 2, 2015, after an extensive and exhaustive 
consultation.  The  LODR  Regulations  consolidated  and  streamlined  the  provisions  of  listing 
agreements that  existed  for  different  segments of the  capital market. The  provisions  of the 
LODR Regulations have been categorized into various chapters viz., Chapter – I to XII.  

Subsequent  to  the  implementation  of  the  LODR  Regulations,  various  changes  have  taken 
place in the regulatory landscape, like 
 

  Amendments made to the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Companies Act’);  
  Repeal of the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 

 

and substitution with ICDR Regulations, 2018 (‘ICDR Regulations’);  
Issue  of  informal  guidance/  interpretative  letters  regarding  interpretation  of  various 
provisions of the LODR Regulations etc. 

 

While  SEBI  has  endeavoured  to  keep  the  LODR  Regulations  and  the  circulars  issued 
thereunder in line with the ever evolving market dynamics, many representations continue to 
be received from various stakeholders on various aspects of these regulations. A need was 
thus felt to review and align the LODR Regulations with the following objectives: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

To strengthen corporate governance practices and disclosure requirements (proposed 
amendments at Annex A); 
 
To ease the compliance burden on listed entities (proposed amendments at  Annex 
B); 
 
Other  amendments  inter-alia  to  maintain  consistency  within  the  LODR  Regulations, 
harmonize the LODR Regulations with the Companies Act, (proposed amendments at 
Annex C) and maintain gender neutrality;  
 

C.   Public Comments 

 

This consultation paper seeks public comments on the proposed amendments to Chapters I 
– IV, XII and the corresponding schedules of the LODR Regulations, as detailed at Annex A 
to C. The comments/suggestions may be provided as per the format given below:

There is a possibility  that the

A listed entity may reduce its
