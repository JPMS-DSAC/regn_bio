- Review of “Reverse Book Building Process” 

Background  

 

1)  SEBI came out with SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003 whereby the 

concept of price fixation was changed from fixed price announced by the acquirer 

to a reverse book built price determined by the existing public shareholders. The 

same  process  was  continued  in  SEBI  (Delisting  of  Equity  Shares)  Regulations, 

2009  (‘Delisting  Regulations,  2009’)  which  superseded  the  SEBI  (Delisting  of 

Securities) Guidelines, 2003.  

 

2)  Subsequently,  to  examine  and  review  the  framework  for  the  delisting  of  equity 

shares of companies, SEBI came up with a discussion paper in 2014 to solicit the 

views of all stakeholders. Accordingly, after taking into consideration all the views 

received  from  stakeholders  and  Primary  Market  Advisory  Committee  (PMAC), 

vide  notification  dated  March  24,  2015,  SEBI  (Delisting  of  Equity  Shares) 

Amendments  Regulations,  2015  were  notified,  thereby  amending  Delisting 

Regulations, 2009. 

 

3)  Key changes introduced by the said amendment included Responsibilities of the 

company’s  Board,  Revisiting  the  Reverse  Book  Building  (‘RBB’)  mechanism 

including  determination  of  price,  Minimum  level  of  acceptance  of  shares  by 

promoters  and  ensuring  maximum  participation  of  shareholders  of  that  class, 

Enlarging  the  scope  of  small  companies  on  the  basis  of  net  worth  and  paid  up 

capital and SEBI Board’s power to relax strict enforcement of regulations. 

Reverse Book Building Process and Issues 

4)  Currently, in voluntary delisting an issuer/promoter has to first take the approval 

of shareholders of that class, then an in-principal approval of the stock exchange 

followed by  RBB Process to discover the price. The promoter may choose to pay 

a price equal to or more than the discovered price to the shareholders who had

tendered their shares in the RBB process. Delisting is regarded as successful if 

promoter  shareholding  reaches  90%  pursuant  to  RBB  at  the  discovered  price 

which is acceptable to the promoter. 

 

5)  Several  concerns  have  been 

raised  by 

the  stakeholders 

regarding 

implementation  of  the  reverse  book  building  process.  Such  concerns  are  

summarized herein below: 

 

a)  Price is influenced by the arbitrage seekers. Some shareholders who are 

actually  arbitrageurs/speculators  waiting  for  delisting  opportunity  may  get 

into 

the  company 

through 

the  secondary  market 

route  and 

disproportionately  influence  the  price  discovery  by  bidding  at  very 

unrealistic levels. In such scenario, the process of delisting becomes very 

onerous on the promoters at such price levels. 

 

b)  After the public announcement of delisting, some shareholders  may form 

groups,  bid at  exorbitantly  high  prices  in  order  to  drive  the  high  premium 

and  in  case  premium to  the floor  price  comes  at  significantly  high  levels, 

then  promoter/acquirer  exercises  his  unilateral  right  to  reject  the  offer 

price. Such shareholders may end up holding the company and promoter 

to ransom. 

 

c)  No country except India has adopted the reverse book building method to 

delist  the  shares  of  the  company.  Unlike  IPO  (no  investors  can  bid  at 

unreasonably  low  level  and/or  high  level,  everyone  has  to  bid  within  the 

price-band only), in the reverse book building, only floor price is fixed and 

disclosed  and  it  is  totally  left  to  the  wisdom  of  the  shareholders  to  bid  at 

any price. The bids may be placed at such price levels  which may not be 

as per company fundamentals and/or current market sentiments, and as a 

result,  a  price  which  is  unreasonably  high  may  be  arrived  at.  If  the 

discovered price is onerous to the promoter, he may  reject the price and 

all the efforts to delist the company finally go futile. 

 

d)  Few  groups  of  shareholders  may  take  up  large  holdings  post  the 

announcement  and  get  the  ability  to  influence  the  process  by  driving  the 

premium  to  restrictively  high  levels  which  may  not  be  acceptable  to  the 

Page 2 of 6 

 

 
 

promoters  and  accordingly,  small  shareholders  are  denied  a  chance  to 

exit.  

 

e)  Small  shareholders  are  unable  to  comprehend  the  reverse  book  building 

process, as unlike IPO, there is only floor price and no price band. Without 

fully  understanding  the  various  attributes  of  valuation,  such  shareholders 

may  end  up  bidding  at  very  unreasonable  level,  which  may  totally  vitiate 

the  delisting  process, because  in  such  scenarios,  promoter  exercises  his 

unilateral  right  of  rejecting  the  discovered  price  and  the  entire  exercise 

defeats its objective. 

 

f)  Further,  it has been  also  pointed  out  that promoters  in order  to  influence 

the  price  discovery  through  RBB  systematically  divest  their  stake  to 

friendly  shareholders and  subsequently  come  with  delisting  proposal  and 

such  friendly  shareholders  don’t  bid  independently  in  order  to  keep  the 

price as per the wishes of the promoters. 

g)  The  floor  price  computed  before  initiating  RBB  process  doesn’t  consider 

the  book  value.  While  discovering  the  price  though  RBB  process, 

promoter  needs  to  compute  the  “Floor  Price”  as  per  Regulation  8(2)  of 

Takeover  Regulations,  2011,  which  doesn’t  take  into  account  the  book 

value  of  the  company  in  case  of  frequently  traded  shares.  A  related 

example is cited below for illustration: 

“As per BSE reference, it was informed that in one of the delisting matters 

book value of the shares of the company was nearing three times higher 

than  the  floor  price  determined  in  terms  of  Regulation  8  of  Takeover 

Regulations.  In  that  case,  a  floor  price  of  Rs.  510/-  per  share  had  been 

fixed by the acquirer, whereas the book value of the equity shares of the 

company was Rs. 1569/-. 

In  this  case  as  well  as  in  couple  of  other  cases,  the  concerns  raised  by 

several  investors  were  that  the  acquirers  were  voluntarily  delisting  the 

equity  shares  of  the  company  by  offering  a  much  lower  price  than  book 

value  of  the  shares,  causing  the  minority  shareholders  to  suffer  a  huge 

monetary loss”.

7)  Observations from the above table are as follows: 

a)  During  the  period  F.Y.  2015-16 to  F.Y.  2017-18,  a total  of 15  companies 

got voluntarily delisted, by following the reverse book building process. 

b)  Seven companies got delisted at the floor price (Premium being zero) and 

8  companies  got  delisted  at  a  premium  ranging  between  7.69%  to 

242.02%. 

Proposal 

 

 

 

 
 

8)  Since,  introduction  of  bidding  within  “Price  Band”  (Floor  &  Cap  Price)  may  be 

detrimental to the interest of the investors, it is suggested that RBB in the present 

form may be amended as per the following: 

 

Price discovered as per “Reverse book building method” along with 

counter offer of promoter. 

 

Currently,  if  the  price  discovered  through  RBB  is  not  attractive  to  the  promoter, 

he  may  unilaterally  reject  the  price  and  the  whole  exercise  becomes  futile. 

Instead, the promoter may be allowed to make counter offer to the shareholders 

of  that  class.  If  the  counter  offer  is  lucrative  to  the  shareholders  and  if  it  is 

accepted, delisting should be treated successful. 

 

9)  Further,  it  is  also  suggested  that  in  case  promoter(s)  give  a  counter  offer,  then 

the  counter  offer  price  should  not  be  less  than  the  book  value  and  the  counter 

offer  should  be  accepted  by  such  number  of  public  shareholders  where  the 

promoter shareholding reaches 90%.
