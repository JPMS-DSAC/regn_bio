Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee (TRAC) 

The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (“SEBI”)  has  constituted  the 
Takeover  Regulations  Advisory  Committee  (“TRAC”)  to  review  the  SEBI 
(Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (“Takeover 
Regulations”) and to suggest suitable recommendations for amendments to the 
Takeover Regulations as it considers necessary. 
 
There have since been various prominent judgments by Hon’ble Supreme Court, 
various  Hon’ble  High  Courts  and the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal that 
have further clarified and redefined the scope and applicability of the Takeover 
Regulations.  Further, during this period, SEBI has also issued various informal 
guidance / interpretative letters regarding  interpretation of various provisions of 
the  Takeover  Regulations.    A  need  has  thus  arisen  to  review  and  realign  the 
Takeover  Regulations  with  these  developments  and  to  ensure  that  they  reflect 
the best practices adopted globally. 
 
As  part  of  a  consultative  process  in  the  exercise  of  reviewing  this  significant 
piece of legislation, the TRAC has decided to seek inputs and suggestions from 
the public at the outset on any aspect of the Takeover Regulations, about which 
sections  of  the  public  may  believe  that  intervention  in  the  form  of  a  review  is 
required.   
 
In  order  to  receive  such  inputs  and  suggestions  in  a  structured  manner,  the 
TRAC  hereby  invites  suggestions  from  members  of  the  public  in  the  following 
format:-
