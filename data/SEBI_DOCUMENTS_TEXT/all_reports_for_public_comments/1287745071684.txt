 Background: 

Retail  Individual  Investor  in  a  public  issue  was  defined  in  the  erstwhile  SEBI 
(Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000  (DIP  Guidelines)  until  August 
2003 as under: 

(i)  Fixed  price  issue:  Retail  Individual  Investor  is  one  who  applies  for  allotment 

equal to or less than 10 marketable lots. 

 
(ii) Book built issue: Retail Individual Investor is one who applies for up to 1000 

securities. 

The  aforesaid  definition  of  Retail  Individual  Investor  did  not  differentiate  between 
profiles  of  different  investors.  e.g.  a  Retail  Individual  Investor  who  applies  for  1000 
shares of `530/- each and a Retail Individual Investor who applies for 1000 shares of 
`.10/- each. It was decided to define Retail Individual Investor on the basis of amount 
applied  for,  instead  of  the  number  of  shares  applied  for  and  DIP  Guidelines  were 
amended in August 2003 to provide that a Retail Individual Investor means an investor 
who applies or bids for securities of or for a value of not more than `50,000. 

The aforesaid limit of `50,000 was found to be too low particularly in the context of 
large size book built issues and also resulted in  higher transaction costs. In view of this, 
in March 2005, the DIP Guidelines were amended to enhance the aforesaid limit from 
`50,000 to `1,00,000. 

The aforesaid stipulation of DIP Guidelines has now been incorporated in the SEBI 
(Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR Regulations).

2.0  Matter for consideration : 
 

It  is  more  than  five  years  since  the  limit  of  `1,00,000  for  defining  a  retail  individual 
investor was stipulated. It is felt that the aforesaid limit of `1,00,000 for defining a retail 
individual investor needs to be enhanced on account of interalia the following reasons:  

2.1 

 

(i)  It  has  been  observed  that  in  recent  public  offerings,  approximately  75%  of 
applications in the Retail Individual Investor category have come in the size of 
`80,000 to `1,00,000. Whereas, in the Non Institutional Investor category, the 
number of applications in the size of less than `5,00,000 is negligible. The above 
suggests that Retail Individual Investors who have the capacity and appetite to 
apply  for  securities  worth  above  `1,00,000  were  constrained  from  doing  so 
because of the `1,00,000 limit nor do they make an application under the Non 
Institutional Investor category because the allocation there is limited to 15% as 
against 35% for Retail Individual Investor category.  

 
(ii) In terms of ICDR Regulations, since 35% of the public issue is to be allocated to 
Retail Individual Investors, in a large sized public issue e.g. for an issue size of 
`.4000 crores to `6000 crores, the limit of `1,00,000 would mean that the issue 
has  to  receive  a  minimum  of  1,50,000  to  2,00,000  applications  from  Retail 
Individual Investors to fill in the 35% allocation. This could be a daunting task 
considering  that  in  case  of  well  oversubscribed  issues,  the  number  of 
applications received from Retail Individual Investors was in the range of 35,000 
to 70,000.  

(iii) The rate of inflation in India has increased from about 4% in 2005 to about 12% 
currently, measured in terms of wholesale price index. In the same period, the 
BSE Sensex has risen from about 8000 points to about 18000 points. This means 
that the Retail Individual Investors now buy a lesser number of securities with 
`1,00,000 than they would buy with the same amount in 2005.
