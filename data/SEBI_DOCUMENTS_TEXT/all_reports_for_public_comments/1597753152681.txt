CONSULTATION PAPER ON THE FORMAT FOR  

BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING 

 

A.  Background 
 

1.  SEBI,  in  2012,  mandated  the  top  100  listed  entities  by  market  capitalisation  to  file 
Business Responsibility Reports (BRR) as per the disclosure requirement emanating from 
the  'National  Voluntary  Guidelines  on  Social,  Environmental  and  Economic 
Responsibilities  of  Business'  (NVGs).  These  guidelines  contained  comprehensive 
principles  to  be  adopted  by  companies  as  part  of  their  business  practices  and  a 
structured  business 
requiring  certain  specified 
disclosures,  demonstrating  the  steps  taken  by  companies  to  implement  the  said 
principles.  The  requirement  for  filing  BRRs  was  extended  to  the  top  500  entities 
companies by market capitalisation from the financial year 2015-16. In December 2019, 
SEBI  extended  the  BRR  requirement  to  the  top  1000  listed  entities  by  market 
capitalisation, from the financial year 2019-20.

responsibility 

 

2.  The  philosophy  of  responsible  business  is  based  on  the  principle  of  business  being 
accountable to all its stakeholders towards global developments which are increasingly 
seeking  businesses  to  be  responsible  and  sustainable  towards  their  environment  and 
society.  In  light  of  ever-increasing  global  challenges  relating  to  climate  change, 
environmental risks, growing inequality, etc., business leaders have been compelled, and 
have also found it to be in their interest, to reimagine the role of businesses in the society 
and not view them merely as economic units for generating wealth. The performance of 
a company must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it 
achieves its environmental, social, and good governance objectives. Therefore, globally 
there  is  a  growing  recognition  and  emphasis  on  stakeholder  model  of  governance 
amongst all stakeholders including institutional investors. 

3.  In  order  to  align  the  NVGs  with  the  emerging  global  concerns,  the  Sustainable 
Development  Goals  (SDGs),  and  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  & 
Human Rights (UNGPs), the NVGs were revised and released as the National Guidelines 
on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBCs) in March 2019.  

 

 

4.  In November 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) constituted a Committee on 
Business  Responsibility  Reporting  (‘Committee’)  for  finalising  Business  Responsibility 
Reporting  formats  for  listed  and  unlisted  companies,  based  on  the  framework  of  the 
NGRBCs. SEBI was also part of this Committee and worked on the report. The report of 
the Committee was released on August 11, 2020. 1  

 
B.  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)  

 

1.  The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Business  Responsibility  Report  be  called  the 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). These disclosures, which are 
from  an  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (“ESG”)  perspective  that  have  been

recommended  in  the  BRSR,  are  intended  to  enable  businesses  to  engage  more 
meaningfully  with  their  stakeholders,  and  encourage  them  to  go  beyond  regulatory 
financial compliance and report on their social and environmental impacts. 

 

2.  The comprehensive format for reporting as recommended by the Committee for listed 
entities  is  enclosed  at  Annex  –  1.  Further,  in  order  to  enable  better  reporting  by 
companies, the Committee has also developed a guidance  note to define and interpret 
the scope of each question in the BRSR (enclosed at Annex – 2). 

 

C.  Proposal 

 

It  is  proposed  that  the  format  for  business  responsibility  and  sustainability  reporting,  as 
recommended by the Committee, shall be applicable to the top 1000 listed entities by market 
capitalization. It is also proposed that to begin with, the new format will be adopted by such 
listed entities on a voluntary basis for the financial year 2020 – 21 (for those who choose not 
to adopt the new format, the existing format will apply) and mandatorily from the financial 
year 2021-22.   

 

D.  Public Comments: 

In order to take into consideration, the views of various stakeholders, public comments are 
invited  on  the  aforesaid  business  responsibility  and  sustainability  reporting  format.
