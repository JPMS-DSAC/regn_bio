1992

1.  On  04-03-2008  SEBI  had  put  up  a  consultative  paper  on  amendments  to  SEBI 
(Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 for public comments. In order 
to harmonize requirements of acquisition/sale of shares reported under the SEBI 
(Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  1992  and  the  requirements  of  the 
SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 it was 
proposed  that  transaction  disclosures  made  under  either  regulation  (with  the 
same  or  higher  level  of  disclosure)  should  be  deemed  to  be  good  disclosure 
under the other. It was also proposed to increase the harmonization between the 
two in terms of threshold limits set. 

In order to have an efficient market, it is essential that all relevant information 
which  has  an  impact  on  the  price  of  the  shares  of  a  company  is  promptly 
disseminated to the market. The listing agreement of the company with the stock 
exchanges and SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 requires 
the  company  to  make  continuous  and  prompt  dissemination  of  the  price 
sensitive information to the market through stock exchanges and other print and 
electronic  media.    The  Directors/Officers  of  the  company,  being  insiders  have 
access to the unpublished price sensitive information. The dealing in shares by 
major shareholders itself is price sensitive information and therefore, Regulation 
13 of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 requires that these 
entities  shall  disseminate  information  about  their  dealing  in  the  shares  of  the 
company on crossing certain threshold limit prescribed in the regulation to the 
company.  The  stock  exchange  in  turn  disseminates  the  same  to  the  market 
through  electronic  notices  to  its  members  and  also  displays  the  same  on  its 
website. 

 

3.  Under  the  present  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  1992  the 
shareholder/director/officer  of  a  listed  company  is  required  to  disclose  to  the 
company  information  regarding  the  shareholding  or  voting  rights  within  4 
working days of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition or 
sale of shares or voting rights or of becoming the director or officer of the said 
company, as the case may be. The company in turn is required to disclose this to 
the Stock Exchanges, on which the company is listed, within five days. Thus, on 
occasion,  a  total  of  9  days  may  pass  before  price  sensitive  information  is 

disseminated to the public.  The rationale for the said disclosure is diluted over 
the 9 days period provided for it. 

4.  As per SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 
the acquirer is given 2 days time to inform the company and the stock exchange 
about the acquisition of shares after a certain limit is breached as specified in the 
said regulation. Stock Exchanges in turn are required to “immediately” display 
the said information on the trading screen, the notice board and on its website.    

In line with SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 
1997,  it  is  proposed  that  the  time  gap  between  the  date  of  transaction  and  the 
date of dissemination of the information by the stock exchange may be reduced 
from nine days to two working days by making necessary amendments to the 
relevant  provisions  of  Insider  Trading  Regulations.  This  would  make  it  
mandatory  for  a  person  to  report  the  transactions  within  one  working  day  of 
trading to the company and company in turn shall inform the stock exchanges, 
where  the  shares  are  listed,  within  one  working  day  of  receipt  of  information. 
The Stock exchanges shall ensure immediate dissemination of information to the 
market.  

The details of the proposed amendment to SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) 
Regulations, 1992 vis-à-vis existing regulation is provided in the table below. 

Comments  are  invited  from  the  public  on  the  above  proposals.  The  comments 
may  be  sent  by  e-mail  upto  26th  June,  2008  to  jyotis@sebi.gov.in  and
