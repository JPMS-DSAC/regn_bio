Primary market debt offering through private placement on electronic book 

Consultation paper 

 

1.  Background 

Over the past several years, various measures have been taken by SEBI, Government and RBI 

for  development  of  the  corporate  bond  markets.    The  Indian  corporate  bond  market  has 

evolved gradually over a period of time.   

 

SEBI notified the regulatory framework for issue and listing of corporate bonds through SEBI 

(Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008.    This  regulatory  framework 

prescribed  a  disclosure  based  regime,  whereas  the  earlier  regime  required  mandatory 

investment  grade  rating  for  public  issues.    The  total  primary  market  issuance  has  increased 

from Rs.1,74,781 crore in 2008-09 to Rs. 4,13,558 crore in 2014-15.

From the above table, it can be seen that public issues of corporate bonds has increased  from 

Rs  1,500  crores  in  2008-09  to  Rs  9,451  crores  in  the  year  2010-11.  Thereafter,  in  the  year 

2011-12,  the  public  issue  of  corporate  bonds  increased  from  Rs  35,611  crores  to  Rs  42,383 

crores  in  the  year  2013-14  due  to  tax  free  bond  issuances  and  consequently  the  issuance 

declined  to  Rs  9,713  crores  in  the  year  2014-15.  Further,  in  case  of  private  placement,  the 

issuances have increased from Rs 173,281 crores in 2008-09 to Rs 404,136 crores in 2014-15.  

It  can  be  also  be  seen  that  in  all  the  financial  years,  private  placement  of  corporate  bonds 

constituted a substantial proportion of the total issuances. 

 

IOSCO’s  Emerging  Market  Committee  (EMC)  published  a  report  during  November  2011  on 

development  of  corporate  bond  markets  in  the  emerging  markets.    As  per  the  report,  it  has 

been,  inter-alia,  observed  that  aside  from  public  issuance  and  private  placements,  emerging 

markets  (EMs)  have  introduced  hybrid  offer  regimes.  Among  the  EMs  surveyed,  the 

alternative offer regime  carries the  most importance in Malaysia, India, Brazil, and Thailand 

accounting  for  99%,  80%,  70%  and  36%  of  total  issuance,  respectively.    A  hybrid  regime 

refers to issuance frameworks that contain elements of both public and private regimes and 

which  has  lighter  regulatory  requirements  and  are  designed  with  target  investors  of 

corporate bonds in mind – i.e. professional or institutional investors. 

 

2.  Introduction of Electronic Book for Private Placement  

SEBI  placed  an  agenda  item  on  introduction  of  an  electronic  book  for  primary  market  debt 

offering through private placement before the "Corporate Bonds and Securitization Advisory 

Committee" (CoBoSAC) meeting held in July 2015.  The committee, in-principle, accepted the 

said proposal and recommended the initiation of public consultation process on the captioned 

proposal. 

 

SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008  govern  public  issue  of  debt 

securities  and  listing  of  debt  securities  issued  through  public  issue  or  on  private  placement

basis, on a recognized stock exchange.  It has been observed from the available data that the 

majority  of  the  issuances  in  India  take  place  through  private  placement  route,  which  are 

subsequently  listed  on  stock  exchange.    During  financial  year  2014-15,  private  placement 

accounted  for  approximately  98%  of  debt  securities  issuances  that  have  been  subsequently 

listed.  These issues of private placements are usually negotiated by the issuers directly with 

the  investors  such  as  Qualified  Institutional  Buyers  (QIBs)/  High  Net  Worth  individuals 

(HNIs)  or  placed  through  the  arrangers  over-the-telephone  market  and  then  listed  on  stock 

exchanges.  It  is  felt  that  this  mechanism  may  lack  transparency  and  is  an  informal  way  to 

discover price. 

 

Based on a review of sample private placement allotment data for FY 2014-15, received from 

the market participants regarding types of investors coming to the primary market for private 

placement of corporate bonds,  it has been observed that banks and mutual funds, inter-alia, 

constitute the majority of the investors.  

 

The  key  benefits  of  electronic  book  vis-à-vis  over-the-telephone  market,  inter-alia,  are 

improvement in efficiency, transparency of the price discovery mechanism and also reduction 

of  cost  and  time  taken  for  such  issuance.    Usage  of  electronic  book  by  investors  for  trading 

securities  in  Indian  markets  have  demonstrated  that  the  benefits  can  percolate  in  terms  of 

efficient price discovery, reduction in timelines, reduction of cost, transparency, etc. 

 

3.  Proposals  

3.1  Keeping  in  view  the  benefits  of  electronic  auction  mechanism  such  as  making  it  a 

formal and transparent mechanism, it is proposed that a platform for electronic book 

may be created in India. 

3.2  Applicability – Optional or mandatory: With respect to this platform for electronic 

book, two approaches are possible:  

3.2.1  To  begin  with,  the  electronic  book  may  be  provided  as  an  alternative  to  the 

existing mechanism.  Subsequently, based on the performance/ acceptability of 

such  a  book  ,  this  could  be  made  mandatory  for  all  issuers  for  issuance  of 

privately placed Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs), which are proposed to be 

listed or ;

3.2.2  To  make electronic  book    mandatory  for  all private  placement issues  having a 

threshold of Rs. 500- Rs 1,000 crores in terms of amount being raised. 

 

3.3  In  order  to  enable  issuers  to  use  electronic  book  for  private  placement  of  corporate 

bonds,  which  are  subsequently  proposed  to  be  listed,  it  is  proposed  to  create  a 

platform for creation of electronic book, which would be provided by entity to be called 

as “Electronic Book Provider” (EBP).   

 

3.4  The issuer shall enter into an agreement with the EBP, before using its services.  The 

agreement shall contain necessary terms and conditions for usage of the book as well 

as rights and liabilities of both the parties. 

 

3.5  The  issuer  and  EBP  shall  ensure  that  all  requisite  compliances  prescribed  under 

various  legislations  such  as  Companies  Act,  SEBI  Regulations  etc.  with  regards  to 

private placement, are adhered to by the electronic book.   For example – the EBP shall 

ensure that there is no public solicitation and the total number of bidders should not 

exceed  200  (excluding  QIBs)  as  required  under  Companies  Act,  2013  and  the  rules 

made thereunder. 

 

3.6  Eligibility criteria as EBP : It is proposed that the following would be eligible to act as 

EBP:-  

3.6.1  Regulated  market 

infrastructure 

institutions  such  as  recognized  stock 

exchange(s) / depositories  and  

3.6.2  Category I Merchant Bankers (having minimum networth of Rs. 100 crores).  

3.7 Condition  for  acting  as  a  EBP:  -  The  EBP  would  provide  services  through  an 

electronic book.  Therefore, there is a need for putting in place criteria so as to ensure 

high level of service and prevention of conflict of interest, if any, and conditions to act 

as EBP shall be as follows:- 

a)  EBP shall obtain prior approval of SEBI before establishing and offering its services. 

b)  The  EBP  shall  ensure  compliance  with  all  requisite  conditions,  provisions, 

legislations etc., with regard to private placement of debt securities. 

Page 4 of 7 

  

 

c)  The EBP shall ensure safety, secrecy, integrity and retrievability of data. 

d)  EBP  should  own  electronic  book  website/  URL  on  which  it  proposes  to  offer  its 

services. 

e)  EBP should have adequate human, technology and risk management capabilities. 

f)  EBP should have policies and procedures to address potential conflicts which may 

arise among issuer(s), bidders and EBP. 

g)  In order to enhance transparency, self bidding by EBP (or proprietary bidding) may 

not  be  allowed.  However,  if  safeguards  such  as  bidding  on  arms-length  basis  is 

there , then such bidding and subsequent disclosure of same may be considered. 

h)  Adequate backup, disaster management and recovery plans should be there for the 

electronic book so provided by EBP.   

i)  Electronic book so provided by EBP would be subject to periodic audit by Certified 

Information Systems Auditor (CISA).
