CONSULTATION PAPER FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS 

AMENDMENTS  TO  SEBI  (PORTFOLIO  MANGERS)  REGULATIONS,  1993 
PURSUANT TO INTRODCUTION OF SECTION 9A IN THE INCOME TAX ACT, 1961 

 

 

1.0  Objective 

1.1 

The objective of this consultation paper is to seek comments from the public 

for the purpose of laying down an enabling framework for the registration of 

Eligible  Fund  Managers  to  manage  Eligible  Investment  Funds  pursuant  to 

insertion of Section 9A in the Income Tax Act, 1961.  

2.0  Background 

2.1 

The Hon’ble Finance Minister while presenting the Union Budget for the year 

2015-16 announced:  

“The  present  taxation  structure  has  an  inbuilt  incentive  for  fund 

managers to operate from offshore locations.  To encourage such offshore 

fund managers to relocate to India, I propose to modify the Permanent 

Establishment  (PE)  norms  to  the  effect  that  mere  presence  of  a  fund 

manager in India would not constitute PE of the offshore funds resulting 

in adverse tax consequences.” 

 

2.2 

Subsequently,  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961  has  been  amended  by  inserting 

Section 9A in the Act (popularly known as ‘Safe Harbour Norms’).  This section 

inter-alia  provides  that  fund  management  activity  carried  out  through  an 

Eligible  Fund  Manager  located  in  India  acting  on  behalf  of  an  Eligible 

Investment  Fund  shall  not  constitute  business  connection  in  India  of  such 

fund  subject  to  the  fund  and  the  fund  manager  meeting  certain  specified 

conditions mentioned therein.  As per Section 9A of Income Tax Act, 1961: 

2.2.1  Eligible Investment Fund (EIF) is a fund established or incorporated 

or registered outside India, which collects funds from its members for 

investing it for their benefit and fulfils following conditions namely: 

a)  the fund is not a person resident in India; 

 

1 

b)  the  fund  is  a  resident  of  a  country  or  a  specified  territory  with 

which an agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of section 90 or 

sub-section (1) of section 90A has been entered into; 

c)  the aggregate participation or investment in the fund, directly or 

indirectly,  by  persons  resident  in  India  does  not  exceed  five  per 

cent of the corpus of the fund; 

d)  the  fund  and  its  activities  are  subject  to  applicable  investor 

protection regulations in the country or specified territory where 

it is established or incorporated or is a resident; 

e)  the fund has a minimum of twenty-five members who are, directly 

or indirectly, not connected persons; 

f)  any member of the fund along with connected persons shall not 

have any participation interest, directly or indirectly, in the fund 

exceeding ten per cent; 

g)  the aggregate participation interest, directly or indirectly, of ten 

or less members along with their connected persons in the fund, 

shall be less than fifty per cent; 

h)  the fund shall not invest more than twenty per cent of its corpus 

in any entity; 

i)  the fund shall not make any investment in its associate entity; 

j)  the monthly average of the corpus of the fund shall not be less than 

one hundred crore rupees: 

Provided that if the fund has been established or incorporated in 

the  previous  year, the  corpus  of  fund  shall  not be  less  than  one 

hundred crore rupees at the end of such previous year; 

k)  the  fund  shall  not  carry  on  or  control  and  manage,  directly  or 

indirectly, any business in India or from India; 

l)  the  fund  is  neither  engaged  in  any  activity  which  constitutes  a 

business  connection  in  India  nor  has  any  person  acting  on  its 

behalf whose activities constitute a business connection in India 

 

2 

other than the activities undertaken by the eligible fund manager 

on its behalf; 

m) the remuneration paid by the fund to an eligible fund manager in 

respect  of  fund  management  activity  undertaken  by  him  on  its 

behalf is not less than the arm's length price of the said activity  

Provided that the conditions specified in clauses (e), (f) and (g) 

shall  not  apply  in  case  of  an  investment  fund  set  up  by  the 

Government or the Central Bank of a foreign State or a sovereign 

fund, or such other fund as the Central Government may subject 

to conditions if any, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify 

in this behalf. 

 

2.2.2  Subsequently, in the Union Budget 2016-17, above mentioned clause 

(b) and clause (k) have been announced to be modified as under: 

“(b) the fund is a resident of a country or a specified territory with 

which an agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of section 90 or 

sub-section  (1)  of  section  90A  has  been  entered  into  or  is 

established  or  incorporated  or  registered  in  a  country  or  a 

specified territory notified by Central Government in this behalf.” 

 

“(k) the fund shall not carry on or control and manage, directly or 

indirectly, any business in India” 

 

The amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2017 and shall apply 

to the assessment year 2017-18 and subsequent assessment years. 

 

2.2.3  Eligible  Fund  Manager  (EFM)  is  any  person  who  is  engaged  in  the 

activity of fund management and fulfils the following conditions: 

a)  the  person  is  not  an  employee  of  the  eligible  investment  fund  or  a 

connected person of the fund; 

 

3 

b)  the person is registered as a fund manager or an investment advisor 

in accordance with the specified regulations; 

c)  the person is acting in the ordinary course of his business as a fund 

manager; 

d)  the  person  along  with  his  connected  persons  shall  not  be  entitled, 

directly  or  indirectly,  to  more  than  twenty  per  cent  of  the  profits 

accruing  or  arising  to  the  eligible  investment  fund  from  the 

transactions carried out by the fund through the fund manager. 

 

2.3 

Further the government issued Income Tax (5th Amendment) Rules, 2016 on 

March 15, 2016 providing guidelines for the application of Section 9A. 

 

2.4  One of the conditions stated in sub Section (4)(b) of Section 9(A) is that the 

 
2.5 

EFM  shall  be  registered  as  a  fund  manager  or  an  investment  adviser  in 

accordance with the specified regulations.  Further, the specified regulations 

have been defined to mean Securities and Exchange Board of India (Portfolio 

Managers)  Regulations,  1993  (PMS  Regulations)    or  the  Securities  and 

Exchange  Board  of  India  (Investment  Advisers)  Regulations,  2013  (IA 

Regulations),  or  such  other  regulations  made  under  the  Securities  and 

Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  which  may  be  notified  by  the  Central 

Government. 

In the backdrop of the CBDT notification on Safe Harbour norms, SEBI has had 

a series of interactions with various stake  holders. During such meetings to 

discuss the enabling framework for registration of EFMs, it was observed that 

IA  Regulations  do  not  allow  an  investment  adviser  to  handle  funds  and 

securities of its clients.  Further, as advisory activity is also permitted under 

PMS Regulations, participants mostly expressed interest to be registered only 

under  PMS  Regulations. 

  The  participants  also  observed  that  certain 

provisions  mentioned  in  PMS  Regulations  may  not  be  feasible  for  portfolio 

managers  pertaining  to  their  fund  management  activities  for  eligible 

 

4 

investment  funds.  Therefore,  amendments  may  be  required  in  the  existing 

PMS Regulations.  

 

2.6 

In view of the above, to enable EFMs to manage EIFs, as envisaged under the 

provisions  of  Section  9(A)  of  Income  Tax  Act,  1961,  amendments  to  SEBI 

(Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 are proposed.
