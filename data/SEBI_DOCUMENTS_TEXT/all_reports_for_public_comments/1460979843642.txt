Consultation Paper on Distribution of Cash Benefits through Depositories 

For investments in various securities, investors receive cash benefits such as dividend, 

interest and redemption payments.  At present, cash benefits are distributed directly by 

issuer  companies  to  the  investors  mostly  through  their  Registrar  and  Transfer  Agents 

(RTAs). Though this model has worked  fine, there is further scope for  improvement in 

the  areas  related  to  efficient  tracking  of  payment,  having  a  consolidated  view  of  all 

benefits received, non-payment and delayed payment, updation of investor bank details, 

disclosure  of  unpaid  cash  benefits,    etc.  In  order  to  further  enhance  the  investor 

experience and to make securities market more efficient, SEBI is considering a proposal 

for distribution of cash benefits through depositories. It is proposed to seek the views of 

various stakeholders and public on the proposal in order to take an informed decision.  

Background  

In India, although distribution of non-cash benefits such as bonus, rights, amalgamations, 

demergers, sub-division etc are handled through depositories, cash benefits are handled 

outside  the  depository  system.  Depositories  provide  details  of  shareholders  and 

bondholders  including  name,  address  and  bank  details  to  the  respective  issuer 

companies which, in turn, arrange for distribution of cash benefits.  

Issues in the current process 

All cash benefit distributions are being processed outside the depository system. Thus, 

no  information  is  available  in  the  demat  account  with  respect  to  entitlement  of  cash 

benefits and payment of the same to the investors. 

In case any investor requires any information  or has a complaint with respect to above 

benefits, they are required to approach the respective issuer companies or their Registrar 

& Transfer Agents (RTAs) which may be inconvenient to the investors.  

The issues that investors may be facing are as under:

1.  Tracking of payments: It may be difficult for the investors to track whether they have 

received  all  the  cash  benefits  due.  Investors  need  to  track  the  corporate 

announcements for the benefits due to them and correlate the same with bank credits 

to  understand  if any  credits  are  missing.  Investor  can  only  see  a  credit  in his  bank 

statement  and  the  narration  is  often  incomplete  for  the  investor  to  understand  the 

nature of credit. In case of missing or wrong bank details, the investor is despatched 

a physical warrant. In case of any problem with the warrant or revalidation, the investor 

is required to contact the issuer company or RTA. 

2.  Consolidated  statement  for  all  cash  benefits  received:  Investors  do  not  get  a 

consolidated statement of all cash benefits due and paid to them. Depositories cannot 

provide  such  a  statement  as  they  do  not  have  the  information.  Investors  need  to 

engage in culling out such details by browsing  through their bank statements when 

such information is needed, for example, for tax filings. 

3.  No alerts: Unlike in the case of non-cash corporate actions where depositories send 

SMS alerts, investors may not get SMS alerts or email alerts for cash benefits paid to 

them.  

4.  No  correlation  with  demat  transactions:  In  the  case  of  bonds  and  other  debt 

instruments, securities may be debited from the client’s account by the issuer/RTA but 

at the same time the redemption payment may not have been received by the investor. 

An  investor  needs  to  track  and  ensure  that  he  has  indeed  received  redemption 

proceeds and contact the issuer/RTA in case of any problem. 

5.  No tracking of invalid bank details: When electronic credit  to the investor’s bank 

account  fails,  such  information  is  only  available  at  the  issuer  company/  its  RTA.  In 

such cases, Issuer Company delivers a physical warrant to the investor. It is also not 

uncommon where investor receives electronic credit from one company, but does not 

get electronic credit from another company, despite his bank details being the same. 

Besides, every individual company will independently attempt to send electronic credit

since it is not aware that such credit has failed in other companies and thus the bank 

details may not be correct.  

6.  No  tracking  of  returned  undelivered:  Warrants  despatched  by  issuer  companies 

may be returned undelivered due to address of client not being updated. There is no 

central tracking of the same, as the information is only available with each company/ 

its RTA. 

7.  Information on unpaid dividend on company website: To check unpaid dividend 

information, an investor needs to visit websites of each company.  

8.  No  central  monitoring:  As  currently  all  information  related  to  cash  benefit  and 

redemption proceeds distribution is handled by Issuer Company or RTA, there is no 

central  information  available  to  monitor  the  same.  There  is  no  independent  way  to 

check whether the company has indeed distributed all the cash benefits and followed 

legal provisions including timelines. 

9.  Investor  inconvenience:    With  the  demat  system,  for  all  transactions  such  as 

transfer, demat and remat requests, address and contact details change, nomination 

and  transmission,  etc,  the  investor  is  no  longer  required  to  approach  each  issuer 

company  or  its  RTA.  All  such  transactions,  service  requests  and  changes  can  be 

carried out at a single place, viz., the Depository Participant  (DP) where the demat 

account  is  held.  In  the  case  of  cash  benefits,  for  any  information  or  complaint, 

investors have to contact the Issuer company or its RTA. 

Proposal  

All cash benefits including dividend, interest and redemption proceeds may be distributed 

by depositories in the case of all securities held in demat form. Issuers may be required 

to transfer the total amount due to clients of each depository to that depository, which is 

also the registered holder of such securities. The depository in turn will distribute the same 

to its beneficial owners. In respect of securities held in physical form, the issuer company 

may continue to handle the distribution of cash benefits.

Advantages of distribution through Depositories 

A.  Benefits to Investors 

1.  Single record of all cash benefits received by investor in his account: Investors 

will be able to get a consolidated statement of all the cash benefits due to them and 

credited,  along  with  all  details  such  as  announcement  date,  dividend  rate,  amount 

due, date of credit to bank account, bank transaction reference, etc. Demat account 

statement can thus become a single record of all details with respect to cash benefits 

such  as  entitlement  of  cash  benefit,  details  of  credit  received  in  bank  account,  tax 

deducted at source, etc. 

2.  Simplified monitoring: As all details related to cash benefits are available at a single 

place, monitoring of the same will become easy for the investor. For example in case 

of non-receipt of some cash benefits, investor will easily be able to identify from his 

demat account statement. In fact, such missed payments would be minimised as there 

will be central monitoring by the depository. Investors will also be able to easily view 

which companies in their portfolio are paying dividend, the rate of dividend and which 

companies are not paying dividend. 

3.  Immediate alerts: Investors can receive directly from the depository SMS or email 

alerts on cash benefits distributed, just as in the case of other transactions. 

4.  Shorter  turnaround  time  for  receiving  cash  benefits:  As  majority  of  cash 

distribution will be carried out in electronic form, investor will get cash benefits in short 

time.  Further,  in  case  of  any  rejection  of  electronic  credit,  DP  will  also  be  able  to 

approach investor for updation of bank details so that investor can get credit directly 

to his bank account electronically.  

5.  Better enforcement of fixed pay date: In order to enable investors to manage their 

cash/securities  flows  efficiently  and  to  enhance  process  transparency,  SEBI  had 

mandated  companies  to  have  a  pre-announced  fixed  pay  date  for  payment  of

dividends. With depositories  crediting directly,  better enforcement  of fixed  pay  date 

can be achieved. Investors will be able to expect credit of dividend on specified dates. 

6.  No  need  for  safe-keeping  of  paper  related  to  cash  benefits:  As  details  of  cash 

benefits will become part of demat account statement, investors will not be required 

to maintain papers related to cash benefits. Investors will be able to view these details 

as and when required.  

7.  Updation of bank details: In case of failure to credit electronically due to invalid or 

absent bank details, such accounts  can be tagged and efforts  can be made by the 

depository to contact the client and get updated details. Information can be provided 

to DPs to contact the client and update the details.  Investors can also be informed 

through SMS and email alerts. Messages will be included in the Consolidated Account 

Statement  and  demat  statement.  This  will  facilitate  achievement  of  the  goal  to 

eventually have all cash benefits credited electronically. 

8.  Investor convenience: As information of cash benefits for all issuers will be available 

centrally in depository system, for any query related to cash  benefits,  investor can 

contact his DP who will able to provide the necessary details instead of approaching 

various issuers.  

B.  Benefits to Issuers 

1.  The need to maintain separate infrastructure to maintain cash benefit information will 

reduce.  For  example,  today  in  the  case  of  companies  whose  shares  are  held  in 

dematerialised  form,  no  infrastructure  is  required  on  part  of  issuer  companies  to 

maintain shareholder data. Similarly, all information related to cash benefits including 

paid, unpaid details will be  available  in the depository system for  the companies to 

download as and when required.  

2.  At present, each  issuer  appoints  banker for distribution  of  cash  benefits  and  sends 

communication  to  its  each  shareholder  about  credit  of  cash  benefits  separately.  In 

case cash benefit distribution is carried out by depository, there may be economies of

scale. Depositories will also send SMS or email alerts to investors instantaneously. All 

information of cash benefits will be available in demat account statements which are 

sent to investors at defined frequency. Therefore, issuers will not be required to send 

communication to each shareholder separately saving on the costs.  

3.  As complete data is available in depository system, reconciliation will be simplified and 

automated for the issuers.  Compliance with obligations of distribution, disclosure of 

unclaimed cash benefits, and transfer of unclaimed benefits to Investor Education and 

Protection  Fund  etc  under  Companies  Act  can  be  automatically  ensured  through 

market infrastructure.
