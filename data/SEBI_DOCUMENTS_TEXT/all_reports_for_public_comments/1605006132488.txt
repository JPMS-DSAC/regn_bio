Consultation Paper on the Applicability and role of the Risk Management 

Committee 

 
1.  Objective  

 
To  solicit  public  comments  /  views  on  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  SEBI 
(Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  (hereinafter 
referred  as  “LODR  Regulations”  or  “LODR”) regarding  the  applicability and  role  of 
the risk management committee. 
 

2.  Background and need for review 

 
2.1. In  June  2017,  a  committee  on  corporate  governance  headed  by  Shri.  Uday 
Kotak  was  constituted  by  SEBI  with  an  aim  to  improve  the  standards  of 
Corporate Governance of listed entities. Based on the recommendations of the 
Committee,  the  following  amendments  were  made  to  LODR  Regulations  with 
respect to the Risk Management Committee: 
(1)  The  requirement  of  constitution  of  Risk  Management  Committee  was 
extended  to  the  top  500  listed  entities  on  the  basis  of  the  market 
capitalisation, from the top 100 listed entities.  

(2)  In  view  of  the  increasing  relevance  of  cyber  security  and  related  risks,  it 
was specified that the role of Risk Management Committee shall cover this 
specific aspect of cyber security risk.  

(3)  The Risk Management Committee  was  mandated to meet at least once a 

year. 

 

2.2. Considering the multitude of risks faced by listed entities, risk management has 
emerged as a very important function of the board. The Covid-19 pandemic has 
also reinforced the need for a robust risk management framework. While LODR 
Regulations specify the role of various board committees of listed entities such 
as  Audit  Committee,  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  and 
Stakeholder  Relationship  Committee,  defining  the  role  and  responsibilities  of 
the  Risk  Management  Committee  (except  for  cyber-security  risk)  is  left  to 
individual boards of listed entities.  
 

2.3. In light of the increasing importance of the risk management function, a need is 

thus felt to: 
(1)  Extend the requirement of formation of a Risk Management Committee to a 

larger number of listed entities  

(2)  Define the role and responsibilities of the Risk Management Committee in 

the LODR Regulations and

(3)  Increase  the  frequency  and  define  a  quorum  for  the  meetings  of  the  Risk 

Management Committee. 

 

3.  Proposal 

 
In view of the above, the following are proposed: 
3.1. The  requirement  of  constituting  a  Risk  Management  Committee  may  be 
extended from the top 500 to the top 1000 listed entities, on the basis of market 
capitalization.  

 

3.2. The  role  and  responsibility  of  the  Risk  Management  Committee  may  inter-alia 

include the following: 

(1)  To formulate a detailed risk management policy which shall include: 

 
(a)  A framework for identification of internal and external risks specifically 
faced by the listed entity, in particular including financial, operational, 
sectoral,  sustainability 
(specifically,  Environmental,  Social  and 
Governance related risks and impact), information and cyber security 
risks  

(b)  Measures for risk mitigation  
(c)  Systems for internal controls 
(d)  Business contingency plan 

 

 

(2)  To  monitor  and  oversee  implementation  of  the  risk  management  policy, 
including evaluating the adequacy of risk management and internal control 
systems;  
 

(3)  Ensure that appropriate methodology, processes and systems are in place 
to  monitor  and  evaluate  risks  associated  with  the  business  of  the  listed 
entity; 

(4)  To  review  the  risk  management  policy  on  annual  basis,  including  by 

considering the changing industry dynamics and evolving complexity; 
 

(5)  To  keep  the  board  informed  about  the  nature  and  content  of  its 

discussions, recommendations and actions to be taken; 
 

(6)  The  appointment,  removal  and  terms  of  remuneration  of  the  Chief  Risk 
Officer  (if  any)  shall  be  subject  to  review  by  the  Risk  Management 
Committee, jointly with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

Further, the Risk Management Committee shall coordinate its activities with the 
Audit Committee in instances where there is any overlap with audit activities.  
 

3.3. In  line  with  the  powers  of  the  Audit  Committee  under  LODR  Regulations,  the 
Risk Management Committee shall also have powers to seek information from 
any  employee,  obtain  outside  legal  or  other  professional  advice  and  secure 
attendance of outsiders with relevant expertise, if it considers necessary. 
 

3.4. The  frequency  of  the  meetings  of  the  Risk  Management  Committee  may  be 

increased to at least twice in a year.  

 

3.5. While  no  change  is  proposed  to  the  composition1  of  the  Risk  Management 
Committee, the quorum for a meeting of the Risk Management Committee may 
be  either  two  members  or  one  third  of  the  members  of  the  Committee, 
whichever is greater, including at least one member of the board of directors in 
attendance. 
 

3.6. The proposed amendments to LODR Regulations are placed at Annex I.
