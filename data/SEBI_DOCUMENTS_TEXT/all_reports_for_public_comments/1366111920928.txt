Format for providing inputs / suggestions on the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider 

Trading) Regulations, 1992  

Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (“SEBI”)  has  constituted  a  High  Level 
Committee to review the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (“PIT 
Regulations”)  and  to  suggest  suitable  recommendations  for  amendments  as  it 
considers necessary.  

Two decades have passed since the PIT Regulations were notified. Since then there 
have  been  several  amendments  to  the  Regulations  and  judicial  paradigm  through 
case laws have also evolved in India. There have been various prominent judgments 
by  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court,  various  Hon’ble  High  Courts  and  the  Hon’ble  Securities 
Appellate Tribunal that have further clarified and redefined the scope and applicability of 
the PIT Regulations. A need has thus arisen to review and realign the PIT Regulations 
with  these  developments  and  to  ensure  that  they  reflect  the  best  practices  adopted 
globally.  

As part of a consultative process in the exercise of reviewing this  significant  piece  of 
legislation, the High Level Committee has decided to seek inputs and suggestions from 
the public at the outset on any aspect of the PIT Regulations, about which sections of 
the public may believe that intervention in the form of a review is required.  

In order to receive such inputs and suggestions in a structured manner, the High Level 
Committee to review PIT Regulations hereby invites suggestions from members of the 
public in the following  format:-
