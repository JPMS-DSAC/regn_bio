Designing a Framework for Enhanced Market Borrowings by large Corporates  

Consultation Paper  

 

1.  Budget Announcement and its objective  

1.1.  Government  of  India  in  the  Union  Budget  of  2018-19,  made  the  following 

announcement: 

“SEBI  will  also  consider  mandating,  beginning  with  large  Corporates,  to  meet 
about one-fourth of their financing needs from the debt market.” 

1.2.  A series of steps have been taken, over time, by Government in consultation with 
Regulators, to develop and deepen the bond market. At the same time, however, 
concerns  have  been  raised  about  the  ability  of  banks  to  finance  increasing 
borrowing needs of the corporates, especially as the investment cycle has shown 
an  upward  tick.  Accordingly,  the  said  budget  announcement  may  be  seen  as  a 
step in the direction of the larger goal of not only to reduce reliance on banks to 
finance corporates but also to develop a liquid and vibrant corporate bond market.  

2.  Evolving a framework for operationalising the intent of budget announcement  

2.1.  Evolving  a  framework  for  operationalising  the  extant  budget  announcement  may 
require  identification  of  the  meaning  and  scope  of  the  terms  "large  corporates", 
"financing  needs"  and  "mandate",  which  have  been  used  therein.  The  same  are 
discussed as under: 

a) 

Identifying large corporates and their financing needs: The intention of the 
budget announcement is to nudge corporates (who have borrowing needs) to 
access the bond market. Accordingly, a large corporate could be one who;  

i.  has a certain threshold of outstanding borrowings; 

ii.  has a reasonable credit rating;  

iii. 

intends to finance itself with long-term borrowings (i.e. borrowings  above 1 
year);and  

iv.  has listed its securities on the stock exchange. 

b)  What constitutes mandate: Given the current stage of development of bond 
market  in  India,  any  mandatory  requirement  would  need  to  be  light-touch  in 
nature  and  would  also  need  to  provide  enough  leeway  to  the  identified 
corporates to meet the mandatory requirement from the bond market.

3.  Current market structure and inference drawn therefrom  

 

3.1.  Some of the measures that have been taken for the development of bond market 
includes:  mandatory  reporting  requirement  of  OTC 
in  bonds  and 
dissemination of the data in public domain, setting up of dedicated debt segment 
on  exchanges,  uniformity  in  market  conventions,  electronic  bidding  platform  for 
private placement, consolidation of debt ISINs etc. These measures have resulted 
in  an  uptick  in  the  share  of  bond  market  to  total  corporate  credit.  The  budget 
announcement, as above, is a further step towards deepening the bond market.

3.2.  Before, however, arriving at the granular level details of the operational framework 
underpinning  the  Budget  announcement,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  bond 
market  micro-structure  and  the  lessons  that  can  be  learnt  for  framing  the 
operational framework.  

Bank Financing Vs. Bond Financing: 

3.3.  Chart1  below  shows  the  percentage  share  of  bank  and  bond  financing  to 
corporate sector over a period of 5 years. As is seen, the share of bond market in 
comparison to bank financing has seen a steady growth. Further, FY 2016-17 was 
a  watershed  year  when  share  of  bond  market  financing  overtook  that  of  bank 
financing.

Credit rating profile of issuers: 

 

3.4.  If we catalogue the primary issuances of listed corporate bonds, across multiple 
years,  in  different  rating  buckets,  it  is  seen  that  the majority  of  the  issuances  is 
skewed  towards  credit  rating  of  "AA"  and  above.  Chart  2  below  represents  the 
bonds issued in different rating categories.

3.5.  As  can  be  seen  from  the  chart  above,  around  90%  of  the  issuances  happen  in 

credit rating bucket of "AA or above”. 

3.6.  One  of  the  primary  reasons for  a  high  concentration  of  issuance  in  paper  rated 
“AA and above” is because institutional investors, who are the largest investors in 
bond  market,  invest  primarily  in  highly  rated  paper.  With  a  view  to  address  this 
issue, the budget of 2018-19 has made the following announcement: 

"Corporate  debt  securities  rated  „BBB‟  or  equivalent  are  investment  grade.  In 
India,  most  regulators  permit  debt  securities with the  „AA‟  rating  only  as  eligible 
for  investment.  It  is  now  time  to  move  from  „AA‟  to  „A‟  grade  ratings.  The 
Government and concerned Regulators will take necessary action." 

3.7.  The  operationlisation  of  this  budget  announcement  is  likely  to  facilitate  even 
lower rated borrowers (borrowers rated between AA - and A) to raise funds from 
the bond market. 

3.8.  Apart from the above, the rating profile of corporates could be further augmented 
by  providing  credit  enhancement  facilities.  This  is  especially  relevant  for 
companies in the infrastructure sector as generally they have a lower rating. With 
a view to improve the credit rating of infrastructure companies, the Union Budget

Public Issue 

Private Placement

3.10. As  per  the  above  charts,  corporate  bond  issuance  is  done  primarily  through 
private placement route. Further, almost 60-70% of the total issues are done by 
financial  sector  entities  and  the  private  sector  non-financial  entities  constitutes 
only around 20 % of the total issuances. 

 

3.11. A  deeper  examination  of  the  reasons  for  the  above  trend  reveals  that  financial 
sector  companies,  including  NBFCs  doing  private  placement,  have  been 
exempted  from  the  requirement  of  maintenance  of  Debenture  Redemption 
Reserve  (DRR),  while  all  issuances  by  non-financial  entities  and  entities  doing 
public issue are required to set aside a part of their profits (equivalent to 25 % of 
the value of outstanding debentures) as DRR. Further, such companies have to 
investatleast an amount equivalent to 15% of the debentures maturing during the 
year in bank deposits, government securities, etc. Such an earmarking of funds 
imposes an opportunity cost on the issuer. 

3.12. As  the  requirement  of  DRR  maintenance  imposes  a  significant  cost  on  public 
issue of bonds and on bonds issued on private placement basis by non-financial 
corporates,  and  given  that  issue  of  protection  of  bond  investors,  in  cases  of 
default,  has  been 
the  enactment  and 
operationalisation  of  Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code  (IBC),  it  is  felt  that  if  the 
requirement of DRR is dispensed with, it will naturally facilitate more corporates 
to access the bond market for their financing needs. 

significantly  addressed  by 

RBI Policy framework on Large Exposures  

3.13. With a view to address concentration risk  in the banking system, RBI has come 

out with a policy framework on banks’ large exposures.  

3.14. The  framework  involves  mandating  enhanced  provisioning  norms  for  banks’ 
exposure  to  large  borrowers.  These  enhanced  provisioning  norms  have  come 
into  effect  from  the  FY  2018-19  and  shall  be  applicable  on  incremental  lending 
made to borrowers with Aggregate Sanctioned Credit Limit (ASCL) of INR 25,000 
crores in FY 2017-18. Further, the ASCL limit for application of the extant norms 
will be gradually reduced and it will be INR 10,000 crores beginning FY 2019-20. 
These measures are expected to result in corporates further accessing the bond 
market but the impact of these measures is yet to be assessed. 

Implementation of IBC: 

3.15. The coming into force of IBC in 2016 has addressed the default risk of bonds to a 
large  extent  as  the  bond  holders  have  been  kept  on  higher  priority  than  even 
Government  dues  in  the  liquidation  waterfall.  It  is  expected  that,  in  the  medium 
term, this would facilitate deepening of bond market. As per Bank of International 

 

Page 5 of 9 

 

Settlement  (BIS)  data,  implementation  of  bankruptcy  reforms  have  significant 
impact on deepening of bond market in countries which have implemented such 
reforms.  For  example,  the  corporate  bond  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  increased 
from 12.7 % to 26.3 % in Brazil, 8.1 % to 13.1 % for Russia, 18.8 % to 33.4 % in 
China  and  68.4  %  to  106.8  %  for  U.K.  over  the  5  year  period  from  the  year  of 
reform.  For  India,  at  present,  the  share  of  corporate  bond  to  GDP  is 
approximately 17 % and if the trend is the same as that seen in other countries, 
then it can safely be presumed that the bond market to GDP should move from 
the current 17 % to at least 22 - 23 % by 2022-23, just on account of successful 
implementation of IBC. 

3.16. From the above bond market micro-structure, the following can be inferred – 

a)  The  share  of  bond  market  in  comparison  to  bank  financing  has  shown  an 
upward trend and currently both these modes have almost an equal share. It is 
expected  that  the  share  of  bond  market  would  get  further  accentuated  in 
coming years. 

b)  A large proportion of issuances happen in the  credit rating bucket of “AA and 

above”. 

c)  Most  of  the  bond  issuances  are  privately  placed  with  financial  sector 

companies accounting for a major share of such placements. 

d)  Dispensing  the  DRR  requirement  for  non-financial  entities  and  entities  doing 
public issue could facilitate more such companies to access the bond market.  

e)  The budget announcements regarding shifting to the credit rating bucket of “A 
and  above”  and  regarding  credit  enhancement  /  guarantee  to  the  debt 
securities issued by infrastructure companies, once operationalized, could give 
additional boost to the bond market.  

3.17. As for  the  headwinds  which  may  impact  the  growth  of bond markets,  it may  be 
noted  that  during  the  last  year,  as  a  result  of  various  factors  (including  global 
factors),  there  has  been  a  hardening  of  G-Sec  yield  by  almost  120-130  bps. 
Evolving  global  scenarios,  depreciation  of  Rupee,  etc  could  add  further 
uncertainty  to  the  level  and  direction  of  the  long  term  yields.  This  could  impact 
the appetite of borrowers to access the bond market. 

4.  Proposal 

Considering  the  above,  the  regulatory  intent  would  be  to  operationalize  the  budget 
announcement  in  a  manner  which  provides  for  a  light  touch  framework  and  at  the 

 

Page 6 of 9 

same time provides an appropriate timeframe to the market for smooth  transition to 
the new framework. Accordingly, following is proposed: 

 

4.1.  Applicability  of  framework  -  The  framework  shall  be  applicable  to  any 
corporate (except for scheduled commercial banks), which as on March 31stof an 
year: 

a)  has an outstanding long term borrowing of Rs 100 crores or above; and 

b)  has a credit rating of "AA and above";and 

c) 

intends  to  finance  itself  with  long-term  borrowings  (i.e.  borrowings  above  1 
year); and 

d) 

its  securities  (specified  securities  or  debt  securities  or  non-convertible 
redeemable  preference  share)  listed  in  terms  of  Chapter  IV,  V  or  VI  of 
SEBI(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 

A  corporate  fulfilling  the  above  criteria  will  be  considered  as  a  large  corporate 
under this framework. 

Subsequent  to  implementation  of  budget  announcement  and  after  making  an 
assessment  of  the  capacity  of  the  bond  market  to  absorb  even  lower  rated 
issues,  a  view  would  be  taken  on  reducing  the  threshold  of  rating  in  the  extant 
framework, from "AA" to "A". 

4.2.  Definition of borrowing: The word "long term borrowing" shall mean borrowings 
which  have  original  maturity  period  of  1  year  or  above.  Further,  the  same  shall 
exclude external commercial borrowings and inter-corporate borrowings between 
a parent and subsidiaries. 

4.3.  Implementation Schedule: The framework is proposed to be implemented with 
effect from  April  01,  2019  and  the  large  corporate,  which  has  been  identified  in 
terms  of  criteria  as  mentioned  at  para  4.1  above,  shall  raise  25%  of  its 
borrowings  (incremental)  for  the following  year  through  bond  market.  For  e.g. a 
large  corporate  identified  on  March  31,  2019  shall  borrow  atleast  25%  of  its 
borrowings 
through  bond  market. 
Discussions  with  market  participants  and  analysis  of  data  reveals  that  the 
incremental  shifting  of  corporate  borrowing  to  bond  market  (as  a  result  of  this 
mandatory requirement), on a yearly basis, would be in the range of 5 to 10 % of 
the total bond issuances  during a year. It is expected that this  requirement may 
not be onerous on the corporates, given that implementation of IBC could result 
in  further  deepening  of  bond  market  by  at  least  5  %  of  GDP  as  brought  out  in 

(incremental)  made

4.4.  Compliance  framework:  The  framework  proposes  a  staggered  compliance 

mechanism, details of which are as under: 

a)  Large  corporate,  covered  under  the  framework  shall  inform  the  stock 

exchanges of the same; 

b)  A “comply or explain” approach would be applicable for the initial two years of 
implementation.  Thus,  in  case  of  non-fulfillment  of  the  requirement  of  market 
borrowing, reasons for the same shall be disclosed as part of the “continuous 
disclosure requirements”; 

c)  From  third  year  of  implementation  i.e.  F.Y. 2021-22,  the  requirement  of  bond 
borrowings shall be tested for a contiguous block of two years i.e. F.Y. 2021-
22  and  2022-23  will  be  treated  as  one  block  and  the  requirement  of  25% 
borrowing  through  bond  market  shall  need  to  be  complied  for  the  sum  of 
incremental  borrowings  made  across  the  period  of  the  block.  Further,  at  the 
end  of  block  if  there  is  any  deficiency  in  the  requisite  bond  borrowing,  a 
monetary penalty in the range of 0.2% to 0.3% of the shortfall shall be levied.  

d)  Subsequent compliance will be tested for each such block of two years i.e. FY 
2023-24 and 2024-25, F.Y. 2025-26 and 2026-27, etc. in the manner identified 
above.
