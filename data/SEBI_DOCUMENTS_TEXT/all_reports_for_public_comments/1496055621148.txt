CONSULTATION PAPER  

(ODIs)/Participatory Notes (PNs) 

 

A.  Background 

 

1.  SEBI had set out Conditions for issuance of Offshore Derivative Instruments (ODIs) 

through Regulation 22 of SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014. 
 

2.  SEBI  has  been  taking  steps  for  streamlining  and  tightening  the  conditions  for 
issuance and reporting of ODIs by FPIs registered with SEBI. A list of the measures 
taken by SEBI in this regard during recent past is given as follows:- 

 

 

(a) The Regulation 22 (2) of SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 
2014 (“FPI Regulations”) has been amended to ensure that transfer of 
ODIs are done to persons subject to fulfilment of Regulation 22 (1) of 
FPI  Regulations  and  prior  consent  of  the  FPI  is  obtained  for  such 
transfer,  except  when  the  persons  to  whom  the  ODIs/PNs  are  to  be 
transferred to are pre-approved by the FPI itself. 

(b) Vide  a  circular  dated  June  10,  2016,  SEBI  has  issued  instructions  on 
Know  Your  Client  (KYC)  norms  for  ODI  subscribers,  transferability  of 
ODIs,  reporting  of  suspicious  transactions,  periodic  review  of  systems 
and  modified  ODI  reporting  format.  The  circular  inter  alia  advises  as 
follows: 

•  Applicability of Indian KYC/AML norms for Client Due Diligence: ODI 
Issuers  shall  now  be  required  to  identify  and  verify  the  beneficial 
owners  (BO)  in  the  subscriber  entities,  who  hold  in  excess  of  the 
threshold  as  defined  under  Rule  9  of  the  Prevention  of  Money-
laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 i.e. 25 % in case 
of  a  company  and  15  %  in  case  of  partnership  firms/  trusts/ 
unincorporated bodies. 

•  KYC Review: The KYC review shall be done on the basis of the risk 

criteria as determined by the ODI issuers. 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Suspicious Transactions Report: ODI Issuers shall be required to file 
suspicious  transaction  reports,  if  any,  with  the  Indian  Financial 
Intelligence Unit, in relation to the ODIs issued by it. 

•  Reporting of complete transfer trail of ODIs: ODI issuers shall also 
be required to report all intermediate transfers during the month in 
the monthly reports on ODIs. 

•  Reconfirmation  of  ODI  positions:  ODI  Issuers  shall  be  required  to 
carry  out  reconfirmation  of  the  ODI  positions  on  a  semi-annual 
basis.  In  case  of  any  divergence  from  reported  monthly  data,  the 
same should be informed to SEBI in format provided. 

•  Periodic Operational Evaluation: ODI Issuers shall be required to put 
in  place  necessary  systems  and  carry  out  a  periodical  review  and 
evaluation  of  its  controls,  systems  and  procedures  with  respect  to 
the  ODIs.  A  certificate  in  this  regard  should  be  submitted  on  an 
annual basis to SEBI by the Chief Executive Officer or equivalent of 
the ODI Issuer. 

 
(c) Vide  a  circular  dated  June  29,  2016,  it  was  further  clarified  that  ODI 
subscribers  who  have  subscribed  to  ODIs  under  SEBI  (Foreign 
Institutional  Investors)  Regulations,  1995  can  continue  to  subscribe  to 
ODIs  under  the  FPI  regime,  subject  to  the  condition  that  they  comply 
with Regulation 22 of FPI Regulations and meet the eligibility criteria as 
laid  down  in  the  SEBI  circular  dated  November  24,  2014  along  with 
other  norms  which  may  be  notified  by  SEBI  from  time  to  time.  Those 
ODI  subscribers  which  do  not  meet  the  aforementioned  norms, 
including unregulated funds whose investment manager is appropriately 
regulated, can continue to hold the position till the date of expiry of such 
positions  or  till  December  31,  2020,  whichever  is  earlier.  Such 
subscribers cannot take fresh positions or renew the old positions. 

(d) Pursuant to a meeting on April 26, 2017, the SEBI Board gave approval 
to  insert  an  express  provision  in  Regulation  22  (1)  of  the  SEBI  (FPI) 
Regulations,  2014  to  prevent  Resident  Indians/NRIs  or  to  the  entities 
which  are  beneficially  owned  by  Resident 
from 
subscribing to Offshore Derivative Instruments. 
 
 

Indians/NRIs 

 

B.  Impact of steps taken by SEBI in recent past. 

 
As  a  result  of  the  aforementioned  steps  taken  by  SEBI  there  has  been  a  significant 
reduction in the notional value of Outstanding ODIs. The data in this regard is given as 
follows:-

C.  Proposals for further tightening of ODI/PN Norms:- 

 
In order to further enhance the transparency in the process of issuance and monitoring of 
ODIs being issued by the FPIs registered with SEBI, following steps are being proposed:- 

 

1.  Levy of Regulatory fees on FPIs issuing ODIs:- 

 

 

As discussed above, in order to ensure that the ODI route is not misused, SEBI has 
been  continuously  making  regulatory  changes.  These  changes  however,  require 
investment  in  manpower  and  systems  in  order  to  make  quick  analysis  of  the 
voluminous data being submitted by the ODI issuing FPIs. SEBI incurs a significant 
expenditure  in  terms  capital  and  manpower  when  it  comes  to  monitoring  of 
investments  coming  through  the  ODI  route.  SEBI  has  put  in  place  dedicated  IT 
systems for the ODI issuers to report the Beneficial Owners and other details of the 
ODI subscribers. We may therefore, levy regulatory fees on FPIs issuing ODIs and 
the group entities of such FPIs, which may be involved in taking underlying positions 
in  Indian  securities  market.  The  proposal  for  implementation  of  fee  on  ODI  issuing 
FPIs will require changes in SEBI (FPI) Regulations, 2014. 

It  is  proposed  that  beginning  April  01,  2017,  for  a  period  of  every  three  years, 
regulatory fees of US$ 1,000 be levied on each ODI issuing FPI for each and every 
ODI subscriber coming through such FPI. We understand from the monthly ODI data 
reported by the ODI issuers that quite a few ODI subscribers invest through multiple 
issuers. It will discourage the ODI subscribers from taking ODI route and encourage 
them to directly take registration as an FPI. 

 

 

hedging:- 

2.  Prohibit ODIs from being issued against derivatives except for those used for 

Presently, ODIs are being issued against derivatives along with equity and debt. As 
of April 2017, the ODIs issued against derivatives had a notional value of INR 40,165 
Cr which is 24% of the total notional value of outstanding ODIs.  SEBI proposes to 
prohibit ODIs from being issued against derivatives for speculative purpose. Further, 
the  ODI  issuers  shall  be  given  time  till  December  31,  2020  to  wind  up  the  ODIs 

issued against derivatives which are not for hedging purpose. It will be incumbent on 
ODI  issuing  FPI  to  ensure  that  ODI  is  issued  against  those  derivatives  which  are 
purely for hedging purpose and not for naked speculation. The ODI issuing FPI shall 
put in place necessary system to ensure the same.
