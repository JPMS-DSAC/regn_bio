Agencies (CRAs) 

 

1.  Objective 

The  objective  of  the  consultation  paper  is  to  seek  comments/  views  from  the  public  on  the 
proposals  that  are  expected  to  improve  market  efficiency  by  reducing  the  information 
asymmetry  in  the  market  and  enhancing  the  governance,  accountability  and  functioning  of 
Credit  Rating  Agencies  (CRAs)  for  carrying  out  the  rating  activities  in  an  efficient  and 
professional manner, thereby, yielding timely and accurate ratings. 
 
 

2.  Background 

SEBI  intends  to  review  the  regulatory  framework  for  CRAs  and  put  in  place  provisions 
pertaining to  enhanced disclosures  by  issuer  companies that  shall  augment the  effectiveness 
of the rating process and outcomes and enable CRAs to be proactive and come out with fair, 
objective and unbiased ratings, mitigating the issues of conflict of interest. In pursuance of the 
same,  the  regulatory  framework  and  practices  prevalent  in  other  jurisdictions  were  also 
referred.  SEBI  also  held  discussions  with  various  market  participants/  stakeholders  to 
understand  their  concerns  and  suggestions.  After  taking  into  account  these  suggestions  and 
practices  abroad,  this  paper  has  been  prepared  where  the  proposals  are  listed  for  public 
comments, along with detailed rationale for the same.  
 

 

3.  Proposals 

 
3.1.  Enhanced net-worth requirement for CRAs: 

Minimum  net  worth  requirement  to  be  eligible  for  grant  of  registration  as  a  CRA  to  be 
increased to Rs. 50 Crores, from current requirement of Rs 5 crores. 

Rationale: 
 
Currently,  as  per  SEBI  (CRA)  Regulations,  1999,  an  applicant  is  required  to  have  a 
minimum  net-worth  of  Rs.  5  Crores  to  be  eligible  forgrant  of  registration  as  a  CRA. 
Thiswas  stipulated  by  SEBI  in  1999.  The  systemic  importance  of  CRAs  as  well  as  the 
roles,  responsibilities  and  business  undertaken  by 
increased 
significantly  as  a  result  of  evolution  of  the  financial  markets  and  change  in  market 
dynamics. Therefore, the present obligations of the CRAs warrant an increased networth 
requirement  to  ensure  that  CRAs  have  adequate  financial  capabilitiesthat  would  enable 
them  to  invest  in  building  intellectual  capital,  developing  efficient  systems  and 
infrastructure and adopting better technologyto ensure the highest standards of analytical 
rigour. 

them  have  since

Accordingly, it is proposed that the minimum net worth requirement to be eligible for grant 
of  registration  as  a  CRA  may  be  increased  to  Rs.  50  Crores.  The  existing  registered 
CRAs having a net worth of less than rupees Rs. 50 crores, shall be provided a period of 
three years to meet the said networth requirement. 
 

3.2.  Enhanced Eligibility criteria for Promoter of a CRA 

 
If  a  CRA  is  promoted  by  a  company  or  a  body  corporate  (other  than  a  public  financial 
institution, scheduled commercial bank, foreign bank or foreign credit rating agency), then 
such promoter should also have a sound track record of carrying on business in financial 
services for a period of not less than five years. 

 

Rationale: 

Considering the important role played by CRAs, it is imperative that CRAs are promoted 
by experienced and financially robust entities, with long-term commitment and interest in 
the  financial  markets  whose  line  of  business  is  not  misaligned  with  the  activity  of  credit 
rating. Therefore the promoter being a body corporate should have a sound track record 
of carrying on business in financial services for a period of not less than five years. 

3.3.  Requirements  of  disclosure  of  financial  results  on  the  Exchange(s)  for  issuers  of 
listed debt to be brought in line with the corresponding requirements for issuers of 
listed equity. 

 

Rationale: 
 
While issuers of listed equity are required to disclose financial results on a quarterly and 
year-to-date basis (as per Regulation 33 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015), issuers of 
listed  debt  are  required  to  disclose  financial  results  on  a  half-yearly  basis  (as  per 
Regulation  52).  This  results  in  information  regarding  financial  performance  of  issuers  of 
listed  debt  not  being  available  in  a  timely  manner  to  the  public  at  large.  This  constrains 
the  ability  of  the  CRA  as  well  as  the  public  at  large  to  assess  the  creditworthiness  and 
repayment ability of the Issuer in a timely manner.  

Accordingly  the  requirement  of  disclosure  of  financial  results  for  Issuers  of  listed  debt 
needs to be brought in line with that of issuers of listed equity and, hence, it is proposed 
that  issuers  of  listed  debt  shall  disclose  on  the  Exchange(s)  the  below  mentioned 
financial  results  in  the  format  as  prescribed  in  Schedule  III  to the  Companies  Act,  2013 
(excluding notes and detailed sub-classification): 

  Statement of Profit and Loss on a quarterly and year-to-date basis  
  Statement of Assets and Liabilities/ Balance Sheet on a half-yearly basis

3.4.  Mandatory  disclosure  of  annual  consolidated  financial  results  to  the  Exchange(s) 

in case of issuers having only listed debt. 

 

Rationale: 
 
Support  from  the  holding/  parent  company  is  a  major  consideration  while  rating 
instruments of subsidiaries. Hence, an analysis of the financials of the holding company 
and the group as a whole helps the public at large in getting a holistic picture about the 
creditworthiness of the entire group.  
 
Vide Gazette Notification dated Feb 16, 2015, Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules,  2015  and  Ind  AS  110,  it  has  been  made  mandatory  to  prepare  consolidated 
financial statements for companies (that control one or more entities)whose equity or debt 
securities are listed or are in the process of being listed. 
 
While  SEBI  (LODR)  Regulations,  2015  mandate  submission  of  annual  consolidated 
financial  results  for  listed  equity,  the  same  is  not  mandated  for  issuers  of  listed  debt. 
Mandating  the  same  for  entities  having  listed  debt  shall  aid  investors  in  factoring  in 
possibility  of  parent  support  for  servicing  the  debt  obligations,  in  case  company’s  cash/ 
cash  instruments  are  insufficient  to  service  forthcoming  debt  obligations,  and  put  listed 
debt  at  par  with  listed  equity  in  this  respect  and  bring  it  in  line  with  Indian  accounting 
standards. 
 
Therefore, it is proposed that submission of annual consolidated financial results may be 
mandated for issuers of listed debt. 
 

 

3.5. Restriction on Crossholding in SEBI registered CRAs: 

 

a.  No  CRA  shall,  directly  or  indirectly,  hold  more  than  10%  of  shareholding  and/  or 
voting  rights  in  another  CRA  and  shall  not  have  representation  on  the  Board  of  the 
other CRA. 
 

b.  Acquisition of shares and/ or voting rights in a CRA resulting in change in control may 

be permitted with the prior approval of SEBI. 
 

c.  A shareholder holding 10% or more shares and/ or voting rights in a registered CRA 
shall  not  hold  10%  or  moreshares  and/  or  voting  rights,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  any 
other CRA. However, it shall not apply to holdings by broad-based domestic financial 
institutions.  
 

 
Rationale: 
 
Currently, there is no restriction on a CRA acquiring shares/ voting rights in another CRA 
or a person acquiring shares/ voting rights in more than one CRA. However, significant 
crossholdings  may  give  rise  to  conflict  of  interest  wherein  the  independence  of  such  a 

Page 3 of 15 

 

 

 

CRA to function may get affected in terms of rating process followed, instruments having 
dual ratings from these CRAs. 
 
Having  some  thresholds  on  cross-holding  in  CRAs  may  mitigate  concerns  regarding 
conflict of interest, independence of operations, etc. 
 
A  threshold  of  10  per  cent  for  acquisition  of  shares  and/  or  voting  rights  has  been 
proposed keeping in view  certain statutory rights and protections under the Companies 
Act, 2013 available to such shareholders. Further, a threshold of 10 per cent, subject to 
certain exemptions, is also applicable on cross-holdings in banks, as stipulated by RBI. 
The  extant  SEBI  (CRA)  Regulations  also  recognize  the  influence  exercised  by 
shareholders with 10 per cent or more holding and puts additional restrictions on CRAs 
for  rating  of  securities  issued  by  such  entities, their  associates,  in  order  to  mitigate the 
potential conflict of interest. 
 
However,  introducing  restrictions  on  cross-holding  in  CRAs  may  limit  consolidations 
within  the  industry.  Some  consolidations  may  lead  to  synergies/  economies  of  scale, 
diversification of business risks,  transfer of technical know-how to the target entity,  etc. 
Hence,  in  order  to  facilitate  such  scenarios,  acquisition  of  shareholding  and/or  voting 
rights resulting in change in control may be permitted with the prior approval of SEBI.  
 
In this regard, certain instances of restrictions on crossholding/ shareholding have been 
observed, the same are as under: 
 
India: 
As  per 
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  (Stock  Exchanges  and  Clearing 
Corporations)  Regulations,  2012,a stock  exchange  shall  not  acquire  or hold  more  than 
15 per cent of equity paid up capital in another recognized stock exchange. 
 
In the banking sector, it is seen that while there is a restriction of 10 per cent of equity 
capital/ voting rights on crossholding, consolidations can happen with the prior approval 
of RBI. 
 
Internationally: 
As per the CRA Regulations of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), 
a shareholder with at least 5 per cent of capital/ voting rights in a registered CRA cannot 
have  more  than  5  per  cent  of  capital/  voting  rights,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  any  other 
CRA.

3.6.  Appeal by Issuers against ratings provided by CRAs 

 

   Appeal by Issuers against the rating(s) provided to its instrument(s) by the CRA, shall be 
reviewed  by  a  Rating  Committee  of  the  CRA  that  shall  be  different  from  the  rating 
committee that had initially assigned the rating to the instrument(s) and shall consist of a 
majority of independent members. 

Rationale: 

As  per  the  Rating  Process  followed  by  the  CRAs,  the  issuers  have  an  opportunity  to 
appeal  against  the  rating  assigned  to  its  instruments  by  the  CRA,  which  is  thereafter 
considered  for  a  review  by  a  Rating  Committee  of  the  CRA  which,  as  per  the  present 
practice, may be the same or different from the Committee that had initially assigned the 
rating to the instrument(s).  
 
It  is  felt  that  in  the  interest  of  transparency  and  fairness,  issuers  should  get  a  just 
opportunity of review by an independent Rating Committee of the CRA so that the facts 
presented by the issuers can be reviewed impartially. In this regard, it is proposed that all 
cases  of  appeal  by  issuers  against  the  rating  assigned  to  their  instruments  by  the  CRA 
shall be reviewed by a separate Appeal Committee of the CRA. Such Appeal Committee 
shall be different from the Rating Committee that had initially assigned the rating (that the 
issuer is appealing against) and shall consist of a majority of independent members.   
 
 

3.7.  Withdrawal of ratings permitted after a specified minimum period. 

A  CRA  may  be  allowed  to  withdraw  the  ratings  subject  to  the  CRA  having  rated  that 
instrument continuously for 5 years or 50% of tenure of instrument, whichever is higher. 
At the time of withdrawal the CRA shall assign a rating to such security and issue a press 
release also stating the reasons for withdrawal. 

 
Rationale: 
 
Currently,  the  CRA regulations,  do  not  allow  withdrawal  of  ratings  by  CRAs  and  require 
CRAs  to  continuously  monitor  the  rating  of  securities  during  the  lifetime  of  securities. 
However,  vide  SEBI  Circular  dated  March  31,  2017,  it  was  clarified  that  withdrawal  of 
ratings  is  permitted  for  bank  loans/  facilities  and  open-ended  mutual  fund  schemes, 
subject  to  certain  conditions  and  disclosure  of  reason(s)  for  withdrawal  in  the  Press 
Release. 
 
SEBI  has  received  representations  from  Issuers  requesting  permission  for  withdrawing 
ratings  as Issuers  at  times  might  not  be  satisfied  with  the  services  being  offered  by  the 
current CRA and might want to seek services of another CRA in rating its instruments. It 

Page 5 of 15 

 

 

 

has also been observed that internationally, there is no such requirement of a CRA rating 
an instrument throughout its lifetime. 
 
It  is  thereby  proposed  that  on  receipt  of  request  for  withdrawal  from  the  issuer,  a  CRA 
may withdraw the rating subject to the CRA having rated that instrument continuously for 
5 years or 50% of the tenure whichever is higher. The CRA would assign a rating to such 
security at the time of withdrawal and issue a press release mentioning the reason(s) for 
withdrawal. 
 

3.8. Any  activity,  other  than  the  rating  of  financial  instruments  and  economic/  financial 

 

research, shall be hived off by the CRA to a separate entity. 
 
Rationale: 
 
As per the SEBI (CRA) Regulations, 1999, CRAs can undertake the ratings of securities. 
However,  CRAs  are,  currently,  also  additionally  undertaking  rating/  grading  of  non-
financial instruments/ facilities/ projects/ entities, providing advisory services, etc. 
 
It is pertinent to mention that undertaking such activities may pose regulatory and systemic 
risks  as  such  activities  are  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  SEBI  and,  hence,  are  not  being 
monitored.  In  order  to  address  these  concerns,  it  is  proposed  that  CRAs  may  segregate 
the  activities,  other  than  the  rating  of  financial  instruments  and  economic/  financial 
research, and hive off the same to a separate entity. 
 
A similar provision was also brought in SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 
1996, wherein assignments, not incidental to the activity of depository, are required to be 
segregated and hived off to a separate entity. 

 

3.9.  Disclosure  of  non-accepted  ratings  only  for  a  period  of  6  months  of  non-

acceptance 

 

 

 

Details  of  non-accepted  ratings,  disclosed  on  the  website  of  the  CRAs,  may  be  made 
available only for a period of 6 months of such disclosure. 

Rationale: 

As  per  extant  requirements,  ratings  not  accepted  by  the  issuer  shall  be  disclosed  as   
non-accepted rating on the CRA’s website. The details to be disclosed include the name 
of  the  issuer,  name/  type  of  instrument,  size  of  the  issue,  rating  and  outlook  assigned, 
etc. 
 

Page 6 of 15 

 

 

 

Since non-accepted ratings are not monitored and reviewed by the CRA, post the initial 
rating  exercise,  they  cease  to  accurately  reflect  the  creditworthiness  of  the  issuer/ 
borrower and, therefore, do not remain meaningful after a period. Further, the instrument 
may  subsequently  be  rated  by  other  CRA(s)  and,  post  acceptance  by  the  issuer/ 
borrower,  be  continuously  monitored  by  these  CRA(s)  in  line  with  the  regulatory 
requirements.  In  the  above  situations,  availability  of  non-accepted  ratings  on  a  CRA's 
website  may  be  confusing  or  misleading  for  the  investors.  In  view  of  the  same,  it  is 
proposed  that  details  of  non-accepted  ratings  be  made  available  on  the  website  of  the 
CRAs only for a period of 6 months of such non-acceptance. 

 

3.10. Enhanced disclosure norms for CRAs 

 
An  Annual  Rating  Summary  Sheet  presenting  a  snapshot  of  rating  action  carried  out 
during  the  year,  shall  be  uploaded  by  the  CRAs  on  their  websites  on  an  annual  basis, 
separately for securities and financial instruments other than securities.  
 
Rationale: 
 
Currently,  CRAs  disclose  detailed  information  about  the  rating  actions  carried  out  by 
CRAs  on  a  half-yearly/  annual  basis,  however  the  information  is  quite  detailed  and 
exhaustive. In order to have a summarized view of the ratings/ actions taken by a CRA, 
for  ease  of  perusal  by  the  investors  in  seeing  the  performance  of  the  CRA,  a  summary 
sheet  presenting  a  snapshot  of  the  rating  actions  (new  ratings,  upgrades,  downgrades, 
default cases, etc.) shall be uploaded by the CRAs on their website on an annual basis, 
separately for securities and financial instruments other than securities.   
 
The format of the same is presented at Annexure A. 
 

3.11. Rationalization of existing disclosures for CRAs 

 
The  disclosure  requirements  laid  down  in  the  Circular  CIR/  MIRSD/  CRA/  6/  2010  dated 
May  3,  2010  need  to  be  rationalized  by  segregating  it  for  securities,  and  financial 
instruments other than securities.  
 
Further, CRAs shall also specify the Instrument Type (e.g. NCD, Preference Shares,  CP, 
CD,  etc.),  Sector  of  Issuer,  Status  of  listing,  trigger  of  the  rating  action,  date  of  event/ 
intimation in cases of default. 

 

 
 
 
 
 

Page 7 of 15 

 

 

 

Rationale: 
 
The disclosures need to be such that are easily comprehensible to the investors. For ease 
of  understanding  by  the  investors,  the  current  disclosures  need  to  be  segregated  for 
ratings of securities and financial instruments other than securities.  
 
The disclosures also need to reflect the promptness of the CRA in taking the rating action. 
It  is,  thereby,  proposed  to  include  the  following  additional  information  in  the  various 
disclosures mandated vide Circular dated May 03, 2010. 
 

  Type of Instrument being rated (e.g. NCD/ Preference Shares/ CP/ CD, etc.) being 

rated and Issue Size 
  Sector of the Issuer  
  Whether the instrument is listed or not 
  Separate  tables  for  upgrades  and  downgrades  in  the  disclosure  pertaining  to 

movement of ratings 

  Trigger event that resulted in the rating movement 
  Current Outstanding Rating in disclosure of History of Outstanding Ratings 
  Date of event/date of intimation triggering change in rating in case of default cases 
  Debt-weighted  default  rates  in  case  of  average  default  rates  for  last  5  financial 

years 

 
With respect to disclosure of debt-weighted default rates, it may be noted that  CRAs are 
required to disclose default rates in accordance with Point 2.2.3 of the said Circular, which 
is  the  number  of  defaults  among  rated  entities  in  the  static  pool  as  a  percentage  of  the 
total number of entities in the static pool. It is proposed that in addition to this, CRAs shall 
also disclose the debt-weighted default rate which shall be defined as the amount of rated 
debt that defaulted in the static pool as a percentage of the total amount of rated debt in 
the  static  pool.  The  averaging  for  debt-weighted  default  rate  shall  be  based  on  the 
weighted average method where weights shall be the amount of debt rated in each static 
period. This will help reflect the significance of a default from an issuer with high quantum 
of rated debt on the overall default statistics. 
 
Further, it is proposed to delete Annexure IV of the said Circular as the information in this 
Annexure has been incorporated in the proposed modified Annexure II.  
 
In  accordance  with  the  above  suggested  modifications,  the  proposed  formats  of  the 
modified  disclosures,  with  the  added  columns  highlighted  in  bold,  are  presented  at 
Annexure B.
