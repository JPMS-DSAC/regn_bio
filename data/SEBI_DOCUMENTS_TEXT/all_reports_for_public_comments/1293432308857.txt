The  Primary  Market  Advisory  Committee  (PMAC)  has  received  suggestions  regarding 
preferential issue guidelines and it has been decided to upload the same on SEBI website 
for  inviting  public  comments.  The  suggestions  can  be  viewed  on  SEBI’s  website 
(www.sebi.gov.in) under the heading “Review of SEBI (DIP) Guidelines : Preferential Issue 
guidelines  -  Proposals  –Series  VII”  in  the  section  “Reports/Documents”  and  sub-
classification “Reports for Public Comments”. Comments on the same may be sent to Ms. 
Neelam  Bhardwaj,  DGM,  Division  of 
to 
neelamb@sebi.gov.in  /    ushar@sebi.gov.in  or  faxed  to  91-22-22045633  on  or  before 
December 31, 2004. 
 
Suggestions received on Chapter XIII of SEBI (DIP) Guidelines. 
 
Price 
 
The proposed guidelines involve changes in the manner in which the minimum price is to 
be  calculated.    Instead  of  the  weekly  high  and  low  of  the  closing  prices of shares, the 
weighted average price of the shares based on all transactions on the exchange is to be 
reckoned. The weighted average price is more representative. The concept of 130 trading 
days and 10 trading days has been introduced, in place of six months and two weeks, to 
address  situations  arising  out  of  quotations  not  being  available  on  account  of  stock 
exchanges  holidays.  Adjustment  for  corporate  action  in  calculation  of  price  is  a  new 
requirement.  A  specific  reference  has  been  made  to  the  provisions of Section 79 of the 
Companies Act, 1956, where the issue is at a discount.  
 
For the purpose of  identification of  frequently or infrequently traded shares and  valuation 
of infrequently traded shares, the provisions of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of shares and 
Takeover) Regulations 1997,  is being made applicable. 
 
Issue of Shares with Differential Voting Rights 
 
The  concept  of  ‘relevant  equity  shares’  is  being  introduced  to  create  the  requisite 
regulatory framework for preferential issue of shares with differential voting rights in terms 
of Section 86 of the Companies act, 1956, read with Companies (Issue of Share Capital 
with  Differential  Voting  Rights)  Rules,  2001.  In  this  context,  to  ensure  the  availability  of 
reference  stock  market  quotations,  the  requirement  of  prior  listing  for  a  minimum  of  12 
months has been introduced.  
 
Prohibit indirect dilution of price condition 
 
In  order  that  there  is  no  indirect  dilution  of  the  minimum  price  requirement,  by 
advantageous  issue  terms  on  convertibles  by  way  of  discount  on  issue,  premium  on 
redemption and high coupon rates, a condition that the annual IRR of the instrument is not 
to exceed the PLR of SBI for a comparable tenure has been brought in.

Single ‘relevant date’ for Warrants 
 
The choice with respect to relevant dates for warrants available in terms of the current 
dispensation is dropped.  With a single ‘relevant date’, the price at which shares are to be 
issued against the warrants is crystallized at the time of adoption of the resolution, with 
clarity on the minimum amount to be paid at the time of allotment of warrants.  
 
Non-transferability - promoter and promoter group 
 
The existing condition with respect to lock-in on shares issued to promoter and promoter 
group is being made onerous with the requirement that the entire preferential allotment is 
to be locked-in for three years, without any reference to the “20% rule”. Under the current 
dispensation, the operation of the non-transferability condition was dependent on the lock-
in  profile  (the  percentage  of  holding  and  the  residual  period  of  lock-in)  of  the  pre-
preferential  holding  of  promoters  and  promoter  group.  This  is  sought  to  be  de-linked. 
Further,  an  additional  requirement  extending  the  non-transferability  condition  to  the  pre-
preferential  issue  holding  of  promoter  and  their  relatives  (enlarged  definition  as  in 
Schedule 1A to the Companies Act) is introduced.      
 
Disclosure in Explanatory Statement  
 
In  terms  of  the  proposed  guidelines,  more  detailed  disclosures  are  required  in  the 
Explanatory Statement of the Notice under Section 173(2) of the Companies Act. 
 
Issues for Open Offer 
 
Issue of securities on a selective basis to the shareholders of a listed company may be 
required for effecting an open offer for acquisition of shares in that company  in terms of 
the provisions of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Take Over) Guidelines. 
A  new  clause  has  been  introduced  to  deal  with such issues and relaxations required in 
respect thereof duly specified. 
 
Time-line 
 
The  existing  time-line  of  15  days  for  completion  of  allotment  from  the  date  of  resolution 
has  been  extended  to  21  days  with  a  caveat  that,  in  addition  to  allotment,  all  effective 
steps for listing and trading should have been completed within the period.   
 
Issues to Asset Reconstruction Companies  
 
Some of the relaxations provided for in the existing guidelines with respect to preferential 
issues under a scheme of corporate restructuring, as per the framework of the Reserve 
Bank  of  India,  are  being  extended  to  preferential  issues  to  securitisation  and  asset 
reconstruction companies referred to in Section 4A(1)(vii) of the Companies Act, 1956.

Issuers other than companies, etc.  
 
The  guidelines  seek  to  specifically  cover  preferential  issues  by  issuers  other  than 
companies. Further, issues by issuers whose FCDs/PCDs, etc.  alone are listed and not 
equity have also been specifically covered.  Similarly instruments (which merely confer a 
right  on  the  holder  to  apply  for  and  get  allotted  equity  shares)  are  to  be  issued  in 
accordance with the guidelines if they are to be issued on a preferential basis. The existing 
reference to issue on a private placement basis has been dropped, in view of the proviso 
to sub-section (3) of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956.  
 
Allotment in terms of Sec.81(3) of Companies Act 1956  
 
Thescope of SEBI preferential issue guidelines is being enhanced to bring issue/allotment 
of shares under the provision of Section 81(3) of Companies Act, 1956 within the purview 
of Chapter XIII of SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000.

Instead  of  6  months  and  2  weeks

quotes  not  being  available  on 
account  of  stock  exchanges  being 
closed is eliminated. The concepts of 
month and week were susceptible to 
multiple interpretations which can be 
avoided by introducing the concept of 
trading  day.  Also  being  dropped  is 
the  concept  of  average  of  high  and 
low. 
the  price  being 
determined is the weighted average 
price for the period.

This  concept  is  being  introduced to 
take  care  of  issue  of  shares  with 
differential  voting  rights  in  terms  of 
the  amended  provisions  of  Section 
86 of the Companies Act, 1956 read 
with  Companies  (Issue  of  Share 
Capital  with  Differential  Voting 
Rights) Rules, 2001. 
 
 
 
The  existing  guidelines  do  not 
provide  for  any  such  adjustment, 
whereas  it  is  required.  The  non-
inclusion of dividend is in line with the 
current  practices  adopted 
the 
derivatives market. 
 
 
 
This  is  designed  to  explicitly  make 
clear that compliance with Section 79 
is  a  must  in  case  of  a  company 
issuer. 
 
 
 
 
The idea is to prevent issue of shares 
on a preferential basis effectively at a 
price lower than the price envisaged, 
by  paying  to  the  allottee  interest  on 
the  debt  element  at  a  rate  higher 
than what is prev alent  in  the  market 
or  by  issuing  the  securities  at  a 
discount or by paying a premium on 
redemption.

exchange, the prices of the relevant equity 
shares  of  the  issuer  as  reported  by  the 
exchange which has recorded the highest 
trading  volume  in  respect  of  the  relevant 
equity  shares  of  the  issuer  during  one-
hundred  thirty  trading  days preceding the 
relevant date shall be taken.

identical in all respect, in terms of voting, 
dividend-entitlement or otherwise, to the 
shares proposed to be issued on a 
preferential basis .

days prior to the date on which the 
general meeting of the shareholders of the 
issuer is held to consider the issue in 
terms of Section 81(1-A) of the 
Companies Act or in the case of an issuer 
other than a company under the 
corresponding applicable provisions. 

Frequently traded shares and infrequently 
traded shares shall have the same

effecting  a  corporate  action  in  respect  of 
equity shares of the issuer other than for 
the purpose of payment of dividend.

in 
specified above. 
 
13.4.4  No

price  lower  than  its  face  value  except  in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 
79 of the Companies Act, 1956.
