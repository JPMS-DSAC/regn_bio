Discussion Paper on Growth and Development of Equity Derivatives Market 

Objective  

in India 

1.  To  solicit  the  comments/views  from  stakeholders  including  on  issues  related  to 

trading  in  derivatives,  participant’s  profile,  product  mix,  stock  eligibility,  leverage 

related  matters  and  product  suitability  framework  to  further  strengthen  the 

framework in line with the emerging trends and global best practices.  

 

Introduction 

2.  Derivatives market in India has been growing rapidly in recent years. Orderly growth,  

development  and  alignment  of  both  cash  and  derivatives  markets  is  important. 

Keeping this objective in mind, the discussion paper has been prepared to undertake 

an assessment of the derivatives market in India so as to evaluate whether there is a 

need to further strengthen the regulatory framework for derivatives in India.  

 

Background  

3.  SEBI constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. L. C. Gupta in November 

1996 to "develop appropriate regulatory framework for derivatives trading in India". 

In  March  1998,  the  L.  C.  Gupta  Committee  (LCGC)  submitted  its  report 

recommending the introduction of derivatives market in a phased manner beginning 

with the introduction of index futures.  

 

4.  In  addition  to  the  above,  SEBI  had  also  constituted  Derivative  Market  Review 

Committee under the Chairmanship of Prof M Rammohan Rao to review development 

of the derivatives market and suggest future course of action.  The committee inter-

alia recommended to widen the range of products such as option contracts with longer 

life  or  tenure,  creation  of  Volatility  index  &  F&O  contacts  on  it,  options  of  futures, 

exchange  traded  currency  contracts  and  mini  contracts  on  equity  indices.  The

committee had also made recommendations on operational issues such as revision of 

eligibility  criteria  for  introduction  of  F&O  on  stocks  &  upward  revision  on  position 

limits etc.   

 

Relevant extracts of L C Gupta Committee 

 

5.  The  Committee  strongly favours  the  introduction  of  financial  derivatives in order  to 

provide the facility for hedging in the most cost-efficient way against market risk. This 

is an important economic purpose. At the same time, it recognizes that in order to make 

hedging  possible,  the  market  should  also  have  speculators  who  are  prepared  to  be 

counter-parties  to  hedgers.  A  derivatives  market  wholly  or  mostly  consisting  of 

speculators is unlikely to be a sound economic   institution. A soundly based derivatives 

market requires the presence of both hedgers and speculators. 

 

6.  The Committee is of the opinion that the entry requirements for brokers/dealers for 

derivatives market have to be more stringent than for the cash market. These include 

not only capital adequacy requirements but also knowledge requirements in the form 

of mandatory passing of a certification programme by the brokers/dealers and the sales 

persons. An important regulatory aspect of derivatives trading is the strict regulation 

of sales practices. 

 

7.  The objective of SEBI is to make both derivatives market and cash market fair, efficient 

and transparent. Economically, it is important to realise that equity cash market and 

equity derivatives market are of one piece. Their sound development is inter-related 

closely. 

 

8.  The  Committee  recognises  that  an  efficient  cash  market  is  required  for  an  efficient 

futures  market.  The  Committee  also  recognises  the  danger  that  if  the  cash  market 

behaviour is erratic or does not reflect fundamentals, a futures market, based on such 

a cash market, will fail to give a correct indication of future prices and its usefulness for 

price discovery will be reduced.

9.  With regard to participation of individual investors it is pertinent to mention here that 

L C Gupta committee in its report has given emphasis on Regulation of Sales Practices 

and Disclosures for Derivatives. The committee has observed following:   

 

“The  Committee  has  identified  broker-client  relationship  and  sales  practices  for 

derivatives  as  needing  special  regulatory  focus.  The  potential  risk  involved  in 

speculating (as opposed to hedging) with derivatives is not understood widely. In the 

case of pricing of complex derivatives contracts, there is a real danger of unethical sales 

practices. Clients may be fooled or induced to buy unsuitable derivatives contracts at 

unfair prices and without properly understanding the risks involved”. 

 

Products available for trading in derivative segment 

10. Accordingly BSE and NSE were permitted to introduce trading in derivatives on June 

09, 2000 with launch of Equity Index futures followed by Index options. Subsequently, 

Futures  &  Options  on  Individual  stocks  were  permitted  in  2001.  Currently,  the 

following  products  are  available  for  trading  in  the  equity  derivative  segment  of 

exchanges;

products  and  were  allowed  to  offer  either  European  style  or  American  style  stock 

options  contracts.  Exchanges  (BSE  &  NSE)  have  introduced  European  style  option 

contracts.

12. Presently,  minimum  contract  size  in  equity  derivatives  segment  is  Rs.  5  lakhs. 

Therefore the lot size for derivatives contracts in equity derivatives segment is fixed in 

such a manner that the contract value of the derivative on the day of review is within 

Rs. 5 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs.  

 

13. SEBI  has prescribed  eligibility criteria for introduction of derivatives on stocks and 

indices. The eligibility criteria inter-alia includes the following: 

 

a)  A stock to be part of Top 500 stocks in terms of average daily market capitalization 

and average daily traded value in the previous six months on a rolling basis,  

b)  The stock’s median quarter-sigma order size over the last six months shall be not 

less than Rupees 10 Lakh and  

c)  The market wide position limit (MWPL) in the stock shall not be less than Rupees 

300 crores etc.   

 

14. Below mentioned pie-chart depicts the share of turnover of various products available 

under the equity derivatives segment for FY 2016-17:

15. For the FY 2016-17, it is seen that Equity derivatives turnover is largely dominated by 

index  options  which  contributed  77.14%  to  the  total  turnover,  followed  by  Stock 

Futures at 11.79%, Stock Options at 6.47% and Index Futures at 4.60%. 

 

16. Index  options  and  stock  options  dominate  trading  in  the  derivatives  segment  by 

accounting for 83.61% of total trading in derivative segment. The possible reasons for 

greater trading interest in the options could be that the Security Transaction tax (STT) 

on  options is chargeable  on  option  premium value  & thus  could  be  lower  in term of 

value than that of futures where it is chargeable on notional value and also the trading 

in  options  enable  market  participant’s  to  deploy  various  trading  strategies  to  earn 

upfront premium that may be used to off-set losses or enhance gains in their trading 

position in futures or in cash market.

Cash market turnover and equity derivatives turnover include the total turnover at NSE & BSE.  

 

18. It is observed from Table No. 2 above that between the period FY 2004-05 to FY 2016-

17, the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for turnover in cash market has been 

11.39%, whereas CAGR for turnover in equity derivatives has been 35.10%. The market 

capitalization of listed companies (BSE) has grown has been 17.82% CAGR during this 

period. It is also observed that the ratio of turnover of equity derivatives to equity cash 

has increased from 1.54 to 15.59 during the aforesaid period. 

 

19. The  increase  in  the  turnover  over  the  years  may  be  attributed  to  various  reasons 

including  the  higher  index  levels  and  increase  in  stock  prices  resulting  in  growth  of 

notional  turnover,  reduced  STT  on  equity  futures  from  0.017%  to  0.01%  and

introduction  of  commodity  transaction  tax  at  0.01%  on  non-agricultural  commodity

20. Over the years more than 95% of equity derivative trading in India happens on NSE. In 

this context, feedback has been received from market participants regarding derivative 

trading in mid-cap indices, exchange-wise position limits and to allow inter-operability 

of  Clearing  Corporations  (CCs)  to  allow  market  participants  to  consolidate  clearing 

with a CC of their choice to achieve economies of scale and efficiency gains. 

 

21. Futures  and  options  on  Indian  Indices  (mainly  NIFTY  &  SENSEX)  are  available  for 

trading in other jurisdictions. Table No. 3 shows the name of the jurisdictions where 

derivative contracts on such Indices are available.

25. The analysis of profile of the participants in the equity derivative segment reveal the 

following; 

 

  The proprietary trades i.e., trading by stock  brokers on their proprietary account 

dominate trading in Index options. The proprietary trades contribute between 45% 

-55% of total trading volume in index options. Non Institutional Non Proprietary 

category  which  includes  individual  investors  and  proprietary  category  together 

contributed around 85% of the total trading volume in index options.  

  In  case  of  stock  options,  both  proprietary  trades  and  non-institutional  non-

proprietary   contributed for around 80% of trading stock options. 

  One  possible  reason  for  the  active  trading  by  proprietary  trades  in  derivatives 

especially  options  could  be  upfront  income  in  the  form  of  option  premium  on 

writing of options.   

  It  is  observed  that  non-institutional  non-proprietary  investors  which  include 

individual  investors  contribute  the  highest  volume  in  futures  (index  as  well  as

stock).  (It  is observed  from  Table  No  5  and  Chart  No  2  that  Individual  investors 

accounts  for  58%  of  trading  by  non-institutional  non-proprietary  category.)  The 

possible reasons for such trading preference could be that futures are less complex 

than options and also Individual investors familiarity with trading in index futures 

and stock futures.   

  It  is  observed  that  Foreign  Investors  contribute  between  15%-20%  in  the  total 

volume across all product categories available in equity derivatives segment. The 

FPIs  are  present  in  all  types  of  product  categories  to  hedge  their  underlying 

exposure and they may not be taking speculative positions. 

  Further,  low  FPIs  participation  could  also  be  because  of  trading  of  futures  and 

options  on  major  indices  in  foreign  markets  such  as  Singapore,  Hong  Kong  and 

Dubai etc. 

  Domestic institutional investors are not active in derivatives and their turnover is 

negligible  in  the  derivative  segment.  The  lower  trading  interest  by  the  domestic 

institutions  such  as  mutual  funds  could  be  attributed  to  certain  regulatory 

restrictions  viz  not  allowed  to  write  option  contracts  and  exposure  to  option 

premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the scheme etc. 

 

26. It is observed from Table No. 5 and Chart No 2 that Individual Investors contributed 

for 25.67% of total turnover and these investors constitute 58% in the category of non-

institution non-proprietary trading which dominates trades in index futures and stock 

futures. Therefore it could be inferred that individual investors are present across all 

types of derivative products and their trading  may be concentrated in index futures, 

stock future and stock options.  

 

27. As  evaluated  from  the  data,  individual  investors  are  present  across  all  product 

categories including products such as index option/stock options which are inherently 

more complex and are thus more risky, particularly selling of options. 

 

28. The  participation  of  individual  investors  and  their  contribution  in  the  derivative 

segment has been shown in the Table No 6 below:

total turnover in the equity derivative segment remained in the range of 26% to 33%. 

However, taking into account the increase in turnover in the equity derivative segment 

and  the number of investors trading in equity derivative segment it can be  inferred 

that trading turnover in the equity derivative segment per investor has increased.  

 

30. In order to ascertain trading behavior of such investors, the trading activity of these 

investors in the cash segment has been taken as a proxy. The profiling is done on the 

basis of trading activity of individual investors in cash segment. The Table No 7 below 

display  categorization  by  cash  market  trading  of  above  individual  investors  during 

2016-17:

31. It is observed from Table No 7 that; 

 

  Investors with trades of less than equal to Rs.10 lakhs accounts for about 6% of the 

total derivative trading by individual investor, of these investors not traded in cash 

market accounts for 2.5% of total derivative trading by individual investor.

  Approximately 68% of total Individual Investors traded in the derivative segment 

are falling in the category of trades greater than Rs.2 lakhs in cash segment. These 

Individual Investors account for more than 84% of turnover in Derivative Segment 

in the Individual Investor category.   

  Number of Individual Investors traded in the derivative segment are scattered in 

terms of their turnover in cash segment. 

  Individual investors traded for value greater than Rs.10 lakhs in cash segment have 

around 77% of concentration in turnover in derivative segment (in the category of 

Individual Investors).  

  Approximately  23%  of  individual  investors  who  have  traded  in  the  equity 

derivatives have a cash market turnover of less than Rs.10 lakhs.  

  Around 14% of Individual Investors who have contributed approximately 10% of 

the turnover of equity derivatives segment have not traded in the cash segment. 

Such trading could be speculative in nature. 

  More  than  50%  trading  in  the  derivative  segment  in  the  category  of  Individual 

Investors is concentrated by investors who have greater than Rs.1 crore exposure 

in cash market. 

 

32. Derivatives products by nature are complex instruments. The valuation of derivatives 

such  as  options  depends  on  many  variables  and  option  writers  are  exposed  to 

significant  risk  if  that  do  not  have  corresponding  position.  Therefore it  is  important 

that investors have a good understanding of derivatives and the ability to absorb the 

risk of their position. Indian market does not have the concept of product suitability 

framework. Investors may not have adequate understanding and financial capability to 

withstand  risk  posed  by  complex  derivative  instruments.  It  may  be  pertinent  to 

mention that L C Gupta committee in its report has also given emphasis on Regulation 

of Sales Practices and Disclosures for Derivatives.

36. It is observed from the above Table No.9 that the ratio of turnover in equity derivatives 

to  turnover  in  equity  cash  market  in  India  is  high  and  second  only  to  South  Korea. 

Comparative  turnover  on  the  basis  of  option  premium  in  other  foreign  markets  as 

stated  in  the  Table  No.10  above  indicate  that  the  turnover  ratio  in  India  is  also 

somewhat higher than that of foreign markets.   

 

Factors governing trading behaviour in derivatives   

 

I.  Margin required for trading in Derivatives 

 

37. Margin  for  equity  derivatives  is  computed  on  a  portfolio  based  approach  using  a 

software called - SPAN (Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk). SPAN uses different types 

of scenarios to calculate margins. The minimum margin percentage on index futures is 

5% and on the stock futures is 7.5% which are scaled up by look ahead period.  

 

38. In  case  clients  have  off-setting  positions  such  as  Index  futures/stock  futures  and 

constituent stock/stock futures, then cross margin benefit is provided wherein margin 

requirement is reduced due to off-setting nature of the positions.  Further, margins are 

levied  at  the  exchange/clearing  corporation  level.  No  adjustment  in  margins  is 

permitted for taking off-setting positions in two different exchanges.   

 

39. In cash segment, no adjustment in margins is allowed on off-setting positions. 

 

 

II.  Securities Transaction Tax (STT) framework in India 

 

40. Securities  Transaction  Tax  (STT)  is  levied  on  the  transactions  done  in  the  equity 

derivatives segment of the stock exchanges. STT came into effect from October 1, 2004. 

Table No. 11 below shows the changes in STT rates applicable to transactions in cash 

segment and equity derivatives segment since its introduction.

41. From the above Table, the following observations are made: 

 

  In Cash segment, the STT rate is higher for delivery based transactions than non-

delivery transactions; 

  STT  in  Options  was  levied  on  the  seller  of  options  on  the  notional  value  of  the 

contract (strike price plus premium). However, with effect from June 1, 2008, STT 

is being levied only on the premium amount.  

  STT is levied at 0.05% on the option premium on the seller of the option whereas 

on exercise of the option, STT is levied at 0.125% on the notional value of the option 

on the buyer of the option.

Observations: 

  

42. From the data that have been placed in the preceding Tables, the following is observed: 

 

  Between  the  period  from  FY  2004-05  to  2016-17,  the  growth  in  the  turnover  of 

equity derivatives segment outpaced the growth in turnover of cash segment. The 

ratio of notional turnover in equity derivatives to equity cash segment increased 

from 1.54 for the FY 2004-05 to 15.59 for the FY 2016-17. However, in case the 

option  turnover  is  based  on  premium  value,  the  ratio  of  cash  to  derivatives  is 

somewhat in line with international trend.  

  There is significant concentration of volumes in terms of products, exchange and 

investor category. 

  In terms of indices NIFTY futures is highly traded and volumes are almost divided 

between domestic and SGX Nifty futures indicating overseas interest in the NIFTY 

futures.  

  Options dominate trading in the derivatives segment by accounting for 83.61% of 

total trading in derivative segment.  

  Proprietary trades and Individual investors contribute 43% and 26% respectively 

of the total volume of the equity derivatives in India.  

  Around 14% of Individual Investors who have contributed approximately 2.5% of 

the  total  turnover  of  equity  derivatives  segment  have  not  traded  in  the  cash 

segment.  More  than  50%  trading  in  the  derivative  segment  in  the  category  of 

Individual Investors is contributed by investors who have greater than Rs.1 Crore 

exposure in cash market; 

  Large number of individual investors are active in derivative segment. Going by 

their trading pattern in cash segment, it is observed that these investors may or 

may not have  adequate financial capability to withstand risks posed by complex 

derivative instruments. In the absence of a product suitability framework, this may 

not be in the interest of securities market.

SEBI Initiatives  

 

 

43.  SEBI  has  taken  steps  to  develop  the  cash  market  by  initiating  measures  such  as 

introduction  of  new  products,  redesigning  existing  products,  conducting  investor 

awareness initiative, etc.  SEBI has revised the Margin Trading facility by rationalising 

initial margin requirements in cash market, permitting stocks as collateral for availing 

funding from stock brokers, etc.  

 

44. Similarly to enhance the liquidity in the in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) 

mechanism the framework has been revised to make it more suited to the needs of the 

market participants. SEBI has received many suggestions to further improve the SLB 

framework.  SEBI  is  examining  the  suggestions  with  view  to  improve  the  SLB 

mechanism. 

 

Feasibility of Product Suitability for trading in derivatives  

 

45. Though  the  observations  of  L  C  Gupta  Committee  regarding  Regulation  of  Sales 

Practices  and  Disclosures  for  Derivatives  in  India  were  made  at  the  time  of  the 

introduction of derivative trading in India, are still relevant. SEBI Investor Survey 2015 

brought  out  the  risk  perceptions  of  investors  with  regard  to  the  various  financial 

instruments. In the said report, it is observed that 31% of investor’s responded consider 

bonds/debenture more risky that equity and mutual funds. Further, 57% respondents 

believe that bonds/debentures are unsafe. Thus there is need to have focused investor 

awareness with regard to financial instruments particularly derivative products.  

 

46. Derivatives are complex products and there are many variables which are required to 

be considered for valuation of the derivative contracts. Under the current framework, 

the  trading  members  are  required  to  have  qualified  approved  user  and  sales  person 

who have passed a Certification programme approved by SEBI to operate in derivative 

market. However, a concept of product suitability framework for clients as prevalent in 

other jurisdictions is not present in India.

Matters for discussion 

 

i. Ratio of turnover in derivatives to turnover in cash market is around 15 times. To 

what extent the drivers of this ratio in India are comparable with drivers in other 

markets. 

 

ii.  What  are  the  global  best  practices  and  experience  in  international  markets  to 

align cash and derivative markets. 

 

iii.  Considering the participants’ profile, what measures would be required to create 

balanced participation in equity derivatives market. 

 

iv.  Taking  into  account  trading  of  individual  investors  in  derivatives,  especially 

options,  is  there  a  need  to  introduce  a  product  suitability  framework  in  our 

market.  

 

v. Considering participants’ profile, product mix and leverage in equity derivatives, 

what could be the guiding principles for setting minimum contract size and open 

position limits for equity derivatives. 

 

vi.  Whether there is a need to review existing criteria for introduction of derivatives 

on stocks or derivatives on indices.     

 

vii.  Taking in to account the margin levied in the derivative segment and consequent 

leverage, is the present margin framework adequate. Is there a need to review 

trading and risk management framework for derivatives.      

 

viii. Whether there are any inefficiencies in the market that needs to be addressed. 

 

ix. Whether there is any regulatory arbitrage that needs to be addressed.
