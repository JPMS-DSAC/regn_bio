Dear Sir,
Sub : Formats of Statistical Information/ Compliance Reports/Bio-Data of 
 
Key Personnel of AMCs
 
 
In terms of Clause (b) of sub-regulation (4) of regulation 18 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, all Asset Management Companies are required to submit bio-data of their key personnel to the trustees of Mutual Funds. 
SEBI is in the process of preparing a database of top officials and key personnel working with the intermediaries. You are, therefore, required to submit the bio-data of key personnel to SEBI in the enclosed format. 
The AMCs are also required to submit periodically statistical reports and compliance test information to SEBI. The formats for submission of those information have been prepared. The formats are being circulated herewith for the purpose of inviting your suggestions and to initiate discussions in the forthcoming meeting with members of AMFI on April 30, 1997.
 
Yours faithfully,
 

D.CHANDA
