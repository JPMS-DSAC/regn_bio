CIR/MRD/DP/ 39 /2010 
 
 
To, 
 
All Stock Exchanges, 
 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Subject: Activity schedule for Auction Session 
 
As per extant practice, in case of default by the selling broker in a settlement, the 
security delivered short is bought in the auction session and is delivered to the 
buying broker on T+4 day.  
 
In order to reduce the time involved in delivering the shares to the buying broker, 
in case of default, it has been decided to conduct the auction on the same day of 
the settlement, after the pay-in is completed. i.e. the auction for trades done on T 
day  shall  be  conducted  on  T+2  day  after  pay-in  is  completed  and  shortfall  is 
crystallized. 
 
The activity schedule as under shall be applicable with effect from February 1, 
2011: 
 
Rolling settlement for T day trade 
 
S. No.  Day 
1 
2 
 
Auction settlement for T day trade 
3 
4 
 
However, as the bank and stock exchange holidays are not common there are 
days when multiple settlements are conducted on the working day immediately 
following the day(s) of the closure. On such days when multiple settlements (say 
S1 and S2) are conducted on the same day (say Tm) the auction session shall be 
as under:
