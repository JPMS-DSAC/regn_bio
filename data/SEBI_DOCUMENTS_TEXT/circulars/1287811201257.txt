To, 
 
All Depositories, 
 
Dear Sir(s), 
 

Sub: Account Maintenance Charges collected upfront on annual/ half 

yearly basis on demat accounts  

(BOs) 

 
1.  The  Depository  Participants  (DPs)  have  a  system  of  collecting  account 
maintenance  charge 
towards 
maintenance  of  demat  accounts  for  varied  periodicity  of  collection  (viz. 
monthly, quarterly, half yearly and annually). It has been noticed that in cases 
where  AMC  is  collected  on  an  annual  upfront  basis,  on  closure/shifting  of 
demat account, the AMC for the balance period for which no service has been 
provided by the DP, is not refunded to the BO..  

from  beneficial  owners 

(AMC) 

 
2.  In view of the above, it has been decided that in the event of closing of the 
demat account or shifting of the demat account from one DP to another, the 
AMC  collected  upfront  on  annual/half  yearly  basis  by  the  DP,  shall  be 
refunded by the DP to the BO for the balance of the quarter/s. For instance, in 
case  annual  AMC  has  been  paid  by  the  BO  and  if  the  BO  closes/shifts  his 
account in the first quarter, he shall be refunded the amount of the balance 3 
quarters i.e. 3/4th of the AMC. Likewise, if a BO closes/shifts his account in 
the third quarter, he shall be refunded the amount for the balance one quarter 
i.e. 1/4th of the AMC. 

 
3.  For the purpose of the above requirement the year shall begin from the date 

of opening of the account in quarterly rests. 

. 
4.  The above requirements shall be applicable to all existing and new accounts 
held  with  DPs  which  collect  annual/half  yearly  upfront  AMC.  It  is  hereby 
clarified that the above requirements shall not be applicable to those DPs who 
collect quarterly/ monthly AMC. 

 
5.  The Depositories are advised to:- 
 

a)     make amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and  regulations for 
the  implementation  of  the  above  decision  immediately,  as  may  be 
applicable/necessary ;
