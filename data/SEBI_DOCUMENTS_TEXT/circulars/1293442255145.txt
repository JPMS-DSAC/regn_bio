EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 

TO ALL REGISTERED FIIS 

 

Dear Sir, 
 
Please note that while registering you as a Foreign Institutional Investor, you were required 
as a condition of your registration, to ensure that at least 70% of the investments made by 
you was in equity or equity related instruments. This condition was till now b ein applied to 
the investment made for each sub-account managed by you. This implied that the aggregate 
investment made for each  sub-account was required to have the composition of equity and 
debt in the ratio of 70:30. 
 
The condition has since been amended as follows: 
 
“As a regiatered FII you may invest in all securities in the primary and secondary markets 
such  as  shares,  debentures,  warrants  of  companies  listed/to  be  listed  on  the  stock 
exchanges in India including OTC Exchange   of India, specific schemes floated by domestic 
mutual  funds  for  institutional  investors  and  such  other  securities  as  may  be  approved  by 
SEBI  from  time  to  time.  The  aggreggte  investment  in  equity  and  equity  related 
instruments such as fully convertible debentures and convertible portion of partially 
convertible  debentures,  tradeable  warrants  made  by  you  on  behalf  of  all  approved 
sub-accounts for which you may be investing in India, shall not be less than 70% of 
the aggregate investments made by you in all the approved sub-accounts.” 
 
This would imply that the ration of 70:30 between equity and debt would now be applied at 
global  level  of  the  aggregate  investments  made  by  a  Fund  Manager/Power  of  Attorney 
Holder/Nominee  Company  through  the  sub-accounts  approved  by  us,  wherever  the  Fund 
Manger/Power  of  Attorney  Holder/Nominee  Company  is  a  registered  FII,  instead  of  at  the 
level of each sub-account. 
 
Please  note  that  in  cases  where  the  registered  FII  is  a  Fund  itself,  the  ratio  would 
continue to tbe applied to the Fund only. 
 
The amendment comes into effect immediately. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
PRATIP KAR
