Dear Sir / Madam,

2005 on ‘Comprehensive Risk Management Framework for the Cash Market’. 

 
2. SEBI has also put in place a ‘Mechanism for regular monitoring of and penalty for short-

collection/ non-collection of margins from clients’ in Derivatives segment by issuing the 

following circulars: 

2.1. Circular No. CIR/DNPD/7/2011 dated August 10, 2011

3. Further, SEBI vide circular no. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2019/14 dated January 11,

(TM),  Self-clearing  Member  (SCM),  Clearing  Member(CM)  and  Professional  Clearing 

Member (PCM) as prevalent in the equity derivatives segment.  

 
4. In cash segment, the VaR margin is collected by Clearing Corporation (CC) upfront from 

trading  member/clearing  member  by  adjusting  against  the  available  liquid  assets  of 

TM/CM at the time of trade. However, the quantum, form and mode of collection of the 

margin from the client is left to the discretion of TM/CM. In order to align and streamline 

the risk management framework of both cash and derivatives segments, with respect to

collection of margins from the clients and reporting of short-collection/non-collection of 

margins, following guidelines are issued: 

4.1. Collection of margins from the clients by TM/CM in cash segment: 

4.1.1.  The ‘margins’ for this purpose shall mean VaR margin, extreme loss margin 

(ELM), mark to market margin (MTM), delivery margin, special / additional 

margin or any other margin as prescribed by the Exchange to be collected 

by TM/CM from their clients. 

4.1.2.  Henceforth, like in derivatives segment, the TMs/CMs in cash segment are 

also required to mandatorily collect upfront VaR margins and ELM from their 

clients. The TMs/CMs will have time till ‘T+2’ working days to collect margins 

(except VaR margins and ELM) from their clients. (The clients must ensure 

that  the  VaR  margins  and  ELM  are  paid  in  advance  of  trade  and  other 

margins  are  paid  as  soon  as  margin  calls  are  made  by  the  Stock 

Exchanges/TMs/CMs.  The  period  of  T+2  days  has  been  allowed  to 

TMs/CMs  to  collect  margin  from  clients  taking  into  account  the  practical 

difficulties often faced by them only for the purpose of levy of penalty and it 

should not be construed that clients have been allowed 2 days to pay margin 

due from them.) 

4.1.3.  As prescribed in clause 7 of SEBI circular MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-07/2005 dated 

February  23,  2005,  the  TM/CM  shall  be  exempted  from  collecting  upfront 

margins  from  the  institutional  investors  carrying  out  business  transactions 

and in cases where early pay-in of securities is made by the clients.  

4.1.4.  If the TM/CM had collected adequate initial margins from the client to cover 

the potential losses over time till pay-in, he need not collect MTM from the 

client. 

4.1.5.  As  like  in  derivatives  segments,  the  TMs/CMs  shall  report  to  the  Stock 

Exchange  on  T+5  day  the  actual  short-collection/  non-collection  of  all 

margins from clients. 

4.2. Penalty structure for short-collection/non-collection of margins and false/incorrect 

reporting of margin collection from the clients by TMs/CMs: 

4.2.1.  For short-collection / non-collection of client margins, the Stock Exchanges 

shall  take  the  disciplinary  action  as  per  the  framework  specified  in  SEBI 

Circular CIR/DNPD/7/2011 dated August 10, 2011.

with effect from April 01, 2020.
