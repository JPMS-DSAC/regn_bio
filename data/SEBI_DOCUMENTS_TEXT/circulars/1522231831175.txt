Dear Sir/Madam,  
Sub.:  Clarifications  with  respect  to  circular  on  “Specifications  related  to  International 
Securities Identification Number (ISINs) for debt securities issued under the SEBI (Issue 
and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008”. 
 
1.  SEBI  had  issued  a  circular  No.  CIR/IMD/DF-1/67/2017  dated  June  30,  2017  on 
“Specifications  related  to  International  Securities  Identification  Number  (ISINs)  for  debt 
securities  issued  under  the  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008” 
(ISIN circular). With respect to the same, based on the queries and representations received 
from time to time, certain clarifications are issued through this circular: 
 
1.1. It  is  clarified  that  structured  products/market  linked  debt  securities  as  mentioned  in 
paragraph  2.1.2.2  of  the  ISIN  circular  refer  to  the  structured  products/market  linked 
debentures as per the SEBI circular Cir/IMD/DF/17/2011 dated September 28, 2011. 
 

1.2. With  respect  to  paragraph  2.1.3  of  the  ISIN  circular,  it  is  clarified  that  in  case  of  debt 
securities, where call and/or put option is exercised, the issuer, if so desires, may issue 
additional  debt  securities  for  the  balance  period  viz.  remaining  period  of  maturity  of 
earlier debt securities. For example, if an issuer has issued debt securities in the month 
of August 2017 having maturity period of three years and callable after one year, then in 
such a scenario if the call option is exercised in the month of August 2018, then for the 
balance  two  years  period  viz  (September  2018-August  2020)  the  issuer  may  issue 
additional debt securities maturing in August 2020, under the same ISIN. 

 

  

Provided  that  the  aforesaid  additional  issue  shall  be  subject  to  the  condition  that  the 
aggregate count of outstanding ISINs maturing in the financial year in which the original

issue  of  debt  securities  (bearing  call  and/or  put  option)  is  due  for  expiring,  shall  not 
exceed the prescribed limit of ISINs. 
 

1.3. With  respect  to  paragraph  2.1.5  of  the  ISIN  circular,  it  is  clarified  that  for  all  the  debt 
securities issued in the financial year (FY) 2017-18 on or after July 01, 2017, all the ISINs 
corresponding to these issues, maturing in any financial year, shall adhere to the limit of 
12/5 ISINs. 
 

1.4. Additionally, it may be noted that in case of conversion of partly paid debt securities to 
fully  paid  debt  securities,  such  conversion  shall  not  be  counted  as  an  additional  ISIN 
under paragraph 2.1.2 of ISIN circular.  
 

1.5. With respect to Paragraph 2.2  of the  ISIN circular, it is  clarified that the  exemption as 
granted under paragraph 2.2.5 of the said circular shall also be available to All India Term 
Lending and Refinancing Institutions (AITLRI) as notified by RBI and Infrastructure Debt 
Funds  registered  as  Non-Banking  Finance  Companies  subject  to  them  issuing  debt 
securities with minimum five years maturity. 

 

1.6. All  the  exemption  from  the  applicability  of  ISIN  circular,  as  have  been  outlined  in 
paragraph 2.2 of the ISIN circular and paragraph 1.5 above shall be available only till June 
30,  2020  and  shall  not  continue  beyond  that  period.  Thus,  no  exemption  from  the 
applicability of ISIN circular shall be available to any issuer for debt securities issued on 
or after July 01, 2020.  

It is further clarified that for the class of entities, mentioned in paragraph 2.2 of the ISIN

while  making  an  issue  of  debt  securities,  disclose  upfront  in  the  Information 
Memorandum/Disclosure Document that further issuances may be made under the same 
ISIN. However, if such a disclosure is not made by the issuer then compliance shall have 
to  be  made  with  regulation  59  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
 

1.8. With respect to paragraph 3.1.2 of the ISIN circular, it is clarified that the statement to be 
submitted  to  the  stock  exchanges  shall  be  submitted  half  yearly  on  the  basis  of  the
