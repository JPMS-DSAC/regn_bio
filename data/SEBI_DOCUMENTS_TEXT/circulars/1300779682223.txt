Dear Sirs, 

Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities.

Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-09/2000 dated February 16, 2000 
advising inter-alia the list of 195 scrips (serial numbers 373 to 567 of annexure "B" to the 
circular) for compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form for institutional investors 
viz., banks, mutual funds, domestic financial institutional investors, foreign institutional 
investors and OCB's with effect from June 26, 2000. 

Some of the companies, whose scrips were included in the list of securities for compulsory 
trading in dematerialised form for institutional investors and OCBs, could not sign agreements 
and establish connectivity with either or both the depositories well on time or are in the process 
of doing so. It has been decided that the effective date for compulsory trading by institutional 
investors and OCBs in dematerialised form for these scrips (51 scrips as per annexure A) 
therefore stands postponed and the revised date would be announced later. 
  

Yours faithfully,
