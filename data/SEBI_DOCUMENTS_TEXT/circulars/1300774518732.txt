DIP (Compendium)Circular No. 4                                                         September 6, 2000 

TO 

ALL MERCHANT BANKERS/DEBENTURE TRUSTEES

Amendments to the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection Guidelines), 2000.

The captioned Guidelines came into effect from January 27, 2000. The Guidelines for issue of 
debt instruments are contained in Chapter X thereof. SEBI had constituted a working group of 
Debenture Trustees which made certain suggestions to improve the effectiveness of the 
trustees. SEBI has considered these recommendations and has decided to implement the same 
by making certain amendments to the DIP Guidelines as given in Section A of the annexure. 

As per the extant guidelines, debt instruments with maturity over 18 months are compulsorily 
to be secured. SEBI has received representations to allow issue of unsecured/subordinated debt 
instruments in the nature of mezannine capital. In order to provide a variety of debt instruments 
and to help the development of the debt market it has been decided to allow the issue of 
unsecured/subordinated debt instruments as per Guidelines given in Section B of the Annexure. 

This circular shall come into force with immediate effect. 

Please acknowledge receipt. 

Yours faithfully, 
  

O. P. GAHROTRA 
Sr. Executive Director
