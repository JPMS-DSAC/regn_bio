Sir / Madam, 

Sub: Change in Government Debt Investment Limits 

1.  Present debt investment limits available for FPI investments in Government securities (G-Secs) 

include a USD 20 billion limit for all FPIs and another USD 10 billion limit for Long Term FPIs. 

While the USD 20 billion limit has been fully utilized, the USD 10 billion limit has been utilized 

only up to 22.86%.  

 

2.  Therefore,  in  partial  modification  of  para  5  of  the  SEBI  circular  CIR/IMD/FIIC/8/2014  dated 

April  07,  2014,  it  has  been  decided  to  enhance  the  investment  limit  in  government  securities 

available to all FPIs by USD 5 billion by correspondingly reducing the amount available to long 

term FPIs from USD 10 billion to USD 5 billion within the overall limit of USD 30 billion.  

 

3.  The  incremental  investment  limit  of  USD  5  billion  (INR  24,886  cr)  shall  be  required  to  be 

invested  in  government  bonds  with  a  minimum  residual  maturity  of  three  years.  Further,  all 

future  investment  against  the  limit  vacated  when  the  current  investment  by  an  FPI  runs  off 

either through sale or redemption shall also be required to be made in government bonds with 

a minimum residual maturity of three years. It is, however, clarified that there will be no lock-in 

period and FPIs shall be free to sell the securities (including those that are presently held with 

less than three years of residual maturity) to the domestic investors.
