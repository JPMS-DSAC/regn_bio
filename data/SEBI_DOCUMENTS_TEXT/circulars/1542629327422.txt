CIRCULAR 

November 19,2018 

 
CIR/CFD/CMD-1/142/2018 
 
 
To 
 
All Listed Entities 
All the Recognized Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/Madam,  
 
Sub:  Disclosure  of  reasons  for  delay  in  submission  of  financial  results 
by listed entities 
 

1.  Regulation  33  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Listing 
Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  (“Listing 
Regulations”),  inter-alia,  specifies  timelines  for  submission  of  financial 
results  by  listed  entities.  Accordingly,  the  quarterly  and  annual  financial 
results  are  to  be  submitted  by  listed  entities  to  stock  exchanges  within 
forty-five/sixty  days  from  the  end  of  the  quarter/financial  year.  It  is 
expected that the listed entities shall adhere to the aforesaid timelines for 
submission of financial results.  

2. 

In case of non-compliance of various provisions of the Listing Regulations 
including  non-submission  /  delayed  submission  of  financial  results,  SEBI 
has  prescribed  a  standard  operating  procedure  (providing  for  levy  of 
penalties, freezing of promoter shareholding, suspension of trading ,etc.) 
through certain circulars, the latest being the circular  dated May 3, 2018. 
Such  penalties, freezing  of promoter  shareholding,  etc.  act as  deterrents 
for listed entities to delay disclosure of their financial results. 

3.  Nevertheless,  wherever  there  were  delays  in  submission  of  financial 
results by certain listed entities to the stock exchanges in the past, while 
the  fact  of  delay  was  intimated  by  the  listed  entity,  the  reasons  for  the 
same were not disclosed / were not brought out clearly. In such cases, the 
investors were often left unaware as to the reasons for such delays which 
may have had an impact on their investment decision. Hence, a need for 
disclosure by listed entities of reasons for delay in submission of financial 
results arises.  

4.  Accordingly,  if  any  listed  entity  does  not  submit  its  financial  results  in 
accordance  with  the  timelines  specified  in  Regulation  33  of  Listing 
Regulations,  the  listed  entity  shall  disclose  detailed  reasons  for  such 
delay  to  the  stock  exchanges  within  one  working  day  of  the  due  date  of 
submission  for  the  results  as  required  under  Regulation  33.  However,  if
