Dear Sir/Madam,
 
Sub: SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations, 2003
 

Please refer to the following circulars issued by SEBI, on the captioned subject:
 
Circular No. MAPIN/Cir-01/2004 dated 1.1.2004
Circular No. MAPIN/Cir-02/2004 dated 1.1.2004
Circular No. MAPIN/Cir-03/2004 dated 1.1.2004
Circular No. MAPIN/Cir-04/2004 dated 2.1.2004
 
SEBI has received representations from the intermediaries/entities that the requirement of preparing individual demand drafts for each of their employees and their dependants is a very cumbersome process. Similarly, clarifications have been sought as to whether dependent minor children of the related persons mentioned in sub-clauses (i) to (vii) of regulation 4(1)(b) of the captioned Regulations have to obtain unique identification numbers.
 
It is hereby clarified that payment towards the application fee can be made in the form of consolidated demand draft in favour of SEBI, along with a list of particulars of the persons on behalf of whom the applications and the payments are made. This would be deemed to be in compliance with Regulation 12 of the captioned Regulations.
 
It is also clarified that dependent minor children of the natural persons mentioned in sub-clauses (i) to (vii) of regulation 4(1)(b) of the captioned Regulations need not obtain unique identification numbers or make applications in respect of the same.
 
This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, to protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market. 
 

Yours faithfully,
V S SUNDARESAN
