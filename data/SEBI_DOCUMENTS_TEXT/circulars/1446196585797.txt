information  for  the  investor  to  take  well  informed  investment  decision.  Also,  the 

investor  has  the  option  to  obtain  full  prospectus  from  the  market  intermediaries 

associated  with  the  public  issue  and  can  also  download  from  the  websites  of 

stock exchanges, merchant bankers and SEBI.   

 

3. 

The revised format of abridged prospectus as per Regulation 58 (1) and Part D of 

Schedule  VIII  of  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 

Regulations, 2009, is placed at Annexure I.
