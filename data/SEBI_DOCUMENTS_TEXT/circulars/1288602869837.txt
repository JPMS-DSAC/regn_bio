Review Report to ……………………. 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of _________ 
(Name of the Company) for the period ended ______. This statement is the responsibility of 
the Company’s management and has been approved by the Board of Directors/ committee of 
Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based 
on our review.  
 
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagement  (SRE) 
2400,  Engagements  to  Review  Financial  Statements  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
A  review  is  limited  primarily  to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical  procedures 
applied  to  financial  data  and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not 
performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to  believe  that  the  accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  prepared  in 
accordance  with  applicable  accounting  standards19  and  other  recognised  accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of
