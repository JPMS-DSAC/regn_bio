Dear Sir/Madam,
 
Sub : Listing of further issue of capital
 
1.      SEBI had, vide its circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-15 /2001 dated March 08, 2001 mandated, inter alia, that a listed company shall be required to obtain 'in-principle' approval for listing from the stock exchanges before issuing further shares or securities.
2.      The Government of India vide circular No.F.No.1/9/SE/2003 dated April 23, 2003 has, inter alia, withdrawn the requirement relating to compulsory listing by companies on regional stock exchange. Keeping in view the letter and spirit of the said circular, it has been decided that if a company is listed on any stock exchange which is having nationwide trading terminals, it would be a sufficient compliance of the aforesaid SEBI circular, if it obtains ‘in-principle’ approval from such stock exchange(s) for further issue of shares or securities. Where the company is not so listed on any stock exchange having nationwide trading terminals, it shall continue to obtain ‘in-principle’ approval from all the exchanges where it is listed as was provided in the aforesaid Circular dated March 08, 2001.

Where the company is not listed on any exchange having nationwide trading terminals, it agrees to obtain such ‘in-principle’ approval from all the exchanges in which it is listed before issuing further shares or securities.”
