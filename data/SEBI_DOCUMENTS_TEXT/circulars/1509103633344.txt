CIRCULAR 

 

SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2017/114 

                          

 

      October 6, 2017 

 

All Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies (AMCs)/  

Trustee Companies/Boards of Trustees of Mutual Funds/ AMFI 

 

Sir/ Madam, 

 

Subject: Categorization and Rationalization of Mutual Fund Schemes 

 

1.  It is desirable that different schemes launched by a Mutual Fund are clearly distinct 
in terms of asset allocation, investment strategy etc. Further, there is a need to bring 
in uniformity in the characteristics of similar type of schemes launched by different 
Mutual Funds. This would ensure that an investor of Mutual Funds is able to evaluate 
the  different  options  available,  before  taking  an  informed  decision  to  invest  in  a 
scheme. 
 

2.  In order to bring the desired uniformity in the practice, across Mutual Funds and to 
standardize the scheme categories and characteristics of each category, the issue 
was  discussed  in  Mutual  Fund  Advisory  Committee  (MFAC).  Accordingly,  it  has 
been decided to categorize the MF schemes as given below: 
 

I.  Categories  of  Schemes,  Scheme  Characteristics  and  Type  of  Scheme  (Uniform 

Description of Schemes): 

 

3.  The Schemes would be broadly classified in the following groups: 

a.  Equity Schemes 
b.  Debt Schemes 
c.  Hybrid Schemes 
d.  Solution Oriented Schemes 
e.  Other Schemes 

 

The details of the scheme categories under each of the aforesaid groups along with their 
characteristics and uniform description are given in the Annexure. 
 

4.  As per the annexure, the existing ‘type of scheme’ (presently mentioned below the 
scheme  name  in  the  offer  documents/  advertisements/  marketing  material/etc) 
would be replaced with the type of scheme (given in the third column of the tables 
in the Annexure) as applicable to each category of scheme. This will enhance the 
existing disclosure. Hence, for the purpose of alignment of the existing schemes with

the  provisions  of  this  circular,  change  in  “type  of  scheme”  alone,  would  not  be 
considered as a change in fundamental attribute. 

5.  In  case  of  Solution  oriented  schemes,  there  will  be  specified  period  of  lock  in  as 

stated in the Annexure.  
However, the said lock- in period would not be applicable to any existing investment 
by an investor, registered SIPs and incoming STPs in the existing solution oriented 
schemes  as  on  the  date  on  which  such  scheme  is  getting  realigned  with  the 
provisions of this circular. 
 

6.  The investment objective, investment strategy and benchmark of each scheme shall 
be suitably modified  (wherever applicable) to bring it in line with the categories of 
schemes listed above. 

 

 

II.  Definition of Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap: 

7.  In  order  to  ensure  uniformity  in  respect  of  the  investment  universe  for  equity 
schemes, it has been decided to define large cap, mid cap and small cap as follows: 

a.  Large Cap: 1st -100th company in terms of full market capitalization 
b.  Mid Cap: 101st -250th company in terms of full market capitalization 
c.  Small Cap: 251st company onwards in terms of full market capitalization 

8.  Mutual Funds would be required to adopt the list of stocks prepared by AMFI in this 

regard and AMFI would adhere to the following points while preparing the list:  

a.  If a stock is listed on more than one recognized stock exchange, an average of full 
market capitalization of the stock on all such stock exchanges, will be computed; 
b.  In case a stock is listed on only one of the recognized stock exchanges, the full 

market capitalization of that stock on such an exchange will be considered.  

c.  This list would be uploaded on the AMFI website and the same would be updated 
every six months based on the data as on the end of June and December of each 
year. The data shall be available on the AMFI website within 5 calendar days from 
the end of the 6 months period.  

 

9.  Subsequent to any updation in the list, Mutual Funds would have to rebalance their 

portfolios (if required) in line with updated list, within a period of one month. 
 

III.  Process to be followed for categorization and rationalization of schemes: 

a.  Only one scheme per category would be permitted, except: 

i. 
Index Funds/ ETFs replicating/ tracking different indices;  
ii.  Fund of Funds having different underlying schemes; and  
iii.  Sectoral/ thematic funds investing in different sectors/ themes 

b.  Mutual Funds would be required to analyze each of their existing schemes in light of 
the list of categories stated herein and submit their proposals to SEBI after obtaining 
due approvals from their Trustees as early as possible but not later than 2 months 
from the date of this circular.

c.  The  aforesaid  proposals  of  the  Mutual  Funds  would  also  include  the  proposed 
course  of  action  (viz.,  winding  up,  merger,  fundamental  attribute  change  etc.)  in 
respect of the existing similar schemes as well as those that are not in alignment to 
the categories stated herein. 

d.  Subsequent  to  the  observations  issued  by  SEBI  on  the  proposals,  Mutual  Funds 
would have to  carry out the necessary changes in all respects within a maximum 
period of 3 months from the date of such observation. 

e.  Where there is a merger of schemes/change of fundamental attribute(s) of a scheme 
(as laid down under SEBI Circular No. IIMARP/MF/CIR/01/294/98 dated February 
4, 1998), the AMCs would be required to comply with Regulation 18 (15A) of SEBI 
(Mutual Funds Regulation, 1996).  

f.  Mutual  Funds  are  advised  to  strictly  adhere  to  the  scheme  characteristics  stated 
herein  as  well  as  to  the  spirit  of  this  circular.  Mutual  Funds  must  ensure  that  the 
schemes  so  devised  should  not  result  in  duplication/minor  modifications  of  other 
schemes offered by them. The decision of SEBI in this regard shall be binding on all 
the mutual funds. 
 

IV.  Applicability of this circular: 

a.  All existing open ended schemes of all Mutual Funds  
b.  All such open ended schemes where SEBI has issued final observations but have 

not yet been launched. 

c.  All open ended  schemes in respect of which draft scheme documents have been 

filed with SEBI as on date 

d.  All open ended schemes for which a mutual fund would file draft scheme document. 

 
This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  under  Section  11  (1)  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provision of Regulation 77 
of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 to protect the interests of investors in securities 
and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
