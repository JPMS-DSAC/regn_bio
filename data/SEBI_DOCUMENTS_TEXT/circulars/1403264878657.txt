Sir/Madam, 
 
 
Sub: Minimum Assets under Management (AUM) of Debt Oriented Schemes 
 
 

1. 

It has been observed that many debt oriented schemes are operating with 
a  very  low  AUM.  In  the  interest  of  investors,  it  is  important  that  debt 
oriented  schemes  have  an  adequate  corpus  to  ensure  adherence  to  the 
investment  objectives  as  stated  in  Scheme  Information  Document  and 
compliance  with  investment  restrictions  specified  under  SEBI  (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations, 1996.  

2. 

In this regard, it has been decided that: 

a) The  minimum  subscription  amount  of  debt  oriented  and  balanced 
schemes at the time of new fund offer shall be at least `20 crore and 
that of other schemes shall be at least  `10 crore. 

 
b) An  average  AUM  of  `20  crore  on  half  yearly  rolling  basis  shall  be 

maintained for open ended debt oriented schemes. 

c) The  existing  open  ended  debt  oriented  schemes  shall  comply  with 
point  (b)  stated  above  within  one  year  from  the  date  of  issue  of  this 
circular. 

 
d) In case of breach of points  (b) and (c) above, the AMC shall scale up 
the  AUM  of  such  scheme  within  a  period  of  six  months  so  as  to 
comply  with  point  (b)  stated  above,  failing  which  the  provisions  of 
Regulation 39 (2) (c) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 would 
become applicable. 

e) The  confirmation  on  compliance  of  the  above  shall  be  reported  to 

SEBI in the Half Yearly Trustee Reports. 

 

 

3.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under section 11(1)
