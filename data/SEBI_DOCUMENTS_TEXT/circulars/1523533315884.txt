SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2018/69                                           April 12, 2018

Sir/Madam, 

 

Subject: Performance disclosure post consolidation/ Merger of Schemes  

1.  Reference  is  drawn  to  Schedule  VI  under  Regulation  30  of  SEBI  (Mutual 

Funds)  Regulations,  1996  and  SEBI  circular  dated  March  15,  2017  which 

govern the depiction of past performance of schemes. 

2.  Currently,  there  are  no  specific  guidelines  governing  the  depiction  of 

performance  of  the  surviving  scheme,  pursuant  to  merger  of  schemes. 

Further,  it  is  observed  that  Mutual  Funds  adopt  varied  practices,  such  as 

disclosing  the  weighted  average  performance  or  performance  of  surviving 

schemes, while making such disclosures.   

3.  In  order  to  standardize  the  disclosure  of  performance  of  schemes  post-

merger,  the  issue  was  discussed  in  Mutual  Fund  Advisory  Committee 

(MFAC)  and  based  on  the  recommendations,  it  has  been  decided  to 

disclose the performance, post-merger of schemes as given below:  

 
i) 

When  two  schemes,  for  example,  Scheme  A  (Transferor  Scheme) 

&  Scheme  B  (Transferee  Scheme),  having  similar  features,  get 

merged  and  the  merged  scheme  i.e.,  surviving  scheme  also  has 

the  same  features,  the  weighted  average  performance  of  both  the 

schemes needs to be disclosed. 

 
When Scheme A (Transferor Scheme) gets merged into Scheme B 

ii) 

(Transferee  Scheme)  and  the  features  of  Scheme  B  are  retained, 

the performance of the scheme whose features are retained needs 

to be disclosed.

iii)  When Scheme A (Transferor Scheme) gets merged into Scheme B 

(Transferee  Scheme)  and  the  features  of  Scheme  A  (Transferor 

scheme)  are  retained,  the  performance  of  the  scheme  whose 

features are retained needs to be disclosed. 

 

iv)  When Scheme A (Transferor Scheme) gets merged with Scheme B 

(Transferee Scheme) and a new scheme, Scheme C emerges after 

such  consolidation  or  merger  of  schemes,  the  past  performance 

need not be provided. 

4.  In  addition  to  disclosing  the  performance  of  the  scheme  as  mentioned  in 

para 3 above, past performance of such scheme(s) whose features are not 

retained post-merger may also be made available on request with adequate 

disclaimer. 

 

 

 

5.  This circular shall be applicable with effect from May 01, 2018. 

 

6.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) 

of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the 

provisions  of  Regulation  77  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  to
