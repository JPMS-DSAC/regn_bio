All Debenture Trustees 

Dear Sir / Madam, 

Sub:  Reporting of information on a quarterly basis 

1.  Vide  circular  no.  2(1999-2000)  dated  April  19,  1999  and  Circular  No. 
MIRSD/DPS2/DT/CIR-2/2004  dated  March  9,  2004,  SEBI  had  advised  all 
Debenture  Trustees  to  submit  information  pertaining  to  their  activities  on  a 
quarterly basis as per the format prescribed in the aforementioned circulars.   

 
2.  In  partial  modification  of  the  aforementioned  circulars,  it  has  now  been 
decided that beginning from the quarter ending June 30, 2008, the debenture 
trustees shall submit the quarterly reports to SEBI in electronic form only and 
the  submission  of  such  reports  in  hard  copy  shall  be  dispensed  with.    The 
quarterly  report  in  the  prescribed  format  shall  be  submitted  to  e-mail  id 
dt@sebi.gov.in  in  pdf  and  excel  format.    Thus,  Debenture  Trustees  who 
have      to  report  information  shall  send  two  files  by  e-mail  –  one  file  in  pdf 
format and the other in excel format on a quarterly basis. In respect of those 
Debenture  Trustees  who  have  no  information  to  submit  during  a  particular 
quarter with regard to activities mentioned  in Part I, II, III and IV of Circular 
No.  2  (1999-2000)  dated  April  19,  1999  and  also  with  regard  to  activities 
mentioned in Circular No. MIRSD/DPS2/DT/CIR-2/2004 dated March 9, 2004, 
such Debenture Trustees need not furnish any report to SEBI for that quarter.

3.  The pdf/excel  files containing the quarterly report shall  be sent to email  id  
dt@sebi.gov.in  with  the  title  “Quarterly  report  submitted  by  aaa  for  the 
quarter ended xxx yyyy” where aaa represents the name of the   Debenture 
Trustee,  xxx  represents  the  month  at  the  end  of  the  quarter  and  yyyy 
represents the year. Also, the attached pdf/excel file containing the quarterly 
report shall bear the name of the   debenture trustee as well as  the month at 
the  end  of  the  quarter    and  the  corresponding  year.    For  example,  if    a 
Debenture  Trustee  ABC  Limited  submits  the  report  for  the  quarter  ended 
June 2008, the report  sent to dt@sebi.gov.in shall bear the title” Quarterly 
report  submitted  by  ABC  Limited  for  the  quarter  ended  June  2008”  and  the 
attached  pdf/excel  file  shall  bear  the  name  “ABCLimitedquarterlyJune2008”.  
The report submitted shall also be duly certified by the compliance officer. 

 
4.  The  other  terms  and  conditions  mentioned  including  the  time  schedule  for 
submission of the quarterly reports mentioned in our Circulars No. 2 (1999-
2000)  dated  April  19,  1999  and  Circular  No.  MIRSD/DPS2/DT/CIR-2/2004 
dated March 9, 2004  shall remain unchanged. 

 
5.  This  circular  is  being  issued  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  under 
Section 11 (1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Copy of 
the circular is also available on the SEBI web-site www.sebi.gov.in.
