Dear Sir,
SUB : Usage of interest income earned on Investor Protection Fund.
Investor Protection Fund has been formed to compensate the investors for loss in the event of the broker being declared defaulter. Over the period, there has been an increase in the corpus of this fund and the disbursement from the fund has come down drastically due to implementation of improved risk management.
In order to promote investor education and to create greater investor awareness, it has been decided to permit all the Stock Exchanges to utilize interest income earned on Investor Protection Fund for investor education, awareness and research.
Yours faithfully,    
S.V. MURALIDHAR RAO DIVISION CHIEF ECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT Fax : 022-2845761 email : mdrao@sebi.gov.in
