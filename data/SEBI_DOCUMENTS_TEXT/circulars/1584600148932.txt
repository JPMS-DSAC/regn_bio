Madam / Sir, 
 
Sub: Relaxation from compliance with certain provisions of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 due to the CoVID -19 virus pandemic 
 

1.  The CoVID 19 virus has hit populations around the world and has resulted in many restrictions, 
including free movement of people, thereby hampering businesses and day to day functioning 
of companies. It has been declared a ‘pandemic’ by the World Health Organization (WHO).  
 

2.  Developments arising due to the spread of the virus warrant the need for temporary relaxations 
in  compliance  requirements  for  listed  entities.  Accordingly,  SEBI  has  decided  to  grant  the 
following  relaxations  from  compliance  stipulations  specified  under  the  SEBI  (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR’) to listed entities.
