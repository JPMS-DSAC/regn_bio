DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER 
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT 
 
 
 
 
All Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies (AMCs) 
Association of Mutual Funds (AMFI) 
 
Dear Sir, 
 
Sub: AMFI Guidelines for change of mutual fund distributor  
 
 
It has come to the notice of SEBI that unwarranted hardship is being caused to investors 
in mutual fund schemes who wish to switch from an existing mutual fund distributor to 
either another mutual fund distributor or opt to deal direct.   
 
Some Asset Management Companies (AMCs) are insisting on the investor procuring a 
‘No Objection Certificate’ (NoC) from the existing distributor for this switch over, despite 
the  guideline  from  Association  of  Mutual  Funds  in  India  (AMFI).  Vide  circular  dated 
September  5,  2007,  AMFI  had  mandated,  inter-alia,  that  on  receipt  of  letter  from  the 
investor advising AMCs about his desire to change his distributor, AMCs will act on that 
instruction.    It  appears  that  this  mandate  is  not  being  followed  by  the  mutual  fund 
industry. 
 
The inconsistent practices prevailing in the industry is causing hardship to investors and 
should  stop  forthwith.    You  are,  therefore,  advised  to  ensure  compliance  with  the 
instruction of the investor informing his desire to change his distributor and / or go direct, 
without compelling that investor to obtain an NoC from the existing distributor. 
 
All mutual funds shall comply with the above requirements in letter and spirit. 

These guidelines are issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with the provisions of Regulation 
77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. 

 

Yours faithfully, 

 

ASHA SHETTY
