Sub: Introduction of Volatility Index 

 

The SEBI appointed Derivatives Market Review Committee (DMRC), headed by Professor M. 
Rammohan Rao, recommended the introduction of Volatility Index and Futures and Options on 
this Index.  
 
Accordingly, it has been decided that, to begin with, Exchanges shall construct a Volatility Index 
and disseminate the same. The Exchanges are free to decide whether they want to adopt any of 
the  Volatility  Index  computation  models  available  globally  or  may  like  to  develop  their  own 
model  for  computation  of  Volatility  Index.  The  detailed  methodology  for  computing  the 
Volatility Index shall be disseminated by the Exchange for the benefit of the market participants 
and investors. 
 
Based on experience gained and awareness generated, derivatives on Volatility Index shall be 
considered for introduction in due course of time. 
 
This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 11 of 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  to  promote  the  development  of  the 
securities market. 
 
This circular is available on SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in, under the category “Derivatives – 
Circulars”. The Circular shall come into force from the date of the circular. 

 
 

Yours faithfully, 
 
 
 
Dr. Sanjeevan Kapshe
