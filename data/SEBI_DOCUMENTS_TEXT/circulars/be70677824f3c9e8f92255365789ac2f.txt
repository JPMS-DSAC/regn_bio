Sub: Corporate Governance in listed Companies – Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement 
 
SEBI, vide circular SEBI/CFD/DIL/CG/1/2004/12/10 dated October 29, 2004, issued the revised clause 49 of the listing agreement, which was to come into effect by April 1, 2005. Since it was brought to SEBI’s notice that a large number of companies were still not in a state of preparedness to be fully compliant with the requirements as contained in the revised clause 49, SEBI extended the date for ensuring compliance with the revised Clause 49 of the listing agreement upto December 31, 2005 vide circular no. SEBI/CFD/DIL/CG/1/2005/29/3 dated March 29, 2005. The revised clause 49 thus has come into effect from January 1, 2006. 
 
SEBI has been in receipt of a number of requests/suggestions to bring about clarifications on certain provisions of the revised Clause 49. After examining the same, it has been decided to make the following changes to certain provisions of the revised clause 49: 
 
·The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. 
 

Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the previous approval of shareholders. 

 
·Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting.
 
In view of the above, certain changes have to be incorporated in the revised Clause 49, details of which are placed in Annexure I
 
The Stock Exchanges are advised to accordingly amend the listing agreement with immediate effect.
 
Yours faithfully,
 
Parag Basu
