Dear Sir,
Sub : RRTI CIRCULAR 1(98-99)
Reg : Arms length relationship between the issuer company and the registrar to the issue.
SEBI had amended the SEBI (Registrars to issue and share transfer agents) Rules and Regulations, 1993, in September 1997, to introduce an arms length relationship between the issuer and the registrar, in the form of Regulation 13(A). This change was notified in the government gazette dated September 17, 1997.
It has now come to SEBIâ€™s notice that some of the registrars are not aware of the said amendment though it was notified in the Government gazette.
This is to inform the Registrars to the issues about the said notification, with a direction to strictly comply with and adhere to Regulation 13(A). In this regard, enclosed please find a copy of the government gazette.
Please acknowledge the receipt.
Yours faithfully,
