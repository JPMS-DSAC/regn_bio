To, 

All Depositories 

 

CIRCULAR 

 

Subject:  Recording of all types of Encumbrances in Depository system 

 

Sir/ Madam, 

 

1.  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeover)  Regulations,  2011  requires 

promoters of a company to disclose details of their encumbered shares. In this regard, 

it  was  observed 

that  apart 

from  pledge,  hypothecation  and  non-disposal 

undertakings(NDUs),  currently  there  is  no  framework  to  capture  the  details  of  other 

types of encumbrances in the depository system.   

 

2.  It has now been decided that Depositories shall put in place a system for capturing and 

recording  all  types  of  encumbrances,  which  are  specified  under  Regulation  28(3)  of 

SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations,  2011,  as 

amended from time to time. Towards this end, Depositories shall follow processes and 

other norms similar to that stipulated for the purpose of capturing and recording NDUs 

in Depository system. This is apart from pledge and hypothecation, whose processes 

and  specific  norms  are  separately  provided  in  SEBI  (Depositories  &  Participants) 

Regulations, 2018 and circulars issued thereon. 

 

3.  The  freeze  and  unfreeze  instructions  executed  by  the  Participant  for  recording  all 

encumbrances will be subject to 100% concurrent audit.  

 

4.  The Depository Participant shall not facilitate or be party to any type of encumbrance 

outside the Depository system as outlined herein.  

 

5.  The Depositories shall implement the provisions of this circular within one month from 

the date of this circular.

6.  The Depositories are advised to: 

 

i.  make  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules  and  regulations  for  the 

implementation of the above decision, as may be applicable/necessary; 

ii. 

to carry out system changes if any to implement the above;

iv.  communicate to SEBI, the status of implementation of the provisions of this circular 

in their Monthly Development Report. 

 

7.  This  circular  is  being  issued  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  Section  11(1)  of 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and section 19 of the Depositories 

Act,  1996  to  protect  the  interest  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the 

development of, and to regulate the securities market.
