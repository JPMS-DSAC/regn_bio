2.  In  order  to  have  prudential  limits for  derivative  investments  by  mutual 
funds  and  to  bring  in  transparency  and  clarity  in  the  disclosure  of  the 
same to investors, it has been decided to bring in certain modification

20% of the net assets of the scheme. 

6.  Cash  or  cash  equivalents  with  residual  maturity  of  less  than  91  days

7.  Exposure  due  to  hedging  positions  may  not  be  included  in  the  above

b.  Hedging  positions  cannot  be  taken  for  existing  derivative 
positions.  Exposure  due  to  such  positions  shall  have  to  be 
added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 3. 

c.  Any  derivative  instrument  used  to  hedge  has  the  same 

underlying security as the existing position being hedged.  

d.  The  quantity  of  underlying  associated  with  the  derivative 
position  taken  for  hedging  purposes  does  not  exceed  the 
quantity  of  the  existing  position  against  which  hedge  has  been 
taken. 

8.  Mutual  Funds  may  enter  into  plain  vanilla  interest  rate  swaps  for 
hedging purposes. The counter party in such transactions has to be an 
entity recognized as a market maker by RBI.  Further, the value of the 
notional  principal  in  such  cases  must  not  exceed  the  value  of 
respective existing assets being hedged by the scheme. Exposure to a 
single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of the 
net assets of the scheme. 

9.  Exposure  due  to  derivative  positions  taken  for  hedging  purposes  in 
excess  of  the  underlying  position  against  which  the  hedging  position 
has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point 3. 

Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions 

10. Each  position  taken  in  derivatives  shall  have  an  associated  exposure 
as  defined  under.  Exposure  is  the  maximum  possible  loss  that  may 
occur  on  a  position.  However,  certain  derivative  positions  may 
theoretically  have  unlimited  possible  loss.  Exposure  in  derivative 
positions shall be computed as follows: 

 

 Position 

Exposure 

Long Future  Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts 

Short Future  Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts 

Option 
bought 

Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts.  

Disclosure of derivatives in Half Yearly Portfolios 

11. The manner of disclosure of derivatives position in half yearly portfolio 
disclosure  reports has  not  been  specified  in  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds) 
Regulations,  1996  and  the  disclosures  being  currently  made  are  not 
uniform  across  the  industry.  Therefore,  the  following  format  for  the 
purpose of uniform disclosure of investments in derivative instruments
