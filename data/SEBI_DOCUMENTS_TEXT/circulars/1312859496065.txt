decided  to  permit  SEBI  registered  Mutual  Funds  to  accept  subscriptions  from  foreign 

investors who meet the KYC requirements for equity schemes. This would enable Indian

investors in Indian equity market.”

through the following two routes: 

2.1.  Direct  route  -  Holding  MF  units  in  demat  account  through  a  SEBI  registered 

depository participant (DP). 

2.2.  Indirect route- Holding MF units via Unit Confirmation Receipt (UCR).  

 

3.  The  investment  through  the  above  mentioned  routes  shall  be  subject  to  the  following 

conditions : 

3.1.  Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) shall mean a person resident in a country that 

is  compliant  with  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF)  standards  and  that  is  a
