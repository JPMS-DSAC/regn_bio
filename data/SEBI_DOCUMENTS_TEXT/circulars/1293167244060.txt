observed by SEBI that the Stock Exchanges were following varying practices 
with  respect  to  the  setting  up,  management  of  and  the  disbursements  from 
the IPF/CPF. 

 
3.  With  a  view  to  bring  about  uniformity  in  the  practices  followed  by  Stock 
Exchanges with respect to the constitution, management and the utilisation of 
the  IPF/CPF  at  the  Stock  Exchanges,  the  provisions  of  the  IPF/CPF  have 
been  reviewed  and  consolidated.  The  Comprehensive  Guidelines  on  the 
IPF/CPF are enclosed as Annexure. These Guidelines are being issued after 
a  due  consultative  process  with  the  public  and  after  the  approval  of  the 
Secondary Market Advisory Committee of SEBI.
