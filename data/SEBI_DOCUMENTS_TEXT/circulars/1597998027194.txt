Clearing Member leading to default 

 

 

 

1.  SEBI  vide  circular  dated  December  17,  2018  had  specified  Early  Warning 
Mechanism to prevent diversion of client’s securities and consequential action(s) 
to be initiated by the Stock Exchanges (“SEs”), Clearing Corporations (“CCs”) and 
Depositories were also specified in the said Circular.  

2.  With the introduction of uniform membership structure of Trading Member (“TM”) 
and  Clearing  Member (“CM”)  across  all  segments,  the TM  shall make  good  the 
default of its clients to the CM and the CM shall make good the default of its clients 
/ TM to the CC. The default of TM may not necessarily lead to default of CM, if the 
CM continues to fulfill the settlement obligation with the CC. To protect the interest 
of non-defaulting clients of a TM and /or non-defaulting clients / TM(s) of the CM, 
in the likely event of default by TM / CM, there is a need for Standard Operating 
Procedure  (“SoP”)  enumerating  the  steps  to  be  taken  by  the  SEs  /  CCs  / 
Depositories in such cases where SE / CC is of the view that TM / CM is likely to 
default in repayment of funds or securities to its clients. 
 

3.  In order to harmonize the action amongst all SEs / CCs / Depositories in a time 
bound  manner  this  SoP  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  SEs,  CCs  and 
Depositories  so  as  to  achieve  uniformity  in  implementation  of  actions.  The  SoP 
lays down the actions to be initiated by the SEs / CCs / Depositories within a time 
frame after detection of the early warning signals as laid out in the Circular dated 
December 17, 2018 and other triggers as laid down in this circular untill declaration 
of defaulter of TM / CM by the SE / CC. Once the TM is declared defaulter, the 
proceedings shall be in compliance with the bye-laws, rules and regulations of SE 
/ CC respectively. 

 

4.  On analysis of early warning signals or any of the following triggers, if the SE / CC 
is  of  the  view  that  the  TM  /  CM  is  likely  to  default  in  the  repayment  of  funds  / 
securities to its clients and / or fail to meet the settlement obligations to CM / CC, 
where:  

a)  There  is  shortage  of  funds  /  securities  payable  to  the  clients  by  Rs.  10 

crore (SE may have their own criteria) and / or  

b)  TM / CM has failed to meet the settlement obligations to CM / CC and / or
