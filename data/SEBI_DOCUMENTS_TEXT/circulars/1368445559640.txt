Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:  SEBI  Circular  No.  CIR/CFD/DIL/3/2013  dated  January  17,  2013  -  
Amendments  to  SEBI  (Employee  Stock  Option  Scheme  and  Employee 
Stock  Purchase  Scheme)  Guidelines,  1999  and  Equity  Listing  Agreement- 
Clarification 

 

1.  SEBI  vide  Circular  No.  CIR/CFD/DIL/3/2013  dated  January  17,  2013  made 
amendments to Equity Listing Agreement and  SEBI (Employee Stock Option 
Schemes and Employee Stock Purchase Schemes) Guidelines, 1999 ("SEBI 
(ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines,  1999").  The  amendment  to  Equity  Listing 
Agreement through insertion of Clause 35 C mandated that all the employee 
benefit  schemes  involving  the  securities  of  the  company  shall  be  in 
compliance  with  SEBI  (ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines,  1999  and  any  other 
guidelines,  regulations  etc.  framed  by  SEBI  in  this  regard.    The  said  clause 
also  required  that  all  the  employee  benefit  schemes  already  framed  and 
implemented  by  the  company  involving  dealing  in  the  securities  of  the 
company, before the insertion of this clause shall be aligned with and made to 
conform to SEBI (ESOS and ESPS) Guidelines, 1999 by June 30, 2013. 

 
2.  The  amendment  to  SEBI  (ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines  1999  also  provided 
that  no  ESOS/ESPS  schemes  shall  involve  acquisition  of  securities  of  the 
company from the secondary market. 

 
3.  SEBI  is  in  receipt  of  various  representations  seeking  clarification  on  the 
applicability  of  the  circular  as  well  as  on  the  continued  holding  of  securities 
already  acquired  by  employee  benefit  trusts  before  the  date  of  the  circular, 
beyond  June  30,  2013,  i.e.  the  last  date  by  which  listed  companies  are 
required  to  align  their  employee  benefit  schemes  involving  securities  of  the 
company with SEBI (ESOS and ESPS) Guidelines 1999. 

 
4.  It has been decided to issue following clarifications on the said topics: 
 
5.  Applicability of the circular 
 

The circular No. CIR/CFD/DIL/3/2013 dated January 17, 2013 is applicable to 
all  employee  benefit  schemes  involving  the  securities  of  the  company 
provided that the schemes are set up, managed or financed by the company

directly  or  indirectly.  Thus,  the  circular  shall  be  applicable  if  any  of  the 
following conditions are satisfied: 
a)  if  the  company  has  set  up  the  scheme  or  the  trust/agency  managing  the 

scheme; or 

b)  if the company has direct or indirect control over the affairs of the scheme 

or the trust/agency managing the scheme; or 

c)  if the company has extended any  direct or indirect financial assistance to 
the  employee  benefit  schemes  or  the  trust/agency  managing  such 
schemes. 

 
6.  Extension of time for aligning the employee  benefit schemes with SEBI 

Guidelines 
 
The  circular  dated  January  17,  2013  required  that  all  employee  benefit 
schemes involving securities of the company shall be aligned with and made 
to  conform  to  SEBI  (ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines  by  June  30,  2013.  It  has 
been  decided  to  extend  the  time  limit  for  such  alignment  to  December  31, 
2013.  Accordingly,  in  Clause  35C  (ii)  of  the  Equity  Listing  Agreement,  the 
words "June 30, 2013" shall be replaced with "December 31, 2013". 
 
However, further grant of options from the date of the circular i.e. January 17, 
2013, shall be strictly in accordance with SEBI (ESOS and ESPS) Guidelines 
1999.  Accordingly,  there  shall  not  be  any  grant  of  options  to  employees 
ineligible under Clause 4.2 and 4.3 of the SEBI (ESOS and ESPS) Guidelines 
1999 from January 17, 2013. 
 

7.  Holding of securities by Trusts beyond December 31, 2013 
 

Employee  benefits  trusts  which  have  already  acquired  securities  of  the 
company  from  secondary  market  before  the  date  of  the  circular  No. 
CIR/CFD/DIL/3/2013  i.e  January  17,  2013,  may  continue  to  hold  such 
securities beyond the date specified for alignment of the schemes with SEBI 
(ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines  1999  i.e.  December  31,  2013,  provided  that 
the  schemes  have  been  aligned  with  SEBI  (ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines 
1999  and  such  securities  are  used  only  in  accordance  with  such  aligned 
schemes. 

 
8.  Continued  holding  of  securities  by  non-ESOP  employee  benefit 

schemes 
Existing employee benefit schemes involving securities of the company which 
does not involve granting of options to/ purchase of securities by employees 
shall be permitted to either:

a)  hold  the  securities  of  the  company  already  acquired  by  them  beyond
