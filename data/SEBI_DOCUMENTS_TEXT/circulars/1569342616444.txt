Sir / Madam, 

 

Sub: Valuation of money market and debt securities  

 

1.0  Review  of  existing  provisions  on  valuation  of  money  market  and  debt 

securities:  

 

1.1  SEBI  vide  various  circulars  prescribed  the  guidelines  on  valuation  of  money 

market and debt securities. In order to align these guidelines with best market 

practices  and  improve  the  robustness  of  valuation  of  these  securities,  the 

following has been decided: 

 

1.1.1 

Definition  of  non-traded,  thinly  traded  and  traded  money  market  /  debt 

security:  

 

Reference:  Point  3  under  “Guidelines  for  valuation  of  securities  for  Mutual 

Funds” in SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 dated September 18, 2000, 

Paragraphs  1  and  2  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  MFD/CIR  No.14/442/2002  dated 

February 20, 2002  

 

1.1.1.1 

In line with the current industry practice, the present definition of traded and 

non-traded  money  market  and  debt  securities  needs  to  be  updated.

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

Accordingly, traded and non-traded money market and debt securities shall 

be defined as follows: 

 

a.  A money market or debt security shall be considered as traded when, on 

the date of valuation, there are trades (in marketable lots) in that security 

on  any  recognized  Stock  Exchange  or  there  are  trades  reported  (in 

marketable  lots)  on  the  trade  reporting  platform  of  recognized  stock 

exchanges  or  The  Clearing  Corporation  of  India  Ltd.  (CCIL).  In  this 

regard, the marketable lots shall be defined by AMFI, in consultation with 

SEBI. 

 

b.  A  money  market  or  debt  security  shall  be  considered  as  non-traded 

when, on the date of valuation, there are no trades (in marketable lots) in 

such  security  on  any  recognized  Stock  Exchange  or  no  trades  (in 

marketable lots) have been reported on any of the aforementioned trade 

reporting platforms. 

 

1.1.1.2 

As  the  valuation  methodology  for  thinly  traded  debt  securities  is  same  as 

non-traded  debt  securities,  a  separate  definition  of  thinly  traded  debt 

securities is not required and stands deleted as provided in aforementioned 

circular. 

 

1.1.2 

Valuation  of  money  market  /  debt  securities,  Government  Securities, 

investments 

in  short 

term  deposits  (pending  deployment)  and  OTC 

derivatives:  

 

1.1.2.1 

Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual  maturity  of 

upto 30 days:

SEBI  Circular  No.  Cir/IMD/DF/6/2012  dated  February  28,  2012  and 

Paragraph  1.0  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  SEBI/HO/IMD/DF4/CIR/P/2019/41 

dated March 22, 2019  

 

a. 

In  partial  modification  to  the  aforesaid  circulars,  the  following  has  been 

decided:  

 

 
 

i.  Amortization based valuation is permitted for money market and debt 

securities  including  floating  rate  securities,  with  residual  maturity  of 

upto  30  days.  Further,  the  amortized  price  shall  be  compared  with 

the  reference  price  which  shall  be  the  average  of  the  security  level 

price  of  such  security  as  provided  by  the  agency(ies)  appointed  by  

AMFI  for    said    purpose  (hereinafter    referred  to  as  “valuation 

agencies”). The amortized  price shall be used for valuation only if it 

is  within  a  threshold  of  ±0.025%  of  the  reference  price.  In  case  of 

deviation beyond this threshold, the price shall be adjusted to bring it 

within the threshold of ±0.025% of the reference price. 

 

ii. 

In  case  security  level  prices  given  by  valuation  agencies  are  not 

available  for  a  new  security  (which  is  currently  not  held  by  any 

Mutual  Fund),  then  such  security  may  be  valued  on  amortization 

basis on the date of allotment / purchase. 

 

iii.  Further, with effect from April 01, 2020 onwards, amortization based 

valuation  shall  be  dispensed  with  and  irrespective  of  residual 

maturity,  all  money  market  and  debt  securities  shall  be  valued  in 

terms of paragraph 1.1.2.2 below.

decided: 

 

 

i.  All  money  market  and  debt  securities 

including 

floating  rate 

securities,  with  residual  maturity  of  over  30  days  shall  be  valued  at 

average of security level prices obtained from valuation agencies.  

ii. 

In  case  security  level  prices  given  by  valuation  agencies  are  not 

available  for  a  new  security  (which  is  currently  not  held  by  any 

Mutual Fund), then such security may be valued at purchase yield on 

the date of allotment / purchase. 

 

1.1.2.3 

Valuation of Government Securities: 

 

 

Reference:  Paragraph  6  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  MFD/CIR  No.14/442/2002 

dated February 20, 2002

1.1.2.4 

Valuation of other money market / debt securities, short-term deposits with 

banks (pending deployment) and OTC derivatives: 

a.  The valuation of bills purchased under rediscounting scheme shall be as 

per the guidelines mentioned for valuation of money market instruments, 

at paragraphs 1.1.2.1 and 1.1.2.2, as the case may be. 

b. 

Investments in short-term deposits with banks (pending deployment) and 

repurchase (repo) transactions (including tri-party repo i.e. TREPS) with 

tenor of upto 30 days, shall be valued on cost plus accrual basis. 

c. 

In  order  to  have  uniformity  in  valuation  methodology,  prices  for  all OTC 

derivatives  and  market  linked  debentures  shall  be  obtained  from 

valuation agencies. 

 

 

 

 
 

1.1.3 

Valuation of securities with Put / Call Options: 

 

Reference: Provisions for “Valuation of securities with Put / Call options” in 

SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/ 8 / 92 / 2000 dated September 18, 2000  

 

1.1.3.1 

The  existing  provisions  for  valuation  of  securities  with  call  option  and 

securities with put option remain the same. However, in partial modification 

to  the  provision  on  valuation  of  securities  with  both  put  and  call  options  in 

the aforementioned circular, it has been decided that: 

 

a.  Only  securities  with  put  /  call  options  on  the  same  day  and  having  the 

same put and call option price, shall be deemed to mature on such put / 

call  date  and  shall  be  valued  accordingly.  In  all  other  cases,  the  cash 

flow of each put / call option shall be evaluated and the security shall be 

valued on the following basis:

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

i. 

Identify  a ‘Put Trigger  Date’, a date  on  which ‘price to  put  option’ is 

the  highest  when  compared  with  price  to  other  put  options  and 

maturity price. 

ii. 

Identify a ‘Call Trigger Date’, a date on  which ‘price to call option’ is 

the  lowest  when  compared  with  price  to  other  call  options  and 

maturity price.  

iii. 

In  case  no  Put  Trigger  Date  or  Call  Trigger  Date  (‘Trigger  Date”)  is 

available,  then  valuation  would  be  done  to  maturity  price.  In  case 

one Trigger Date is available, then valuation would be done as to the 

said  Trigger  Date.  In  case  both  Trigger  Dates  are  available,  then 

valuation would be done to the earliest date.  

 

 

 

 

1.1.3.2 

If a put option is not exercised by  a Mutual  Fund  when  exercising  such  put 

option  would  have  been  in  favour  of  the  scheme,  in  such  cases  the 

justification for not exercising the put option shall be provided to the Board of 

AMC and Trustees. 

 

1.1.4 

Deletion of various provisions: 

 

1.1.4.1  Considering  that  valuation  has  evolved  from  a  matrix  based  approach  to 

security  level  pricing,  the  following  provisions  in  existing  circulars  stand 

deleted:  

 

a.  The phrase “The approach in valuation of non traded  …….  account for 

illiquidity risk” under point no. (ii) (b) contained in “Guidelines for valuation 

of  securities  for  Mutual  Funds”  in  SEBI  Circular  No.  MFD/CIR/  8  /  92  / 

2000 dated September 18, 2000

2.0  Waterfall approach for valuation of money market and debt securities: 

 

It is decided that for arriving at security level pricing, a waterfall approach shall 

be followed for the valuation of money market and debt securities. 

  

2.1  AMFI  shall  ensure  that  valuation  agencies  have  a  documented  waterfall 

approach for valuation of money market and debt securities. The said waterfall 

approach shall be documented in consultation with SEBI. 

 

2.2 

The  following  broad  principles  should  be  adopted  as  part  of  the  aforesaid 

waterfall approach, for arriving at the security level prices: 

 

2.2.1 

All traded securities shall be valued on the basis of traded yields, subject to 

identification of outlier trades by the valuation agencies.  

 

2.2.2 

Volume Weighted  Average  Yield  (VWAY)  for  trades  in  the  last  one  hour  of 

trading  shall  be  used  as  the  basis  for  valuation  of  Government  Securities 

(including  T-bills).  Valuation  of  all  other  money  market  and  debt  securities 

(including  Government  securities  not  traded  in  last  one  hour)  shall  be  done 

on the basis of VWAY of all trades during the day. 

 

2.2.3 

An  indicative  list  of  exceptional  events  shall  form  part  of  the  documented 

waterfall approach mentioned above. In case of any exceptional events on a 

day, only VWAY of trades post such event may be considered for valuation. 

Further, all exceptional events along-with valuation carried out on such dates 

shall be documented with adequate justification.

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

2.2.4 

All  trades  on  stock  exchanges  and  trades  reported  on  trade  reporting 

platforms  till  end  of  the  trade  reporting  time  (excluding  Inter-scheme 

transfers), should be considered for valuation on that day. Towards this end, 

the timing for disclosure of Net Asset Value (NAV) on website of respective 

AMCs and AMFI, stands extended as per paragraph 3.0 below. 

 

2.2.5 

Considering  the  importance  of  polling  in  the  valuation  process,  guidelines 

shall  be  issued  by  AMFI  on  polling  by  valuation  agencies  and  on  the 

responsibilities  of  Mutual  Funds  in  the  polling  process,  as  part  of  the 

aforesaid  waterfall  approach.  These  guidelines  shall  inter-alia  include  the 

following: 

 

2.2.5.1  Valuation  agencies  shall  identify  the  Mutual  Funds  who  shall  participate  in 

the  polling  process  on  a  particular  day,  taking  into  account  factors  such  as 

diversification  of  poll  submitters  and  portfolio  holding  of  the  Mutual  Funds. 

Mutual Funds who are identified by the valuation agencies shall necessarily 

participate  in  the  polling  process.  However,  in  case  any  Mutual  Fund  does 

not  participate  in  the  polling  process,  detailed  reason  for  the  same  shall  be 

recorded and made available during SEBI inspections. 

 

2.2.5.2  The  minimum  number  of  polls  to  be  considered  for  valuation  along-with  the 

operational modalities of polling, shall be specified. 

 

2.2.5.3  AMCs  shall  have  a  written  policy,  approved  by  the  Board  of  AMC  and 

Trustees,  on  governance  of  the  polling  process.  The  aforesaid  policy  shall 

include measures for mitigation of potential conflicts of interest in the polling 

process and shall identify senior officials responsible for polling.  

 

2.2.5.4  AMCs shall ensure that participation in the polling process is not mis-used to 

inappropriately influence the valuation of securities. The officials of the AMC 

who  are  responsible  for  polling  in  terms  of  paragraph  2.2.5.3  above,  shall 

also be personally liable for any mis-use of the polling process.

2.2.5.5  AMCs  shall  maintain  an  audit  trail  for  all  polls  submitted  to  valuation 

agencies.  

 
The  aforesaid  waterfall  approach  shall  form  part  of  the  valuation  policy  of 

2.3 

individual  AMCs  which  is  uploaded  on  their  respective  websites.  AMFI  shall 

ensure that the said  waterfall approach  is also  available  on the  website  of the 

valuation agencies. 

 

3.0  Extension of time for disclosure of NAV: 

 

Reference: SEBI Circular No. SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 5/63714/06 dated March  29, 

2006 

 
In  order  to  enable  consideration  of  all  trades  during  a  day  for  valuation,  it  has 

3.1 

been decided to extend the present timeline upto 11:00 p.m. for uploading the 

NAVs of all schemes (except Fund of Fund  schemes)  on the  website of AMFI 

and respective AMCs.  

 

4.0  Deviation from valuation guidelines: 

 

4.1  As  per  the  Principles  of  Fair  Valuation  specified  in  Eighth  Schedule  of  SEBI 

(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, AMCs are responsible for true and fairness 

of valuation and correct NAV. Considering the same, in case  an AMC decides 

to deviate from the valuation price given by the valuation agencies, the detailed 

rationale for each instance of deviation shall be recorded by the AMC. 

 

4.2 

The  rationale  for  deviation  along-with  details  such  as  information  about  the 

security (ISIN, issuer name, rating etc.), price at which the security was valued 

vis-a-vis  the  price  as  per  the  valuation  agencies  and  the  impact  of  such 

deviation on scheme NAV (in amount and percentage terms) shall be reported 

to the Board of AMC and Trustees.

4.3 

The rationale for deviation along-with details as mentioned under paragraph 4.2 

above shall be disclosed immediately and prominently, under a separate head 

on the website of AMC.  

 
Further,  while  disclosing  the  total  number  of  instances  of  deviation  in  the 

4.4 

monthly and half-yearly portfolio statements, AMCs shall also provide the exact 

link to their website for accessing the information mentioned at paragraph 4.3. 

 

5.0  Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  rated  below  investment 

grade: 

 

Reference:  Paragraph  2.0  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  SEBI/HO/IMD/DF4/ 

CIR/P/2019/41  dated  March  22,  2019  on  valuation  of  money  market  and  debt 

securities rated below investment grade 

 

5.1 

In order to ensure uniformity in classification of securities as below investment 

grade or default and in the treatment of accrual of interest & future recovery (if 

any) with respect to such securities, the following has been decided:  

 

5.1.1 

Definition of below investment grade and default:  

 

5.1.1.1  A  money  market  or  debt  security  shall  be  classified  as  “below  investment 

grade”  if  the  long  term  rating  of  the  security  issued  by  a  SEBI  registered 

Credit Rating Agency (CRA) is below BBB- or if the short term rating  of the 

security is below A3. 

 

5.1.1.2  A money market or debt security shall be classified as “Default” if the interest 

and  /  or  principal  amount  has  not  been  received,  on  the  day  such  amount 

was due or when such security has been downgraded to “Default” grade by a 

CRA.  In  this  respect,  Mutual  Funds  shall  promptly  inform  to  the  valuation

agencies  and  the  CRAs,  any  instance  of  non-receipt  of  payment  of  interest 

and / or principal amount (part or full) in any security. 

 

 

 

5.1.2 

Treatment of accrued interest, future interest accrual and future recovery: 

 

5.1.2.1  The  treatment  of  accrued  interest  and  future  accrual  of  interest,  in  case  of 

money  market  and  debt  securities  classified  as  below  investment  grade  or 

default, is detailed below: 

 

a.  The  indicative  haircut  that  has  been  applied  to  the  principal  should  be 

applied to any accrued interest. 

 

b. 

In case of securities classified as below investment grade but not default, 

interest  accrual  may  continue  with  the  same  haircut  applied  to  the 

principal.  In  case  of  securities  classified  as  default,  no  further  interest 

accrual shall be made. 

 

5.1.2.2  The  following  shall  be  the  treatment  of  how  any  future  recovery  should  be 

accounted for in terms of principal or interest:  

 

a.  Any  recovery  shall  first  be  adjusted  against  the  outstanding  interest 

recognized  in  the  NAV  and  any  balance  shall  be  adjusted  against  the 

value of principal recognized in the NAV. 

b.  Any recovery in excess of the carried value  (i.e. the value recognized in 

NAV)  should  then  be  applied  first  towards  amount  of  interest  written  off 

and then towards amount of principal written off.

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

6.0  Review of provisions referring to Non-Performing Assets:  

 

 

6.1  Considering  that  as  per  the  Principles  of  Fair  Valuation,  valuation  has  to  be 

reflective of the realizable price, the concept of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) 

may not be relevant for the Mutual Fund industry. It has thus  been decided to 

appropriately  modify  all  regulatory  provisions  referencing  NPAs.  Accordingly, 

the following modifications are made to extant SEBI circulars: 

 

6.1.1 

The  guidelines for identification and provisioning for Non-Performing Assets 

(Debt securities) for Mutual Funds in terms of SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/8 

/92/2000  dated  September  18,  2000  and  SEBI  Circular  No. 

MFD/CIR/14/088/2001 dated March 28, 2001 stand deleted.  

 

6.1.2 

The term “NPA” as per SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/6/73/2000 dated July 27, 

2000 shall be replaced with “securities classified as below investment grade 

or default”. Further, the term “NPA” as per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MFD/CIR 

No.05/12031/03  dated  June  23,  2003  shall  be  replaced  with  “exposure  to 

securities classified as below investment grade or default”. 

 

6.1.3 

Paragraph  2  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  MFD/CIR/05/432/2002  dated  June  20, 

2002 shall be modified as follows: 

 

Treatment and disposal of illiquid securities or securities classified as 

default at the time of maturity / closure of schemes 

In case of close-ended schemes, some of the investments made by Mutual 

Funds  may  become  default  at  the  time  of  maturity  of  schemes.  Further,  at 

the  time  of  winding  up  of  a  scheme,  some  of  the  investments  made  by 

Mutual Funds may become default or illiquid. In due course of time i.e. after 

the maturity or winding up of the schemes, such investments may be realised 

by  the  Mutual  Funds.  It  is  advised  to  distribute  such  amount,  if  it  is 

substantial, to the concerned investors. In case the amount is not substantial,

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

it may be used for the purpose of investor education. The decision as to the 

determination of substantial amount shall be taken by the Trustees of Mutual 

Funds  after  considering  the  relevant  factors  including  number  of  investors, 

amount recovered, cost of transferring funds to investors; among others. 

 

6.1.4 

In  the  format  of  the  abridged  scheme-wise  annual  report  format  prescribed 

vide  SEBI  Circular  No.  SEBI/IMD/CIR  No.8/132968/2008  dated  July  24, 

2008,  under  notes  to  accounts,  the  term  “NPA”  shall  be  replaced  with 

“securities classified as below investment grade or default”. 

 

6.1.5  With  respect  to  the  notes  below  the  portfolio  format  prescribed  vide  SEBI 

Circular  No.  MFD/CIR/9/120/2000  dated  November  24,  2000, 

the 

modifications shall be as under:  

 

a. 

In  point  2,  the  term  “NPA”  shall  be  replaced  with  “below  investment 

grade or default”.
