Review Report to ……………………. 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of …………………………….. (Name 
of the  Company) for the period ended…………. This statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management 
and has been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements 
based on our review. 
 
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagement  (SRE)  2400,  Engagements  to 
Review Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we 
plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement.  A  review  is  limited  primarily  to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical  procedures  applied  to 
financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion. 
 
Based  on  our  review  conducted  as  above,  nothing  has  come  to  our  attention  that  causes  us  to  believe  that  the 
accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  accounting  standards 
and  other  recognized  accounting  practices  and  policies  has  not  disclosed  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in 
terms  of  Regulation  33  of  the  SEBI (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

period ended ____. This statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approved by the 
Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. 
 
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagement  (SRE)  2400,  Engagements  to 
Review Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we 
plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement.  A  review  is  limited  primarily  to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical  procedures  applied  to 
financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion. 
 
In the conduct of our Review we have relied on the review reports in respect of non-performing assets received from 
concurrent  auditors  of  _________  branches,  inspection  teams  of  the  bank  of  _______  branches  and  other  firms  of 
auditors of _________ branches specifically appointed for this purpose. These review reports cover ______ percent of 
the advances portfolio of the bank. Apart from these review reports, in the conduct of our review, we have also relied 
upon various returns received from the branches of the bank.  
 
Based  on  our  review  conducted  as  above,  nothing  has  come  to  our  attention  that  causes  us  to  believe  that  the 
accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  prepared  in  accordance  with  applicable  accounting  standards 
and  other  recognized  accounting  practices  and  policies  has  not  disclosed  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in 
terms  of  Regulation  33  of  the  SEBI (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement or that it has not been prepared 
in accordance with the relevant prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India in respect of income recognition, 
asset classification, provisioning and other related matters.
