Sir/ Madam, 

 

Subject: Participation in derivatives market by Mutual Funds 

 

1.  In terms of SEBI circular no. DNPD/Cir-29/2005 dated September 14, 2005, existing 

schemes of the Mutual Funds, whose Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) do not 

envisage  investments  in  derivatives,  are  required  to  obtain  positive  consent  from 

majority  of  the  unit  holders  before  commencing  investment  in  derivatives.  An  exit 

option has to be provided to the dissenting unit holders and such option is to be kept 

open  for  a  period  of  one  month  prior  to  the  scheme  commencing  trading  in 

derivatives. 

 

2.  SEBI  has  received  representations  that  for  existing  schemes’  whose  SIDs  do  not 

currently  envisage  investments  in  derivatives,  obtaining  positive  consent  from 

majority  of  unit  holders  as  mandated  above  is  challenging  on  account  of  vast 

geographical spread of unit holders and hence the request for doing away with such 

requirements.  This  matter  was  discussed  in  Mutual  Fund  Advisory  Committee, 

wherein  it  was  recommended  that  for  participation  in  derivatives  market  by  such 

schemes,  the  requirement  of  obtaining  positive  consent  should  be  dispensed  with 

and all investors of the scheme should be given exit option with no exit load, in line 

with the guidelines for changes in any other fundamental attribute of the scheme. 

 

3.  Based  on  the  above  considerations  and  in  view  of  prudent  investment  norms  that 

are in place for investment in derivatives by Mutual Funds, it has been decided that 

for introduction of derivative investments in an existing scheme,  whose SIDs do not

currently  envisage  such  investments,  the  requirement  of  obtaining  positive  consent 

from  majority  of  unit  holders  shall  no  longer  be  applicable.  However,  prior  to  the 

scheme commencing participation in derivatives, all investors of such schemes shall 

be  given  exit  option  with  no  exit  load  for  30  days,  as  against  exit  option  to  only 

dissenting unit holders mandated earlier. 

 

4.  In  view  of  the  above,  in  point  2  of  SEBI  circular  no.  DNPD/Cir-29/2005  dated 

September 14, 2005, clause I) b shall be read as follows: 

 

“Existing  schemes  of  Mutual  Funds,  whose  SIDs  do  not  envisage  investments  in 
derivatives, may participate in derivatives market subject to the following conditions: 

 

 

i. 

ii. 

The  extent  and  the  manner  of  the  proposed  participation  in derivatives  shall  be 
disclosed to the unit holders. 

The risks associated with such participation shall be disclosed and explained by 
suitable numerical examples. 
 

iii.  Prior  to  commencing  participation  in  derivatives,  the  scheme  shall  comply  with 
the provisions of Regulation 18 (15A) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 
and  all unit holders shall be  given at least 30 days to exercise option to exit at 
prevailing NAV without charging of exit load.”  

 
5.  All other provisions of the the above mentioned circular remains unchanged. 

 

6.  This circular is applicable with immediate effect. 
 

This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  under  Section  11  (1)  of  the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992, read with the provision of Regulation 

77  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulation,  1996  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in 

securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
