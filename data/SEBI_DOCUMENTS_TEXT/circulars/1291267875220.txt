Sub: Revised Exposure Margin  for Exchange Traded Equity Derivatives  

 
This  is  in  partial  modification  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  SMDRP/DC/CIR-13/02  dated 
December 18, 2002 which, inter-alia, specified that the exposure margin shall be higher

open position in stock options in a particular underlying. 
 
With  a  view  to  ensure  market  safety  and  safeguard  the  interest  of  investors,  it  has  now 
been  decided  that  the  said  exposure  margin  shall  be  higher  of  10%  or  1.5  times  the 
standard  deviation  (of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of  the  stock  price),  with  effect  from
