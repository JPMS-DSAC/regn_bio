Dear Sir/ Madam, 

 

Sub: Enhanced Disclosure and Transparency Norms for Credit Rating Agencies  

 
In  order  to  enhance  the  governance,  accountability  and  functioning  of  Credit  Rating

comments and suggestions received from the public, the following guidelines are being 
issued:  
 

1.  Request by Issuers for review of ratings provided by CRAs: 

 

 

A.  In the interest of transparency and fairness, it has been decided that all cases 
of requests by an Issuers for review of the rating(s) provided to its instrument(s)

consist of a majority of independent members. 
 

B.  As defined in the Circular for Enhanced Standards for CRAs dated November 
01,  2016,  "independent"  would  mean  people  not  having  any  pecuniary 
relationship with the CRA or any of its employees.

A.  In  order  to  make  the  disclosures  more  relevant,  it  is  clarified  that  all  non-

a half–yearly basis.  
 

IV. With respect to Annexure VII, the following terms, in addition to  those 
already  defined  under  Point  2.2  of  the  aforementioned  Circular,  shall 
have the meaning as under:

defaulted in the static pool as a percentage of the total amount of 
rated debt in the static pool.  

b.  Averaging  for  debt-weighted  default  rate  shall  be  based  on 
the weighted average method where weights shall be the amount 
of debt rated in each static period.

prepared and disclosed separately for ratings of
