Dear Sir,
Registration of Sub-brokers
Please refer to our letter No.SMD/OPG/AA/1020/96 dated 14th March 1996, a copy of which is enclosed for your reference. A guidelines for making application complete in all respect was also attached with letter.
It has been observed while processing the application that the Sub-brokers are still making incomplete applications, which is causing unnecessary delay in process of registration.
Your attention is drawn to Sec 11(56) of chapter III of Stock Brokers and sub-brokers Rules and Regulations 1992 requiring the applicant to furnish a declaration, that he is not convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty which is not furnished by applicant in maximum cases.
You are required to take necessary action at your end.
Thanking you,
Yours faithfully, sd/-
