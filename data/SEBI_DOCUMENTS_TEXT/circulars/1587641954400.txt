CIRCULAR 

 

 

SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2020/70                                                  April 23, 2020 

  

All Mutual Funds/ Asset Management Companies (AMCs)/

Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) 

 

Sir / Madam, 

 

Sub:  Review  of  provisions  of  the  circular  dated  September  24,  2019  issued 

under  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations, 1996  due  to  the  COVID  -  19  pandemic 

and moratorium permitted by RBI. 

 

1. 

Currently, Valuation agencies  appointed  by AMFI recognize default of security 

in terms of Clause 5.1.1.2 and 9.1.2 of SEBI circular dated September 24, 2019  

 

2. 

In view of the nationwide lockdown and the three-month moratorium/ deferment 

on payment permitted by RBI, a differentiation in treatment of default, on a case 

to  case  basis,  needs  to  be  made  as  to  whether  such  default  occurred  solely 

due to the lockdown or loan moratorium. 

 
Accordingly,  based  on  assessment,  if  the  valuation  agencies  appointed  by 

3. 

AMFI are of the view that the delay in payment of interest/principal or extension 

of  maturity  of  a  security  by  the  issuer  has  arisen  solely  due  to  COVID-19 

pandemic  lockdown  and/or  in  light  of  the  moratorium  permitted  by  Reserve 

Bank  of  India  (RBI)  (vide  notification  no.  RBI/2019-20/186,  dated  March  27, 

2020) creating   temporary   operational   challenges   in   servicing   debt, then 

valuation agencies may not consider the same as a default  for the purpose of 

valuation of money market or debt securities held by Mutual Funds.

valuation shall be accepted. 

5. 

6. 

 
The  above  modification  to  our  circular  dated  September  24,  2019  shall  be  in
