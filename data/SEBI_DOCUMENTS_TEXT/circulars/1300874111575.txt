Dear Sirs, 

Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities.

Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-01/2000 dated January 06, 2000 
advising inter alia the list of 34 scrips (annuxure "B" to circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-
01/2000 dated January 06, 2000) for compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form for 
institutional investors viz., banks, mutual funds, domestic financial institutional investors, 
foreign institutional investors and OCB's with effect from January 17, 2000. The following two 
companies which were included in annexure "B" are in the process of completing the 
formalities for signing the agreement and to establish connectivity with both the depositories: 

1. Nagarjuna Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited 
2. VST Industries Lmited 

It has therefore been decided to postpone the date for compulsory dematerialised trading in 
respect of the above scrips by institutional investors and OCBs to a date which would be 
announced after they complete the formalities. The final list of scrips for compulsory settlement 
of trades in dematerialised form for institutional investors viz., banks, mutual funds, domestic 
financial institutional investors, foreign institutional investors and OCB's with effect from
