July 10, 2007 

 
The Managing Director / Executive Director / Administrator  
Of All Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sirs, 

 

Sub.:  Amendments to Clause 41 of Equity Listing Agreement 
 
I. 

In  order  to  rationalize  and  modify  the  process  and  formats  for  submission  of 
financial  results  to  the  stock  exchanges  and  also  with  a  view  to  simplify  the 
same,  SEBI  has  decided  to  replace  the  existing  Clause  41  of  the  Listing 
Agreement.  Inter  alia,  the  following  amendments  have  also  been  made  in  the 
revised clause: 
 
1.  Submission of Financial Results  

 
With a view to enable investors know the performance as early as possible, 
companies  have  an  option  to  furnish  either  unaudited  or  audited  quarterly 
and year to date financial results to the Stock Exchange within one month 
from  the  end  of  each  quarter.  Where  a  company  furnishes  unaudited 
financial  results,  the  results  shall  be  subjected  to  a  Limited  Review  and  a 
copy  of  the  Limited  Review  Report  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Stock 
Exchange within two months from the end of the quarter.  
 
Further,  it  has  been  decided  to  simplify  the  provision  for  explanation  in 
variation  between  items of  unaudited  and  audited  quarterly/  year  to  date  / 
annual results. As against the extant requirement for providing explanation 
for  variation  in  any  of  the  items  in  the  proforma,  the  revised  clause  41 
requires the same to be furnished only in respect of Net Profit or Loss After 
Tax and for exceptional / extraordinary items. Further, it has been decided 
to reduce the percentage of variation for the purpose from ‘20% or more’ to 
’10% or Rs.10 lakhs, whichever is higher’. 
 
In case of a company having subsidiaries, such company has an option to 
submit  the  quarterly  consolidated  financial  statements  in  addition  to  the 
stand  alone  financial  results.  However,  such  a  company  shall  submit  the 
annual  consolidated  financial  results  along  with  the  annual  stand-alone 
financial statements to the stock exchanges. The modified requirements on 
publication are detailed in the following paragraph.

2.  Publication of Results 
 

the  publication  of 

As  regards 
financial  results,  companies  having 
subsidiaries who file both stand-alone and consolidated results to the stock 
exchange  are  provided  with  an  option  of  publishing  of  stand-alone  or 
consolidated  results, subject to the condition that a choice once exercised 
cannot be changed during the year.  
 
In case the company changes its option in any subsequent financial year, it 
shall  furnish  comparative  figures  for  the  previous  financial  year  in 
accordance with the option exercised for the current year. The company, if 
it  opts  to  publish  consolidated  financial  results  only,  shall  also,  in  the 
advertisements,  state  the  places,  such  as  the  company’s  website,  Stock 
Exchange  web  site,  etc.,  where  the  stand-alone  financial  results,  will  be 
available.  In  case  the  company  opts  for  publishing  stand-alone  financial 
results  only,  it  shall  also  publish  information  in  respect  of  its  consolidated 
turnover, net profit after tax and earnings per share. 
 

3.  Simplification in the revised Clause 41 

 
During the process of revision of the clause, it was felt necessary to further 
simplify and organize the presentation of the sub-clauses. The following are 
areas simplified in the Revised Clause 41: 
 

i.  Wherever possible, repeated requirements in the existing clause have 

been removed and similar requirements have been consolidated.  

ii.  Formats have also been consolidated wherever possible and given in 

one place as Annexures to Clause 41. 

iii.  Since the Notes to various formats were common across formats, the 
same have been rationalized and consolidated in one place under the 
clause itself. 

iv.  Certain additional information such as other provisions, miscellaneous 

expenditure & exceptional / extraordinary items has been included.  

v.  Based  on  feed  back  from  the  companies,  clauses  have  been 

interpreted and clarified wherever necessary. 

 

II.  Applicability  
 

The revised Clause 41 of Equity Listing Agreement shall come into force for all 
filings made to stock exchanges in respect of accounting periods commencing 
on  or  after  July  01,  2007.  Financial  statements  for  such  periods  shall  be 
prepared, submitted and published as prescribed under the revised clause.

This  statement  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  Management  and  has  been

A  review  of  interim  financial  information  consists  principally  of  applying  analytical

conducted  in  accordance  with  the  generally  accepted  auditing  standards,  the 
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements 
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
 
Based  on  our  review  conducted  as  above,  nothing  has  come  to  our  notice  that

inspection  teams  of  the  bank  of  _______  branches  and  other  firms  of  auditors  of 
_________  branches  specifically  appointed  for  this  purpose.  These  review  reports

We  have  audited  the  quarterly  financial  results  of  ………………………(name  of  the

year to date results for the period ……………. to …………………, attached herewith, 
being submitted by the bank pursuant to the requirement of clause 41 of the Listing

results  have  been  prepared  from  interim  financial  statements,  which  are  the 
responsibility of the bank’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on  these  financial  results  based  on  our  audit  of  such  interim  financial  statements, 
which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  recognition  and  measurement 
principles  laid  down  in  Accounting  Standard  (AS)  25,  Interim  Financial  Reporting, 
issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  and  other  accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. 

 
We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  auditing  standards  generally 
accepted  in  India.    Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial results are free of material 
misstatement(s).  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the  amounts  disclosed  as  financial  results.    An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the 
accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management.    We 
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
These  financial  results  incorporate  the  relevant  returns  of  _______(number)
