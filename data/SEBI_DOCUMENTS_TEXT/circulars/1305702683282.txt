Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub: Clarification on circular dated December 3, 2009 on ‘Dealings between a Client 

and a Stock broker  

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

1.  This is with reference to SEBI circular No. MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 
3, 2009 wherein the stock brokers were directed to comply with the requirements 
as annexed to the aforesaid circular. 

2.  Subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  aforesaid  circular,  SEBI  has  received 
representations  from  market  participants  expressing  difficulties  in  implementation 
of the requirements pertaining to renewal of Running Account Authorisation once 
in a year as prescribed in clause 12(a) read with clause 12(c) of the Annexure to 
the aforesaid circular.  

3.  Hence,  in  consultation  with  the  major  stock  exchanges,  the  above  requirements 

have now been modified as follows: 

i.  Clause 12(a) of the aforesaid annexure pertaining to renewal of authorisation 

 

 

stands deleted.  

ii.  Clause 12(c) of the aforesaid annexure is revised and shall read, as under:  

“The authorisation shall be dated and shall contain a clause that the clients may 
revoke  the  authorisation  at  any  time.  The  stock  brokers,  while  sending 
periodical statement of accounts to the clients, shall mention therein that their 
running account authorisation would continue until it is revoked by the clients.”   

The  above  modifications  would  simplify  and  rationalize  the  requirements  while 
protecting the interest of investors. 
 

4.  The  Stock  Exchanges  are  directed  to  bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the 
notice of the stock brokers and also disseminate the same on their websites. The 
stock exchanges shall also make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, 
rules and regulations for the implementation of the above decision.
