Dear Sir/Madam, 

 

 

Sub: Restrictions on Promoters and Whole-Time Directors of Compulsorily 

Delisted Companies Pending Fulfillment of Exit Offers to the Shareholders  

1.  In terms of section 21A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCR Act) 

read with rule 21 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 and Chapter V 

of  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Delisting  of  Equity  Shares)  Regulations, 

2009  (“Delisting  Regulations”),  a  recognised stock  exchange may  compulsorily  delist 

the equity shares of a listed company on certain grounds. 

 

2.  In terms of Regulation 24 of the Delisting Regulations, the company which has been 

compulsorily  delisted,  its  whole-time  directors,  its  promoters  and  the  companies 

promoted  by  any  such  person,  shall  not  directly  or  indirectly  access  the  securities 

markets for a period of ten years from the date of compulsory delisting. 

 

3.  Sub-regulation (3) of regulation 23 of the Delisting Regulations provides that pursuant 

to  compulsory  delisting  of  a  company,  the  promoter  shall  acquire  delisted  equity 

shares  from  the  public  shareholders,  subject  to  their  option  of  retaining  their  equity

4.  In addition to the restriction imposed under Regulation 24 of the Delisting Regulations, 

in  order  to  ensure  effective  enforcement  of  exit  option  to  the  public  shareholders  in 

case of compulsory delisting and taking into account the interests of investors, it is felt 

necessary  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  mechanism  in  this  regard.  Accordingly,  it  is 

hereby directed that in case of such companies whose fair value is positive:- 

a.  such a company and the depositories shall not effect transfer, by way of sale, 

pledge,  etc.,  of  any  of  the  equity  shares  and  corporate  benefits  like  dividend, 

rights, bonus shares, split, etc. shall be frozen, for all the equity shares, held by 

the  promoters/  promoter  group  till  the  promoters  of  such  company  provide  an 

exit  option  to  the  public  shareholders  in  compliance  with  sub-regulation  (3)  of 

regulation  23  of  the  Delisting  Regulations,  as  certified  by  the  concerned 

recognized stock exchange;  

b.  the  promoters  and  whole-time  directors  of  the  compulsorily  delisted  company 

shall also not be eligible to become directors of any listed company till the exit 

option as stated at 4.a. above is provided.  

 

5.  For  the  aforesaid  purposes,  "compulsorily  delisted  company"  means  a  company 

whose equity shares are delisted by the recognised stock exchange under Chapter V 

of the Delisting Regulations. 

 

6.   The  concerned  recognised  stock  exchanges  and  depositories  shall  co-ordinate  with 

each  other  for  ensuring  compliance  of  these  requirements.  SEBI  may  also  take  any 

other appropriate action(s) against the promoters/promoter group and directors of the 

compulsorily  delisted  company 

for  non-compliance  with  sub-regulation  (3)  of 

regulation 23 of the Delisting Regulations.  

 

7.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  under  section  11(1)  of  the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interests of investors 

in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to  regulate  the  securities 

markets.
