CIRCULAR 

 

September 26, 2017 

To 
 
All recognized Stock Exchanges, 
  

Dear Sir / Madam, 

  

Sub: Prevention of Unauthorised Trading by Stock Brokers 

  

I.  SEBI  in  the  past  has  taken  several  steps  to  tackle  the  menace  of  “Unauthorized 
Trades” viz Periodic Running Account Settlement, Post transactions SMS/email by 
exchanges/Depositories, Ticker on broker/DP websites etc. It was observed that in 
spite of measures taken, a considerable proportion of investor complaints is of the 
nature of “Unauthorized Trades”.  

 
II.  The  current  regulatory  requirements  in  commodity  derivative  markets  require  that 
“The members shall execute the trade of clients only after keeping evidence of the 
client  placing  such  order;  it  could  be,  interalia,  in  the  form  of  sound  recording.” 
There  are  no  such  requirements  in  Equity,  Equity  Derivative  and  Currency 
Derivative Market side. 
 

III.  To further  strengthen  regulatory  provisions  against  un-authorized  trades and  also 
to  harmonise  the  requirements  across  markets,  it  has  now  been  decided  that  all 
brokers  shall  execute  trades  of  clients  only  after  keeping  evidence  of  the  client 
placing such order, it could be, inter alia, in the form of:   
a.  Physical record written & signed by client,  
b.  Telephone recording,  
c.  Email from authorized email id,  
d.  Log for internet transactions,  
e.  Record of SMS messages,  
f.  Any other legally verifiable record.  

When  dispute  arises,  the  burden  of  proof  will  be  on  the  broker  to  produce  the 
above records for the disputed trades.
