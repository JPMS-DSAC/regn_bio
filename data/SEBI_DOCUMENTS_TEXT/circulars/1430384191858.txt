                         April 30, 2015 

CIR/IMD/DF/03/2015 
 
All Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies (AMCs)/  
Trustee Companies/Boards of Trustees of Mutual Funds  
 
Sir/ Madam, 
 
Subject: Stress Testing of Liquid Fund and Money Market Mutual Fund Schemes 
 
1.  Risk  Management  framework  has  been  prescribed  by  SEBI  vide  circular  dated 
September 30, 2002. As a part of risk management framework, Mutual Funds (MFs) 
carry  out  stress  testing  of  their  portfolio,  particularly  for  debt  schemes.  In  order  to 
standardize  this  practice  across  industry,  AMFI  came  out  with  Best  Practice 
Guidelines dated September 12, 2014 on stress testing of Liquid Funds and Money 
Market Mutual Fund Schemes (MMMFs).  
 

2.  In order to further strengthen the risk management practices and to develop a sound 
framework  that  would  evaluate  potential  vulnerabilities  on  account  of  plausible 
events and provide early  warning on the health of the underlying portfolio of Liquid 
Fund and MMMF Schemes, it has been decided to stipulate the following guidelines: 
 
a.  As  a  part  of  the  extant  risk  management  framework,  AMCs  should  have  stress 
testing policy in place which mandates them to conduct stress test on all  Liquid 
Fund and MMMF Schemes.  
 

b.  The stress test should be carried out internally at least on a monthly basis, and if 
the market conditions require so, AMC should conduct more frequent stress test. 
 

c.  The concerned schemes shall be tested on the following risk parameters, among 

others deemed necessary by the AMC: 

Interest rate risk  

i. 
ii.  Credit risk  
iii. 

Liquidity & Redemption risk  
 

d.  While conducting stress test, it will be required to evaluate impact of the various 
risk parameters on the scheme and its Net Asset Value (NAV). The parameters 
used  and  the  methodology  adopted  for  conducting  stress  test  on  such  type  of 
scheme,  should  be  detailed  in  the  stress  testing  policy,  which  is  required  to  be 
approved by the Board of AMC.

e.  Further,  in  the  event  of  stress  test  revealing  any  vulnerability  or  early  warning 
signal,  it  would  be  required  to  bring  it  to  the  notice  of  the  Trustees  and  take 
corrective action as deemed necessary, to reinforce their robustness. Each AMC 
should also be required to have documented guidelines, to deal with the adverse 
situation effectively. 
 

f.  Such stress-testing policy shall be reviewed by the Board of AMC and Trustees, 
at least on an annual basis, in light of the evolving market scenarios and should 
cover the following aspects: 
i.  Adequacy  of  the  documentation  for  various  elements  of  the  stress  testing 

framework 

ii.  Scope of coverage of the stress testing policy and the levels of stress applied 
iii.  Integration of the stress testing framework in the day-to-day risk management 

processes 

iv.  Adequacy  of  the  corrective  actions  and  the  efficacy  of  the  systems  for  their 

activation 

 

g.  Further,  Trustees  shall  be  required  to  report  compliance  with  this  circular  and 
steps  taken  to  deal  with  adverse  situations  faced,  if  any,  in  the  Half  Yearly 
Trustee Report submitted to SEBI. 
 

This circular shall be applicable with immediate effect. 

 

This  circular  is  issued in  exercise  of the  powers  conferred under  Section 11  (1)  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provision of Regulation 
77  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in 
securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
