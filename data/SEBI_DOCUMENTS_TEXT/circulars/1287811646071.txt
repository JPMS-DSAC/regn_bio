Dear Sir, 
 

 

Sub: Introduction of call auction in Pre-open session 

1.  The  issue  regarding  call  auction  and  its  use  in  various  session,  including 
pre-open session was deliberated in Secondary Market Advisory Committee 
(SMAC).  Based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  committee  and  proposal 
received  from  the  stock  exchanges,  it  has  been  decided  to  introduce  call 
auction mechanism in pre-open session.  

 
2.  To begin with, pre-open session shall be introduced on a pilot basis by BSE 
and NSE for the scrips forming part of Sensex and Nifty. The list of scrips is 
placed at annexure ‘A’.  In case of any change in the composition of Sensex 
and  Nifty,  pre-open  session  shall  be  introduced  for  such  incoming  scrips. 
Pre-open  session  shall  also  continue  for  the  scips  moving  out  of  Sensex 
and Nifty, though they will not be reckoned for the computation of the index.  

 
3.  The  pre-open  session  shall  be  for  a  duration  of  15  minutes  i.e.  from  9:00 
a.m. to 9:15 a.m., out of which 8 minutes shall be allowed for order entry, 
order modification and order cancellation, 4 minutes for order matching and

trade confirmation and the remaining 3 minutes shall be the buffer period to 
facilitate the transition from pre-open session to the normal market. 

 
4.  The session shall close randomly during last one minute of order entry i.e. 
anytime  between  7th  and  8th  minute  of  the  order  entry.  Such  random 
closure shall be system driven. 

 
5. 

Limit orders and market orders shall be entered during the pre-open session 
and both shall be reckoned for computation of equilibrium price. No iceberg 
order will be allowed i.e orders shall be disclosed in full quantity. 

 
6.  Price  band  of  20%  shall  be  applicable  on  the  securities  during  pre-open 

session.  

 
7. 

In case the index breaches the prescribed threshold limit upon the closure 
of pre-open session, the procedure as prescribed in SEBI Circular Ref. No. 
SMDRPD/Policy/Cir-37 /2001 dated June 28, 2001 shall be applicable from 
the time continuous normal market opens.  

 
8.  The  equilibrium  price  shall  be  the  price  at  which  the  maximum  volume  is 
executable.  In  case  more  than  one  price  meets  the  said  criteria,  the 
equilibrium  price  shall  be  the  price  at  which  there  is  minimum  order 
imbalance  quantity  (unmatched  order  quantity).  The  absolute  value  of  the 
minimum order imbalance quantity shall be taken into consideration.  

 

 

Further, in case more than one price has same minimum order imbalance 
quantity, the equilibrium price shall be the price closest to the previous day’s 
closing price. In case the previous day’s closing price is the mid-value of a

pair of prices which are closest to it, then the previous day’s closing price 
itself  shall  be  taken  as  the  equilibrium  price.  In  case  of  corporate  action, 
previous day’s closing price shall be the adjustable closing price or the base 
price. 
 
Explanation:  A  scenario  may  arise,  wherein;  more  than  one  price  may 
have  same  minimum  imbalance  quantity.  Example  on  the  same  is  given 
hereunder:

In the said example 103 and 96 are the prices wherein, the volume tradable 
and  unmatched  quantity  is  the  same.  To  derive  the  equilibrium  price,  the 
said  prices  i.e.  103  and  96  which  is  closest  to  the  previous  day’s  closing 
price  shall  be  considered.  In  case  the  previous  day’s  closing  price  is  95, 
then, 96 may be considered as the equilibrium price. In case the previous 
day’s closing price is 105, then, 103 may be considered as the equilibrium 
price.  In case the previous day’s closing price is 99.5 which is the mid-value 
of 103 and 96, then the equilibrium price shall be the previous day’s closing 
price i.e. 99.5.
