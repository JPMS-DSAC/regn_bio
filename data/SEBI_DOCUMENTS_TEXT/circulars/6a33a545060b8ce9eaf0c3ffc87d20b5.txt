To,
The President/ Executive Director / Managing Director
All Stock Exchanges     Dear Sir ,  
Sub : Broker Database
 
For a long time now absence of a comprehensive database of brokers has been felt as a constraint both by the Stock Exchanges & SEBI. As the concept of integrated markets is now emerging and multiple memberships of Stock Exchanges has become a necessity for survival in a competitive business environment, it has become necessary for Stock Exchanges to have a comprehensive data base of all their members for better risk administration of multiple memberships.
 
For this data base consultations were held by us with the Bombay Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange and the Delhi Stock Exchange after which it is considered desirable that a format be standardized for collecting all the relevant data for a comprehensive data base which would give a historical profile of the brokers business, multiple memberships, the relatives & associate concerns of the brokers in the capital markets. Besides the data base could be a useful data bank for the use of the Stock Exchanges/ SEBI for inspections of brokers and to have a track record of brokers business.
 
Accordingly a standardized format is enclosed herewith which is to be duly completed by the members of your Exchange.
 
For the sake of convenience , the questionnaire has been divided into three parts, Section I, Section II and Section III. Section I pertains to information which is expected to be readily available with the brokers. Sections II & III may require some more time to be complied and furnished as it requires reference to past years information. Section II pertains to information pertaining to areas like arbitration, inspections, defaults and Section III pertains to turnover figures. Section II and III have to be certified/ countersigned by the Stock Exchange for the correctness of the information furnished.
 
The time limit for submitting the questionnaire duly filled is as follows:
 
Section I : March 15, 1998
Section II : March 31, 1998
Section III : April 15, 1998  
 
You are advised to circulate this questionnaire to all the members of your exchange and ask them to fill it up and submit the same to you in duplicate. You are also requested to verify the information furnished by the members in Section II & Section III and certify the correctness of the same. After verifying the same one copy of the questionnaire duly signed by the broker member and the Exchange and soft copies of all questionnaires enclosed in one floppy should be forwarded to us.  
Please treat this as urgent.
 
Yours sincerely    
O.P. GAHROTRA SR. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Encl. : as above.
