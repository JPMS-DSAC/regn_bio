It  is  observed  from  the  information  provided  by  the  depositories  that  the

At least 50% of other than promoter holdings as per clause 35 of Listing

securities of the company from TFTS to normal Rolling Settlement. For 
this  purpose,  the  listed  companies  shall  obtain  a  certificate  from  its 
Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) and submit the same to the stock 
exchange/s. However, if an issuer-company does not have a separate 
RTA, it may obtain a certificate in this regard from a practicing company 
Secretary/Chartered  Accountant  and  submit  the  same  to  the  stock 
exchange/s. 

There  are  no  other  grounds/reasons  for  continuation  of  the  trading  in
