All Stock Exchanges and Merchant Bankers 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub: Applicability of Delisting Regulations- Transitional Provisions 
 
As  you  are  aware,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Delisting  of 
Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 (Delisting Regulations) were notified by SEBI 
on June 10, 2009. 
 
SEBI  has  since  been  receiving  queries  from  various  market  participants,  listed 
companies etc regarding the ‘transitional provisions’ contained in regulation 31 of 
the Delisting Regulations.  
 
Regulation 31 of the Delisting Regulations outlines certain situations under which 
the provisions of the earlier Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of 
Securities) Guidelines, 2003 (Delisting Guidelines) would still be applicable to a 
particular delisting transaction. 
 
In this regard, it is hereby clarified that in cases where a special resolution has 
already been passed under the Delisting Guidelines prior to commencement of 
the  Delisting  Regulations,  the  delisting  process  shall  be  governed  by  the 
provisions of the Delisting Guidelines, provided the said resolution is acted upon 
within  a  period  of  three  months  from  the  date  of  this  circular.  Otherwise,  the 
company  would  be  required  to  pass  a  fresh  special  resolution  in  terms  of 
Delisting Regulations and proceed for delisting in terms of Delisting Regulations.  
 
For this purpose, the words  ”acted upon” shall mean that the implementation of 
activities including the opening of the book building process for determination of 
the exit price in terms of Clause 8.1 of the Delisting Guidelines, should be done 
within three months from the date of this circular.  
 
 
 

You are advised to take note of the above for future compliance and for guidance 
to the listed companies. 
 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
 
Neelam Bhardwaj
