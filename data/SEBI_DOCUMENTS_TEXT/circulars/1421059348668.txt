To,  
 
The Depositories 
 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 

Subject: Risk Management Policy at the Depositories   

 
1.  The  Depository  System  was  reviewed  by  the    Depository  Systems  Review 
Committee(DSRC)  inter  alia  in  the  context  of  Principles  for  Financial  Market 
Infrastructures(PFMI)  laid  down  by  the  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement 
Systems 
Securities 
Commissions(IOSCO). 
 

International  Organization 

of 

(CPSS) 

and 

2.  The FMI principles lay emphasis on the need to have a robust risk management 
framework to identify, monitor and manage various risks emanating from multiple 
sources to its operations. The principles also emphasize that  as the Board of the 
FMI  is  ultimately  responsible  for  managing  the  FMIs  risks,  it  should  establish  a 
clear,  documented  risk-management  framework  that  includes  the  FMI’s  risk-
tolerance policy, assigns responsibilities and accountability for risk decisions, and 
addresses decision making in crises and emergencies. 
 

3.  The Depository Systems Review Committee(DSRC) has therefore recommended 

the following:  

 

"There  should  be  a  Board  approved  policy  providing  for  a  well  documented 
comprehensive  risk  management  framework  at  both  depositories. The  risk 
management  group/  committee  should  be  active  and  meet  periodically  to 
continuously  identify, evaluate  and  assess applicable  risks  in  depository  system 
through various sources such as  investors complaints, inspections, system audit 
etc.  and  suggest   measures  to  mitigate  risk  wherever  applicable.  A  Chief  Risk 
officer should be made responsible, accountable, accessible & answerable to the 
board on overall risk management issues."
