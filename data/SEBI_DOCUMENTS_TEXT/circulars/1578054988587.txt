SEBI/HO/MIRSD/CRADT/CIR/P/2020/2   

 

 

 

        January 03, 2020 

 

 To 

All Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) registered with SEBI 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 

 

Sub: Strengthening of the rating process in respect of ‘INC’ ratings 

 
 

1.  SEBI  vide  circular  no.  SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD1/CIR/P/2019/140  dated  November  21,  2019 

mandated listed companies to make public disclosure on stock exchanges of: 
 

a.  default  in  payment  of  interest/installment  obligations  on  loans,  including  revolving 
facilities like cash credit, from banks/financial institutions which continues beyond 30 
days and  
 

b.  default in case of unlisted debt securities i.e. NCDs and NCRPS, promptly but not 

later than 24 hours from the occurrence of the default.  
 

2.  In partial modification to SEBI Circular no. SEBI/ HO/ MIRSD/ MIRSD4/ CIR/ P/ 2017/ 71 
dated  June  30,  2017,  the  No  Default  Statement  (NDS)  is  being  aligned  with  the 
requirements of the aforementioned circular.  The revised NDS is placed at Annexure A. 
 

3.  In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  rating  process  of  the  CRAs  with  regard  to  ‘Issuer  not 

cooperating’ (INC) ratings, following directions are being issued: 
 

a. If an issuer has all the outstanding ratings as non-cooperative for more than 6 months, 
then the CRA shall downgrade the rating assigned to the instrument of such issuer to 
non-investment grade with INC status. If non-cooperation by the issuer continues for 
further six months from the date of downgrade to non-investment grade, no CRA shall 
assign  any  new  ratings  to  such  issuer  until  the  issuer  resumes  cooperation  or  the 
rating is withdrawn.  

 
b. The withdrawal norms for the ratings have been stipulated vide Circular no. SEBI/HO/ 
MIRSD/DOP2/CIR/P/2018/95  dated  June  06,  2018.  However,  in  case  of  multiple 
ratings on an instrument (where there is no regulatory mandate for multiple ratings), 
a CRA may withdraw a rating earlier than stipulated in the aforementioned circular, 
provided the CRA has:

i. rated the instrument continuously for 3 years or 50 per cent of the tenure of the 

instrument, whichever is higher; and 

 

ii.  received  No-objection  Certificate  (NOC)  from  75%  of  bondholders  of  the 

outstanding debt for withdrawal of rating; and 

 

iii.  received an undertaking from the issuer that another rating is available on that 

instrument. 

c.  At    the time of withdrawal, the    CRA    shall     assign    a    rating    to    such 
instrument and   issue   a   press   release, as   per   the   format   prescribed   vide 
Circular    dated    November 01, 2016.    The    Press    Release    shall also mention 
the reason(s) for withdrawal of rating.  
 

 

 

4.  Applicability: The circular shall be applicable with immediate effect except para 3(a) which 

shall be effective from July 01, 2020. 
 

5.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11 (1) of Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with the provisions of Regulation 20 of SEBI 
(Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, to protect the interest of investors in securities 
and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.
