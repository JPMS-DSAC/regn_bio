Sub: Designated e-mail ID for regulatory communication with SEBI 

 
Attention 
the  SEBI  circular  MIRSD/DPSIII/Cir-21/08  dated 
July 7, 2008  wherein  SEBI  has  advised  the  Registrars  to  an  Issue/  Share 
Transfer Agents, Debenture Trustees, Bankers to Issue, Credit Rating Agency 
and Underwriters to create and communicate to SEBI a designated e-mail id for 
regulatory communications.  
 
SEBI has already put in place a system for issuance of digitally signed circulars 
with respect to stock exchanges, depositories and merchant bankers. However, 
it is observed that some of the e-mail ids available with SEBI are not exclusive 
e-mail ids but are personal e-mail ids. 
 
Hence, the Merchant Bankers are also advised to create a designated e-mail id 
for  regulatory  communications.  This  e-mail  id  shall  be  an  exclusive  e-mail  id 
only for the above purpose and should not be a person-centric e-mail id. 
 
The  Designated  e-mail 
to  SEBI  at 
intermediary@sebi.gov.in as per the format prescribed at Annexure A, latest  by 
August 8, 2008.  
 
Yours faithfully, 

ID  shall  be  communicated
