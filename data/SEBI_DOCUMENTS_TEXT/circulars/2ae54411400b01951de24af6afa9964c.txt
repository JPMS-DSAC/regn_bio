In this context, we have received request from some of the Exchanges that as the implementation of Y2K compliant software at the Exchanges shall be completed by December 15, 1999, the brokers maybe allowed time up to December 15, 1999 to become Y2K compliant.
In view of the above, the cut-off date for the stock brokers to become Y2K compliant has been extended up to December 15, 1999. You are advised to invariably deactivate the trading terminals of those stock brokers, who are not Y2K compliant, with effect from the trading cycle commencing on/after December 15, 1999 and submit the action taken report to SEBI, immediately, thereafter.
