ANNEXURE-1 
 
PRODUCT DESIGN AND RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR 91-DAY 
GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (GoI) TREASURY BILL (T- bill) FUTURES 

 

1.1   Underlying 

1.2 

91 - day GoI T-bill.  
 
Trading hours 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  
 

1.3  Size of the contract 

` 2 lakh.  

 
1.4  Quotation 

100  minus  futures  discount  yield  (i.e.  for  a  yield  of  5%  the  quote  would  be  100-
5=95). The value of 1 basis point change in the futures discount yield would be `  
5.  
 
Tenor of the contract 
The maximum maturity of the contract would be 12 months. 

1.5 

 
1.6  Contract months  

Three  serial  monthly  contracts  followed  by  three  quarterly  contracts  of  the  cycle 
March/June/September/December. 
 

1.7  Settlement mechanism 

The 91-day T-Bill future would be settled in cash in Indian Rupees. 
  

1.8  Contract value 

` 2000 * (100 – 0.25 * y)  
where y is the futures discount yield. 
For example, for a futures discount yield of 5%, the contract value would be – 
2000 * (100 – 0.25*5) = ` 197,500 
 

1.9  Daily Contract Settlement value 

` 2000 * (100 – 0.25 * yw)  
(Here yw is weighted average futures yield of last half an hour). 
In  the  absence  of  last  half  an  hour  trading,  theoretical  futures  yield  would  be 
considered for computation of Daily Contract Settlement Value. 

 
1.10     Expiry/Last trading day/Final settlement day 

The expiry / last trading day / final settlement day for the contract would be the last 
Wednesday  of  the  expiry  month.  If  any  expiry  day  is  a  trading  holiday,  then  the 
expiry/ last trading day/ final settlement day would be the previous trading day.

1.11  Final Contract Settlement value 

 

 

 

` 2000 * (100 – 0.25 * yf)  
(Here yf is weighted average discount yield obtained from weekly auction of 91-day 
T-Bill on the day of expiry). 
The  methodology  of  computation  and  dissemination  of  the  weighted  average 
discount yield would be publicly disclosed by RBI.   

Initial margin 
 
The Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an  individual  client  across  various  scenarios  of  price  changes.  The  various 
scenarios of price changes would be so computed so as to cover a 99% VaR over 
a one day horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be 
fixed at 3.5 standard deviation. The initial margin so computed would be subject to 
a minimum of 0.1 % of the notional value of the contract on the first day of trading 
in 91-day T-bill futures and 0.05 % of the notional value of the contract thereafter 
(the notional value of the contract shall be  
`  200,000).  The  initial  margin  shall  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  net  worth  of  the 
clearing member on an online, real time basis.  

 
1.13  Extreme Loss margin 

 
1.14     Calendar spread margin 

Extreme loss margin of 0.03 % of the notional value of the contract for all gross 
open positions shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on 
an on line, real time basis. 

Interest rate futures position at one maturity hedged by an offsetting position at a 
different  maturity  would  be  treated  as  a  calendar  spread.    The  calendar  spread 
margin shall be at a value of ` 100/- for spread of one month, ` 150 for spread of 
two month, ` 200/- for spread of three month and ` 250/- for spread of four month 
and  beyond.    The  benefit  for  a  calendar  spread  would  continue  till  expiry  of  the 
near month contract. For a calendar spread position, the extreme loss margin shall 
be 0.01% of the notional value of the far month contract. 
 

1.15   Formula for determining standard deviation 

 

The  exponential  moving  average  method  would  be  used  to  obtain  the  volatility 
estimate  every  day.  The  estimate  at  the  end  of  time  period  t  (σydt)  is  estimated 
using the volatility estimate at the end of the previous time period. i.e. as at the end 
of  t-1 time period (σydt-1), and the return (rydt) observed in the futures market during 
the time period t. The formula would be as under:  
 
(σydt)2 = λ (σydt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rydt)2 

where 
λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates change. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.

σydt  (sigma)  means  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of 
discount yield of 91-day T-Bill futures at time t. 

 The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rydt = ln(Ydt/Ydt-1) where Ydt is 
the discount yield  of 91-day T-Bill futures at time t. The plus/minus 3.5 sigma 
limits for a 99% VAR based on logarithmic returns on discount yield of 91-day 
T-Bill  futures  would  have  to  be  converted  into    price  changes  through  the 
following formula : 

 σpt=D*σydt* Ydt 
 
where 
σpt means the standard deviation of percentage change in price at time t 
D means Modified Duration  
Ydt =Discount Yield for 91-day T-Bill futures at time t 
σydt  (sigma)  means  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of 
discount yield at  time t 

The  margin  on  long  position  would  be  equal  to  100  *  (D*3.5σydt*  Ydt) 
percentage  of  the  notional  value  of  the  futures  contract  and  the  margin  on 
short  position  would  be  equal  to  100  (D*-3.5σydt*  Ydt)  percentage  of  the 
notional value of the futures contract.  The Modified Duration for 91 day T-Bill 
Futures shall be -0.25.  

iii.  The  volatility  estimation  and  margin  fixation  methodology  should  be  clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin 
for  any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the 
trading software itself should provide this information on a real time basis on 
the trading workstation screen.  

iv.  During the first time-period on the first day of trading in 91-day T-bill futures, 

the sigma would be equal to 2.7 %. 

 

 
1.16   Position limits 
 

i.  Client  Level:    The  gross  open  positions  of  the  client  across  all  contracts 
should not exceed 6% of the total open interest or ` 300 crores whichever is 
higher.    The  Exchange  will  disseminate  alerts  whenever  the  gross  open 
position of the client exceeds 3% of the total open interest at the end of the 
previous day’s trade. 

Trading Member Level: The gross open positions of the trading member 
across all contracts should not exceed 15% of the total open interest or  ` 
1000 crores whichever is higher. 

 
ii. 

 

iii.  Clearing  Member  Level:    No  separate  position  limit  is  prescribed  at  the 
level of clearing member.  However, the clearing member shall ensure that 
his own trading position and the positions of each trading member clearing 
through him is within the limits specified above.

iv.  FIIs: In case of Foreign Institutional Investors, registered with Securities and 
Exchange Board of India, the total gross long (bought) position in cash and 
Interest  Rate  Futures  markets  taken  together  should  not  exceed  their 
individual permissible limit for investment in government securities and the 
total gross short (sold) position, for the purpose of hedging only, should not 
exceed their long position in the government securities and in Interest Rate 
Futures, at any point in time.
