granted by the exchange.

frozen. Upon receipt of the final listing/ trading permission from the exchange for 
such  additional  shares/  securities,  the  shares/securities  credited  in  the  new 
temporary  ISIN  shall  be  debited  and  the  same  would  get  credited  in  the  pre-
existing  ISIN  for  the  said  security.  Thereafter,  the  additional  securities  shall  be 
available for trading.
