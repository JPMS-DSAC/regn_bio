All Portfolio Managers 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 

Sub: Portfolio Managers - Regulation of Fees and Charges  

1.  Portfolio  Managers  are  registered  and  regulated  under  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 

Managers) Regulations 1993.  
 

2.  As  per  the  aforesaid  regulations,  the  inter  se  relationship  between  the  portfolio 
manager  and  client,  mutual  rights, 
to 
management  of  funds  or  portfolio  of  securities  are  specified  in  the  agreement 
signed between the portfolio manager and the client. The contents of the portfolio 
manager-client agreement are laid out in Regulation 14  to be read with Schedule 
IV of the SEBI (Portfolio Manager) Regulations 1993. 
 

liabilities  and  obligations  relating 

3.  SEBI  has  been  receiving  complaints  from  clients  relating  to  fees  and  charges 
being levied by portfolio managers. Upon scrutiny of the complaints, it has come to 
the  notice  of  SEBI  that  the  clauses  relating  to  fees  and  charges  in  the  portfolio 
manager-client  agreement  do  not  always  clearly  reflect  the  fees  and  charges 
payable by the client and the manner of computation of the same.  

4.  In  order  to  bring  about  greater  uniformity,  clarity  and  transparency  with  regard  to 
fees and charges, portfolio managers  are advised  to take the following measures 
in respect of all client agreements:  

Fees and Charges 
a)  Profit  sharing  /  performance  related  fees  are  usually  charged  by  portfolio 
managers  upon  exceeding  a  hurdle  rate  or  benchmark  as  specified  in  the 
agreement.  However  there  is  no  uniformity  in  practice  on  how  the  profit  / 
performance  of  the  portfolio  computed.  It  is  advised  that,  henceforth,  profit  / 
performance shall be computed on the basis of high water mark principle over 
the life of the investment, for charging of performance / profit sharing fee.  
 
High  Water  Mark  Principle:  High Water  Mark  shall  be  the  highest  value  that 
the portfolio/account has reached. Value of the portfolio for computation of high 
watermark shall be taken to be the value on the date when performance fees

are charged. For the purpose of charging performance fee, the frequency shall 
not  be  less  than  quarterly.  The  portfolio  manager  shall  charge  performance 
based  fee  only  on  increase  in  portfolio  value  in  excess  of  the  previously 
achieved high water mark.  
 
Illustration: Consider that frequency of charging of performance fees is annual. 
A client’s initial contribution is Rs.10,00,000, which then rises to Rs.12,00,000 
in  its  first  year;  a  performance  fee/  profit  sharing  would  be  payable  on  the 
Rs.2,00,000  return.  In  the  next  year  the  portfolio  value  drops  to  Rs.11,00,000 
hence  no  performance  fee  would  be  payable.  If  in  the  third  year  the  Portfolio 
rises to Rs.13,00,000, a performance fee/profit sharing would be payable only 
on  the  Rs1,00,000  profit  which  is  portfolio  value  in  excess  of  the  previously 
achieved high water mark of Rs.12,00,000, rather than on the full return during 
that year from Rs.11,00,000 to Rs.13,00,000. 
 

b)  All  fees  and  charges  shall  be  levied  on  the  actual  amount  of  clients’  assets 

under management. 
 

c)  High  Water  Mark  shall  be  applicable  for  discretionary  and  non-discretionary 

services and not for advisory services.  

 
d)  In case of interim  contributions/ withdrawals by clients, performance fees may 
be  charged after  appropriately  adjusting  the  high  water  mark  on  proportionate 
basis. 
 

Maximum Liability 
e)  Regulation  14(1)(b)(xiii)  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers)  Regulations,  1993 
provides that the agreement between the portfolio manager and the client shall, 
inter alia, contain, in case of a discretionary portfolio manager, a condition that 
the  liability  of  a  client  shall  not  exceed  his  investment  with  the  portfolio 
manager. 

 
f)  Portfolio managers shall strictly comply with the aforesaid Regulation. 

Disclosure of fees and charges 
g)  To ensure transparency and adequate disclosure regarding fees and charges, 
the client agreement shall contain a separate Annexure which shall list all fees 
and  charges  payable  to  the  portfolio  manager.  The  Annexure  shall  contain 
details of levy of all applicable charges on a sample portfolio of Rs.10 lacs over 
a period of one year. The fees and charges shall be shown for 3 scenarios viz. 
when  the  portfolio  value  increases  by  20%,  decreases  by  20%  or  remains 
unchanged. An illustration of the same is enclosed as Annexure-1.

11 font.  

i)  All  existing  clients  may  be  sent  a  letter  as  an  addendum  to  the  agreement 
about  the  applicability  of  the  new  high-water  mark  principle  and  the  resultant 
new  fees/charge  structure.  This  annexure  has  to  be  signed  by  the  client  and 
sent back to the portfolio manager.  

 
j)  New  clients  shall  be  required  to  separately  sign  the  annexure  on  fees  and 
charges and add in  their own handwriting that  they have understood the fees/ 
charge structure. 

 
Disputes 
k)  Regulation  14(1)  read  with  clause  18  of  Schedule  IV  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 
Managers)  Regulations,  1993  provides  for  settlement  of  grievances/disputes 
and provision for arbitration in the portfolio manager – client agreement.  
 
In case of any dispute regarding fees and charges, the same shall be referred 
to  arbitration  for  settlement  as  per  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  under  the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  

l) 

5.  These measures shall be applicable for all fresh client agreements with effect from 
November 1, 2010. For existing clients, the revised terms shall be implemented by 
January 1, 2011. 
 

6.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the
