Dear Sirs,
Re.: SEBI Investors Education Programme – Investments in Mutual Funds
In order to educate the investors to understand the basics of Mutual Funds and their operations, SEBI has prepared a brochurein question-answer format explaining the fundamental issues pertaining to mutual funds. A copy thereof is enclosed. The same is also available at our website www.sebi.gov.in under the "Mutual Funds" section.
You would appreciate that the awareness among the investors about the functioning of mutual funds would help in the healthy growth of the mutual funds industry. You are advised to circulate copies of the brochure among your distributors and agents (including brokers, banks, post offices) and the investors. You may publish the same as small booklets. In that case while the booklets must bear SEBI name and logo, you may give your name as publisher. As a first step, please display it prominently on your web sites at the earliest.
AMFI may consider including the brochure as apart of study material for their training programmes for investors and for their certification programme conducted for agents and distributors.
Please keep us informed about the steps taken by you in this regard from time to time.    
Yours faithfully,  
P. K. NAGPAL
