The  Managing  Director/  Executive  Director/  Administrator  of  all  the  Stock 
Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub.: Amendments to the Equity Listing Agreement 
 
1. 

In  order  to  enhance  disclosures  regarding  shareholding  pattern  in  a  listed 
company and also to bring more transparency and efficiency in the governance 
of a listed company, it has been decided to amend certain clauses in the Equity 
Listing  Agreement.  Accordingly,  this  circular  is  issued,  in  exercise  of  powers 
conferred  by  sub-section  (1)  of  Section  11  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Board of India Act, 1992, to protect the interest of investors in securities and to 
promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market. 

 

2. 

The  full  text  of  amendments  is  given  at  Annexure  A  and  the  brief  of  the 
amendments are as under:  
 

(A)  Uniform  procedure  for  dealing  with  unclaimed  shares  –  Insertion  of 

clause 5A 
It has been brought to the notice of the Board that there is a large quantum of 
shares issued pursuant to  the public issues, which remain unclaimed despite 
the best efforts of the Registrar to Issue or Issuers and that there is no uniform 
practice for dealing with such shares.  

 

It has been decided to provide a uniform procedure for dealing with unclaimed 
shares i.e., shares which could not be allotted to the rightful shareholder due to 

insufficient/incorrect  information  or  any  other  reason.  Accordingly,  the  new 
Clause 5A is to be inserted, which, inter alia, provides the following: 
(a)  The  unclaimed  shares  shall  be  credited  to  a  demat  suspense  account 

opened by the issuer with one of the depository participants. 

(b)  Any  corporate  benefit  in  terms  of  securities,    accruing  on  unclaimed 
shares  such  as  bonus  shares,  split  etc.,  shall  also  be  credited  to  such 
account.   

(c)  Details  of  shareholding  of  each  individual  allottee  whose  shares  have 
been credited to such suspense account shall be properly maintained by 
the issuer. 

(d)  The allottee’s account shall be credited as and when he/she approaches 
the  issuer,  after  undertaking  the  proper  verification  of  identity  of  the 
allottee. 

(e)  The voting rights of these shares will remain frozen till the rightful owner 

claims the shares.  

(f)  Details (in aggregate) of shares in the suspense account including freeze 
on their voting rights, shall be disclosed in the Annual Report as long as 
there are shares in the suspense account 
  

(B)  Notice  period  for  Record  Date  and  Board  Meeting  –  Amendments  to 

clause 16 and clause 19  
It has been decided to reduce the timelines for notice period for all corporate 
actions  like  dividend,  bonus  etc,  for  all  scripts  whether  in  demat  or  physical, 
whether  in  F&O  segment  or  not.  The  notice  period  for  record  date  has  been 
reduced  to  7  working  days  and  for  board  meeting  has  been  reduced  to  2 
working days.   

 
(C)  Uniformity in dividend declaration – Insertion of clause 20A 

It  has  been  decided  to  mandate  that  listed  companies  shall  declare  their 
dividend  on  per  share  basis  only.  This  is  expected  to  bring  uniformity  in  the 
manner of declaring dividend amongst the listed companies.   

(D)  Shareholding pattern for each class of shares and voting rights pattern – 

Amendment to clause 35 
It  is  clarified  that  clause  35 of  the  listing agreement  which gives  a  format  for 
disclosures  of  shareholding  pattern,  is  required  to  be  given  for  each  class  of 
security separately. Further, it has been decided to amend clause 35 to provide 
an additional format for disclosures of voting rights pattern in the company. 

 

3.  All Stock exchanges are advised to : 

(a)  give effect to the above mentioned policy amendments and appropriately 
amend the relevant Clauses of the Equity Listing Agreement in line with 
the text of the amendments specified in annexure. 

(b)  communicate to SEBI the status of implementation of the requirements of 

this circular in the next Monthly Development Report. 

 

4.  Applicability 

All  the  amendments  as  specified  in  Annexure  A  shall  come  into  force  with 
immediate effect. 

 

5. 

This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the
