and industry bodies/associations seeking further extension of time for preparation, 

finalization and submission of financial results for listed entities for the quarter/half

lockdown,  subsidiaries  and  associates  situated  in  containment  zones  making  the 

audit  process  challenging  and  other  operational  challenges  due  to  the  CoVID-19 

pandemic.
