The list of scrips for compulsory dematerialised trading by institutional investors and OCB’s from February 15, 1999 is given as annexure ‘A’.
It has also been decided that delivery of shares in dematerialised form is compulsory by all investors in respect of 12 scrips (annexure ‘B’) with effect from January 4, 1999 and in respect of 19 scrips (annexure ‘C’) with effect from February 15, 1999.
