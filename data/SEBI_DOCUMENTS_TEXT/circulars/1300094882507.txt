Sir / Madam,  

 

Sub: Usage of load account.  

1.  SEBI vide circular SEBI/IMD/Cir-4/168230/09 dated June 30, 2009 had, interalia, mandated the 

following : 

1.1. There shall be no entry load for all mutual fund schemes. 

1.2. The  upfront  commission  to  distributors  will  be  paid  by  the  investor  directly  to  the 

distributor, based on his assessment of various factors including the service rendered 

by the distributor.  

1.3. Exit  load  or  CDSC  charged  to  the  investor,  a  maximum  of  1%  of  the  redemption 

proceeds shall be maintained in a separate account which can be used by the AMC to 

pay  commissions  to  the  distributor  and  to  take  care  of  other  marketing  and  selling 

expenses.  Any balance shall be credited to the scheme immediately. 

 

The  above  circular  came  into  effect  from  August  01,  2009  and  ensured  that  the  entire 

subscription amount is invested in the scheme without any charge of entry load. 

2.  Prior  to  August  2009,  mutual  funds  charged  both  entry  and  exit  loads  on  its  investors.  Since 

August 2009, mutual funds can charge only exit  load.  These load balances are maintained as 

‘liabilities’ in the books of the scheme and are not included in the net asset value (NAV). 

 

3.  It  is  essential to  bring  about  uniformity  in  usage  of  load  balances. In this  regard,  the following 

have been decided: 

3.1. The load balance shall be segregated into two accounts in the books of accounts of 

the scheme  - one to reflect  the balance as on July 31, 2009 and the other to reflect 

accretions since August 01, 2009.
