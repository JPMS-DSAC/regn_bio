12.  Exercise at Expiry 

 
13. 

On  expiry  date,  all  open  long  in-the-money  contracts,  on  a  particular  strike  of  a 
series, at the close of trading hours would be automatically exercised at the final 
settlement price and assigned on a random basis to the open short positions of the 
same strike and series. 

Initial Margin 
The  Initial  Margin  requirement  would  be  based  on  a  worst  scenario  loss  of  a 
portfolio  of  an  individual  client  comprising  his  positions  in  options  and  futures 
contracts  on  the  same  underlying  across  different  maturities  and  across  various 
scenarios (as detailed under Annexure III) of price and volatility changes. In order 
to achieve this, the price range for generating the scenarios would be 3.5 standard 
deviation and volatility range for generating the scenarios would be 3%.  
 
The  sigma  would  be  calculated  using  the  methodology  specified  for  currency 
futures  in  SEBI  circular  no.  SEBI/DNPD/Cir-38/2008  dated  August  06,  2008  and 
would  be  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of  USD-INR  futures 
price.  
 
For  the  purpose  of  calculation  of  option  values,  the  following  standard  option 
pricing models - Black-Scholes, Binomial, Merton - would be used.  
 
The  initial  margin  would  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  networth  of  the  clearing 
member on an online, real time basis. 
 

14.  Extreme Loss margin 

Extreme loss margin equal to 1.5% of the Notional Value of the open short option 
position would be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on an on 
line, real time basis. Notional Value would be calculated on the basis of the latest 
available Reserve Bank Reference Rate for USD-INR.  

 
15.  Net Option Value  

The Net Option Value is the current market value of the option times the number of 
options  (positive  for  long  options  and  negative  for  short  options)  in  the  portfolio. 
The  Net  Option  Value  would  be  added  to  the  Liquid  Net  Worth  of  the  clearing 
member. Thus, mark to market gains and losses would not be settled in cash for 
options positions. 

 
16.  Calendar Spread Margin 

A  long  currency  option  position  at  one  maturity  and  a  short  option  position  at  a 
different maturity in the same series, both having the same strike price would be 
treated as a calendar spread. The margin for options calendar spread would be the 
same as specified for USD-INR currency futures calendar spread.  
 
The  margin  would  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  delta  of  the  portfolio  in  each 
month. A portfolio consisting of a near month option with a delta of 100 and a far 
month option with a delta of –100 would bear a spread charge equal to the spread 
charge for a portfolio which is long 100 near month currency futures and short 100 
far month currency futures.

Premium would be paid in by the buyer in cash and paid out to the seller in cash 
on T+1 day.  
 
Until the buyer pays in the premium, the premium due shall be deducted from the 
available Liquid Net Worth on a real time basis.
