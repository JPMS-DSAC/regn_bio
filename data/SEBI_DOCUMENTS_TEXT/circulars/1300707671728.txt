All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ 
Custodians and AMFI/RAIN 

Dear Sirs, 

Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities

Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-49/2000 dated October 16, 2000 advising that there 
should be a time gap of three months between the date for establishing connectivity by the companies with 
both the depositories and the date of commencement of compulsory dematerialised trading. It was further 
advised that the date announced for compulsory dematerialised trading for the scrips as per SEBI circular no. 
SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-23/2000 dated May 29, 2000 would henceforth be treated as the date by which the 
company should establish connectivity with both the depositories. The compulsory dematerialized trading in 
these companies will commence after three month from that date. It was also mentioned in the circular that 
the companies which fail to establish connectivity with both the depositories on the scheduled date would be 
traded only on the 'trade for trade' settlement window of the exchanges from the following settlement period. 

In accordance with the aforementioned circulars dated May 29, 2000 and October 16, 2000, out of the 275 
scrips required to establish connectivity with both the depositories by November 27, 2000, 104 companies 
have now established connectivity. These 104 scrips (Serial No. 1 to 104 of annexure 'A') would be traded 
compulsorily in dematerialized form by all investors with effect from February 26, 2001. The 168 scrips 
(Serial No. 105 to 272 of annexure 'A') which have not established connectivity would be traded only on 
"trade for trade" segment of the stock exchanges, from the settlement period commencing on or immediately 
after December 11, 2000. 

Currently scrips of 281 companies have been included for trading only on 'trade for trade' settlement window 
of the exchanges. Out of these, 53 companies (Serial Nos. 273 to 325 of annexure 'A') have established 
connectivity with both the depositories. These scrips shall be traded on the normal trading segment where 
deliveries can be made either in physical or dematerialised form with effect from December 26, 2000 and 
compulsorily in dematerialised form 3 months after that date i.e. from March 26, 2001. 
  

Yours faithfully,
