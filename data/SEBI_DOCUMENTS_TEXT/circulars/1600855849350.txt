Dear Sir/Madam, 

September 23, 2020 

Sub: System-Driven Disclosures (SDD) under SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 

1.  Please  refer  to  SEBI  circular  dated  December  01,  2015  and  December  21,  2016 
pertaining  to  processes  to  be  followed  by  Depositories,  Exchanges  and  Registrar  & 
Share Transfer Agents (“RTAs”) for implementation of SDD. Subsequently, SEBI vide 
circular  dated  September  09,  2020  under  Regulation  7(2)  SEBI  (PIT)  Regulations, 
2015 has provided a detailed procedure for SDD implementation. 
The  circular  dated  September  09,  2020  requires  that  the  capture  of  the  PAN  of  the 
entities  be  done  from  the  listed  company  itself,  rather  than  through  the  RTAs  as 
provided in the circular dated December 01, 2015.  

2.  In order to align the practices, it has been decided to use the procedure of capturing 
the PAN of the promoters from listed companies as mentioned in para 2,3 & 4 of the 
Annexure A of the circular dated September 09, 2020 for SAST disclosures too. The 
referred paras are quoted here for convenience: - 
“2.  Listed  company  shall  provide  the  information  including  PAN  number  of  Promoter(s) 
including member(s) of the promoter group, designated person(s) and director(s) (hereinafter 
collectively  referred  to  as  entities)  as  per  PIT  Regulations  to  the  designated  depository 
(selected in terms of SEBI  circular ref.  no.   SEBI/HO/CFD/DCR1/CIR/P/2018/85 dated May 
28, 2018) in the format and manner prescribed by the Depositories. For PAN exempt entities, 
the  Investor’s  Demat  account  number(s)  shall  be  specified  by  the  listed  company.  The 
information shall be provided within 10 days from the date of this circular.  
3.  The  designated  depository  shall  share  the  information  received  from  the  listed  company 
with other depository.  
4.   In  case  of  any  subsequent  update  in the  details  of the  entities,  the  listed  company  shall 
update  the  information  with  the  designated  depository  on  the  same  day.  The  designated 
depository shall share the incremental changes with the other depository on the day of receipt 
from the listed company.” 

3.  The  other  requirements  of  SEBI  circular  dated  December  01,  2015  on  the  subject 

shall remain in force.
