To All Registered Merchant Bankers 

 

Dear Sirs, 

 

 

SEBI/CFD/MB/IS/3/2008/29/08 

August 29, 2008 

Sub.:  Effective  date  of  ASBA  Process  and  clarification  on  clause  2.8  of  SEBI 

(Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP)) Guidelines, 2000  

 

In exercise of the powers conferred under sub-section (1) of section 11 of the Securities 

and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, all merchant bankers are informed as under:  

 

(1)  Effective date of SEBI Circular on ASBA process 

(a) 

It  is  mentioned  in  SEBI  circular  no.  SEBI/CFD/DIL/DIP/31/2008/30/7  dated 

July 30, 2008 that the said circular shall come into effect from the date to be 

specified  by  SEBI,  once  few  eligible  banks  are  recognised  as  Self  Certified 

Syndicate Banks (SCSBs).  

 

(b) 

In this regard, it is hereby informed that as of date, the following banks have 

been  recognised  as  SCSBs  and  appear  in  the  list  of  SCSBs  displayed  on 

SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in : 

(i)  Corporation Bank  

(ii)  Union Bank of India  

(iii)  HDFC Bank  

(iv)  State Bank of India 

(v) 

ICICI Bank Limited  

 

(c) 

It is further informed that the abovementioned circular shall come into effect 

from the date of issuance of this circular. All the abovementioned banks are 

eligible  to  function  as  SCSBs  in  public  issues  made  through  book  building 

route, opening on or after September 1, 2008.  

 

(2)  Clarification on clause 2.8 of the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 

(a)  Clause 2.8 of the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 states as under:  

 “No company shall make a public or a rights issue of securities unless firm 

arrangements of finance through verifiable means towards 75% of the stated 

means  of  finance,  excluding  the  amount  to  be  raised  through  proposed 

Public / Rights issue, have been made.”  

 

(b) 

It  may  be  stated  that  for  the  purpose  of  the  abovementioned  clause,  debt 

funding from financial institutions/ banks is considered as “firm arrangement 

of finance”,  only if the financial institutions/ banks extending the debt funding 

have given final sanction letters in this regard to the issuer company.  

 

(c) 

In  relation  to  the  above,  it  has  been  brought  to  our  notice  that  in  case  of 

mega projects involving high debt component, companies take considerable 

time  in  obtaining  final  sanction  letter  for  loans  from  financial  institutions/ 

banks,  as  the  process  involves  syndication,  proper  timing,  exploration  of 

various funding options (both within and outside India), etc.  In order to make 

it practicable for companies raising funds for mega projects with debt funding 

requirement  of  at  least  Rs.1000  crores,  it  has  been  decided  that  the 

abovementioned clause 2.8 shall be deemed to have been complied with, if 

the following conditions are satisfied:  

(i) 

The  issuer  company  has  obtained  “in-principle  sanction”  letters for  the 

proposed debt funding from all the relevant financial institutions/ banks;  

 

 

(ii)  The promoters of the issuer company have given a legally enforceable 

undertaking/  guarantee  to  meet  the  gap  in  funding  in  the  event  of 

inability of the issuer company to arrange firm financing arrangements;  

 

(iii)  The funding gap, which the promoters have undertaken to meet, does 

not  exceed  33%  of  the  promoters’  measurable  unencumbered  net 

worth, as evidenced by the certificate given by the statutory auditors of 

the issuer company in this regard; 

To  illustrate:  Suppose  a  project  size  of  Rs.16000  crores  is  being 

financed through public issue of Rs.6000 crores and debt from banks of 

Rs.10000  crores.  The  provisions  of  clause  2.8  shall  be  considered  to 

have been sufficiently complied with, if firm arrangements are made to 

the  extent  of  Rs.7500  crores  (i.e.,  75%  of  Rs.10,000  crores).  For 

meeting  the  gap  of  Rs.7500  crores,  if  the  promoters  were  to  give  a 

guarantee,  the  promoters  must  have  a  minimum  unencumbered  net 

worth  of  Rs.22,727.28  crores.    If  the  measurable  unencumbered  net 

worth  of  the  promoters  is  less  than  Rs.22,727.28  crores,  then  the 

amount of firm arrangement which can be arranged through promoters’ 

measurable  unencumbered  net  worth  shall  be  reduced  by  33%  of  the 

extent  of  shortfall  and  the  balance  shall  have  to  be  arranged  through 

firm bank finance. 

(iv)  For  the  purposes  of  computation  of  promoters’  net  worth,  the  value  of 

promoters’  unencumbered  shareholding  in  listed  companies  at  an 

average market price over 26 weeks has been considered; 

(v)  The abovementioned undertaking/ guarantee has been included in the 

list  of  material  contracts  and  documents  for  inspection  required  under 

clause 6.15.1 of the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000; 

 

 

 

 

(vi)  The  Lead  Merchant  Bankers  to  the  Issue  have  satisfied  themselves 

about the adequacy of funds available with the promoters of the issuer 

company  giving  the  undertaking/  guarantee  as  mentioned  above  and 

the capability of such promoters to fulfil their commitments.  

(vii)  The  offer  document  of 

the 

issuer  company  contains  adequate 

disclosures  about  how  the  Lead  Merchant  Bankers  to  the  Issue  have 

satisfied themselves in this regard.  

(d) 

It  is  informed  that  in  respect of  cases  other than  that mentioned  in  para  (c) 

above, the extant requirement of obtaining final sanction letter to comply with 

the abovementioned clause 2.8, shall continue.  

 

(e)  All  merchant  bankers  are  advised  to  take  note  of  the  above  and  ensure 

compliance.  

 

 

 

Yours faithfully, 

 

 

Neelam Bhardwaj
