SMDRP/POLCIY/CIR-45/2000 SEPTEMBER 25, 2000

To, All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ Custodians and AMFI/RAIN
Dear Sirs,
Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities.
This has reference to our earlier circular number: SMDRP/POLCIY/CIR-44/2000 dated September 18, 2000 advising the list of scrips to be traded only on "trade for trade settlement" window of the stock exchanges.
Central Depository Services (India) Limited informed us that the companies (1) Ind-Swift Limited (serial number 26 of Annexure ‘A’) and (2) XO Infotech Limited (Formerly XO Tronic Limited) (serial number 201 of Annexure ‘B’) had already established connectivity them. It was therefore decided that the scrips of these companies would be traded compulsorily in dematerialised form for all investors from October 30, 2000 and that these scrips may be excluded from the list of scrips for trading only on the "trade for trade settlement" window of the stock exchanges.
Yours faithfully,    
P. K. KURIACHEN DIVISION CHIEF SECONDARY MARKET, DEPOSITORIES, RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS DEPARTMENT
