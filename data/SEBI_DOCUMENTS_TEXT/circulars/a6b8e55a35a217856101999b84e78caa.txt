To:
The Executive Director / Managing Director of all the Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir,
Listing agreement entered into between companies and the stock exchanges is an important instrument for investor protection and corporate governance. It is therefore important that its compliance by companies is monitored regularly by stock exchanges and appropriate action is taken for non-compliance and is also brought to the notice of SEBI. To increase the efficiency of the stock exchanges in monitoring the compliance with listing requirements, the stock exchanges will be required to :
(a) Set up a separate cell with separate identified staff for monitoring the compliance with listing agreement by all the listed companies.
(b) The cell should be automated for on-line monitoring.
(c) Cases on non-compliance should be attended to promptly and notices sent to the companies for appropriate action.
(d) The status report on the compliance of the listing requirements shall be placed before the Governing Boards / Councils in every meeting.  
Yours faithfully,  
P. K. BINDLISH Division Chief Secondary Market, Depository, Research & Publications Department EMAIL : pkb@sebi.gov.in
