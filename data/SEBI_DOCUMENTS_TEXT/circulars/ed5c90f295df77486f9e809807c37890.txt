SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT Mittal Court, B Wing, First Floor, 224, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021
SMDRP/Policy/Cir-10/2001 February 13, 2001
 
To:
The President/Executive Director/ Managing Director Of all the Stock  Exchanges
Dear Sir/Madam,
Pursuant to the discussions in the meeting of the Group on Risk Management in  Equity Markets held on January 31, 2001, the stock exchanges are advised to  implement the following :

Automated Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (ALBM)

Vide circular no. SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-31/2000 dated July 27, 2000, an option  was given to the pure securities borrower of withdrawal of shares from the  clearing house/clearing corporation, subject to margins. This option is being  withdrawn w.e.f. the next settlement following date of this circular and the  shares borrowed under this facility shall be retained with the clearing  corporation or clearing house of the exchange.

System for Gross Margining at the sub-broker level

With effect from February 28, 2001, the sub-brokers will mandatorily  provide the client code number while acting on behalf of clients at the order  entry level and the exchanges will ensure the same.

Continuous Net Settlement (CNS)

Vide circular no. SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-51/2000 dated November 6, 2000, it was  provided that the facilities of CNS would be provided in 15 scrips mentioned in  that circular. It has now been decided that the CNS facility would also be  available in voluntary rolling settlement segment of the stock exchanges in all  the scrips which are having facility of ALBM/MCFS in those stock exchanges in  the account period settlement.

Scrips eligibility for ALBM/MCFS 

For the eligibility of the scrips for the facility of ALBM/MCFS, the  exchanges shall henceforth ensure that the scrip satisfies all the three  parameters mentioned below :

 
Market capitalisation 

 The scrips must have a minimum market capitalisation of Rs.  200 crores. The scrips which are currently in the ALBM or MCFS in any of the  exchanges would however continue to be eligible for this facility even though  the market capitalisation is now less than Rs. 200 crores. However, in  subsequent review, these scrips would have to qualify on criteria other than  market capitalisation. 
Liquidity
For the purpose of liquidity, the scrips shall satisfy either all the  following four parameters or the parameter of impact cost.

 
 
 
Liquidity measured as under : 


 
Trading Volume - average trading volume in the scrip in the last six months  should be among the top 75% of the above universe meeting the market  capitalisation criterion. 
Number of Trades - average number of trades should be among the top 75% of  the trading above universe meeting market capitalisation criterion. 
Trading Frequency - the scrip should have been traded on at least 75% of the  trading days in the last 6 months. 
Velocity of Trades - the scrip should have been among the top 75% in terms  of number of shares traded as a percentage of the total number of shares traded  as a percentage of the total number of shares in the equity capital of the  company for at least six months. 

OR

 
 
Liquidity based on impact cost 



Impact cost must be less than 2.5%. The procedure for computation of impact  cost is enclosed as 'Annexure'

 
Floating Stock 


The minimum floating stock criteria should be applied as under:

 
 
at least 25% of the company's equity capital must be held by non-promoters 
in case, the non-promoter holding is less than 25%, the market  capitalisation of non-promoter holding of the company's capital should be at  least Rs.100 crores subject to a minimum non-promoter holding of 10% of paid up  capital. 



Non-promoter holding shall be as provided in our circular No.  SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-7/2001 dated February 1, 2001 .
The list of scrips so eligible would be reviewed every six  months.

Mark to Market Margin in Rolling Settlement

Vide circular no. SMDRP/Policy/CIR-53/2000 dated November 15, 2000, it  was provided that the mark to market margin in rolling settlement would be  applicable as in the account period settlement system. It has now been decided  that the mark-to-market profits and losses across the settlements for which the  positions are unsettled would be permitted to be netted off.

Collection of Margins

All the margins prescribed by SEBI shall be collected on T+1 basis.

Bank Guarantee towards Base Minimum Capital (BMC) 

The stock exchanges may take their own decisions regarding tenure of bank  guarantees deposited by members towards BMC.  Yours faithfully,
P. K. BINDLISH DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER, SECONDARY MARKET DEPOSITORY, RESEARCH &  PUBLICATIONS DEPARTMENT e-mail : pkb@sebi.gov.in

ANNEXURE
IMPACT COST
Definition :– Impact cost represents the near actual cost of executing a  transaction as a single transaction forthwith in a given security/portfolio, in  proportion of its weightage in the portfolio under consideration, at any point  of time.
Calculation :- This is the percentage mark up observed while buying / selling  the desired quantity of a security compared to its ideal price (best buy + best  sell) / 2
Example A :-
ORDER BOOK
Buy Quantity
Buy Price         Sell Quantity         Sell Quantity         Sell Price
1000                         98                          1000                     99 2000                          97                         1500                   100  1000                         96                          1000                   101
TO BUY 1500 SHARES
IDEAL PRICE = 99 + 98 = 98.5  2
ACTUAL BUY PRICE = 1000 X 99 + 500 X 100 = 99.33   1500
IMPACT COST         = 99.33 - 98.5 X 100 = 0.84% (FOR 1500  SHARES)        98.5
Steps involved for calculating impact cost

Selection of Portfolio

A portfolio of securities, for which the impact cost is to be computed,  needs to be selected.

Period

The period, for which the impact cost is required, has to be defined.  This period could be for 6 months, 1 year etc.

No. of snapshots

The snapshots of buy and sell orders from the limit order book are  required to be taken on the basis of the period selected. (They may be four  times/five times/six times during the day, keeping away the beginning and  closing hours).
Eg. Portfolio of 5 securities
Securities                             Close Prices (Rs.)         Market Cap  (Rs. Crs.)
SCRIP 'A'                                      300                                     3000 SCRIP  'B'                                        85                                       600 SCRIP  'C'                                      100                                       800 SCRIP  'D'                                     150                                      2500 SCRIP 'E'                                     5000                                    5000

1000                                         305.25                  1500                     307.30  200                                           304.60                   200                     308.45 400                                            302.85                  800                     309.50  500                                           301.50                   400                     310.75

Corpus

A corpus which is envisaged to be invested in the portfolio needs to be  defined. This corpus is to be invested in the securities comprising the  portfolio. It may be Rs.50 lakhs or any other pre-fixed amount.

Define weightage

The weightage of each security in the portfolio is arrived at by dividing  the market cap of the security by the total market capitalization of the entire  portfolio. The market capitalization as of the last day of the period, for which  the impact cost is to be calculated, is reckoned for this exercise.
Eg.
Securities                         Close Prices (Rs.)         Market Cap (Rs.  Crs.)         Wghts.
SCRIP 'A'                                 300                              3000                               25% SCRIP  'B'                                   85                                600                                5% SCRIP  'C'                                 100                                800                                7% SCRIP  'D'                                 150                              2500                               21% SCRIP  'E'                                5000                              5000                              42%
Total                                     11900

Identifying amount to be invested in each security

The amount out of the total corpus (Rs.50 lakhs) to be invested in each  security is arrived at by multiplying the weightage of each stock with the total  corpus earmarked to be invested in the portfolio. The sum of the amount invested  individually in each security in the portfolio should be equal to the corpus to  be invested in the portfolio.
Eg. The amount to be invested in SCRIP 'B' would be 0.05 x Rs.50 lakhs =  Rs.2,50,000.

Lastly, the number of shares of each company to be purchased / sold is found  out by dividing the amount to be invested in each stock by the close price of  that stock.. The close price reckoned for this purpose is the close price as of  the last day of the period for which the impact cost is to be calculated.

Eg. No. of shares for SCRIP 'B' = Rs.2,50,000 / 85 = 2900 (round off)

The buy / sell impact cost is computed for the required no. of shares for  each security as per Example A given above. In the example of SCRIP 'B', for  buying and selling of 2900 shares (snapshot quantity), all the snapshots are  taken from the order books. 
 
In case of securities for which the required number of shares cannot be  bought or sold taking into account all the orders in the limit order book  snapshot, predetermined values are attached as impact costs to such unexecuted  orders, as follows : 





Impact Cost (%)


Fully executed snapshots
Computed Impact Cost


Other than fully executed snapshots
Imputed Impact cost of 5% on snapshot quantity,  ignoring executed quantity



Explanation:

 
For eg. In case of SCRIP 'B' as mentioned above, 2900 shares are required to  be bought / sold for determining the impact cost of SCRIP 'B'. 
An execution of 2900 shares is required for calculating the impact cost of  SCRIP 'B'. The Impact Cost is calculated as per the Example A given above, if  the entire 2900 shares can be bought / sold. 
In case the entire qty. (2900 shares) cannot be bought / sold, an imputed  impact cost of 5% is assigned ignoring executed orders/quantity for each  snapshot. 
Partial non-execution would mean the remainder quantity that could not be  executed e.g. out of 2900 shares and out of 3 snapshots only 1500, 2000 or 2200  shares could be executed. This means the quantity of 1400 in 1st snapshot, 900 in 2nd snapshot, 700 in 3rd snapshot could  not be executed. (This is called other than fully executed snapshot) and full  2900 in 4th snapshot could not be executed. (This also is called  other than fully executed snapshot). For all such snapshots where other than  full execution does not occur, an impact cost of 5% is assigned. 
For all fully executed snapshots, the impact cost is calculated as per  Example A given above and the simple average impact cost of the snapshots are  taken into consideration for determining the impact cost of a security. 


For e.g. there are approx. 250 trading days in a year. The snapshots for  calculating impact cost are taken 4 times during the day. Which means there  would be 1000 snapshots. Out of these, for all those snapshots where the  required quantity of shares (2900 for SCRIP 'B') can be bought/sold, the impact  cost is calculated as given in Example A. For the remaining snapshots where only  a partial non-execution or total non-execution happens, an impact cost of 5% is  assigned, ignoring quantity executed. An average impact cost is then computed  for all the 1000 snapshots observed and the impact cost of the security is thus  determined.
Mechanics of computation of Impact Cost
Assumptions:

 
250 trading days 
Normally, 4 snapshots during trading hours excluding beginning and closing  hours trades. 
For minimum 85% of snapshots, full quantity required to be bought/sold ought  to be bought/sold. 
Computed impact cost is taken for snapshot where full quantity is executed. 
Imputed impact cost of 5% is taken, for snapshots other than fully executed  quantity. 
Simple average impact cost of 100 snapshots is then computed and thus impact  cost is determined. 
An example, depicting the computation of the impact cost, is enclosed.
