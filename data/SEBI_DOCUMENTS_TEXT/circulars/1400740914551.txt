main  board  or  the  diluted  listing  norms,  if  any,  on  or  before  the  exit  of  the 

exchange,  either  on  voluntary  or  compulsory  basis.  Nation-wide  stock 

exchanges  shall  facilitate  the  listing  of  these  companies  on  priority  basis  in  a 

time bound manner.  For this purpose, these nation-wide stock exchanges shall 

immediately create a separate dedicated cell to expedite processing the listing 

requests from such companies. 

ii.  Such  exclusively  listed  companies  may  also  opt  for  voluntary  delisting  before 

the  de-recognition  of  the  stock  exchanges  by  following  the  existing  delisting 

norms of SEBI in terms of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009. 

Nation-wide  stock  exchanges  shall  provide  a  platform  to  these  companies  to 

facilitate reverse book building for voluntary delisting using their platform. 

iii.  With a view to facilitate voluntary delisting, if they so desire, it is clarified that for 

such  companies  as  referred  to  at  Para  2(ii)  above,  the  requirements  of 

‘Minimum  Public  Shareholding’  prescribed  in  Rules  19(2)(b)  and  19A  of  the 

Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957  and  Clause  40A  of  the  Listing 

Agreement, shall not be applicable.  

iv. 

In case of companies exclusively listed in the non-operational stock exchanges 

that are not traceable or where the data available is more than three years old, 

the  process  of  inclusion  in  list  of  companies 

identified  as  'Vanishing' 

(maintained by  Ministry of Corporate Affairs) may be initiated by the respective 

stock exchanges. 

v.  As  per  the  'Exit  Circular'  the  exclusively  listed  companies,  which  fail  to  obtain 

listing on any other stock exchange, which do not voluntary delist or which are 

not considered as 'Vanishing companies',  will cease to be listed company and 

will  be  moved  to  the  dissemination  board  by  the  existing  stock  exchange.  It 

shall  be  the  responsibility  of  the  exchanges  which  are  being  derecognized 

either  on  voluntary  or  compulsory  basis,  to  place  their  exclusively  listed 

companies on the dissemination board. These exchanges shall ensure that the 

database of the exclusively listed company is transferred to SEBI and to those
