Sir / Madam, 
 
Sub:  Orders  per  second  limit  and  requirement  of  empanelment  of  system 
auditors for algorithmic trading in commodity derivatives 

 

 

 

 
1.  Vide  circular  SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DMP/CIR/P/2016/97  dated  September  27, 
2016,  SEBI  had  issued  broad  guidelines  on  algorithmic  trading  for  National 
Commodity Derivatives Exchanges.  
 

2.  The  circular  inter-alia  required  exchanges  to  place  a  limit  on  the  number  of 
orders per second from a particular CTCL ID/ATS User–ID to twenty orders per 
second and to impose economic disincentives for orders exceeding twenty per 
second.  The  circular  also  stipulated  that  system  audit  of  algorithmic  trading 
shall be undertaken by a system auditor empanelled by exchanges. 

 

3.  Based  on  representations  from  exchanges  and  discussions  in  CDAC  sub-
group, it has been decided to permit exchanges to relax the limit on the number 
of  orders  per  second  from  a  particular  CTCL  ID/ATS  User–ID  up  to  hundred 
orders  per  second.  Thus,  para  ‘9’  of  SEBI  Circular  SEBI/HO/CDMRD/ 
DMP/CIR/P/2016/97 dated September 27, 2016 stands revised as follows- 

 
“The exchanges shall place a limit (X) on the numbers of orders per second 
from a particular CTCL ID/ATS User-ID not exceeding hundred orders per 
second. Compliance with the limit “X” so set by a particular CTCL ID/ATS 
User-ID  shall  be  measured  over  a  rolling  period  of  five  seconds  (i.e.,  5X 
orders for 0th – 5th second, 5X orders for 1st-6th second, 5X orders for 2nd 
to 7th second and so on).

For  number  of  orders  exceeding  the  limit  (X)  set  by  the  exchange,  the 
exchange  shall  prescribe  economic  disincentives  and  inform  the  same  to 
SEBI.” 
 

Exchange shall ensure that the limits it provides is subject to its ability to handle 
the load. 
 

4.  Based on representations from exchanges it has also been decided to do away 
with the requirement of empanelment of system auditors by the exchanges for 
system  audit  of  algorithmic  trading.  Thus  in  Para  ’18.c’  of  SEBI  Circular 
SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DMP/CIR/P/2016/97 dated September 27, 2016 the words 
“empanelled by exchanges” stand deleted. 

 

5.  The  exchanges  are  advised  to  bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the  
notice    of    their    members    and    also    to    disseminate    the    same    on    their  
website. 

 

6.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, to protect the interests 
of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate 
the securities market.  

 
7.  This circular is available on SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in. 

 

Yours faithfully,
