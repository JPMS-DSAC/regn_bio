Sir/ Madam, 

 

Subject: Instant Access Facility and Use of e-wallet for investment in Mutual 

Funds 

 

A.  Instant Access Facility (IAF) 

1.  IAF facilitates credit of redemption proceeds in the bank account of the investor 

on the same day of redemption request. In order to further enhance the reach 

of  Mutual  Funds  (MFs)  towards  the  retail  investors,  it  has  been  decided  to 

issue  guidelines  for  extending  IAF.  MFs/  AMCs  may  offer  IAF  subject  to  the 

following conditions: 

a.  Eligibility - IAF shall be allowed through online mechanism and only for 

resident individual investors. 

b.  Applicability 

i.  NAV:  While  observing  the  extant  cut-off  timings  with  respect  to 

repurchase  (i.e.  redemption),  under  IAF  the  following  NAVs  shall 

be applied: 

  where the IAF application is received up to 3.00 pm – the 

lower  of  (i)  NAV  of  previous  calendar  day  and  (ii)  NAV  of 

calendar day on which application is received; 

  where  the  IAF  application  is  received  after  3.00  pm  –  the 

lower of (i) NAV of calendar day on which such application 

is received, and (ii) NAV of the next calendar day.

ii.  Scheme – MFs/ AMCs can offer IAF only in Liquid schemes of the 

MF.  

iii.  Monetary  Limit  -  The  monetary  limit  under  IAF  shall  be  INR 

50,000/-  or  90%  of  latest  value  of  investment  in  the  scheme, 

whichever  is  lower.  This  limit  shall  be  applicable  per  day  per 

scheme per investor. 

c.  Liquidity  

i.  Liquidity for IAF has to be provided out of the available funds  with 

the scheme  and  MFs/  AMCs should  put in  place  a mechanism  so 

that  adequate  balance  is  available  in  the  bank  account  of  the 

scheme  to  meet  liquidity/  redemption  requirements  under  IAF. 

Such  mechanism  may  be  based  on  historical  trends  of  instant 

access. For example, AMCs offering IAF may set aside in cash  at 

least 3 times of – the higher of, last one month’s or three month’s 

daily average of redemptions under instant access on a rolling day 

basis. AMCs should also lay down robust processes for continuous 

monitoring and for funding the redemptions under the IAF.

under IAF. 

d.  Disclosures   

i.  AMCs  shall  make  appropriate  disclosures  in  the  scheme  related 

documents about IAF and ensure that no mis-selling is done on the 

pretext of instant availability of funds to the investors.  

ii.  Appropriate disclosures shall be made to the investors mentioning 

the  scenarios  under  which  IAF  may  be  suspended  and  that  IAF 

request  would  be  processed  as  a  normal  redemption  request  in 

such circumstances. 

e.  Approvals and Controls 

i.  MFs/ AMCs shall offer IAF only  after obtaining  approvals from the 

AMC  Board  and  the  Trustees  and  keep  in  place  adequate 

safeguards in the system to implement this facility.
