D&CC/FITTC/CIR – 06/2002 January 31, 2002
To,
All Stock Exchanges and Depositories  
Dear Sir,
Please refer to circular no. D&CC/FITTC/CIR-05/2001 dated December 26, 2001 regarding the list of scrips, which shall trade under the normal rolling settlement mode of the stock exchanges.
The Depositories have informed us that some of the companies given in annexure ‘A’ (serial no. 01 to 08) had established connectivity with them before October 31, 2001, the correct status of which was not furnished to SEBI. It was therefore decided that these scrips shall trade in the normal rolling settlement mode of the stock exchanges with immediate effect.
As per the information provided by both the depositories the list of scrips that have established connectivity with them as on December 31, 2001 is given in annexure ‘A’ (serial no. 09 to 91). These scrips would be traded in the normal rolling settlement mode with effect from March 31, 2002.    
Yours faithfully, 
G S REDDY
