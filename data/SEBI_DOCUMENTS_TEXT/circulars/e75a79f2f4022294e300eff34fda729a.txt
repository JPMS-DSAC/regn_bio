We have revised the format of quarterly Compliance Test Reports by incorporating the amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. A copy of the revised format, which is effective from the quarter ended June 2000, is enclosed. As the compliance of SEBI Regulations is a continuous process, you are advised to incorporate the modifications/additions under the relevant sections of the format, based on amendments to the Regulations/guidelines issued in the future from time to time.
