Annex 1 
Exhibit C1: Format for the Limited Review Report for listed entities other than banks and 
insurance companies - unaudited standalone quarterly and year to date results 
 
Review report to.................... 
 
We  have  reviewed 
financial  results  of 
……………………………..  (Name  of  the  Company)  for  the  period  ended………….  This 
statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approved by the 
Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based 
on our review. 
 
We  conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  A  review  is  limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data 
and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not  performed  an  audit  and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

the  audit  evidence  we  have obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our 
opinion. 

[Insert Emphasis of Matter Paragraph]4 

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 

Management’s Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Results 

These quarterly financial results as well as the year to date standalone financial results have 
been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  interim  financial  statements.  The  Company’s  Board  of 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of these financial results that give a true and fair 
view  of the  net profit/loss  and  other comprehensive income and other financial  information  in 
accordance  with 
recognition  and  measurement  principles  laid  down  in  Indian 
Accounting Standard 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act  read  with  relevant  rules  issued  thereunder  and  other  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted  in  India  and  in  compliance  with  Regulation  33  of  the  Listing  Regulations.  This 
responsibility  also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate  accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for  safeguarding of the  assets  of  the  Company  and  for  preventing

and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application  of  appropriate 
accounting policies;  making  judgments  and  estimates  that  are  reasonable  and prudent;  and 
design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal   financial   controls that were 
operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial results that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the standalone financial results, the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so. 

The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting 
process. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results 

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  standalone  financial 
results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial 
results.  

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

 

Identify  and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial results, 
whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  

  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. 

  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. 

  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
of  accounting and,  based  on  the audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a material  uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as  a  going concern.  If  we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
results or,  if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 

  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial results, 
including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  financial  results  represent  the  underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them  all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
 
Management’s Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Results 

These quarterly financial results as well as the year to date consolidated financial results have 
been prepared on the basis of the interim financial statements.  

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation 
of these consolidated financial results  that give a true and fair view of the net profit/ loss  and 
other  comprehensive  income  and  other  financial  information  of  the  Group  including  its 
associates and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles  laid  down  in  Indian  Accounting  Standard  34,  ‘Interim  Financial  Reporting’ 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the 
Listing Regulations. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
and of its associates and jointly controlled entities are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Group and its associates  and jointly controlled entities and for preventing and detecting 
frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting  policies; 
making  judgments  and  estimates  that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  the  design, 
implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls,  that  were  operating 
effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial results  that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used 
for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial results by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid. 

In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  results,  the  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  the 
companies  included  in  the  Group  and  of  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  are 
responsible for  assessing  the  ability  of  the  Group  and  of  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled 
entities  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going 
concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  the  respective  Board  of 
Directors  either  intends  to  liquidate  the  Group  or  to  cease  operations,  or  has  no  realistic 
alternative but to do so. 

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates 
and jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of 
the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities.  

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Results 

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain reasonable  assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial 
results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
results.  

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial results, 
whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than

for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  

  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.  

  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. 

  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
of  accounting and,  based  on  the audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a material  uncertainty 
exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  ability  of  the 
Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial results or, if such disclosures 
are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence 
obtained up to the  date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to cease to continue as a 
going concern. 

  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial results, 
including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial  results  represent  the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

  Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  results/financial 
information of the entities within the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities 
to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  Financial  Results.  We  are  responsible  for  the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial results of which we are the independent auditors. For 
the other entities included in the consolidated Financial Results, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. 

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other 
entities included in the consolidated financial results of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them  all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards. 

We  also  performed  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  circular  issued  by  the  SEBI  under 
Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, as amended, to the extent applicable.

Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Results  

These Consolidated financial results have been prepared on the basis of the consolidated 
annual financial statements.  The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial results that give a true and fair 
view of the net profit/ loss and other comprehensive income and other financial information of 
the Group including its associates and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the  Indian 
Accounting  Standards  prescribed  under  Section  133  of  the  Act  read  with  relevant  rules 
issued  thereunder  and  other  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  India  and  in 
compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The respective Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled  entities are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and its associates and jointly controlled 
entities and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate  accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates  that  are reasonable and 
prudent;  and  the  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial 
controls,  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial 
results  that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
results by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 

In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  results,  the  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  the 
companies  included  in  the  Group  and  of  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  are 
responsible  for  assessing  the  ability  of  the  Group  and  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled 
entities  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going 
concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  the  respective    Board  of 
Directors  either  intends  to  liquidate  the  Group  or  to  cease  operations,  or  has  no  realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates 
and jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of 
the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Results  
 
Our  objectives  are  to  obtain reasonable  assurance about  whether  the consolidated  financial 
results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
results.  
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial results, 
whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  

  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls. 

  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of  accounting and,  based  on  the audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a material  uncertainty 
exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  ability  of  the 
Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial results or, if such disclosures 
are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence 
obtained up to the  date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to cease to continue as a 
going concern. 

  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial results, 
including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial  results  represent  the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

  Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  results/financial 
information of the entities within the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities 
to  express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  Financial  Results. We  are  responsible  for  the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial results of which we are the independent auditors. For 
the other entities included in the consolidated Financial Results, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.  

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other 
entities included in the consolidated financial results of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them  all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards. 
We  also  performed  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  circular  issued  by  the  SEBI  under 
Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, as amended, to the extent applicable.

Exhibit  B1:  Format  for  the Limited  Review  Report  for  banks  for  unaudited  standalone 
quarterly and year to date results 

 

Review report to.................... 

 

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of ____ (Name 
of  the  Bank)  for  the  period  ended  ____.  This  statement  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Bank’s 
Management and has been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a 
report on these financial statements based on our review. 

We  conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  A  review  is  limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data 
and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not  performed  an  audit  and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

In the conduct of our Review we have relied on the review reports in respect of non-performing 
assets received from concurrent auditors of __ branches, inspection teams of the bank of ___ 
branches  and  other  firms  of  auditors  of  __  branches  specifically  appointed  for  this  purpose. 
These review reports cover__ percent of the advances portfolio of the bank. Apart from these 
review reports, in the conduct of our review, we have also relied upon various returns received 
from the branches of the bank. 

Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement or that it has not been 
prepared in accordance with the relevant prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India 
in respect of income recognition, asset classification, provisioning and other related matters.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act/Banking Regulations Act, 194926 for safeguarding of the assets 
of  the  Bank  and  for  preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and

to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether 

the  standalone 
Our  objectives  are 
Financial Results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Financial 
Results. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Financial Results, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher 
than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

•  Obtain an  understanding of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in order  to design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. 

•  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. 

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are

requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us  and 
other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in “Other Matter” paragraph below, is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

[Insert Emphasis of Matter Paragraph]32 

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 

Board of Directors’ Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Results 

These  Consolidated  Financial  Results  have  been  compiled  from  the  audited  consolidated 
interim financial statements/ financial information. 

The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated Financial Results that give a true and fair view of the net profit/ loss33 and other 
financial  information  of  the  Group  including  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Accounting Standard 
25 (AS 25) / Indian Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) “Interim Financial Reporting” specified 
under section 133 of the Act / issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India34, the 
relevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the circulars, guidelines and directions 
issued  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  from  time  to  time  (“RBI  Guidelines”)  and  other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the 
Listing Regulations. The respective Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group and 
of  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act/Banking Regulations Act, 1949 
for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application  of appropriate  accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and 
completeness  of  the  accounting records,  relevant  to the  preparation  and  presentation  of  the 
consolidated  Financial  Results  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view  and  are  free  from  material 
misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error  which  have  been  used  for  the  purpose  of 
preparation of the consolidated financial results by the Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid. 

In preparing the consolidated Financial Results, the respective  Board of Directors of the entities 
included  in the Group  and  of  its  associates  and  jointly  controlled entities  are  responsible  for 
assessing the ability of the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the 
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

The respective Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group and of its associates and 
jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the 
Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Results 

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated 
Financial Results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Financial 
Results. 

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

 

Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  Financial 
Results, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 

                                                 
32 If applicable, based on facts and circumstances of the engagement. 
33 As applicable.

those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for  our  opinion. The  risk  of not  detecting  a material  misstatement  resulting  from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

  Obtain an  understanding of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in order  to design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. 

  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. 

  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going  concern. If 
we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Financial Results or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor’s  report.  However,  future  events  or 
conditions may cause the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 

  Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  Financial 
Results,  including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  Financial  Results 
represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair 
presentation. 

  Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  results/financial 
information of the entities within the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities 
to express an opinion on the consolidated Financial  Results. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial results of which we are the independent auditors. For 
the other entities included in the consolidated Financial Results, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.  

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  of  the  Bank  and  such  other  entities 
included  in  the  consolidated  Financial  Results  of  which  we  are  the  independent  auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a  statement  that  we  have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them 
be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

  Obtain an  understanding of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in order  to design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. [OR] Under Section 143(3)(i) 
of the Companies Act 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 

  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. 

  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern. If 
we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Financial Results or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor’s  report.  However,  future  events  or 
conditions may cause the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
