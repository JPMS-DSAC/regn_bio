prescribed at the level of clearing member. However, the clearing member 
shall ensure that his own trading position and the positions of each stock 
broker clearing through him is within the limits specified above.  

15. Risk Management  

The margins shall be collected in INR. For this purpose, RBI reference rate of 
previous day for USD-INR and the corresponding exchange rate published by 
RBI for JPY-INR, as applicable, shall be used till 02:00 p.m. The latest available 
RBI  reference  rate  for  USD-INR  and  the  corresponding  exchange  rate 
published by RBI for JPY-INR, as applicable, shall be used post 02:00 p.m. 

(i)  Initial Margin  

The Initial Margin requirement would be based on a worst scenario loss of 
a  portfolio  of  an  individual  client  comprising  his  positions  in  options  and 
futures  contracts  on  the  same  underlying  across  different  maturities  and 
across various scenarios of price and volatility changes. In order to achieve 
this,  the  price  range  for  generating  the  scenarios  would  be  3.5  standard 

Page 8 of 15 

¼ããÀ¦ããè¾ã   ¹ãÆãä¦ã¼ãîãä¦ã   ‚ããõÀ   ãäÌããä¶ã½ã¾ã   ºããñ¡Ã 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 

 

deviation  and  volatility  range  for  generating  the  scenarios  would  be  3%. 
Since the margins shall be collected in INR, the price scanning range shall 
be scaled up by the total futures margin rate of the contract involving the 
quoted  currency  in  cross-currency  pair  and  INR.  The  initial  margin  so 
computed  would  be  subject  to  a  minimum  of  2%  for  all  cross-currency 
derivatives contracts.  

However, for first two days of trading, the initial margin shall be computed 
using  a  sigma  of  1.15%  for  EUR-USD  contracts,  0.95%  for  GBP-USD 
contracts and 0.60% for USD-JPY contracts. Thereafter, the sigma would 
be calculated using the methodology specified for currency futures in SEBI 
circular no. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-38/2008 dated August 06, 2008 and would be 
the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of futures price. 

For the purpose of calculation of option values, the following standard option 
pricing models - Black-Scholes, Binomial, Merton would be used. 

The initial margin shall be deducted from the liquid  assets of the clearing 
member on an online, real time basis. 

(ii)   Extreme Loss margin  

The extreme loss margin shall be deducted from the liquid  assets of the 
clearing member on an online, real time basis. 

Futures: The extreme loss margin shall be 1% of the mark to market value 
of the contract for all gross open positions.  

Options: The extreme loss margin shall be 1% of the notional value of the 
open short option position. Notional Value would be calculated on the basis 
of the latest exchange rate published by RBI for respective exchange rate. 

(iii)  Net Option Value 

The Net Option Value is the current market value of the option times the 
number of options (positive for long options and negative for short options) 
in  the  portfolio. The  Net  Option  Value  would  be  added  to  the Liquid  Net 
Worth  of  the  clearing  member.  Thus,  mark  to  market  gains  and  losses 
would not be settled in cash for options positions. 

(iv)  Calendar spread margin  

A  currency  futures  position  at  one  maturity  which  is  hedged  by  an 
offsetting position at a different maturity would be treated as a calendar 
spread. For a calendar spread position, the extreme loss margin shall be 
charged on one third of the mark to market value of the far month contract. 

Page 9 of 15

A long currency option position at one maturity and a short option position 
at  a  different  maturity  in  the  same  underlying  would  be  treated  as  a 
calendar  spread.  The  margin  for  options  calendar  spread  would  be  the 
same  as  specified  for  the  corresponding  currency  futures  calendar 
spread. 

The margin would be calculated on the basis of delta of the portfolio in 
each month. A portfolio consisting of a near month option with a delta of 
100  and  a  far  month  option  with  a  delta  of  –100  would  bear  a  spread 
charge equal to the spread charge for a portfolio which is long 100 near 
month currency futures and short 100 far month currency futures. Option 
positions  of  different  expiry,  irrespective  of their  strike  prices,  shall  also 
attract calendar spread margin. 

The  benefit  for  a  calendar  spread  would  continue  till  expiry  of  the  near 
month contract. The calendar-spread margin shall be charged in addition 
to the worst-scenario loss of the portfolio. 

(v)  Settlement of Premium 

Premium  would be  settled  in  INR  and  would  be  paid  in  by  the  buyer  in 
cash and paid out to the seller in cash on T+1 day. Until the buyer pays in 
the premium, the premium due shall be deducted from the available liquid 
assets on a real time basis. 

For arriving at the settlement value in INR for EUR-USD and GBP-USD 
contracts,  the  latest  available  RBI  reference  rate  for  USD-INR  shall  be 
used. For USD-JPY contracts, the settlement value in INR shall be arrived 
at using the latest available exchange rate published by RBI for JPY-INR. 

(vi)  Assignment Margin  

Assignment Margin shall be levied on assigned positions of the clearing 
members towards exercise settlement obligations for option contracts. For

option  positions  exercised,  the  seller  of  the  options  shall  be  levied 
assignment margins which shall be 100% of the net exercise settlement 
value  payable  by  a  clearing  member  towards  exercise  settlement. 
Assignment margin shall be levied till the completion of pay-in towards the 
exercise  settlement.  Assignment  margins  shall  be  computed  as  net  of 
assignment settlement and futures final settlement.

futures  contracts  on  the  same  underlying  across  different  maturities  and 
across various scenarios of price and volatility changes. In order to achieve 
this,  the  price  range  for  generating  the  scenarios  would  be  3.5  standard 
deviation and volatility range for generating the scenarios would be 3%.  

The  sigma  would  be  calculated  using  the  methodology  specified  for 
currency futures in SEBI circular SEBI/DNPD/Cir-38/2008 dated August 06, 
2008  and  would  be  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of 
futures price. 

For the purpose of calculation of option values, the following standard option 
pricing models - Black-Scholes, Binomial, Merton would be used. 

The initial margin shall be deducted from the liquid  assets of the clearing 
member on an online, real time basis. 

(ii)  Extreme Loss margin 

Extreme  loss  margin  shall  be  equal  to  the  following  percentages  of  the 
notional value of the open short option position.  

  EUR-INR: 1.5% 

  GBP-INR: 1.5% 

  JPY-INR:  1.5% 

Notional Value would be calculated on the basis of the latest exchange rate 
published by Reserve Bank for respective FCY-INR. 

The  extreme  loss  margin  shall  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  assets  of  the 
clearing member on an online, real time basis. 

(iii) Net Option Value 

The Net Option Value is the current market value of the option times the 
number of options (positive for long options and negative for short options) 
in  the  portfolio.  The  Net  Option  Value  would  be  added  to  the  Liquid  Net 
Worth of the clearing member. Thus, mark to market gains and losses would 
not be settled in cash for options positions. 

(iv) Calendar Spread Margin 

A long currency option position at one maturity and a short option position 
at a different maturity in the same underlying would be treated as a calendar 
spread.  The  margin  for  options  calendar  spread  would  be  the  same  as 
specified for FCY-INR currency futures calendar spread.

The margin would be calculated on the basis of delta of the portfolio in each 
month. A portfolio consisting of a near month option with a delta of 100 and 
a far month option with a delta of – 100 would bear a spread charge equal 
to the spread charge for a portfolio which is long 100 near month currency 
futures  and  short  100  far  month  currency  futures.  Option  positions  of 
different expiry, irrespective of their strike prices, shall also attract calendar 
spread margin. 

(v) Settlement of Premium 

Premium would be paid in by the buyer in cash and paid out to the seller in 
cash on T+1 day. Until the buyer pays in the premium, the premium due 
shall be deducted from the available liquid assets on a real time basis. 

(vi) Assignment Margin  

Assignment  Margin  shall  be  levied  on  assigned  positions  of  the  clearing 
members towards exercise settlement obligations for option contracts. For 
option  positions  exercised,  the  seller  of  the  options  shall  be  levied 
assignment  margins  which  shall  be  100%  of  the  net  exercise  settlement 
value  payable  by  a  clearing  member  towards  exercise  settlement. 
Assignment margin shall be levied till the completion of pay-in towards the 
exercise  settlement.  Assignment  margins  shall  be  computed  as  net  of 
assignment settlement and futures final settlement.
