The President/Executive Director/Managing Directorof all Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir, 
Sub : Registration Of Brokers
It has been observed that most of the Stock Exchanges are not furnishing the information regarding details of fee remittance by the transferor to SEBI in the format forwarded vide our Circular Ref SMD/MDP/2719/96 dated July 10, 1996, (copy enclosed) resulting in delay in registration.
 
All Exchanges are therefore required to adhere to the said format and certify that the transferor has paid SEBI turnover fees for all the previous years including that related to transactions of the current year and that there are no fee dues payable to SEBI by the transferor member. Wherever court cases are pending, the Exchanges should certify that the transferor has paid all fees due, as per the court order.
 
Yours faithfully, 
M. D. PATELEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
