Dear Sir / Madam,  
 
Subject:  Collection  and  Reporting of  Margins  by  Trading  Member  (TM)  /  Clearing 

Member (CM) in Cash Segment - Clarification 

 
1.  SEBI,  vide  circular  no.  CIR/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2019/139  dated  November  19, 
2019  and  SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/146  dated  July  31,  2020,  issued 
guidelines  with  regard  to  collection  of  margins  from  clients  and  reporting  of  short-
collection  /  non-collection  of  margins  by  Trading  Member  (TM)  /  Clearing  Member 
(CM).  

 
2.  Paragraph 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of the SEBI circular dated November 19, 2019, specifies 

the following: 

 

The ‘margins’ for this purpose shall mean VaR margin, extreme loss margin (ELM), 
mark  to  market  margin  (MTM),  delivery  margin,  special  /  additional  margin  or  any 
other  margin  as  prescribed  by  the  Exchange  to  be  collected  by  TM/CM  from  their 
clients. 

 

Henceforth,  like  in  derivatives  segment,  the  TMs/CMs  in  cash  segment  are  also 
required to mandatorily collect upfront VaR margins and ELM from their clients. The 
TMs  /  CMs  will  have  time  till  ‘T+2’  working  days  to  collect  margins  (except  VaR 
margins and ELM) from their clients. (The clients must ensure that the VaR margins 
and ELM are paid in advance of trade and other margins are paid as soon as margin 
calls are made by the Stock Exchanges / TMs / CMs. The   period   of   T+2   days   
has   been   allowed   to TMs / CMs to collect margin from clients taking into account 
the  practical  difficulties often  faced  by  them  only  for  the  purpose  of  levy  of  penalty 
and it should not be construed that clients have been allowed 2 days to pay margin 
due from them.) 
 

3.  Paragraph  2.1  of  the  SEBI  circular  dated  July  31,  2020,  inter-alia,  specifies  the 

following: 
 
If TM / CM collects minimum 20% upfront margin in lieu of VaR and ELM from the 
client,  then  penalty  for  short-collection  /  non-collection  of  margin  shall  not  be 
applicable.

4.  In view of the representations received with regard to levy of penalty for non-collection 
of “other margins” (other than VaR and ELM) on or before T+2 days from clients by 
TM / CM, following is clarified: 

 

4.1. If  pay-in  (both  funds  and  securities)  is  made  by  T+2  working  days,  the  other 
margins  would  deemed  to  have  been  collected  and  penalty  for  short  /  non 
collection of other margins shall not arise.  
 

4.2. If  Early  Pay-In  of  securities  has  been  made  to  the  Clearing  Corporation  (CC), 
then  all  margins  would  deemed  to  have  been  collected  and  penalty  for  short  / 
non-collection of margin including other margins shall not arise. 
 

4.3. If  client  fails  to  make  pay-in  by  T+2  working  days  and  TM  /  CM  do  not  collect 
other margins from the client by T+2 working days, the same shall also result in 
levy of penalty as applicable. 

 

5.  It  is  reiterated  that  CC  shall  continue  to  collect  upfront  VaR  plus  ELM  and  other 

margins from TM / CM as applicable from time to time.  

 
6.  SEBI circulars dated November 19, 2019 and July 31, 2020 are modified to the extent 
of the above. All other provisions of the said SEBI circulars dated November 19, 2019 
and July 31, 2020 shall continue to remain applicable. 

 

7.  This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  to  protect  the  interests  of 
investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to  regulate  the 
securities market.
