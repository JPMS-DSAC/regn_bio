To 

All Listed Entities (whose specified securities or debt securities or NCRPS are listed on  

SEBI recognized Stock Exchanges) 

 

Dear Sir / Madam, 

Sub: Fund raising by issuance of Debt Securities by Large Entities 

1.  With  a  view  to  operationalising  the  Union  Budget  announcement  for  2018-19, 

which,  inter-alia,  stated  "SEBI  will  also  consider  mandating,  beginning  with  large 

entities, to meet about one-fourth of their financing needs from the debt market”, 

SEBI  came  out  with  a  discussion  paper  on  July  20,  2018.  Based  on  feedback 

received on the discussion paper and wider consultation with market participants 

including  entities,  the  detailed  guidelines  for  operationalising  the  above  budget 

announcement are given below.  

2.  Applicability of Framework 

2.1. For the entities following April-March as their financial year, the framework shall 

come into effect from April 01, 2019 and for the entities which follow calendar 

year  as  their  financial  year,  the  framework  shall  become  applicable  from 

January 01, 2020.  

Explanation: The term ‘Financial Year' (FY) here would imply April- March or 

January-December, as may be followed by an entity. Thus, FY 2020 shall mean 

April 01, 2019 - March 31, 2020 or January 01, 2020 - December 31, 2020, as 

the case may be. 

2.2. The framework shall be  applicable for all listed entities (except for Scheduled 

Commercial Banks),  which as on last day of the FY (i.e. March 31 or December 

31): 

 

Page 1 of 11 

 

 

i. 

have  their  specified  securities  or  debt  securities  or  non-convertible 

redeemable preference share, listed on a recognised stock exchange(s) 

in  terms  of  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 

Regulations, 2015; and 

ii. 

have  an  outstanding  long  term  borrowing  of  Rs  100  crores  or  above, 

where  outstanding  long-term  borrowings  shall  mean  any  outstanding 

borrowing  with  original  maturity  of  more  than  1  year  and  shall  exclude 

external commercial borrowings and inter-corporate borrowings between 

a parent and subsidiary(ies); and 

iii. 

have a credit rating of "AA and above", where credit rating shall be of the 

unsupported  bank  borrowing  or  plain  vanilla  bonds  of  an  entity,  which 

have  no  structuring/  support  built  in;  and  in  case,  where  an  issuer  has 

multiple ratings from multiple rating agencies, highest of such rating shall 

be considered for the purpose of applicability of this framework. 

3.  Framework 

3.1. A  listed  entity,  fulfilling  the  criteria  as  specified  at  para  2.2  above,  shall  be 

considered as a “Large Corporate” (LC) and such a LC shall raise not less than 

25% of its incremental borrowings, during the financial year subsequent to the 

financial  year  in  which  it  is  identified  as  a  LC,  by  way  of  issuance  of  debt 

securities,  as  defined  under  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities) 

Regulations, 2008 (hereinafter "ILDS Regulations"). 

Explanation:  For  the  purposes  of  this  circular,  the  expression  "incremental 

borrowings" shall mean any borrowing done during a particular financial year, 

of original maturity of more than 1 year, irrespective of whether such borrowing 

is  for  refinancing/repayment  of  existing  debt  or  otherwise  and  shall  exclude 

external  commercial  borrowings  and  inter-corporate  borrowings  between  a 

parent and subsidiary(ies). 

3.2. For an entity identified as a LC, the following shall be applicable: 

 

Page 2 of 11 

 

 

i. 

For  FY  2020  and  2021,  the  requirement  of  meeting  the  incremental 

borrowing norms shall be applicable on an annual basis. Accordingly, a 

listed entity identified as a LC on last day of FY 2019 and FY 2020, shall 

comply with the requirement as laid down under para 3.1, by last day of 

FY 2020 and FY 2021, respectively.  

Provided  that  in  case  where  a  LC  is  unable  to  comply  with  the  above 

requirement, it shall provide an explanation for such shortfall to the Stock 

Exchanges, in the manner as prescribed at para 4. 

ii. 

From FY 2022, the requirement of mandatory incremental borrowing by a 

LC  in  a  FY  will  need  to  be  met  over  a  contiguous  block  of  two  years. 

Accordingly, a listed entity identified as a LC, as on last day of FY "T-1", 

shall  have  to  fulfil  the  requirement  of  incremental  borrowing  for  FY  "T", 

over FY "T" and "T+1". 

However, if  at the end of two years i.e.  last day of  FY "T+1", there is a 

shortfall in the requisite borrowing (i.e. the actual borrowing through debt 

securities is less than 25% of the incremental borrowings  for FY "T"), a 

monetary penalty/fine of 0.2% of the shortfall in the borrowed amount shall 

be levied and the same shall be paid to the Stock Exchange(s). 

4.  Disclosure requirements for large entities  

4.1. A listed entity, identified as a LC under the instant framework, shall make the 

following disclosures to the stock exchanges, where its security(ies) are listed: 

i.  Within 30 days from the beginning of the FY, disclose the fact that they 

are identified as a LC, in the format as provided at Annexure A.   

ii.  Within  45  days  of  the  end  of  the  FY,  the  details  of  the  incremental 

borrowings done during the FY, in the formats as provided at Annexure 

B1 and B2. 

 

Page 3 of 11 

 

 

4.2. The  disclosures  made  in  terms  of  para  4.1  shall  be  certified  both  by  the 

Company Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer, of the LC.  

4.3. Further, the disclosures made in terms of para 4.1 shall also form part of audited 

annual financial results of the entity.   

4.4. The  details  of  the  framework  as  mentioned  under  para  3  and  disclosure 

requirements as mentioned under para 4.1, are illustrated in Annexure C.  

5.  Responsibilities of Stock Exchanges 

5.1. The Stock Exchange(s) shall collate the information about the LC, disclosed on 

their platform, and shall submit the same to the Board within 14 days of the last 

date of submission of annual financial results. 

5.2. In the event of a short fall in the requisite borrowing, the Stock Exchanges shall 

collect  the  fine  as  mentioned  at  para  3.2(ii).  The  fine  so  collected  shall  be 

remitted by the stock exchanges to SEBI IPEF fund within 10 days from the end 

of the month in which the fine was collected. 

6.  This Circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with regulation 101(2) of 

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
