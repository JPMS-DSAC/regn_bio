SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 6/98057/07

Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)
 
Dear Sirs,
 
Subject: Bimonthly Compliance Test Reports (CTRs)
 
As you are aware, in order to synchronize the frequency of submission of two documents - compliance certificate by the Asset Management Company (AMC) to the trustees and CTR by the AMC to SEBI, SEBI vide circular no. SEBI/IMD/CIR No.11/36222/2005 dated March 16, 2005 stipulated filing of CTR once in every two months.
 
With an objective of effective and relevant disclosure to the regulator, it has been decided that instead of filing complete CTR with SEBI, the AMCs shall only do exceptional reporting on a bimonthly basis. While the format and contents of CTR would continue, the AMCs would be required to report to SEBI only the exceptions in the CTR i.e. the AMCs shall report for only those points in the CTR where it has not complied with the same. The details sought in the annexures of the CTR shall now be furnished to SEBI in case of non-compliance only along with the exception report. This exception report shall also be placed before the board of trustees.
 
This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
 
Yours faithfully,
 
R K Nair
