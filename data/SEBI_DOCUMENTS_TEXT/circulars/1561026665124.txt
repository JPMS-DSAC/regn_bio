2. Further,  the  following  circulars  were  issued  by  SEBI  from  time  to  time  detailing  the 
operational modalities with respect to handling of client’s funds and securities by stock

a)  Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993:  

 
In  terms  of  clause 2  of  the  circular  SEBI  had  inter  alia  specified  that  “it  shall  be 
compulsory for all member brokers to keep separate accounts for client’s securities 
and  to  keep  such  books  of  accounts,  as  may  be  necessary,  to  distinguish  such 
securities from his/their own securities. Such accounts for client’s securities shall, 
inter-alia provide for the following:- 
 

i.  Securities fully paid for, pending delivery to clients; 
ii.  Fully  paid  for  client’s  securities  registered  in  the  name  of  Member,  if  any, 

towards margin requirements etc. 

 

b)  SEBI Circular No. MRD/DOP/SE/Cir – 11/2008 dated April 17, 2008:  

 
In  the  said  circular,  SEBI  had  inter-alia  specified  that  ‘brokers  should  have

used  for  any  purposes  other  than  meeting  the  respective  client’s  margin 
requirements / pay-ins. Brokers should also maintain records to ensure proper audit 
trail of use of client collateral.  
 

c)  Circular no. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016 

and Circular no. CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/64 dated June 22, 2017: 
 
In the said circulars, SEBI had specified that “stock brokers shall not grant further 
exposure to the clients when debit balances arise out of client’s failure to pay the 
required amount and such debit  balances continues beyond fifth trading day, as 
reckoned  from  the  date  of  pay-in,  except  in  accordance  with  the  margin  trading 
facility provided vide SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/54/2017 dated June 13, 2017 or 
as may be issued from time to time”  
 

d)  Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/DP/CIR/P/2016/13 dated December 16, 2016: 

 
In the said circular, SEBI had specified that “the member shall transfer securities 
from  pool  account  to  the  respective  beneficiary  account  of  their  client  within  1 
working day after the pay-out day. The securities lying in the pool account beyond 
the stipulated 1 working day shall attract a penalty at the rate of 6 basis point per 
week on the value of securities.” 

 
Therefore,  in  terms    of  the  above  provisions,  all  TM/CM  are  required  to  transfer  the 
clients securities received in pay-out to clients demat account within one working day. In 
case  the  client does  not  pay  for  such  securities  received  in pay-out,  then the TM/CM 
shall be entitled to retain those securities up to five trading days after pay-out. Further, 
where the client fails to meet its funds pay-in obligation within five trading days from pay-
out day, the TM/CM shall liquidate the securities in the market to recover its dues. Under 
no circumstances, shall the securities of the clients received in pay-out be retained by 
the TM/CM beyond five trading days and be used for any other purpose. 

 

 

3. As per the provisions of the following circulars, TM/CM are permitted to provide running 
account for securities and create a lien on the client securities to the extent of the clients’ 
indebtedness to the TM/CM. 

 

a)  As per clause 12 of the SEBI circular on ‘Dealings between a client and a Stock 
Broker’  dated  December  03,  2009  a  client  may  specifically  authorize  the  stock 
broker  to  maintain  a  running  account  of  ‘funds’    and  ‘securities’  subject  to  the 
specified conditions. 
 

b)  As  per  clause  2.5  of  SEBI  circular  on  ‘Enhanced  Supervision  of  Stock  Brokers/

circular  CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/64  dated  June  22,  2017,  “a  stock

Referencing  the  above  stated  provisions,  the  TM/CM  are  transferring  client’s 
securities  into  their  own  account  by  way  of  title  transfer  and  then  placing  such 
securities as a collateral to Banks/NBFCs  and/or fulfilling securities shortages of 
other clients/proprietary trades which is not contemplated in the provisions of the 
SEBI circulars referred to in paragraph 2. 

 

 

4. In  order  to  provide  clarity  with  respect  to  a TM/CM  maintaining  a  running  account  for 
client securities and pledging the client securities with Banks/NBFCs, after discussions 
with  the  Exchanges,  Depositories  and  Clearing  Corporations,  the  following  advice  is 
issued:- 

4.1 The securities received in pay-out against which payment has been made by clients, 
shall be transferred to the demat account of the respective clients within one working 
day of the pay-out. Such securities shall be transferred directly from the pool account 
of the TM/CM to the demat account of the respective client. 

 

4.2 With  regard  to  securities  that  have not  been  paid for  in full by  the clients  (unpaid 
securities), a separate client account titled – “client unpaid securities account” shall 
be  opened  by  the  TM/CM.  Unpaid  securities  shall  be  transferred  to  such  “client 
unpaid securities account” from the pool account of the concerned TM/CM.  

 

4.3 The securities kept in the ‘client unpaid securities account’ shall either be transferred 
to  the  demat  account  of  the  respective  client  upon  fulfilment  of  client’s  funds 
obligation or shall be disposed off in the market by TM/CM within five trading days 
after the pay-out. The unpaid securities shall be sold from the Unique Client Code 
(UCC)  of  the  respective  client.  Profit/loss  on  the  sale  transaction  of  the  unpaid 
securities, if any, shall be transferred to/adjusted from the respective client account.   

 

4.4 In case the clients’ securities are kept in the ‘client unpaid securities account’ beyond 
seven trading days after the pay-out, the depositories shall under their bye-laws levy 
appropriate  penalties  upon  such  TM/CM  which  shall  not  be  permitted  to  be 
recovered from the client. 
 

4.5 SEBI circular (on Comprehensive Review of Margin Trading Facility) dated June 13, 
2017 specifies that TM/CM shall maintain separate client wise ledger for funds and 
securities of clients availing  margin trading facility. Accordingly, the securities that 
are bought under Margin Trading Facility, shall be kept in a separate account titled 
as – ‘Client Margin Trading Securities Account’.   

 

4.6 Further  said  circular  on  Comprehensive  Review  of  Margin  Trading  Facility  also 

specifies that: 

 

a)  For the purpose of providing the margin trading facility, a stock broker may 
use  own funds  or  borrow  funds  from  scheduled  commercial  banks  and/or 
NBFCs regulated by RBI. A stock broker shall not be permitted to borrow 
funds from any other source.

b)  The  stock  broker  shall  not  use  the  funds  of  any  client  for  providing  
the  margin trading facility to another client, even if the same is authorized 
by the first client. 

 

the  above 

Also,  SEBI vide  Circular No. MRD/DOP/SE/Cir  – 11/2008 dated April 17, 2008 
had specified that client collateral/securities shall not be used for the purposes 
other than meeting client’s margin requirements/pay-in.  
 
Referencing 
stated  provisions,  TMs/CMs  are  pledging 
collateral/securities of the clients with the Banks/NBFCs to borrow funds to meet 
the  margin  requirement  of  the  clients/proprietary  obligation  which  is  not 
contemplated in the provisions of the aforesaid SEBI circular. In this regard, it is 
reiterated  that  the  client  securities  received  as  collateral  shall  be  used  only  for 
meeting the respective client’s margin requirement by way of depositing the same 
with Stock Exchange/ Clearing Corporation/ Clearing House. 
 

4.7 With  effect  from  September  01,  2019,  clients’  securities  lying  with  the  TM/CM  in 
“client  collateral  account”  ,  “Client  Margin  Trading  Securities  account”  and  “client 
unpaid securities account” cannot be pledged to the Banks/NBFCs for raising funds, 
even with authorization by client as the same would amount to fund based activity 
by TM/CM which is in contravention of Rule 8(1)(f) & 8(3)(f) of Securities Contracts 
(Regulation) Rules, 1957.  
 

4.8 Further,  the  client’s  securities  already    pledged  in  terms  of  clause  2.5  of  SEBI 
Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016  and

upon fulfilment of pay-in obligation or disposed off after giving notice of 5 days to the 
client.
