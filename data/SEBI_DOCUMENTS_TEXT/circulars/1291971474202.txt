To 
The Executive Director/Managing Director 
All Stock Exchanges 
  
 
Dear Sir / Madam, 

Subject: Change in affiliation of  Sub-brokers 
 
Regulation 11(2) of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992 stipulates 
that:  “No fresh certificate needs to be obtained under sub-regulation (1) where a sub-
broker merely changes his affiliation from one stock broker to another stock broker, 
being a member of the same stock exchange.”   
 
Though no fresh certificate needs to be obtained for change in affiliation, such a change may 
require approval from the Board.  

This circular intends to clarify the procedure to be adopted in case of change in affiliation by the 
sub-broker.  The  procedure  to  be  followed  and  the  documents  to  be  submitted  for  seeking 
approval for change in affiliation by the sub-brokers is specified in the table given below:
