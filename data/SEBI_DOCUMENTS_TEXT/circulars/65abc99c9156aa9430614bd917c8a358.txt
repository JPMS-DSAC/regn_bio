SMD/POLICY/CIR-20/97
August 12, 1997
 TO The Executive Director/President/Managing Director of all Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir,
This is with reference to the reporting of complaints against brokers by the stock exchanges. For monitoring the complaints redressal mechanism more effectively, it has been decided that stock exchanges shall send a Monthly Status Report of Complaints against Brokers in enclosed format instead of sending replies on a case to case basis. Reports on individual cases shall be given by stock exchanges as and when asked by SEBI separately.
The format for ‘Monthly report on redressal of investor grievances’ is segregated into three parts :
 Part A: Summary of total Complaints of last six months.
Part B: Summary of total Arbitration cases of last six months
Part C: Details of SEBI referred Complaints resolved during the month.
Part D: Details of SEBI referred Complaints pending more than 4 months with reasons.
This procedure shall be implemented immediately from the month of September 1997 and the Monthly status report should be sent before 5th of every month. These reports shall be sent by different Stock Exchanges to respective Regional Offices of SEBI. Stock Exchanges in Western Regional Office shall send this report to Head Office of SEBI.
Yours faithfully,  
O. P. GAHROTRA SENIOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT
Encl: as above
 
CC: a) Chairman’s Secretariat
b) All Executive Directors, Division Chiefs and Regional Managers of SEBI
