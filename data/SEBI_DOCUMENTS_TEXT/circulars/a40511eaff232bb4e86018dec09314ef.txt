To:
The President/Executive Director/ Managing Director of all Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir,
SEBI has prescribed that every stock exchange has to submit a monthly development report containing developments during that month. In addition to this, stock exchanges are now advised to submit a report to SEBI immediately whenever a substantial number of trading terminal of the members are deactivated due to any reason or pay-in/pay-out is extended beyond the scheduled date. This report should contain the reasons for the problem.
Yours faithfully,
