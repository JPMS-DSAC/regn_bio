PRESS RELEASE
Dated: May 6, 1994
 
Issued by : SECONDARY MARKET DEPARETMENT
TEXT
It may be recalled that the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) instituted an additional feature last year for enabling investors in the primary market to indicate details of their bank account and bank branch. This was intended to reduce the malpractice of theft of refund orders. It has been found that the response from the investors has been very good.
Considering the recurring thefts of dividend warrants/refund orders/ interest warrants, the Securities & Exchange Board of India has requested the companies to institute a procedure of requesting the shareholder to indicate his account number and bank branch so that the cheques /drafts/warrants sent to the shareholder include the details of his account number and the designated bank branch.
A letter in this regard has been issued by Chairman, SEBI to the various Association such as FICCI, ASSOCHAM, CII requesting them to urge their members to institute such procedure in the interest of the investors.
