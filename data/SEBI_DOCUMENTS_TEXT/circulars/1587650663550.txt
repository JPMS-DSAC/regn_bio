listed entities by market capitalization, due to the COVID –19 pandemic 
 
1.  Regulation 44(5) of the LODR requires top 100 listed entities by market capitalization to hold their 
Annual  General  Meeting  (AGM)  within  a  period  of  five  months  from  the  date  of  closing  of  the 
financial year. SEBI vide Circular dated March 26, 2020 (SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD1/CIR/P/2020/48) had 
relaxed this requirement by one month for listed entities whose financial year ends on March 31, 
2020. 

 

2.  Subsequently, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) vide Circular No.18/2020 dated April 21, 2020 
has clarified that “…if the companies whose financial year (other than the first financial year) has 
ended on December 31, 2019 hold their AGM for such financial year within a period of nine months 
from the closure of the financial year (i.e., by September 30, 2020), the same will not be treated as 
a violation.” 

 

3.  Accordingly, regulation 44(5) of the LODR is relaxed whereby the top 100 listed entities by market 
capitalization whose financial year ended on December 31, 2019 may hold their AGM within a period 
of nine months from the closure of the financial year (i.e., by September 30, 2020). 

 

4.  This Circular shall come into force with immediate effect. Stock Exchanges are advised to bring the 
provisions of this circular to the notice of all listed entities that have issued specified securities and 
also disseminate on their websites. 
  

5.  The Circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the Securities and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  read  with  Regulations  101  and  102  of  the  LODR  and  the 
relaxations  contained  herein are  subject to  the  provisions  of the  Companies  Act,  2013  and  rules 
made thereunder.
