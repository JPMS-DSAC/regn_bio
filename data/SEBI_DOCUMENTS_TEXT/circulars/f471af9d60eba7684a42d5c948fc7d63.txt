The President/Executive Director/Managing Director Of all the Stock Exchanges  
Dear Sir/Madam,
Sub:- Rolling settlement of shorter duration.
We have been receiving requests from the exchanges for the introduction of the rolling settlement at the exchanges of duration shorter than T+5. It is advised that the sub-group of the Group on Risk Management in the Equity Markets had considered the issue of the rolling settlement of a shorter duration and it was of the opinion that to begin with the stock exchanges should introduce the rolling settlement only on a T+5 basis.
Accordingly, the stock exchanges are advised that, to start with, the rolling settlement would be only on a T+5 basis. Rolling settlements of a shorter duration would be considered at a later date.  
Yours faithfully,    
P K Bindlish General Manager Secondary Market Depository, Research & Publications Department e-mail : pkb@sebi.gov.in
