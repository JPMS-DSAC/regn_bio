To,
All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ Custodians and AMFI/RAIN
Dear Sirs,
Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialized securities.
It was inter-alia decided at the meeting of the Working Group on dematerialisation of securities held on October 5, 1999 that effective from November 29, 1999, trading in 70 scrips (annexure 'C' to SEBI Press Release dated October 5, 1999) would be compulsory in dematerialized form for institutional investors and OCBs.
Some of the companies, whose scrips were included in the above list, could not sign agreement and establish connectivity with both the depositories well on time or are in the process of doing so. The effective date for compulsory trading in dematerialized form for these scrips would be announced at a later date.
It was, therefore, decided that effective from November 29, 1999, trading in 28 scrips (as per list enclosed) would be compulsory in dematerialized form for institutional investors and OCBs.
Yours faithfully,
