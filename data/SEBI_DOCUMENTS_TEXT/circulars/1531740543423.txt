Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
Subject:  Strengthening  the  Guidelines  and  Raising  Industry  standards  for 
RTAs, Issuer Companies and Banker to an Issue - Clarification  

1.  SEBI, vide circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP1/CIR/P/2018/73 dated April 20, 
2018, inter-alia, mandated RTAs to send a  letter  under  Registered / Speed  
post  seeking  PAN  and  bank details within  90  days  of  the said circular and 
two reminders thereof after the gap of 30 days. 

2.  In  this  regard  SEBI  has  received  several  representations  to  extend  the 
timelines of first letter so as to bunch it up with annual reports/notices of AGM. 
Further, clarifications have been sought to send the reminders by way of modes 
other than Registered / Speed post, citing huge cost involved and the efficacy 
of sending reminders by way of other modes; especially in cases where first 
letter sent by Registered / Speed Post returned undelivered.  

3.  Accordingly,  in  respect  of  para  II  (12)(ii)  of  Annexure  to  the  aforementioned 

circular, it is clarified that: 

a.  The  timeline  for  sending  the  initial  letter  by  Registered  /  Speed  Post  to 
physical shareholders has been extended to September 30, 2018 to enable 
companies  to  send  the  initial  letter  along  with  Annual  Reports/notice  of 
AGM. 

b.  Subsequently,  two  reminders  may  be  sent  by  other  modes  including 

ordinary post / courier. 

Yours faithfully,
