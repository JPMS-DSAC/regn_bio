30, 2014 that as per the FAQ published on the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

before  January  01,  2015, or  at  the  earliest,  in  order  to  avoid  withholding. The  FFIs 

who have registered but have not obtained a GIIN should indicate to the withholding 

agents that the GIIN is applied for. The FAQ published on the IRS website (updated 

as  on  December  22,  2014),  is  placed  as  Annexure  to  this  circular  and  is  also

Announcement  2014-38  provides

the 

in  substance.  Given 

Added: December 22, 2014 

for 

Announcement  2014-38  does  not 
change  the  requirement  in  the  chapter 
4  regulations  that  for  payments  made 
on or after January 1, 2015, in order for 
withholding  not  to  apply,  a  withholding 
agent  may  treat  a  reporting  Model  1 
FFI  as  a  registered  deemed-compliant 
FFI only if the withholding agent has a 
withholding  certificate  identifying  the 
registered  deemed-
payee  as  a 
the  withholding 
compliant  FFI  and 
certificate  contains  a  GIIN 
the 
payee  that  is  verified  in  the  manner 
described in those regulations. Thus, to 
avoid  withholding  on  certain  payments 
made  on  or  after  January  1,  2015,  a 
reporting  Model  1  FFI  should  register 
and obtain a GIIN to properly certify its 
status  to  a  withholding  agent  required 
to  document  the  FFI  for  chapter  4 
purposes. A reporting Model 1 FFI that 
has  registered  but  not  yet  obtained  a 
GIIN  should  indicate  to  its  withholding 
agent that its GIIN is "applied for," and 
in such case, the withholding agent will 
have 90 days from the date it receives 
the  Form  W-8  to  obtain  a  GIIN  and  to 
verify the accuracy of the GIIN against 
the  published  IRS  FII  list  before  it  has 
reason to know that the payee is not a 
registered deemed-compliant FFI. 

Announcement 2014-38 similarly does 
not change the timing of any other due 
diligence and reporting requirements in 
the chapter 4 regulations.
