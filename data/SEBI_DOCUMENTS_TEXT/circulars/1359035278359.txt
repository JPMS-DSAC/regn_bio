To  
 
All Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations 
 
Dear Sir / Madam,  
 

Sub: Guidelines for providing dedicated Debt Segment on Stock Exchanges. 

1.  The  market  for  debt  securities  differs  from  equity  markets  in  several  ways  such 
as risk, returns, liquidity, type of participants and method of trading. While publicly 
issued debt securities are listed, traded and settled in  a manner similar to equity, 
privately placed debt is usually traded between institutional investors on â€˜Over the 
Counter'  (OTC)  basis.  Such  OTC  transactions  are  mandatorily  reported  on 
reporting  platforms  at  FIMMDA,  BSE  and  NSE.  The  settlement  for  such 
transactions  is  different  from  that  in  equity  markets  or  publicly  issued  debt 
securities.  
 

2.  Whereas the equity markets in India offer trading infrastructure comparable to the 
best available globally, the debt markets lack such infrastructure. In order to cater 
to  the  unique  characteristics  of  debt  markets,  it  has  been  decided  to  provide 
dedicated a debt segment on the stock exchanges. 
 

3.  The  debt  segment  shall  offer  separate  trading,  clearing,  settlement,  reporting 

facilities and membership to deal in : 
(i)  "debt securities" as defined in Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue 

and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008; 

(ii)  Government  Securities,  Treasury  Bills,  State  Government  loans,  SLR  and 
Non-SLR Bonds issued by Financial Institutions, municipal bonds, single bond 
repos,  basket  repos  and  CBLO  kind  of  products  subject  to  RBI  approval, 
where required; 

(iii) Securitized  debt  instruments  as  defined  in  SEBI  (Public  Offer  and  Listing  of 

Securitised Debt Instruments)Regulations, 2008; 

(iv)  any  other  debt  instruments  as  may  be  specified  from  time  to  time  by  the 

competent authority. 

 

4.  An  existing  stock  exchange  or  new  stock  exchange  desirous  of  setting  up  debt 
segment may make an application to SEBI, providing operational, regulatory and 
any other necessary details.
