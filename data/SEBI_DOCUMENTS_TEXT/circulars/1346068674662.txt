Dear Sir,

of  retail  investors.  With  a  view  to  achieve  wider  financial  inclusion,  encourage 
holding  of  demat  accounts  and  to  reduce  the  cost  of  maintaining  securities  in 
demat  accounts  for  retail  individual  investors,  it  has  been  decided  that  all 
depository  participants  (DPs)  shall  make  available  a  "Basic  Services  Demat 
Account" (BSDA) with limited services as per terms specified herein. 
 

2.  Eligibility:    Individuals  shall  be  eligible  to  opt  for  BSDA  subject  to  the  following 

conditions-

where they are the sole or first holder.  

b.  Individuals having any other demat account/s where they are not the first 
holder  shall  be  eligible  for  BSDA  in  respect  of  the  single  demat  account 
where they are sole or first holder.

BSDA  on  the  date  of  the  next  billing  cycle  based  on  value  of  holding  of
