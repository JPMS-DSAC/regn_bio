Subject: Reporting for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) 

applications and systems offered and used by Mutual Funds 

Dear Sir / Madam,  

Background 

1.  There  is  increasing  usage  of  AI  (Artificial  Intelligence)  and  ML  (Machine 
Learning) as product offerings by market intermediaries and participants (e.g.: 
“robo advisors”) in investor and consumer facing products. SEBI is conducting 
a  survey  and  creating  an  inventory  of  the  AI  /  ML  landscape  in  the  Indian 
financial  markets  to  gain  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the  adoption  of  such 
technologies  in  the  markets  and  to  ensure  preparedness  for  any  AI  /  ML 
policies that may arise in the future. 
 

2.  As most AI / ML systems are black boxes and their behavior cannot be easily 
quantified, it is imperative to ensure that any advertised financial benefit owing 
to  these  technologies  in  investor  facing  financial  products  offered  by 
intermediaries should not constitute to misrepresentation.

Scope definition 

3.  Any set of applications / software / programs / executable / systems (computer 

systems) – cumulatively called application and systems,  

a.  that are offered to investors (individuals and institutions) or used internally by 

Mutual Funds to facilitate investing and trading or for any other purpose,  

OR 

b.  to disseminate investments strategies and advice,  

c.  to carry out compliance / operations / activities, 

OR 

where  AI  /  ML  is  portrayed  as  a  part  of  the  public  product  offering  or  under 
usage for compliance or management purposes, is included in the scope of this 
circular.  Here,  “AI”  /  “ML”  refers  to  the  terms  “Artificial  Intelligence”  and 
“Machine Learning” used as a part of the product offerings. In order to make 
the scope of this circular inclusive of various AI and ML technologies in use, 
the scope also covers Fin-Tech and Reg-Tech initiatives undertaken by market 
participants that involves AI and ML. 

4.  Technologies that are considered to be categorized as AI and ML technologies 

in the scope of this circular, are explained in Annexure B.

in Annexure B, should participate in the reporting process by completing the 
AI / ML reporting form (see Annexure A). 

6.  With effect from quarter ending June 2019, registered Mutual Funds using AI / 
ML based application or system as defined in Annexure B, are required to fill 
in the form (Annexure A) and make submissions on quarterly basis within 15 
calendar days of the expiry of the quarter to AMFI. 

7.  AMFI  shall  consolidate  the  information  on  AI  /  ML  applications  and  systems 
reported  by  Mutual  Funds on  quarterly  basis  and  submit  to SEBI  at  email  id 
AIML_MF@sebi.gov.in  within  30  calendar  days  of  the  expiry  of  the  quarter,

Annexure B – Systems deemed to be based on AI and ML technology 
 
Applications  and  Systems  belonging  but  not  limited  to  following  categories  or  a 
combination of these:  
 

1.  Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis or text mining systems that 
gather  intelligence  from  unstructured  data.  –  In  this  case,  Voice  to  text,  text  to 
intelligence systems in any natural language will be considered in scope.  E.g.: robo 
chat bots, big data intelligence gathering systems. 

2.  Neural Networks or a modified form of it.  – In this case, any systems that uses a 
number of nodes (physical or software simulated nodes) mimicking natural neural 
networks of any scale, so as to carry out learning from previous firing of the nodes 
will  be  considered  in  scope.  E.g.:  Recurrent  Neural  networks  and  Deep  learning 
Neural Networks. 

3.  Machine  learning  through  supervised,  unsupervised  learning  or  a  combination  of 
both.  –  In  this  case,  any  application  or  systems  that  carry  out  knowledge 
representation  to  form  a  knowledge  base  of  domain,  by  learning  and  creating  its 
outputs  with  real  world  input  data  and  deciding  future  outputs  based  upon  the 
knowledge  base.  E.g.:  System  based  on  Decision  tree,  random  forest,    K  mean, 
Markov decision process, Gradient boosting Algorithms. 

4.  A system that uses statistical heuristics method instead of procedural algorithms or 
the system / application applies clustering or categorization algorithms to categorize 
data without a predefined set of categories. 

5.  A system that uses a feedback mechanism to improve its parameters and bases it 

subsequent execution steps on these parameters. 

6.  A system that does knowledge representation and maintains a knowledge base.
