Dear Sir/ Madam,

Subject: Facility for Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA) 

1.  SEBI  vide  circular  no.  CIR/MRD/DP/22/2012  dated  August  27,  2012  had 
introduced  the  facility  of  “Basic  Services  Demat  Account”  (BSDA)  with  limited 
services  for  eligible  individuals  with  the  objective  of  achieving  wider  financial 
inclusion and to encourage holding of demat accounts. 

2.  Further, vide the aforesaid circular, the Depository Participants (DPs) were advised 
to  provide  an  option  to  all  the  existing  eligible  individuals  to  convert  their  demat 
account into BSDA. So far, few demat accounts have actually been converted into 
BSDA during the last three years despite large number of demat accounts being 
eligible for conversion into BSDA. 

3.  In order to facilitate the eligible individuals to avail the benefits of BSDA, DPs are 
advised  to  convert  all  such  eligible  demat  accounts  into  BSDA  unless  such 
Beneficial Owners (BOs) specifically opt to continue to avail the facility of a regular 
demat account. 

4.  The DPs shall assess the eligibility of the BOs at the end of the current billing cycle 

and convert eligible demat accounts into BSDA. 

5.  The Depositories are advised to:- 

 
a)  make  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules  and  regulations  for  the 

implementation of the above decision as may be applicable / necessary; and 

b)  communicate  to  SEBI,  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  this 

circular by the DPs in the Monthly Development Report.
