Annex 1 

Procedure under Regulation 33(8) of SEBI LODR Regulations with 

respect to listed entities/companies 

 

1.  OBJECTIVE AND CLARIFICATIONS 

a.  The objective of this Procedure is to ensure that the statutory auditors 
undertaking the audit / review of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
/ Results of the Parent Company obtain desired information as required 
under the Standard on Auditing (SA) 600, "Using the Work of Another 
Auditor"  and  the  Guidance  Note  (GN)  on  Audit  of  Consolidated 
Financial  Statements  (Revised  2016)  issued  by  the  Institute  of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) in order to rely on the work of the 
auditors  of  the  Financial  Statements  /  Results  /  Information  of  the 
Components, while forming and expressing an opinion / conclusion, as 
applicable, on the Consolidated Financial Statements / Results of the 
Parent Company under Regulation 33(8) of SEBI LODR Regulations. 

However, the audit and limited review of the respective Components 
that are being consolidated with the Parent Company shall continue to 
be undertaken by the respective auditors of such Components. 
 

b.  The procedure is applicable for Listed Entities in the case of review of 
the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  /  Results  of  the  Parent 
Company prepared in accordance with the requirements of: 
(i) 

Indian  Accounting  Standards  (Ind  AS),    [namely,  Ind  AS  110: 
Consolidated Financial Statements,  Ind AS 28: Investments in 
Associates  and  Joint  Ventures  and 
Ind  AS  111:Joint 
Arrangements] or  

(ii) 

Accounting  Standards  (AS),  [namely,  AS  21:  Consolidated 
Financial  Statements,  AS  23:  Accounting  for  Investments  in 
Associates  in  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  AS  27: 
Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures]. 

c.  The procedure does not alter the requirements of limited review or audit 
of the Standalone / Consolidated Financial Statements/Results of the 
Parent Company and/or the Standalone Financial Statements/Results 
of the Components. The requirement for review / audit of the financial 
Statements  /  results  as  mandated  by  regulations  33(1)  and  33(3), 
continues to exist. Accordingly, the Parent Company could opt to either 
get the Consolidated Statements / Results subjected to limited review 
or audit by their auditors.

2.  AUDIT  /  REVIEW  OF  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  / 

RESULTS 

a.  Compliance with Mandatory SAs / SREs / GNs issued by ICAI 

The audit / review of Consolidated Financial Statement / Results should 
be conducted in accordance with the mandatory Standards on Auditing 
(SA)  /  Standards  on  Review  Engagements  (SRE),  Guidance  Notes 
(GN), as applicable, issued by the ICAI. 
 
In this regard, the audit of Consolidated Financial Statements/Results 
should be conducted in accordance with the Standard on Auditing (SA) 
600, "Using the Work of Another Auditor" (hereinafter referred to as SA 
600) and the Guidance Note (GN) on Audit of Consolidated Financial 
Statements (Revised 2016) (hereinafter referred to as GN CFS) issued 
by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (ICAI)  and  other 
guidance/guidelines of the ICAI. The review of Consolidated Financial 
Statements  /  Results  should  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the 
Standard  on  Review  Engagements  (SRE)  issued  for  the  purpose  by 
the ICAI, also to be read in conjunction with SA 600 and GN on CFS.  

b.  Procedures under SA 600, SRE 2400/2410 and GN on CFS 

The Principal Auditor i.e. the auditor of the parent listed  entity should 
plan  and  perform  an  audit  to  obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit 
evidence  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements / Results. In an audit of Consolidated Financial Statements 
/  Results,  the  principal  auditor  (as  defined  in  SA  600)  is  required  to 
perform various procedures in accordance with SA 600 and GN on CFS 
issued by the ICAI. 
 
The  Principal  Auditor  should  plan  and  perform  the  review  to  obtain 
moderate  assurance  as  to  whether  the  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements  /  Results  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  A  review  is 
limited  primarily  to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical 
procedures, applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance 
than  an  audit.  In  an  engagement  to  review  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements / Results also, the Principal Auditor should comply with the 
requirements of SA 600, SRE 2400/2410 and GN on CFS, as may be 
applicable.

c.  Procedure 

Pursuant to (a) and (b) above, the principal auditor (that is, the Parent 
Company's Auditor) shall, inter alia, consider the following procedures, 
as  applicable,  with  respect  to  the  audit  /  review  of  the  Consolidated 
Financial Statements/Results: 

(Note:  These  procedures  are  not  to  be  construed  as  being  complete  and 

comprehensive and are not a replacement or a substitute to the requirements detailed 

in the relevant Standards on Auditing / Standards on Review Engagements/Guidance 

Notes and must, therefore, not be read on a standalone basis) 
 
i.  Obtain an understanding of the consolidation process followed by 
the  Parent  Company  Management,  including  the  instructions 
issued by the Parent Company Management to Components. 

ii.  Discuss with the other auditor or Component Management those 
of  the  Component’s  business  activities  that  are  significant  to  the 
group and identify Components that are likely to be Significant (See 
Explanatory  Note  below)  and  Non-significant  and  develop  an 
overall Consolidated Financial Statements/ Results audit / review 
plan. 

 

(Explanatory  Note:  The  principal  auditor  will  determine  Significant  Components. 

Such  determination  should  be  made  by  the  principal  auditor  based  upon  their 

understanding  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements, 

materiality  and  exercise  of  professional  judgment.  However,  as  a  minimum, 

Significant  Components  selected  by  the  principal  auditor  would  represent  those 

Components  which  together  with  the  Parent  Company  would  in  the  aggregate 

represent  at  least  eighty  percent  of  each  of  the  consolidated  revenue,  assets  and 

profits.) 

 
iii.  Determine 

for 

the  materiality 

the  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements  /  Results  as  a  whole  when  establishing  the  overall 
Consolidated Financial Statements / Results audit / review plan as 
well  as  determine  whether  the  component's  financial  statements 
are material to the group to determine whether they should scope 
in  additional  components,  and  consider  using  the  work  of  other 
auditors (that is, the Component Auditors), as applicable. 
 

iv.  When  planning  to  use  the  work  of  another  auditor,  the  principal 
auditor  shall  consider  the  professional  competence  of  the  other 
auditor in the context of the specific assignment, if the other auditor 
is not a member of the ICAI –SA 600 Para 11.

v.  Determine  the  nature,  timing  and  extent  of  the  procedures  to  be 
performed by the principal auditor. The principal auditor shall also 
perform procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, 
that  the  work  of  the  other  auditor  is  adequate  for  the  principal 
auditor's purposes, in the context of the specific assignment. 

vi.  Design and perform audit / review procedures on the Consolidated

considerations relating to the consolidation process. 

/  Results  arising 

vii.  When  considered  necessary  by  the  principal  auditor,  he  may 
require  the  other  auditor  to  answer  a  detailed  questionnaire 
regarding  matters  on  which 
the  principal  auditor  requires 
information  for  discharging  his  duties.  The  other  auditor  should 
respond to such questionnaire on a timely basis. 

viii. While the principal auditor should consider the significant findings 
of the other auditor, he may consider it appropriate to discuss with 
the other auditor and the management of the component, the audit 
findings or other matters affecting the financial information of the 
components.  He  may  also  decide  that  supplemental  tests  of  the 
records  or  the  financial  statements  of  the  component  are 
necessary. Such tests may, depending upon the circumstances, be 
performed by the principal auditor or the other auditor. 

ix.  When the principal auditor concludes that the financial information 
of a component is immaterial, the procedures outlined in SA 600 
do not apply. When several components, immaterial in themselves, 
are together material in relation to the financial information of the 
entity  as  a  whole,  the  procedures  outlined  in  SA  600  should  be 
considered. 

x.  Obtain  Management  Representations  including  those  relating  to 

the Consolidated Financial Statements / Results. 

xi.  Evaluate and consider all Reporting Considerations including those 

communicated by the other auditors, 

xii.  Include in the audit / review documentation, the matters specified 

in SA 600 Para 18.

on our review.

We  conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  A  review  is  limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data 
and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not  performed  an  audit  and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

 

Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

Auditor’s  Report  On  Quarterly  Financial  Results  and  Year  to  Date  Results  of  the  Company 
Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
......................... 

We have audited the quarterly financial results of ……… (Name of the company) for the quarter 
ended  …………………  (date  of  the  quarter  end)  and  the  year  to  date  results  for  the  period 
…………  to  …………,  attached  herewith,  being  submitted  by  the  company  pursuant  to  the 
requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015. These quarterly financial results as well as the year to date financial results 
have been prepared on the basis of the interim financial statements, which are the responsibility 
of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
results based on our audit of such interim financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34 (Ind AS 34)for Interim Financial Reporting, prescribed, under Section 133 of the 
Companies  Act,  2013  read  with  relevant  rules  issued  thereunder;  or  by  the  Institute  of 
Chartered  Accountants  of  India2,  as  applicable  and  other  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted in India. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in India. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about  whether  the  financial  results  are  free  of  material  misstatement(s).  An  audit  includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts disclosed as financial results. An 
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us 
these quarterly financial results as well as the year to date results:

Exhibit C3: Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Review of Consolidated Unaudited 
Quarterly  and  Year  to  date  Financial  Results  for  companies  (other  than  banks  and 
insurance companies) 
 
Independent  Auditor’s  Review  Report  On  consolidated unaudited  quarterly  and  year  to  date 
financial results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
............................... 
 
1.  We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  Statement  of  Consolidated  Unaudited  Financial 
Results of ......... (“the Parent”)  and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together 
referred  to  as  “the  Group”),    and  its  share  of  the  net  profit/(loss)  after  tax  and  total 
comprehensive  income  /  loss  of  its  associates  and  joint  ventures  for  the  quarter  ended 
________ and for the period from_____ to______ (“the Statement”), being submitted by 
the Parent pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended5. Attention is drawn to the 
fact  that  the  consolidated  figures  for  the  corresponding  quarter  ended  ____  and  the 
corresponding period from_____to______, as reported in these financial results have been 
approved by the Parent’s Board of Directors, but have not been subjected to review6. 
 

2.  This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s Management and approved by 
the Parent’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement  principles  laid  down  in  Indian  Accounting  Standard  34  “Interim  Financial 
Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 

3.  We conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we  would  become  aware  of  all  significant  matters  that  might  be  identified  in  an  audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

 

We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation  33  (8)  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the extent applicable. 

 
4.  The  Statement  includes  the  results  of  the  following  entities:  (indicate  list  of  entities 
included  in  the  consolidation  similar  to  the  requirement  for  audited  consolidated 
results) 
 

5.  Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above 
and  based  on  the  consideration  of  the  review  reports  of  the  branch  auditors  and  other 
auditors referred to in paragraph 7 below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 

                                                 
5 Regulations includes relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time to time. 
6  As  applicable  (for  example,  in  the  first  financial  year  of  a  newly  listed  company,  or  when  consolidated  quarterly 
financial results are submitted for the first time pursuant to the mandatory requirement with effect from April 1, 2019, 
and no quarterly consolidated financial results were submitted in the previous year).

Exhibit C4: When an Unmodified Opinion is expressed on consolidated audited quarterly 
and  year  to  date  financial  results  for  companies  (other  than  banks  and  insurance 
companies) 
 
Auditor’s  Report  On  consolidated  audited  quarterly  and  year  to  date  financial  results  of  the 
Company  Pursuant  to  the  Regulation  33  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
........................ 
 
1.  We  have  audited  the  accompanying  Statement  of  Consolidated  Financial  Results  of             

 

 

.......... (“the Parent”) and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred 
to as  “the  Group”)  and  its  share of  the net  profit/(loss)  after  tax  and  total  comprehensive 
income / loss of its associates and joint ventures for the quarter ended ________ and for 
the period from_____ to______  (“the Statement”), being submitted by the Parent pursuant 
to  the  requirement  of  Regulation  33  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2015,  as  amended18.  Attention  is  drawn  to  the  fact  that  the 
consolidated  figures  for  the  corresponding  quarter  ended  ____  and  the  corresponding 
period from______to______, as reported in these financial results have been approved by 
the Parent’s Board of Directors, but have not been subjected to audit/review19. 
 

2.  This Statement, which is the responsibility of the  Parent’s Management and approved by 
the  Parent’s  Board of Directors, has been compiled from the related  interim consolidated 
financial statements/ interim consolidated financial information which has been prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”),prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies  Act,  2013,  and  other  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  India.  Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Statement based on our audit of such interim 
consolidated financial statements/ interim consolidated financial information.   
 

3.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  on  Auditing  specified  under 
Section 143(10) of the Companies Act 2013. Those Standards require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
the  disclosures  in  the  Statement.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, 
whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers 
internal control relevant to the Parent’s preparation and fair presentation of the Statement 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  Parent’s  internal  financial  control  with 
reference to the Statement. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the 
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement. 
 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation  33  (8)  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the extent applicable. 

 

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the 
branch auditors and other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 6 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
 

                                                 
18 Regulations includes relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time to time. 
19  As  applicable  (for  example,  in  the  first  financial  year  of  a  newly  listed  company,  or  when  consolidated  quarterly 
financial results are submitted for the first time pursuant to the mandatory requirement with effect from April 1, 2019, 
and no quarterly consolidated financial results were submitted in the previous year).

whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers 
internal control relevant to the Parent’s preparation and fair presentation of the Statement 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  Parent’s  internal  financial  control  with 
reference to the Statement. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness  of the 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the 
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement. 
 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation  33  (8)  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the extent applicable. 

 

4. 

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the 
branch auditors and other  auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 6 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to 
us, and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial 
statements  and  the  other  financial  information  of  branches  and  joint  operations  of  the 

                                                 
31Regulations includes relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time to time. 
32 As applicable (for example, in the first financial year of a newly listed company, or when consolidated quarterly 
financial results are submitted for the first time pursuant to the mandatory requirement with effect from April 1, 2019, 
and no quarterly consolidated financial results were submitted in the previous year).

Exhibit B1: Format for the Limited Review Report for banks for unaudited standalone 

quarterly and year to date results 

Review report to.................... 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of ____ (Name 
of  the  Company)  for  the  period  ended  ____.  This  statement  is  the  responsibility  of  the 
Company’s Management and has been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility 
is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. 
 
We  conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  A  review  is  limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data 
and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not  performed  an  audit  and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
In the conduct of our Review we have relied on the review reports in respect of non-performing 
assets received from concurrent auditors of _________ branches, inspection teams of the bank 
of _______ branches and other firms of auditors of _________ branches specifically appointed 
for this purpose. These review reports cover ______ percent of the advances portfolio of the 
bank. Apart from these review reports, in the conduct of our review, we have also relied upon 
various returns received from the branches of the bank. 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement or that it has not been 
prepared in accordance with the relevant prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India 
in respect of income recognition, asset classification, provisioning and other related matters.

Exhibit B2: When an Unmodified Opinion is expressed on the Audited Quarterly and year 
to date Financial Results (for Banks) 
 
Auditor’s  Report  On  Quarterly  Financial  Results  and  Year  to  Date  Results  of  the  Company 
Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
.................... 
 
We have audited the quarterly financial results of ………………… (Name of the bank) for the 
quarter ended ………………………. (date of the quarter end) and the year to date results for 
the  period  …………….  to  …………………,  attached  herewith,  being  submitted  by  the  bank 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015. These quarterly financial results as well as the year to date 
financial  results  have  been  prepared  from  interim  financial  statements,  which  are  the 
responsibility of the bank’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial  results  based  on  our  audit  of  such  interim  financial  statements,  which  have  been 
prepared  in  accordance  with  the  recognition  and  measurement  principles  laid  down  in 
Accounting Standard 25 / Indian Accounting Standard 34 (AS 25/ Ind AS 34 – Interim Financial 
Reporting) mandated under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder or by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India1 and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India.  
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in India. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about  whether  the  financial  results  are  free  of  material  misstatement(s).  An  audit  includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts disclosed as financial results. An 
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 
These financial results incorporate the relevant returns of _______(number) branches audited 
by  us, _________ (number) branches including _______ (number) foreign branches audited 
by the other auditors specially appointed for this purpose and unaudited returns in respect of 
_________ (number) branches. In conduct of our audit, we have taken note of the reports in 
respect of non-performing assets received from the concurrent auditors of ________ (number) 
branches, inspection teams of banks of ________ (number) branches specifically appointed for 
this purpose. These reports cover ______ percent of advances portfolio of the Bank.  
 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us 
these quarterly financial results as well as the year to date results: 

i.

have been presented in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI

Exhibit B3: Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Review of Consolidated Unaudited 
Quarterly and Year to date Financial Results (for banks as per AS) 
 
Independent  Auditor’s  Review  Report  On  consolidated unaudited  quarterly  and  year  to  date 
financial results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
...................... 
 
1.  We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  Statement  of  Consolidated  Unaudited  Financial 
Results  of  ...............  (“the  Parent”/”the  Bank”)    and  its  subsidiaries  (the  Parent  and  its 
subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”),  its jointly controlled entities   and its share 
of the net profit/(loss) after tax of its associates for the quarter ended ________ and for the 
period from_____ to______ (“the Statement”), being submitted by the Parent pursuant to 
the  requirement  of  Regulation  33  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2015,  as  amended41,  except  for  the  disclosures  relating  to 
consolidated  Pillar  3  disclosure  as  at  _________,  including  leverage  ratio  and  liquidity 
coverage ratio under Basel III Capital Regulations as have been disclosed on the Bank's 
website and in respect of which a link has been provided in the Statement and have not 
been  reviewed  by  us.  Attention  is  drawn  to the  fact  that  the  consolidated figures  for  the 
corresponding quarter ended ____ and the corresponding period from_____to______, as 
reported in these financial results have been approved by the Parent’s Board of Directors, 
but have not been subjected to review.42 
 

2.  This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s Management and approved by 
the Parent’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Accounting Standard 25 “Interim Financial Reporting” 
(“AS  25”),  prescribed  under  Section  133  of  the  Companies  Act,  201343,  the  relevant 
provisions  of  the  Banking  Regulation  Act,  1949,  the  circulars,  guidelines  and  directions 
issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time (“RBI Guidelines”) and other 
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  India.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 

 
3.  We conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we  would  become  aware  of  all  significant  matters  that  might  be  identified  in  an  audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

 

We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation  33  (8)  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the extent applicable. 

 
4.  The  Statement  includes  the  results  of  the  following  entities:  (indicate  list  of  entities 
included  in  the  consolidation  similar  to  the  requirement  for  audited  consolidated 
results) 

 
5.  Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above 
and  based  on  the  consideration  of  the  review  reports  of  the  branch  auditors  and  other 
auditors referred to in paragraph 7 below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 

                                                 
41 Regulations includes relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time to time.  
42  As  applicable  (for  example,  in  the  first  financial  year  of  a  newly  listed  company,  or  when  consolidated  quarterly 
financial results are submitted for the first time pursuant to the mandatory requirement with effect from April 1,  2019, 
and no quarterly consolidated financial results were submitted in the previous year). 
43 In case of nationalised banks, the reference of   Institute of Chartered Accountants of India be suitably specified in 
lieu of the reference of The Companies Act, 2013.

whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
the  disclosures  in  the  Statement.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, 
whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers 
internal control relevant to the Parent’s preparation and fair presentation of the Statement 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  Parent’s  internal  financial  control  with 
reference to the Statement. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the 
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement.
