Review Report to ……………………. 
 
We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  of 
…………………………….. (Name of the Issuer) for the period ended …………….., except 
for  the  disclosures  regarding  „Public  Shareholding‟  and  „Promoter  and  Promoter  Group 
Shareholding‟  which  have  been  traced  from  disclosures  made  by  the  management  and 
have  not  been  audited  by  us.    This  statement  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Issuer‟s 
Management  and  has  been  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors/  committee  of  Board  of 
Directors  of  the  Issuer.  Our  responsibility  is  to  issue  a  report  on  these  financial 
statements based on our review. 
 
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagement 
(SRE)  2400,  Engagements  to  Review  Financial  Statements  issued  by  the  Institute  of 
Chartered  Accountants  of  India.  This  standard  requires  that  we  plan  and  perform  the 
review  to  obtain  moderate  assurance  as  to  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of 
material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of  Issuer‟s personnel and 
analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an 
audit.  We  have  not  performed  an  audit  and  accordingly,  we  do  not  express  an  audit 
opinion. 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in 
accordance  with  applicable  accounting  standards1  and  other  recognised  accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms 
of Clause 43 of the Listing Agreement including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement.

as  the  year  to  date  financial  results  have  been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  interim 
financial  statements,  which  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Issuer‟s  management.    Our 
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  financial  results  based  on  our  audit  of

assurance  about  whether  the  financial  results  are  free  of  material  misstatement(s).    An

significant  estimates  made  by  management.    We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.
