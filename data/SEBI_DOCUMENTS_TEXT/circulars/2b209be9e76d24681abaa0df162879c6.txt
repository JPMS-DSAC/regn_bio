SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT Mittal Court, B Wing, First Floor, 224, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021
SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-14/2001 March 08,  2001
To,
All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ Custodians and AMFI/RAIN
Dear Sirs,
Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised  securities
Please refer to our earlier circular no.  SMDRP/Policy/Cir-49/2000 dated October 16, 2000 advising that there should be a  time gap of three months between the date for establishing connectivity by the  companies with both the depositories and the date of commencement of compulsory  dematerialised trading. It was further advised that the date announced for  compulsory dematerialised trading for the scrips as per SEBI circular no.  SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-23/2000 dated May 29, 2000 would henceforth be treated as the  date by which the company should establish connectivity with both the  depositories. The compulsory dematerialized trading in these companies will  commence after three month from that date. It was also mentioned in the circular  that the companies which fail to establish connectivity with both the  depositories on the scheduled date would be traded only on the 'trade for trade'  settlement window of the exchanges from the following settlement period.
In accordance with the aforementioned circulars dated May 29,  2000 and October 16, 2000, out of the 275 scrips required to establish  connectivity with both the depositories by February 26, 2001, 126 companies have  now established connectivity. These 126 scrips (Serial No. 1 to  126 of annexure 'A') would be traded compulsorily in dematerialized form by  all investors with effect from May 28, 2001. The 146 scrips (Serial No. 127 to 272 of annexure 'A') which have not  established connectivity would be traded only on "trade for trade" segment of  the stock exchanges, from the settlement period commencing on or immediately  after March 19, 2001.
Currently scrips of 566 companies have been included for  trading only on 'trade for trade' settlement window of the exchanges. Out of  these, 77 companies (Serial Nos. 273 to 349 of annexure  'A') have established connectivity with both the depositories. These scrips  shall be traded on the normal trading segment where deliveries can be made  either in physical or dematerialised form with effect from March 26, 2001 and  compulsorily in dematerialised form 3 months after that date i.e. from June 25,  2001.
Yours faithfully,
P. K. KURIACHEN DEPUTY GENERAL  MANAGER SECONDARY MARKET, DEPOSITORIES, RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS DEPARTMENT
