To,
The Presidents/Executive Directors/Managing Directors All Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir,
Registration of Brokers
In terms of provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 SEBI issues Certificate of Registration to stock brokers.
In the case of transfer of membership (including conversion to Corporate membership), while forwarding the application for registration, it is observed that in certain cases registration could not be granted within a reasonable time for non-payment of registration fee by the transferor. Stock Exchanges are advised to verify the fee remittance record of the transferor member (including that related to transactions done in the year in which the membership is transferred) and furnish the information with the registration application in the enclosed format.
Thanking you,
Yours faithfully, sd/-
