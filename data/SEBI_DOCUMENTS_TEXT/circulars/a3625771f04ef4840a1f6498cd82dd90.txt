Dear Sir/s, 
Sub: Designated e-mail ID for regulatory communication with SEBI
 
SEBI has been communicating with the registered market intermediaries, stock exchanges and depositories etc. through circulars, letters, directions etc. SEBI has already put in place a system for issuance of digitally signed circulars with respect to stock exchanges, depositories and merchant bankers. 
 
In line with the above, it has been decided to extend the system of issuance of digitally signed circulars to all other registered intermediaries. 
 
In order to facilitate the above, all registered intermediaries are required to create a designated email id for regulatory communications. This email id shall be an exclusive email id only for the above purpose and should not be a person centric email id.
 
The Designated e-mail ID shall be communicated to SEBI at intermediary@sebi.gov.in as per the format prescribed at Annexure A, latest  by July 10, 2008. 
 
 Yours faithfully,
MANOJ  KUMAR
