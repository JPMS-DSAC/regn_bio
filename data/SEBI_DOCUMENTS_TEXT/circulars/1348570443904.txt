Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub: Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) 
 

 

                     September 25, 2012 

1.  ASBA  facility  was  introduced  by  SEBI  in  July  2008,  as  an  alternative  mode  of 
payment in the public/rights issue processes. In its continuing endeavour to make 
the  facility  more  efficient, SEBI reviewed  the  facility  on  a  continuous  basis  and 
following reforms were introduced:

2.  The  Hon'ble  Finance  Minister,  while  presenting  Union  Budget  2012-13 
announced,  inter  alia,  his  intention  of  simplifying  the  process  of  Initial  Public 
Offers  (IPOs),  lowering  capital  raising  cost  and  helping  companies  reach  more 
retail investors in small towns.  
 

3.  Based on the analysis of the current presence of ASBA facility, it is felt that there is 
substantial scope for increasing the reach of ASBA facility to make the application 
process more convenient for investors.  
 

4.  Towards this end, consultations were held with Reserve Bank of India, Indian Banks’ 
Association  and  other  market  participants,  to  explore  the  possibility  of  providing 
ASBA facility at all branches of Self Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs).
