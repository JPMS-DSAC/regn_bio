Act,  1963.  In  this  regard  upon  consideration  of  various  representations 
received  by  SEBI  and  pursuant 
the 
representatives  of  stock  exchanges,  it  has  been  decided  that  the  limitation 
period,  as modified  to  three  years  in  terms of  Limitation  Act,  1963,  shall be

For  cases  filed  earlier  and  rejected  on  the  ground  of  bar  of 
limitation  as  per  the  earlier  limitation  period  of  six  months,  the 
amount of fee already paid would be deducted from the amount 
computed in terms of SEBI circulars dated August 11, 2010 and 
August 31, 2010. The balance shall be borne by the parties to 
the arbitration in the manner specified vide SEBI circulars dated 
August 11, 2010 and August 31, 2010.
