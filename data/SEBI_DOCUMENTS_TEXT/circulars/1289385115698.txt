the holders of the existing securities of the company, as the case may be, with 
the  designated  stock  exchange.  This  amount  was  being  released  to  issuer 
companies  after  obtaining  a  No  Objection  Certificate  (NOC)  from  SEBI  in 
accordance with the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000. 
Since  these  Guidelines  have  now  been  rescinded,  the  NOC  will  be  issued

application  on  its  letter  head  addressed  to  SEBI  in  the  format  specified  in

the  last  to  permit  listing.  The  application  shall  be  filed  by  the  post  issue  lead 
merchant banker with the concerned designated office of SEBI under which the 
registered office of the issuer company falls, as specified in Annexure – B. On the 
date  of  application,  the  bank  guarantees,  if  any,  included  in  1%  deposit  must 
have a residual validity of at least 2 months.  
 
3. SEBI shall issue the NOC after satisfying itself that the complaints arising from 
the  issue  received  by  SEBI  against  the  Company  have  been  resolved  to  its 
satisfaction, the Company has been submitting monthly Action Taken Reports on 
the complaints forwarded by SEBI to the company as per the proforma specified 
in  Annexure  –  C,  and  the  fees  due  to  intermediaries  associated  with  the  issue 
process including ASBA Banks have been paid.

conditions.
