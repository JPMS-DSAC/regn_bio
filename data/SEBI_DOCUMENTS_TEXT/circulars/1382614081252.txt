In order to facilitate capital raising by small and medium enterprises including start-

and  trading  of  specified  securities  of  small  and  medium  enterprises(SMEs) 
including  start-up  companies  on  Institutional  Trading  Platform  (ITP)  in  SME 
Exchanges. 

The legal framework for such listing and trading of the specified securities on the 
ITP  was  laid  down  vide  SEBI  (Listing  of  Specified  Securities  on  Institutional 
Trading Platform) Regulations, 2013(ITP Regulations) vide Gazette notification No. 
LAD-NRO/GN/2013-14/27/6720  dated  October  08,  2013.  In  this  regard,  through 
said ITP Regulations, necessary amendments have been made in the SEBI (Issue 
of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2009 (ICDR Regulations) by 
inserting  a  "Chapter  XC"  on  "Listing  and  Issue  of  Capital  by  Small  and  Medium 
Enterprises on Institutional Trading Platform without initial public offering". Further, 
vide  said  ITP  Regulations,  consequential  amendments  have  also  been  made  to

SEBI  (Delisting  of  Equity  Shares)  Regulations,  2009.  The  full  text  of  the
