The Managing Director / Executive Director / Administrator  
of All Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sirs, 

 

Sub.:  Amendments to the Listing Agreement for Debentures 
 
I. 

SEBI  vide  Circular  No.  SEBI/CFD/DIL/CIR-39/2004/11/01  dated  November  1, 
2004  had  introduced  a  Model  Listing  Agreement  to  be  entered  into  by 
companies desirous of listing their debentures. The circular was applicable for 
listing of all debentures irrespective of the mode of issuance i.e. whether issued 
on private placement basis or through public/rights issue.  

 
II. 

 

It has been decided to rationalize the provisions of continuous disclosures made 
by issuers who have listed their debt securities and not their equity shares; and 
to  introduce  submission  of  unaudited  financial  results  with  a  limited  review.  It 
has been decided to modify clauses 3.3 and 2.14 (1) of the extant Model Listing 
Agreement for debentures as follows: 
 

i.  Clause  3.3  applicable  for  debentures  issued  on  private  placement  basis 
shall be amended to provide for submission of unaudited half-yearly results 
subject  to  a  limited  review  (instead  of  half-yearly  audited  results).  The 
results shall be submitted to the exchange within one month from the end of 
the  half-year  and  a  copy  of  the  limited  review  report  shall  be  submitted 
within two months from the end of the half yearly period.  

 

ii.  Clause  2.14.A.(1)  applicable for  debentures  issued  on  public/  rights  issue 
basis  shall  be  amended  to  provide  for  submission  of  unaudited  quarterly 
results  subject  to  a  limited  review  (instead  of  unaudited  quarterly  results 
without  limited  review).  The  results  shall  be  submitted  to  the  exchange 
within  one  month  from  the  end  of  the  quarter  and  a  copy  of  the  limited 
review  report  shall  be  submitted  within  two  months  from  the  end  of  the 
quarter. 

iii.  The limited review shall be done by the statutory auditors of the company 
(or  in  case  of  public  sector  undertakings,  by  any  practicing  Chartered 
Accountant) and report of the limited review shall be  prepared on the lines 
of the format now being included in the Model Listing Agreement.  
 
 

III.  Applicability  
 

The  revised  Clauses  of  the Listing Agreement for  Debentures  shall come into 
force for all filings made to stock exchanges on or after April 1, 2007.

Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in 
securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to  regulate  the  securities 
market.  The  provisions  of  SEBI  circular  No.  SEBI/CFD/DIL/CIR-39/2004/11/01 
dated November 1, 2004 regarding the Model Listing Agreement for Debentures 
to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of the instant circular shall stand

Annexure I 

 
Amendments to the Model Listing Agreement for debentures 

i. 

 
ii. 

 
For clause 3.3, the following clause shall be substituted:  
 
3.3 “The  issuer  agrees  to  furnish  unaudited  financial  results  on  a  half-yearly 
basis  preferably  in  the  format  given  in  clause  2.14  of  part  2  of  this 
agreement  within  one  month  from  the  end  of  the  half-year  to  the  stock 
exchange  and  publish  the  same  in  the  manner  prescribed  in  clause 
2.14.A.(5).  The  financial  results  shall  be  prepared  as  per  the  accounting 
standards laid down by ICAI or as applicable to the issuer under relevant 
statutes.  The  same  shall  be  subjected  to  limited  review  by  the  statutory 
auditors of the company (or in case of public sector undertakings, by any 
practicing  Chartered  Accountant)  and  a  copy  of  the  limited  review  report 
prepared on the lines of the format given in clause 2.14 shall be furnished to 
the stock exchange within two months from the end of the half-year.” 

In clause 2.14,  
 
(a) in Section A for item (1), the following items shall be substituted, namely: 
 
“(1) The issuer agrees to furnish unaudited financial results on a quarterly basis 
in the pro  -forma given in Section B  within one month from the end of quarter 
(quarter means 3 months only) to the Stock Exchange.  
 
(1A) The same shall be subjected to limited review by the statutory auditors of 
the  company  (or  in  case  of  public  sector  undertakings,  by  any  practicing 
Chartered Accountant) and a copy of the limited review report prepared on the 
lines of the format given in Section BB shall be furnished to the stock exchange

A  review  of  interim  financial  information  consists  principally  of  applying  analytical 
procedures  for  financial  data  and  making  inquiries  of  persons  responsible  for 
financial  and  accounting  matters.  It  is  substantially  less  in  scope  than  an  audit 
conducted  in  accordance  with  the  generally  accepted  auditing  standards,  the 
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements 
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
 
Based  on  our  review  conducted  as  above,  nothing  has  come  to  our  notice  that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results 
prepared in accordance with accounting standards and other recognised accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
 
(II) Format for the limited review report for Banks: 
 
We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  of 
____  (Name  of  the  Company)  for  the  period  ended  ____.  This  statement  is  the 
responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approved by the Board 
of Directors.  
 
A  review  of  interim  financial  information  consists  principally  of  applying  analytical 
procedures for financial data and making inquires of persons responsible for financial 
and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is 
the  expression  of  an  opinion  regarding  the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole. 
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  
 
In the conduct of our Review we have relied on the review reports in respect of non-
performing  assets  received  from  concurrent  auditors  of  _________  branches, 
inspection  teams  of  the  bank  of  _______  branches  and  other  firms  of  auditors  of 
_________  branches  specifically  appointed  for  this  purpose.  These  review  reports 
cover ______ percent of the advances portfolio of the bank. Apart from these review 
reports,  in  the  conduct  of  our  review,  we  have  also  relied  upon  various  returns 
received from the branches of the bank.  
 
Based  on  our  review  conducted  as  above,  nothing  has  come  to  our  notice  that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results 
prepared in accordance with accounting standards and other recognized accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed,  or  that  it  contains  any  material  misstatement  or  that  it  has  not  been 
prepared  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  prudential  norms  issued  by  the  Reserve 
Bank of India in respect of income recognition, asset classification, provisioning and 
other related matters."
