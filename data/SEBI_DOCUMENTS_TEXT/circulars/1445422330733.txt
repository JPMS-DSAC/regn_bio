notification  F.No.  1/9/SM/2015  dated  August  28,  2015,  all  recognized

(Regulation) 

2.  Exchanges shall comply with the following norms latest by April 01, 2016: 

 
a.  Member  Deposits:  Exchanges  shall  continue  with  their  practice  of 

keeping exposure free member deposits at the current level.

d.  Additional  Ad-hoc  Margins:  Exchanges  have  the  right  to  impose

containment  system  mandated  by  SEBI.  However,  the  Exchanges 
should keep the following three factors in mind while taking such action: 

i.  Additional  risk  management  measures  (like  ad-hoc  margins)  would

degree  of  regularity,  exchanges  should  examine  whether  the 
circumstances  that  give  rise  to  such  margins  can  be  reasonably 
anticipated  and  can 
the  risk 
management  system  mandated  by  SEBI.  Exchanges  are 
encouraged to analyse these situations and bring the matter to the 
attention of SEBI for further action.

into 

ii.  Any  additional  margins  that  the  exchanges  may  impose  shall  be 
based  on  objective  criteria  and  shall  not  discriminate  between

iii.  Transparency  is  an  important  regulatory  goal  and  therefore  every 
effort  must  be  made  to  make  the  risk  management  systems  fully 
transparent by disclosing their details to the public.
