Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub: Review of norms for participation in derivatives by Mutual Funds  
 
1.  Please refer to SEBI circulars No.MFD/CIR/15/19133/2002 dated September 
30,  2002,  No.SEBI/MFD/CIR  No.03/158/03  dated  June  10,  2003,

2.  In order to enable mutual funds to hedge the debt portfolio from interest rate 
volatility,  SEBI  held  a  series  of  meetings  with  various  stakeholders  of  the 
mutual  fund  industry.  Accordingly,  it  has  been  decided  to  implement  the 
following: 

 

Exposure Limits 

 

3.  In  addition  to  the  existing  provisions  of  SEBI  circular  No.IMD/DF/11/2010 

dated August 18, 2010, the following are prescribed: 

 

i. 

To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge 
the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities)  on 
weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures 
(IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs 
to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per 
the formula given below:

ii. 

iii. 

In  case  the  IRF  used  for  hedging  the  interest  rate  risk  has  different 
underlying  security(s)  than  the  existing  position  being  hedged,  it  would 
result in imperfect hedging.  

 

Imperfect  hedging  using  IRFs  may  be  considered  to  be  exempted  from 
the  gross  exposure,  upto  maximum  of  20%  of  the  net  assets  of  the 
scheme, subject to the following: 

a) 

 
Exposure  to  IRFs  is  created  only  for  hedging  the  interest  rate 
risk  based  on  the  weighted  average  modified  duration  of  the 
bond portfolio or part of the portfolio.  
 

b)  Mutual  Funds  are  permitted  to  resort  to  imperfect  hedging, 
without  it  being  considered  under  the  gross  exposure  limits,  if 
and  only  if,  the  correlation  between  the  portfolio  or  part  of  the 
portfolio  (excluding  the  hedged  portions,  if  any)  and  the  IRF  is 
atleast  0.9  at  the  time  of  initiation  of  hedge.  In  case  of  any 
subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may 
be rebalanced within 5 working days and if not rebalanced within 
the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be 
considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of Para 
3 of  SEBI circular dated August 18, 2010. The correlation should 
be calculated for a period of last 90 days. 

 

Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging 
upto  15%  of  the  portfolio  using  IRFs  on  weighted  average 
modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to 
be complied with: 
 
i.  The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the 

IRF is at least 0.9 or 
 

ii.  The  correlation  for  past  90  days  between  the  part  of  the 
portfolio  (excluding  the  hedged  portions,  if  any)  i.e.  at  least 
15%  of  the  net  asset  of  the  scheme  (including  one  or  more 
securities) and the IRF is at least 0.9. 

c)  At  no  point  of  time,  the  net  modified  duration  of  part  of  the 

portfolio being hedged should be negative.

d)  The  portion  of  imperfect  hedging  in  excess  of  20%  of  the  net 
assets of the scheme should be considered as creating exposure 
and  shall  be  included  in  the  computation  of  gross  exposure  in 
terms of Para 3 of  SEBI circular dated August 18, 2010. 

The  basic  characteristics  of  the  scheme  should  not  be  affected  by 
hedging  the  portfolio  or  part  of  the  portfolio  (including  one  or  more 
securities) based on the weighted average modified duration. 

Explanation:  In  case  of  long  term  bond  fund,  after  hedging  the  portfolio 
based on the modified duration of the portfolio, the net modified duration 
should not be less than the minimum modified duration of the portfolio as 
required to consider the fund as a long term bond fund. 
 
The interest rate hedging of the portfolio should be in the interest of the 
investors. 

 

4.  Mutual  Fund  schemes  may  imperfectly  hedge  their  portfolio  or  part  of  their 

portfolio  using IRFs, subject to the following conditions: 

 

i.  Prior  to  commencement  of  imperfect  hedging,  existing  schemes  shall 
comply  with  the  provisions  of  Regulation  18  (15A)  of  SEBI  (Mutual 
Funds)  Regulations,  1996  and  all  unit  holders  shall  be  given  a  time-
period of at least 30 days to exercise the option to exit at prevailing NAV 
without charging of exit load. 

 

 

ii. 

The  risks  associated  with  imperfect  hedging  shall  be  disclosed  and 
explained  by  suitable  numerical  examples  in  the  offer  documents  and 
also needs to be communicated to the investors through public notice or 
any other form of correspondence. 
 
In  case  of  new  schemes,  the  risks  associated  with  imperfect  hedging 
shall  be disclosed  and  explained by  suitable  numerical  examples  in  the 
offer documents.

5.  In  addition  to  the  existing  provisions,  the  mutual  funds  shall  also  make  the
