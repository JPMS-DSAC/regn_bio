To 
All SEBI Registered Merchant Bankers 
 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 
Sub: Disclosure of Track Record of the public issues managed by Merchant 
Bankers 
 

1.  SEBI  regulations  require  that  the  offer  document  shall  contain  adequate 
disclosures so as to enable investors to take well informed investment decisions. 
Further,  a  merchant  banker  is  required  to  exercise  due  diligence  and  satisfy 
himself about all the aspects of the issue including the veracity and adequacy of 
disclosures in the offer documents. 
 

2.  Therefore, it is necessary for investors to evaluate the post-issue performance of 
the  issuer  in  terms  of  disclosures  made  in  the  offer  documents.    This  will  also 
enable them to understand the level of due diligence exercised by the merchant 
bankers.  
 

3.  In view of the above, it has now been decided in consultation with the merchant 
bankers that they shall disclose the track record of the performance of the public 
issues  managed  by  them.  The  track  record  shall  be  disclosed  for  a  period  of 
three financial years from the date of listing for each public issue managed by the 
merchant  banker.  The  format  for  disclosure  of  track  record  is  given  in  the 
Annexure to this circular. 

4.  The track record shall be disclosed on the website of the merchant banker and a 
reference  to  this  effect  shall  be  made  in  the  offer  documents  of  public  issues 
managed in the future.  In case more than one merchant banker is associated

with  a  public  issue,  all  merchant  bankers  who  have  signed  the  due  diligence 
certificate, as disclosed in the offer document, shall disclose the track record. 

5.  The circular shall be applicable for the public issues listed from the date of this 
circular, with immediate effect.  However, in case of past public issues managed 
during the last three years, the track record as specified in Clause 3 above shall 
be disclosed latest by March 31, 2012.  

6.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11(1) of 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, to protect the interests of 
investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to  regulate  the 
securities market.  

7.  This circular is available on SEBI website (www.sebi.gov.in) under the categories
