Subject: Creation of segregated portfolio in mutual fund schemes 

 

1.  In partial modification to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2018/160 

dated December 28, 2018 on ‘Creation  of  segregated portfolio in mutual fund 

schemes’,  it  has  been  decided  to  permit  creation  of  segregated  portfolio  of  

unrated  debt  or  money  market  instruments  by  mutual  fund  schemes  of  an 

issuer  that  does  not  have  any  outstanding  rated  debt  or  money  market 

instruments, subject to the following: 

 

a.  Segregated  portfolio  of  such  unrated  debt  or  money  market  instruments 

may  be  created  only  in  case  of  actual  default  of  either  the  interest  or 

principal  amount.  As  per  SEBI  circular  dated  December  28,  2018,  credit 

event  is  considered  for  creation  of  segregated  portfolio,  however  for  the 

purpose  of  this  circular  ‘actual  default’  by  the  issuer  of  such  instruments 

shall be considered for creation of segregated portfolio.  

 

b.  AMCs  shall  inform  AMFI  immediately  about  the  actual  default  by  the 

issuer.  Upon  being  informed  about  the  default,  AMFI  shall  immediately 

inform the same to all AMCs. Pursuant to dissemination of information by 

AMFI about actual default by the issuer, AMCs may segregate the portfolio
