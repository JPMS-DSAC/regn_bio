2.  The valuation method of debt and money market instruments specified in the 
aforesaid  circulars  were  discussed  in  the  Advisory  Committee  of  Mutual 
Funds.    With  a  view  to  ensure  that  the  value  of  money  market  and  debt 
securities in the portfolio of mutual  fund schemes reflect the current market 
scenario, the current provisions regarding valuation of these securities need 
to be modified, as under: 

 

I.  Valuation of money market and debt securities with residual maturity 

of upto 91 days: 
All  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including  floating  rate  securities, 
with  residual  maturity  of  upto  91  days  shall  be  valued  at  the  weighted 
average price at which they are traded on the particular valuation day.  
 
When  such  securities  are  not  traded  on  a  particular  valuation  day  they 
shall be valued on amortization basis. It is further clarified that in case of 
floating  rate  securities  with  floor  and  caps  on  coupon  rate  and  residual 
maturity of upto 91 days then those shall be valued on amortization basis 
taking the coupon rate as floor.  

II.  Valuation of money market and debt securities with residual maturity 

of over 91 days: 
All  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including  floating  rate  securities, 
with residual maturity of over 91 days shall be valued at weighted average 
price at which they are traded on the particular valuation day. When such 
securities are not traded on a particular valuation day they shall be valued 
at  benchmark  yield/  matrix  of  spread  over  risk  free  benchmark  yield 
obtained from agency(ies) entrusted for the said purpose by AMFI. 
 

 

 
 
 

III. Valuation  of  securities  not  covered  under  the  current  valuation 

policy: 
In  case  of  securities  purchased  by  mutual  funds  do  not  fall  within  the 
current  framework  of  the  valuation  of  securities  then  such  mutual  fund 
shall report immediately to AMFI regarding the same. Further, at the time 
of investment AMCs shall ensure that the total exposure in such securities 
does not exceed 5% of the total AUM of the scheme. 
 
AMFI has been advised that the valuation agencies should ensure that the 
valuation of such securities gets covered in the valuation framework within 
six weeks from the date of receipt of such intimation from mutual fund.  
 
In the interim period, till AMFI makes provisions to cover such securities in 
the  valuation  of  securities  framework,  the  mutual  funds  shall  value  such 
securities using their proprietary model which has been approved by their 
independent trustees and the statutory auditors. 
 

IV. Dissemination of information: 

All mutual funds shall provide transaction details, including inter scheme 
transfers,  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  on  daily  basis  to  the 
agency entrusted for providing the benchmark yield/ matrix of spread over 
risk free benchmark yield. Submission of data would help in daily matrix 
generation and would improve uniformity and accuracy of valuation in the 
mutual  funds  industry.  The  format  in  this  regard  is  provided  in  SEBI 
Circular No.MFD/CIR/23 /066 / 2003 dated March 7, 2003. 

 
V.  Methodology  for  matrix  of  spread  for  marking  up  the  Benchmark 

yield

All  AMCâ€™s  shall  ensure  that  similar  securities  held  under  its  various 
schemes shall be valued consistently.
