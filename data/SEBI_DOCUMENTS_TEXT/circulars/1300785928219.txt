SMD/POLICY/CIR-22/2000

The President / Executive Director,
Managing Director of all Stock Exchanges

Dear Sir/ Madam, 

This is in continuation of circular no. SMD/POLICY/CIR-19/2000 dated April 28, 2000 
communicating that the short seller who does not either own shares or has not borrowed shares 
(which in that case shall be deposited with the clearing corporation / clearing house) the carry 
forward charges shall not be payable to the short seller. This is to be implemented by the 
Exchanges having the carry forward facility for settlements ending after May 31, 2000. 

The matter was further discussed on May 17, 2000 at a meeting of some of the Stock 
Exchanges which has carry forward facility viz. the Stock Exchange, Mumbai, Calcutta Stock 
Exchange, Delhi Stock Exchange and Ahmedabad Stock Exchange on May 17, 2000. It was 
decided that: 

1. The necessary changes in the software shall be completed by the Stock Exchanges by the 

end of June 2000. 

2. Pending changes in the software, the carry forward charges to the short sellers may be 

released on the basis of submission of self-certificate by the members to the Stock 
Exchange about the availability of sufficient number of shares. In case, the short seller 
holds less number of shares than the shares sold, carry forward charges on the balance 
shares i.e. the number of shares sold but not held by the short seller, shall not be released 
to the short seller and shall be credited to the Investor Protection Fund of the Stock 
Exchange as advised earlier. 

You are advised to take steps to give effect to these decisions. 

Yours faithfully, 

P. K. BINDLISH
