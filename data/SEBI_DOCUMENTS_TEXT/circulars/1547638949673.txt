15% of the total market value of equity shares held in that scheme. 

b.  The total number of shares underlying the call options written shall not

c.  At  all  points  of  time  the  Mutual  Fund  scheme  shall  comply  with  the 
provisions  at  paragraph  4(a)  and  4(b)  above.  In  case  of  any  passive

option  is  written  under  a  covered  call  strategy,  it  must  ensure

securities.  

e.  In  no  case,  a  scheme  shall  write  a  call  option  without  holding  the 
underlying  equity  shares.  A  call  option  can  be  written  only  on  shares 
which are not hedged using other derivative contracts. 

f.  The  premium  received  shall  be  within  the  requirements  prescribed  in 
terms  of  paragraph  5  of  SEBI  circular  dated  August  18,  2010  i.e.  the
