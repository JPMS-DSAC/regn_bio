CIRCULAR NO 03/SMD/96
Sub : Amendment to Clause 32 of the Listing Agreement.
SEBI had received representations requesting us to modify the authentication requirement in respect of the Cash Flow Statement required to be given by the companies along with their Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss Account, as per the requirement under Clause 32 of the Listing Agreement. They have requested that the authentication requirement for Cash Flow Statement should be identical to the authentication requirement for the balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss Account as laid down in the Section 215 of the Companies Act, 1956. The suggestion has been accepted by SEBI.
Point no 6 (vi) of Annexure A to our letter no SMD-I9N0/JJ/2331/95 dated June 26, 1995 regarding amendment of Clause 32 of the Listing Agreement now stands amended as under :
