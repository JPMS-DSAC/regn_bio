Dear Sir/Madam, 
Sub: Consolidation or Merger of Schemes 

Please refer to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MFD/CIR No. 05 /12031/03 dated June 23, 2003 
regarding  consolidation  or  merger  of  schemes  which  mandates  that  the  consolidations 
shall  be  viewed  as  changes  in  fundamental  attributes  of  the  related  schemes  and  the 
mutual funds shall comply with the requirements laid down in the SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulations, 1996, for the purpose. 

In order to facilitate merger of schemes, it has been decided that merger or consolidation 
shall  not  be  seen  as  change  in  fundamental  attribute  of  the  surviving  scheme  if  the 
following conditions are met: 

1.  Fundamental  attributes  of  the  surviving  scheme  as  per  SEBI  Circular  No- 
IIMARP/MF/CIR/01/294/98  dated  February  4,  1998  do  not  change.  For  the 
purpose of this circular the surviving scheme means the scheme which remains in 
existence after the merger. 

2.  Mutual  Funds  are  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  circumstances  merit  merger  or 
consolidation of schemes and the interest of the unitholders of surviving scheme is 
not adversely affected. 

After  approval  by  the  Boards  of  AMCs  and  Trustees,  the  mutual  funds  shall  file  such 
proposal with SEBI.  SEBI would communicate its observations on the proposal within the 
time period prescribed under Regulation 29(3) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. 
The letter to unitholders shall be issued only after the final observations communicated by 
SEBI have been incorporated and final copies of the same have been filed with SEBI.  

SEBI circular No. SEBI/MFD/CIR No. 05 /12031/03 dated June 23, 2003 stands modified 
to the aforesaid extent. 

This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  under  section  11(1)  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of Regulation 
77  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  to  protect  the  interests  of  Investors  in 
securities and to promote the development of and to regulate the securities market.
