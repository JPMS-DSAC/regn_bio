Cir. /IMD/DF/16/2010 
 
 
All Portfolio Managers 
 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 

Sub: Portfolio Managers – clarification on minimum investment amount by 

clients, performance of portfolio and schemes    

1.  Portfolio  Managers  are  registered  and  regulated  under  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 

Managers) Regulations 1993.  

2.  SEBI  has  come  across  lack  of  uniformity  in  practice  relating  to  following  issues 

pertaining to portfolio managers:  

 

a)  There  have  been  instances  of  portfolio  managers  accepting  funds  or 
securities  less  than  `5lakh  from  clients  and  opening  client  accounts  on  the 
basis  of  the  client‟s  commitment  that  `5lakh  would  be  brought  in  soon.  Also 
there  have  been  instances  of  committed  amounts  being  higher  than  the 
prescribed minimum of `5lakh while the initial amount collected from the client 
could be below `5lakh. 

 
b)  It  is  seen  that  many  portfolio  managers  are not  making  adequate disclosure 

regarding portfolio performance in the disclosure document.  

 
c)  SEBI vide notification dated August 11, 2008 deleted the word „Scheme‟ from 
PMS Regulations. However, it is seen that in some cases, portfolio managers 
still  group  portfolios  in  separate  investment  categories  and  term  them  as 
„schemes‟ 

3.  In order to bring about greater uniformity, clarity and transparency with regard to 

above issues,  portfolio managers are advised to ensure the following;  

a)  To  ensure  compliance  with  regulation  15(1A)  of  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers) 
Regulations,  1993,  it  is  clarified  that  the  first  single  lump-sum  investment 
amount received as funds or securities from clients should not be less than `5 
Lakh.

b)  To  ensure  compliance  with  regulation  14(2)(b)(iv)  of  SEBI  (Portfolio 
Managers)  Regulations,  1993,  Portfolio  Managers  shall  disclose 
the 
performance  of  portfolios  grouped  by  investment  category  for  the  past  three 
years as per the enclosed prescribed tabular format. Portfolio Managers shall 
also ensure that the disclosure document is given to all clients along with the 
account  opening  form  at  least  two  days  in  advance  of  signing  of  the 
agreement.  In  order  to  ensure  that  the  clients  have  access  to  updated 
information  about  the  portfolio  manager,  portfolio  managers  shall  place  the 
latest disclosure document on their website, wherever possible. 

 
c)  Portfolio Managers shall not organize investment portfolios as „Schemes‟ akin 

to Mutual Fund Schemes while marketing their services to clients. 

4.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  read  with  the  provisions  of 
Regulation 39 of the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993, to protect the 
interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to 
regulate the securities market.
