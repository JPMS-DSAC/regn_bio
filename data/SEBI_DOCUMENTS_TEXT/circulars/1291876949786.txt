To All Registered Merchant Bankers / Stock Exchanges 

 

Dear Sirs, 

 

Sub.:  Amendments  to  SEBI  (Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection)  Guidelines, 

2000. 

 

1.  SEBI  had  recently  amended  the  SEBI  (Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection) 

Guidelines,  2000  (hereinafter  referred  as  “the  Guidelines”),  vide  circular  no. 

SEBI/CFD/DIL/DIP/25/2007/30/4 dated April 30, 2007. 

 

2. 

In the circular, the  words “where the aggregate value of such securities, including 

premium,  if  any,  exceeds  Rs.  50  lacs,”  were  inadvertently  omitted  in  the  opening 

para of the amended clause 2.1.2 of the Guidelines. The said opening para, after 

inclusion of the aforementioned omitted words, reads as under: 

 

“No  listed  issuer  company  shall  make  any  rights  issue  of  securities,  where  the 

aggregate value of such securities, including premium, if any, exceeds Rs. 50 lacs, 

unless  a  draft  letter  of  offer  has  been  filed  with  the  Board,  through  a  Merchant 

Banker, at least 30 days prior to the filing of the letter of offer with the Designated 

Stock Exchange (DSE).” 

 

3.  This  circular,  as  well  as  the  circular  dated  April  30,  2007,  is  available  on  SEBI 

website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  category  “Legal  Framework”.  The  entire 

text of the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000, including 

the  clarification  issued  vide  this  circular,  is  available  on  the  SEBI  website  under 

the categories “Legal Framework” and “Issues and Listing”. 

 

Yours faithfully,
