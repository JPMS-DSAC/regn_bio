All Stock Exchanges and Depositories
Dear Sir,
Please refer to circular no. IES/42365/2001 dated December 20, 2001 regarding the pre-ponement of rolling settlement in the remaining scrips from Monday December 31, 2001.
The exchanges have informed that there are companies that are yet to sign agreements and establish connectivity with both the depositories. As advised earlier by SEBI, the scrips of such companies which have not signed agreements and established connectivity with both the depositories by September 30, 2001 shall be traded on ‘Trade for Trade’ settlement mode in the rolling settlement from December 31, 2001. These scrips will be moved into normal rolling settlement once they have established connectivity with both the depositories as per the procedure already laid down by SEBI.
As per the information provided by both the depositories the list of scrips that have established connectivity with them as on September 30, 2001 is given in annexure ‘A’ (serial no. 01 to 3244) These scrips would be traded in the normal rolling settlement mode with effect from December 31, 2001.
Accordingly the scrips that have established connectivity with both the depositories as on October 31, 2001 (serial no. 3245 to 3305) and November 30, 2001 (serial no. 3306 to 3350) shall be moved into the normal rolling settlement mode from the 'trade for trade' settlement window of the exchanges with effect from January 31, 2002 and February 28, 2002, respectively.
