CIRCULAR 

 

 

SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2018/16                                         February 02, 2018 
 
All Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies (AMCs)/  
Trustee Companies/Boards of Trustees of Mutual Funds  
 
Sir/ Madam, 
 
Subject:  Review  of  additional  expenses  of  up  to  0.30%  towards  inflows 
from beyond top 15 cities (B15) 
 
1.  Presently, in terms of para A(1) of SEBI circular CIR/IMD/DF/21/2012 dated 
September 13, 2012,  additional TER can be charged up to 30 basis points 
on  daily  net  assets  of  the  scheme  as  per  regulation  52  of  SEBI  (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations, 1996, if the new inflows from beyond top 15 cities are 
at  least  (a)  30%  of  gross  new  inflows  in  the  scheme  or  (b)  15%  of  the 
average assets under management (year to date) of the scheme, whichever 
is higher. 
 

2.  The  additional  TER  for  inflows  from  beyond  top  15  cities  (B15  cities)  was 
allowed  with  an  objective  to  increase  penetration  of  mutual  funds  in  B15 
cities.  Since  more  than  five  years  have  elapsed  and  on  review,  it  is  now 
decided that the additional TER of upto 30 basis points would be allowed for 
inflows from beyond top 30 cities instead of beyond top 15 cities.  
 

3.  Accordingly,  (i)  para  A  of  SEBI  circular  CIR/IMD/DF/21/2012  dated 
September  13, 2012; (ii)  para  A(1)(b)  and  Annexure  A1  mentioned  at  para 
A(2)  of  SEBI  Circular  CIR/IMD/DF/05/2014  dated  March  24,  2014,  are 
modified,  whereby  at  all  relevant  places,  the  terms  “15  cities”,  “T15”  and 
“B15”  would  be  substituted  with  “30  cities”,  “T30”  and  “B30”  respectively, 
while keeping the other provisions of the circulars unchanged.  

 
4.  This circular shall be applicable with effect from April 1, 2018.  

 

5.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11 
(1)  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act  1992,  read  with  the 
provision  of  Regulation  77  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulation,  1996,  to 
protect 
the 
development of, and to regulate the securities market.
