2.  SEBI  has  received  various  suggestions  with  regard  to  the  requirement  of 
system  audit  of  trading  algorithm  /  software  used  by  stock  brokers  /  trading 
members.  After  due  examination  of  the  suggestions  in  consultation  with  the 
Technical  Advisory  Committee,  it  has  been  decided  to  revise  the  requirement 
as follows: 

2.1.  The  stock  brokers  /  trading  members  that  provide  the  facility  of 
algorithmic trading shall subject their algorithmic trading system to a system 
audit  every  six  months  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  prescribed 
by SEBI / stock exchanges with regard to algorithmic trading are effectively 
implemented.

audit.  Further,  the  stock  broker  /  trading  member  shall  take  immediate 
corrective actions to rectify such deficiencies / issues. 

2.4. 
In case of serious deficiencies / issues or failure of the stock  broker / 
trading  member  to  take  satisfactory  corrective  action,  the  stock  exchange 
shall not allow the stock broker / trading member to use the trading software 
till  deficiencies  /  issues  with  the  trading  software  are  rectified  and  a 
satisfactory  system  audit  report  is  submitted  to  the  stock  exchange.  Stock 
exchanges may also consider imposing suitable penalties  in case of failure 
of the stock broker / trading member to take satisfactory corrective action to 
its system within the time-period specified by the stock exchanges. 

3.  In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  surveillance  mechanism  related  to 
algorithmic  trading  and  prevent  market  manipulation,  stock  exchanges  are 
directed to take necessary steps to ensure effective monitoring and surveillance 
of  orders  and  trades  resulting  from  trading  algorithms.  Stock  exchanges  shall 
periodically review their surveillance arrangements in order to better detect and 
investigate market manipulation and market disruptions. 

4.  As  directed  vide  circular  dated  March  30,  2012  stock  exchanges  have 
implemented  a  framework  of  economic  disincentives  for  high  daily  order-to-
trade  ratio  of  orders placed  from trading  algorithms  by  prescribing  penalties  in 
form of 'charges to be levied per algo orders' at various levels of daily order-to-
trade  ratio.  The  penalty  rates  specified  by  the  stock  exchanges  have  been 
reviewed  and  in  order  to  provide  sufficient  deterrence,  stock  exchanges  are 
directed  to  double  the  existing  rates  of  'charges  to  be  levied  per  algo  orders' 
specified in their circulars / notices. 

5.   In order to discourage repetitive instances of high daily order-to-trade ratio, 
stock  exchanges  shall  impose  an  additional  penalty  in  form  of  suspension  of 
proprietary trading right of the stock broker / trading member for the first trading 
hour  on  the  next  trading  day  in  case  a  stock  broker  /  trading  member  is 
penalized  for  maintaining  high  daily  order-to-trade  ratio,  provided  penalty  was 
imposed  on  the  stock broker  /  trading  member  on  more  than  ten  occasions  in 
the previous thirty trading days. 

6.  The circular shall be applicable with effect from May 27, 2013. 

7.  Stock Exchanges are directed to: 

7.1.  take  necessary  steps  and  put  in  place  necessary  systems  for 
implementation of the above. 

7.2.  make  necessary  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules  and
