Annexure A 

 

Illustrative Measures for Data Security on Customer Facing Applications 

1.  Analyse  the  different  kinds  of  sensitive  data  shown  to  the  Customer  on  the  frontend 

application to  ensure that only  what is deemed absolutely necessary is transmitted and 

displayed. 

2.  Wherever possible, mask portions of sensitive data. For instance, rather than displaying 

the full phone number or a bank account number, display only a portion of it, enough for 

the Customer to identify, but useless to an unscrupulous party who may obtain covertly 

obtain it from the Customer’s screen. For instance, if a bank account number is “123 456 

789”,  consider  displaying  something  akin  to  “XXX  XXX  789”  instead  of  the  whole 

number. This also has  the added benefit of not having to transmit the full piece of data 

over various networks. 

3.  Analyse data and databases holistically and draw out meaningful and “silos” (physical or 

virtual) into which different kinds of data can be isolated and cordoned off. For instance, 

a  database  with  personal  financial  information  need  not  be  a  part  of  the  system  or 

network that houses the public facing websites of the Stock Broker. They should ideally 

be in discrete silos or DMZs. 

4.  Implement  strict  data  access  controls  amongst  personnel, 

irrespective  of 

their 

responsibilities,  technical  or  otherwise.  It  is  infeasible  for  certain  personnel  such  as 

System  Administrators and  developers  to  not  have  privileged  access  to  databases.  For 

such cases, take strict measures to limit the number of personnel with direct access, and 

monitor, log, and audit their activities. Take measures to ensure that the confidentiality of 

data is not compromised under any of these scenarios. 

5.  Use  industry  standard,  strong  encryption  algorithms  (eg:  RSA,  AES  etc.)  wherever 

encryption  is  implemented.  It  is  important  to  identify  data  that  warrants  encryption  as 

encrypting all data is infeasible and may open up additional attack vectors. In addition, it 

is critical to identify the right personnel to be in charge of, and the right methodologies for 

storing  the  encryption  keys,  as  any  compromise  to  either  will  render  the  encryption 

useless. 

6.  Ensure that all critical and sensitive data is adequately backed up, and that the backup 

locations  are  adequately  secured.  For  instance,  on  servers  on  isolated  networks  that 

have no public access endpoints, or on-premise servers or disk drives that are off-limits 

to  unauthorized  personnel.  Without  up-to-date  backups,  a  meaningful  recovery  from  a 

disaster or cyber-attack scenario becomes increasingly difficult.

Annexure B 
 
Illustrative Measures for Data Transport Security 

 

 

1.  When an Application transmitting sensitive data communicates over the Internet with the 

Stock Brokers’ systems, it should be over a secure, encrypted channel to prevent Man-

In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, for instance, an IBT or a Back office communicating from 

a  Customer’s  web  browser  or  Desktop  with  the  Stock  Brokers’  systems  over  the 

internet,  or  intra  or  inter  organizational  communications.  Strong  transport  encryption 

mechanisms such as TLS (Transport Layer Security, also referred to as SSL) should be 

used. 

2.  For Applications carrying sensitive data that are served as web pages over the internet, 

a  valid,  properly  configured  TLS  (SSL)  certificate  on  the  web  server  is  mandatory, 

making the transport channel HTTP(S). 

3.  Avoid  the  use  of  insecure  protocols  such  as  FTP  (File  Transfer  Protocol)  that  can  be 

easily  compromised  with  MITM  attacks.  Instead,  adopt  secure  protocols  such  as 

FTP(S), SSH and VPN tunnels, RDP (with TLS) etc.

Annexure C 

Illustrative Measures for Application Authentication Security 

 

1.  Any  Application  offered  by  Stock  Brokers  to  Customers  containing  sensitive, 

private,  or  critical  data  such  as  IBTs,  SWSTs,  Back  office  etc.  referred  to  as 

“Application”  hereafter)  over  the  Internet  should  be  password  protected.  A 

reasonable  minimum  length  (and  no  arbitrary  maximum  length  cap  or  character 

class  requirements)  should  be  enforced.  While  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  password 

“complexity”,  longer  passphrases  have  more  entropy  and  offer  better  security  in 

general.  Stock  Brokers  should  attempt  to  educate  Customers  of  these  best 

practices. 

2.  Passwords,  security  PINs  etc.  should  never  be  stored  in  plain  text  and  should  be 

one-way hashed using strong cryptographic hash functions (e.g.: bcrypt, PBKDF2) 

before  being  committed  to  storage.  It  is  important  to  use  one-way  cryptographic 

hashes  to  ensure  that  stored  password  hashes  are  never  transformed  into  the 

original plaintext values under any circumstances. 

3.  For  added  security,  a  multi-factor  (e.g.:  two-factor)  authentication  scheme  may  be 

used  (hardware  or  software  cryptographic  tokens,  VPNs,  biometric  devices,  PKI 

etc.). 

In case of IBTs and SWSTs, a minimum of two-factors in the authentication flow are 

mandatory. 

4.  In  case  of  Applications  installed  on  mobile  devices  (such  as  smartphones  and 

tablets),  a  cryptographically  secure  biometric two-factor  authentication  mechanism 

may be used. 

5.  After a reasonable number of failed login attempts into Applications, the Customer’s 

account can be set to a “locked” state where further logins are not possible until a 

password  and  authentication  reset  is  performed  via  an  out-of-band  channel 

validation,  for  instance,  a  cryptographically  secure  unique  link  that  is  sent  to  the 

Customer’s registered e-mail, a random OTP (One Time Password) that is sent as 

an  SMS  to  the  Customer’s  registered  mobile  number,  or  manually  by  the  Broker 

after verification of the Customer’s identity etc. 

6.  Avoid  forcing  Customers  to  change  passwords  at  frequent  intervals  which  may 

result in successive, similar, and enumerated passwords. Instead, focus on strong

multi-factor  authentication  for  security  and  educate  Customers  to  choose  strong 

 

passphrases.  Customers  may  be  reminded  within  reasonable  intervals  to  update 

their  password  and  multi-factor  credentials,  and  to  ensure  that  their  out-of-band 

authentication reset information (such as e-mail and phone number) are up-to-date. 

7.  Both  successful  and  failed  login  attempts  against  a  Customer’s  account  may  be 

logged  for  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  After  successive  login  failures,  it  is 

recommended  that  measures  such  as  CAPTCHAs  or  rate-limiting  be  used  in 

Applications to thwart manual and automated brute force and enumeration attacks 

against logins.
