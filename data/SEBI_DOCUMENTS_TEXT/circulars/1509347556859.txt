1.  RBI in its Fourth Bi-monthly Policy Statement for the year 2015-16, dated September 29, 2015 
had  announced  a  Medium  Term  Framework  (MTF)  for  FPI  limits  in  Government  securities  in 
consultation  with  the  Government  of  India.  Accordingly,  SEBI  had 
issued  circulars 
CIR/IMD/FPIC/8/2015  dated  October  06,  2015,  IMD/FPIC/CIR/P/2016/45  dated  March  29, 
2016 and IMD/FPIC/CIR/P/2016/107 dated October 03, 2016 and IMD/FPIC/CIR/P/2017/30 
dated April 03, 2017 regarding the allocation and monitoring of FPI debt investment limits in 
Government securities. 
 

2.  It has been decided to revise the limit for investment by FPIs in Government Securities, for the 

July - September 2017 quarter,  as follows: 
 

a.  Limit for FPIs in Central Government securities shall be enhanced to INR 187,700 cr.  

 

b.  Limit  for  Long  Term  FPIs  (Sovereign  Wealth  Funds  (SWFs),  Multilateral  Agencies, 
Endowment  Funds,  Insurance  Funds,  Pension  Funds  and  Foreign  Central  Banks)  in 
Central Government securities shall be revised to INR 54,300 cr. 
 

c.  The debt limit category of State Development Loans (SDL) shall henceforth have two sub-
categories, namely, SDL-General and SDL-Long Term. SDL-General shall be available for 
investment on tap for all categories of FPIs while SDL-Long Term shall be available for 
investment on tap for only Long Term FPIs. The limit for investment by all FPIs in SDL-
General shall be INR 28,500 cr while that for SDL-Long Term shall be INR 4,600 cr.

in the following ratio - 75% for the Long-Term category of FPIs and 25% for the General category 
of FPIs.  
 

5.  The practice of transferring unutilized limits of the Long-Term category to the General category 

of FPIs shall be done away with.  
 

6.  To  harmonize  the  approach  to  FPI  investments  in  SDLs  with  that  for  Central  Government 
securities, future increases in SDLs would be in the ratio of 75% for SDL-Long Term and 25% for 
SDL-General category of FPIs.    
 

7.  All other existing terms and conditions, including the security-wise limits, investment of coupons 
being permitted outside the limits and investments being restricted to securities with a minimum 
residual maturity of three years, shall continue to apply. 
 

This  circular  shall  come  into  effect  immediately.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers 
conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.
