Subject: Reporting for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) 
applications and systems offered and used by market intermediaries 

 

Dear Sir / Madam,  

Background 

1.  There  is  increasing  usage  of  AI  (Artificial  Intelligence)  and  ML  (Machine 
Learning) as product offerings by market intermediaries and participants (eg: 
“robo  advisors”)  in  investor  and  consumer  facing  products.  SEBI  is 
conducting a survey and creating an inventory of the AI / ML landscape in the 
Indian financial markets to gain an in-depth understanding of the adoption of 
such technologies in the markets and to ensure preparedness for any AI / ML 
policies that may arise in the future. 
 

2.  As most AI / ML systems are black boxes and their behavior cannot be easily 
quantified,  it  is  imperative  to  ensure  that  any  advertised  financial  benefit 
owing to these technologies in investor facing financial products offered by 
intermediaries should not constitute to misrepresentation 

Scope definition 

3.  Any  set  of  applications  /  software  /  programs  /  executable  /  systems 

(computer systems) – cumulatively called application and systems,

a.  that  are  offered  to  investors  (individuals  and  institutions)  by 

market intermediaries to facilitate investing and trading,  

OR 

b.  to disseminate investments strategies and advice,  

c.  to carry out compliance operations / activities, 

OR 

where AI / ML is portrayed as a part of the public product offering or 
under usage for compliance or management purposes, is included in 
the scope of this circular. Here, “AI” / “ML” refers to the terms “Artificial 
Intelligence”  and  “Machine  Learning”  used  as  a  part  of  the  product 
offerings. In order to make the scope of this circular inclusive of various 
AI and ML technologies in use, the scope also covers Fin-Tech and 
Reg-Tech  initiatives  undertaken  by  market participants  that  involves 
AI and ML 

4.  Technologies  that  are  considered  to  be  categorized  as  AI  and  ML 
technologies in the scope of this circular, are explained in Annexure B. 

Regulatory requirements 

5.  All registered Stock Brokers / Depository Participant offering or using 
applications or systems as defined in Annexure B, should participate in 
the  reporting  process  by  completing  the  AI  /  ML  reporting  form  (see 
Annexure A). 

6.  With effect from quarter ending March 2019, registered Stock Brokers 
/ Depository Participant using AI / ML based application or system as 
defined in Annexure B, are required to fill in the form (Annexure A) and 
make  submissions  on  quarterly  basis  within  15  calendar  days  of  the 
expiry of the quarter. 

7.  Stock Exchanges and Depositories have to consolidate and compile a 
report,  on  AI  /  ML  applications  and  systems  reported  by  registered 
Stock  Brokers  /  Depository  Participants  in  the  reporting  format 
(Annexure C) on quarterly basis. The said report (Annexure C) shall be

Annexure B – Systems deemed to be based on AI and ML technology 
 
Applications  and  Systems  belonging  but  not  limited  to  following  categories  or  a 
combination of these:  
 

1.  Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis or text mining systems that gather 
intelligence from unstructured data. – In this case, Voice to text, text to intelligence systems 
in any natural language will be considered in scope.  Eg: robo chat bots, big data intelligence 
gathering systems. 

2.  Neural Networks or a modified form of it. – In this case, any systems that uses a number of 
nodes  (physical  or  software  simulated nodes)  mimicking  natural neural networks  of  any 
scale, so as to carry out learning from previous firing of the nodes will be considered in 
scope. Eg: Recurrent Neural networks and Deep learning Neural Networks 

3.  Machine learning through supervised, unsupervised learning or a combination of both. – In 
this case, any application or systems that carry out knowledge representation to form a 
knowledge base of domain, by learning and creating its outputs with real world input data 
and deciding future outputs based upon the knowledge base. Eg: System based on Decision 
tree, random forest,  K mean, Markov decision process, Gradient boosting Algorithms. 

4.  A  system  that  uses  statistical  heuristics  method instead  of  procedural  algorithms  or the 
system  /  application  applies  clustering  or  categorization  algorithms  to  categorize  data 
without a predefined set of categories 

5.  A  system  that  uses  a  feedback  mechanism  to  improve  its  parameters  and  bases  it 

subsequent execution steps on these parameters. 

6.  A system that does knowledge representation and maintains a knowledge base.
