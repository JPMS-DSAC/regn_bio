CIR/DNPD/7/2011   

 

 

 

 

 

      

        August 10, 2011 

To 

Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer 

Recognized Stock Exchanges 

 

Dear Sir/Madam,  

Sub: Short-collection/Non-collection of client margins (Derivatives Segments) 

1.  In consultation with BSE, MCX-SX, NSE and USE, it has been decided that Stock 
Exchanges  shall  levy  penalty  specified  hereunder  on  trading  members  for  short-
collection/non-collection of margins from clients in Equity and Currency Derivatives 
segments: 

For each member  

‘a’ 

Per day Penalty as %age of 

‘a’ 
0.5 
1.0 

(< Rs 1 lakh) And (< 10% of applicable margin) 
(≥ Rs 1 lakh)   Or  (≥ 10% of applicable margin) 
Where a = Short-collection/non-collection of margins per client per segment per day 
 

2.  If short/non-collection of margins for a client continues for more than 3 consecutive 
days,  then  penalty  of  5%  of  the  shortfall  amount  shall  be  levied  for  each  day  of 
continued shortfall beyond the 3rd day of shortfall. 
 

3.  If short/non-collection of margins for a client takes place for more than 5 days in a 
month,  then  penalty  of  5%  of  the  shortfall  amount  shall  be  levied  for  each  day, 
during the month, beyond the 5th day of shortfall.  

4.  Notwithstanding the above, if short collection of margin from clients is caused due 
to movement of 3% or more in the index (close to close value of Nifty/Sensex for 
all equity derivatives) and in the underlying currency pair (close to close settlement 
price of currency futures, in case of all currency derivatives) on a given day, (day 
T),  then,  the  penalty  for  short  collection  shall  be  imposed  only  if  the  shortfall 
continues to T+2 day.  
 

5.  All  instances  of  non-reporting  shall  amount  to  100%  short  collection  and  the 
penalty  as  applicable  shall  be  charged  on  these  instances  in  respect  of  short 
collection.
