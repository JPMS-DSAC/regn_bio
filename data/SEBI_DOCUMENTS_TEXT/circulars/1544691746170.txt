Explanation:  
(1). Public retail funds mean (i) mutual funds or unit trusts which are open for 
subscription  to  retail  investors  and  do  not  have  specific  investor  type 
requirements  e.g.  accredited  investors  etc,  (ii)  insurance  companies  where 
segregated portfolio  with one to  one correlation with a single investor is not 
maintained and (iii) pension funds. 

 

(2) Control includes the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control 
the  management  or  policy  decisions  exercisable  by  a  person  or  persons 
acting  individually  or  in  concert,  directly  or  indirectly,  including  by  virtue  of 
shareholding  or  management  rights  or  shareholders  agreements  or  voting 
agreements or in any other manner. 

b.  In  case,  two  or  more  FPIs  including  foreign  Governments/  their  related 
entities are having direct or indirect common ownership of more than 50% or 
control, all such FPIs will be treated as forming part of an investor group and 
the  investment  limits  of  all  such  entities  shall  be  clubbed  at  the  investment 
limit as applicable to a single foreign portfolio investor.  

c.  In cases where Government of India enters into agreements or treaties with 
other  sovereign  Governments  and  where  such  agreements  or  treaties 
specifically recognize certain entities to be distinct and separate, SEBI may, 
during  the  validity  of  such  agreements  or  treaties,  recognize  them  as  such, 
subject to conditions as may be specified by it.  

d.  The  investment  by  foreign  Government  agencies  shall  be  clubbed  with  the 
investment by the foreign Government/ its related entities for the purpose of 
calculation of 10% limit for FPI investments in a single company, if they form 
part of an investor group. 

e.  The  investment  by  foreign  Government/  its  related  entities  from  provinces/ 
states  of  countries  with  federal  structure  shall  not  be  clubbed  if  the  said 
foreign entities have different ownership and control.  

f. 

In respect of any breach of  the investment limit mentioned above,  the FPI’s 
shall have the following two options:-  

i.  FPI  in  breach  shall  have  to  divest  its  holding  within  five  trading  days 
from  the  date  of  settlement  of  the  trades  to  bring  its  shareholding 
below 10% of the paid up capital of the company, or, 

ii.  The  said  investments  shall  be  treated  as  Foreign  Direct  Investment 

from the date of breach. 

4.  The necessary amendments in SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 

will be notified separately.
