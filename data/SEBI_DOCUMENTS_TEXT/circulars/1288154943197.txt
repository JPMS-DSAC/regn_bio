CIRCULAR 

CIR/MIRSD/CRA/6/2010                                                                            May 3, 2010  
 
All Credit Rating Agencies Registered with SEBI 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 

Sub: Guidelines for Credit Rating Agencies 

 
Recent  events  in  global  financial  system  have  underlined  the  pivotal  role  that  credit 
ratings  play.  Effective  use  of  credit  ratings  by  the  users  is  crucially  dependent  upon 
quality  and  quantity  of  disclosures  made  by  the  Credit  Rating  Agencies  (CRAs).  There 
have  been  widespread  consultations  on  the  issue  both  globally  and  within  India  and 
several documents have been prepared. In the wake of the above and in order to impart 
higher credibility to the processes and procedures associated with the credit rating, it has 
been decided, in consultation with the CRAs, to prescribe the following transparency and 
disclosure norms for them:  
 
1.      Rating Process 

A CRA shall keep the following records in support of each credit rating and review / 
surveillance thereof:   

The important factors underlying the credit rating and sensitivity of such credit 
rating to changes in these factors,  

 
1.2  Summary  of  discussions  with  the  issuer,  its  management,  auditors  and 

bankers which have a bearing on the credit rating,  

1.3  Decisions  of  the  rating  committee(s),  including  voting  details  and  notes  of 

dissent, if any, by any member of the rating committee, and 

 

 

 

 

1.1 

1.4 

1.5 

If a quantitative model is a substantial component of the credit rating process, 
the rationale for any material difference between the credit rating implied by 
the model and the credit rating actually assigned. 

These  records  should  be  maintained  till  five  years  after  maturity  of 
instruments  and  be  made  available  to  auditors  and  regulatory  bodies  when 
sought by them. 

 
2.      Default Studies  

Default studies are central to evaluating the performance of a credit rating agency 
and whether its ratings can predict default over a period of time. In order to promote 
transparency and to enable the market to best judge the performance of the ratings, 
the CRA, should publish information about the historical default rates of CRA rating 
categories  and  whether  the  default  rates  of  these  categories  have  changed  over 
time, so that the public can understand the historical performance of each category

and  if  and  how  rating  categories  have  changed,  and  be  able  to  draw  quality 
comparisons among ratings given by different CRAs. 

2.1 The default rates shall be calculated in the  following manner: 
 

2.1.1  One Year Default Rate is the weighted average of default rates of all 

possible 1 year static pools in the 5-year period. 

2.2 

2.1.2  Cumulative  Default  Rate:  The  cumulative  default  rate  (CDR) 
represents the likelihood of an entity that was rated at the beginning 
of any multi-year period defaulting at any time during the multi-year 
period. Three-year cumulative default rate shall be computed as:  
 
Three-year  CDR  for  rating  category  X  =  No.  of  issuers  which 
defaulted  over  the  three-year  period  /  No.  of  issuers  outstanding  at 
the beginning of the three-year period 

 
For the above purposes, the following terms shall have the meaning as under 
: 

2.2.1  Static  Pool  :  Non-defaulted  ratings  that  were  outstanding  at  the 

beginning of any period 

 
2.2.2  Default  :  Non-payment  of  interest  or  principal  amount  in  full  on  the 
pre-agreed date. A CRA shall recognize default at the first instance of 
delay in servicing of interest or principal on the rated debt instrument. 

 
2.2.3  Default  Rate:  The  number  of  defaults  among  rated  entities  in  the 
static pool as a percentage of the total number of entities in the static 
pool. 

2.2.4  Averaging  :  All  averaging  across  static  pools  for  default  rate 
computations must be based on the weighted average method where 
the weights are the number of ratings in each static period 

Dealing with Conflict of interest  

3.1 A CRA shall formulate the policies and internal codes for dealing with the conflict 

of interests. 

 

   3.2     A CRA shall ensure: 
 

3.2.1        that  its  analysts  do  not  participate  in  any  kind  of  marketing  and 
business development including negotiations of fees with the issuer 
whose securities are being rated,  
that  the  employees’  involved  in  the  credit  rating  process  and  their 
dependants do not have ownership of the shares of the issuer.
