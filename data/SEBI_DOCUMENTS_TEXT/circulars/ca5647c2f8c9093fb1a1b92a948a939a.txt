SMD/POLICY/CIRCULAR/18 /97
August 4th, 1997
TO ALL STOCK EXCHANGES  
Dear Sir,
This is with reference to the reporting of complaints against Sub brokers by the stock exchanges. For monitoring the complaints redressal mechanism more effectively, has been decided that stock exchanges shall send a Monthly Status Report of Complaints against Sub brokers in enclosed format instead of sending replies on case to case basis. Reports on individual cases shall be given by stock exchanges as and when asked by SEBI separately.
The format for ‘Monthly report on redressal of investor grievances’ is segregated into three parts :
Part A: Summary of total Complaints of last six months.
Part B: Details of SEBI referred Complaints resolved during the month.
Part C: Details of SEBI referred Complaints pending more than 4 months with reasons.
This procedure should be implemented immediately from the month of August 1997 and the Monthly status report shall be sent before 5th of every month.  
Yours faithfully,     O P GAHROTRA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT
CC: All R.O.s for their reference
