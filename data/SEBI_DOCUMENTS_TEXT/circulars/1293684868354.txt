To All Registered Merchant Bankers 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub.:  Additional  mode  of  payment  through  Applications  Supported  by  Blocked  Amount 

(hereinafter referred to as “ASBA”)

3. 
 

 

 

In  its  continuing  endeavour  to  make  the  existing  public  issue  process  more  efficient, 
SEBI has decided to introduce a supplementary process of applying in public issues, viz., 
the  “Applications  Supported by  Blocked  Amount  (ASBA)”  process.  The  SEBI  (Disclosure 
and  Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  Guidelines”) 
have since been amended to provide for the ASBA process.  Details of the amendments 
in this regard are given in Annexure I. 

The ASBA process shall be available in all public issues made through the book building 
route.  It  shall  co-exist  with  the  current  process,  wherein  cheque  is  used  as  a  mode  of 
payment. 

The main features of ASBA process are as follows:  

a.  Meaning of ASBA: ASBA is an application for subscribing to an issue, containing an 

authorisation to block the application money in a bank account.  

 
b. 

Self  Certified  Syndicate  Bank  (SCSB):  SCSB  is  a  bank  which  offers  the  facility  of 
applying through the ASBA process. A bank desirous of offering ASBA facility shall 
submit  a  certificate  to  SEBI  as  per  the  format  given  in  Annexure  II,  as  per  the 
specified format, for inclusion of its name in SEBI’s list of SCSBs. The said list will 
be  displayed  by  SEBI  on  its  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in.  ASBAs  can  be  accepted 
only  by  SCSBs,  whose  names  appear  in  the  list  of  SCSBs  displayed  in  SEBI”s 
website.  

On  inclusion  in the  list  of  SCSBs,  a  bank  shall  commence  its  activities  as  an  SCSB 
w.e.f.  the  1st  or  15th  of  a  month,  whichever  is  earlier,  from  the  date  of  such 
inclusion.  It  shall  then  be  deemed  to  have  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the 

1 

 

c. 

 

 
d. 

issuer and shall be required to offer the ASBA facility to all its account holders for 
all issues to which ASBA process is applicable.  
 
A SCSB shall identify its Designated Branches (DBs) at which an ASBA investor shall 
submit ASBA and shall also identify the Controlling Branch (CB) which shall act as a 
coordinating branch for the Registrar to the Issue, Stock Exchanges and Merchant 
Bankers.  The  SCSB,  its  DBs  and  CB  shall  continue  to  act  as  such,  for  all  issues  to 
which ASBA process is applicable. The SCSB may identify new DBs for the purpose 
of ASBA process and intimate details of the same to SEBI, after which SEBI will add 
the  DB  to  the  list  of  SCSBs  maintained  by  it.  The  SCSB  shall  communicate  the 
following  details  to  Stock  Exchanges  for  making  it  available  on  their  respective 
websites. These details shall also be made available by the SCSB on its website: 
(i)  Name and address of the SCSB  
(ii)  Addresses  of  DBs  and  CB  and  other  details  such  as  telephone  number,  fax 

number and email ids. 

(iii)  Name and contact details of a nodal officer at a senior level from the CB. 

Eligibility of Investors: An Investor shall be eligible to apply through ASBA process, 
if he/ she : 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv)  has agreed not to revise his/her bid; 
(v) 

is a “Resident Retail Individual Investor”; 
is bidding at cut-off, with  single option as to the number of shares bid for; 
is applying through blocking of funds in a bank account with the SCSB; 

is not bidding under any of the reserved categories. 

Such investors are hereinafter referred as “ASBA investors”. 

ASBA  Process  in  brief:  An  ASBA  investor  shall  submit  an  ASBA  physically  or 
electronically  through  the  internet  banking  facility,  to  the  SCSB  with  whom  the 
bank  account  to  be  blocked,  is  maintained.  The  SCSB  shall  then  block  the 
application  money  in  the  bank  account  specified  in  the  ASBA,  on  the  basis  of  an 
authorisation  to  this  effect  given  by  the  account  holder  in  the  ASBA.  The 
application money shall remain blocked in the bank account till finalisation of the 
basis  of  allotment  in  the  issue  or  till  withdrawal/  failure  of  the  issue  or  till 
withdrawal/ rejection of the application, as the case may be. The application data 
shall thereafter be uploaded by the SCSB in the electronic bidding system through 
a  web  enabled  interface  provided  by  the  Stock  Exchanges.  Once  the  basis  of 
allotment is finalized, the Registrar to the Issue shall send an appropriate request 
to  the  SCSB  for  unblocking  the  relevant  bank  accounts  and  for  transferring  the 
requisite  amount  to  the  issuer’s  account.  In  case  of  withdrawal/  failure  of  the 
issue, the amount shall be unblocked by the SCSB on receipt of information from 
the pre-issue merchant bankers. The ASBA process is given in detail in Annexure 
III.

f. 

Obligations of the Issuer: The issuer shall ensure that adequate arrangements are 
made by  the  Registrar  to  the  Issue to  obtain  information  about  all ASBAs  and to 
treat these applications similar to non-ASBA applications while finalizing the basis 
of allotment, as per the procedure specified in the Guidelines.   

Applicability  of  ASBA  process:  ASBA  process  shall  be  applicable  to  all  book-built 
public  issues  which  provide  for  not  more  than  one  payment  option  to  the  retail 
individual investors. 

The details of the role and responsibilities of Merchant Bankers in the ASBA process are 
given in Annexure IV, for due compliance by Merchant Bankers.   

The roles and responsibilities of other intermediaries, viz., Registrars, Merchant Bankers 
and Stock Exchanges in the ASBA process are given in Annexure V.  

This  circular  shall  come  in  to  effect  from  the  date  to  be  specified  by  SEBI,  once  few 
eligible banks are recognized as SCSBs. 

This circular and the entire text of the amended SEBI  (DIP) Guidelines are available on 
SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  categories  “Legal  Framework”  and  “Issues 
and Listing”.
