submitting  the  said  report  in  different  formats.  Accordingly,  it  has  been 
decided to standardize the format of reporting of shareholding pattern of the 
recognised stock exchange under MIMPS Regulations.  

4.  The stock exchanges are therefore advised to ensure the submission of the 
report  under  MIMPS  Regulations  on  a  quarterly  basis  within  the  aforesaid 
prescribed time period, as per the format given at Annexure-A.  

5.  The stock exchanges are directed to communicate to SEBI, the status of the 
implementation of the provisions of this circular in their Monthly / Quarterly 
Development Report.
