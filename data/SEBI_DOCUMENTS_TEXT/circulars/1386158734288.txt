Sub: Simplification of demat account opening process  

1.  SEBI has taken a number of steps in the recent past to simplify the Account 
opening and KYC process in the securities markets. In continuation of the efforts 
in  the  same  direction,  it  has  now  been  decided  in  consultation  with  both  the 
Depositories  and  Associations  of  stock  brokers  and  Depository  Participants  to 
further simplify and rationalize the demat account opening process.  

2.    The  existing  Beneficial  Owner-Depository  Participant  Agreements  shall  be 
replaced  with  a  common  document  “Rights  and  Obligations  of  the  Beneficial 
Owner  and  Depository  Participant”.  The  document  annexed  herewith  shall  be 
mandatory  and  binding  on  all  the  existing  and  new  clients  and  depository 
participants. This will harmonize the account opening process for trading as well 
as  demat  account.  This  will  also  rationalise  the  number  of  signatures  by  the 
investor, which he is required to affix at present on a number of pages. 

3.    The  Depository  Participant  shall  provide  a  copy  of  Rights  and  Obligations 
Document  to  the  beneficial  owner  and  shall  take  an  acknowledgement  of  the 
same.  They  shall  ensure  that  any  clause  in  any  voluntary  document  neither 
dilutes the responsibility of the depository participant nor it shall be in conflict with 
any  of  the  clauses  in  this  Document,  Rules,  Bye-laws,  Regulations,  Notices, 
Guidelines and Circulars issued by SEBI and the Depositories from time to time. 
Any such clause introduced in the existing as well as new documents shall stand 
null and void.  

4. The Depositories are directed to: 

i.  Bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the  notice  of  the  Depository 
Participants  and  also  disseminate  the  same  on  their  websites.  They 
shall  take  necessary  steps  to  implement  this  circular  immediately  and 
ensure its full compliance in respect of all new clients  within 3 months 
from the date of this circular.  

ii.  Advise  the depository  participants  to  intimate  their  clients  the modified 
provisions  of  the  Rights  and  Obligations  Document,  replacing  the 
existing BO-DP agreements.

5.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of 
the Securities  and  Exchange Board  of  India  Act, 1992 to protect  the  interests of 
investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of  and  to  regulate  the 
securities markets.  

6.    This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  (www.sebi.gov.in)  under  the 
categories “Legal Framework” and “Circulars”.
