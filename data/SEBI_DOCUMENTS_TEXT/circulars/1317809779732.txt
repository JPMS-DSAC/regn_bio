Dear Sirs, 

Subject: Uniform Know Your Client (KYC) Requirements for the Securities Markets 

1.  SEBI  has  been  getting  feedback  from  the  investors  that  various  SEBI  registered 

intermediaries follow different KYC requirements.  

 
2.   In case of Mutual Funds, Portfolio Managers, Collective Investment Schemes and Venture 
Capital  Funds, though certain  basic requirements have been prescribed for  Customer Due 
Diligence  (CDD)  or  Know  Your  Client  (KYC),  no  specific  KYC  format  has  been 
prescribed.  As  a  result,  these  intermediaries  use  different  KYC  formats  and  supporting 
documents.   

 
3.  SEBI  has  recently  initiated  steps  in  this  direction  in  consultation  with  major  stock 
exchanges, depositories, AMFI and market participants. In case of stock brokers (and also 
for  the  stock  brokers  who  are  depository  participants),  the  account  opening  process  for 
investors has been simplified vide SEBI Circular No. CIR/MIRAD/16/2011 dated August 
22,  2011  (available  on  SEBI  website),  KYC  form  capturing  the  basic  details  about  the 
client has been prescribed as Part I of the account opening form and additional information 
specific to dealing in the stock exchange(s) are obtained in Part II of the form.  

4.  With a view to bring about uniformity in securities markets, it has also been decided that 
the  same  KYC  form  and  supporting  documents  shall  also  be  used  by  all  captioned  SEBI 
registered  intermediaries.  The  KYC  form  as  given  in  Annexure-1  shall  be  filled  by  an 
investor at  the account  opening stage while dealing with  any of the above intermediaries. 
Additional  details  specific  to  the  area  of  activity  of  the  intermediary  being  obtained  now 
but not covered in the KYC form shall also be obtained from the investors in Part II of the 
account opening form.  
 

5.  The additional information (Part II) shall be prescribed by Depositories for their depository 
participants and by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) for all mutual funds. The 
Portfolio  Managers,  Venture  Capital  Funds,  and  Collective  Investment  Schemes  shall 
capture  the  additional  information  specific  to  their  area  of  activities,  as  considered 
appropriate by them. The intermediaries shall also continue to abide by Circulars issued by 
SEBI from time to time for prevention of money laundering.

their Depository Participants,  make necessary amendments to  the relevant  bye-laws, rules 
and  regulations  for  the  implementation  of  the  above  decision  in  coordination  with  each 
other and verify its compliance through internal audits and inspections.
