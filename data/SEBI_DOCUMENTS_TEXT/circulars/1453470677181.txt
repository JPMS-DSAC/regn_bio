Annexure - A 

 
Clarification on voluntary adaptation of Aadhaar based e-KYC process 
  

SEBI vide circular dated October 8, 2013, enabled Aadhaar based e-KYC service offered 
by UIDAI for KYC verification. 
   
Intermediaries have sought clarifications from SEBI on certain operational aspects of the 
same.  
 
It is clarified that for accessing the details enabling client identification and authentication 
from  UIDAI  based  on  client  authorisation,  on  voluntary  basis,  intermediaries  who  utilize 
the services of KYC Service Agencies (KSAs) would be registered as KYC User Agencies 
(KUA) with UIDAI.  
 
1.  For  entering  into  account  based  relationship,  the  client  may  provide  the  following 

information to the intermediary:  

i.  Name  
ii.  Aadhaar number 
iii.  Permanent Account Number (PAN)  

 

2.  The  above  information  can  be  provided  by  the  client  electronically  including  through 

any web enabled device. 

 
3.  The  intermediary  shall  perform  verification  of  the  client  with  UIDAI  through  biometric 
authentication (fingerprint or iris scanning). Mutual Funds can also perform verification 
of the client with UIDAI through One Time password (OTP) received on client’s mobile 
number or on e-mail address registered with UIDAI provided, the amount invested by 
the client does not exceed Rs. 50,000 per financial year per Mutual Fund and payment 
for  the  same  is  made  through  electronic  transfer  from  the  client’s  bank  account 
registered with that Mutual Fund.  
 

4.  PAN of such client is to be verified from the income tax website.  

 

5.  After due validation of Aadhaar number provided by the client, the intermediary (acting 

as KUA) shall receive the KYC information about the client from UIDAI through KSA.  
 

6.  The information downloaded from UIDAI shall be considered as sufficient information 
for  the  purpose  of  KYC  verification.  The  intermediary  shall  upload  this  KYC 
information on the KRA system in terms of KRA Regulations. 
 

7.  In  case  material  difference  is  observed  either  in  the  name  (as  observed  in  the  PAN 
vis-a-vis Aadhaar) or photograph in Aadhaar is not clear, the intermediary shall carry

out additional due diligence and maintain a record of the additional documents sought 
pursuant to such due diligence.  

 

8.  The  records  of  KYC  information  so  received shall  be maintained  by  the  intermediary 

as per the SEBI Act, Regulations and various circulars issued thereunder.
