“19. The entities issuing and/or listing their debt securities in IFSC shall prepare their 

statement of accounts in accordance with IFRS/ US GAAP/ IND AS or accounting 

standards as applicable to them in their place of incorporation. In case an entity does 

not prepare its statement of accounts in accordance with IFRS/ US GAAP/ IND AS, 

a  quantitative  summary  of  significant  differences  between  national  accounting 

standards and IFRS shall be prepared by such entity and incorporated in the relevant

IND AS would suffice, if the issue is targeted to institutional investors, along with a 

disclaimer that issuer has not quantified the effect of applying IFRS/ US GAAP / IND 

AS  to  its  financial  information  and  investor  may  make  their  own  judgment  in
