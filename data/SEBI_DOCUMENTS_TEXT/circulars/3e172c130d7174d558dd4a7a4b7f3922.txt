The formats of the said reports have been modified to incorporate the data on unit capital. The revised formats are enclosed. Accordingly, in future, MCR and ASR shall be submitted to SEBI in the revised format. 
 
It is also clarified that the details of the new scheme launched shall be reported in the MCR for the month in which the allotment is done. For eg. if an NFO closes in the month of July and the allotment is done in the month of August, then, the details of this new scheme shall be reported in the MCR for the month of August that will reach SEBI by 3rd of September.
