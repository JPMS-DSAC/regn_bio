Dear Sir,  
SUB:Statement from the brokers regarding forged/fake/stolen shares
It has been observed recently that cases of forged/fake/stolen shares which are introduced in the market are on the increase and most of them might have been introduced through the sub-brokers. You are therefore, advised, that while forwarding applications for registration of sub-brokers a statement from the recommending member broker should be furnished to the effect that the applicant sub-broker has not introduced any forged/fake/stolen shares in the market.
Henceforth, all the applications for sub-broker registrations should be sent along with the recommending member broker’s statement as mentioned above.
Thanking You,
Yours Faithfully,  
M.D.PATEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
