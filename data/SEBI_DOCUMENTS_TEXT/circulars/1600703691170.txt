Subject: Write-off of shares held by FPIs  
 
1.  SEBI,  vide  circular  number  IMD/FPI&C/CIR/P/2019/124 dated  November  05,  2019, 
had  issued  an  Operational  Guidelines  for  FPIs  and  DDPs  under  SEBI  (Foreign 
Portfolio Investors), Regulations 2019.  

 
2.  In  the  said  Operational  Guidelines,  write-off  of  securities  held  by  FPIs  who  wish  to 
surrender  their  registration  was  permitted  only  in  respect  of  shares  of  companies 
which  are  unlisted/illiquid/suspended/delisted.  However,  in  view  of  the  requests 
received from various stake holders, it has been decided to permit said FPIs to write-
off shares of all companies which they are unable to sell. In this regard, the process 
detailed at para 17 of Part C of the said Operational Guidelines shall be complied with.
