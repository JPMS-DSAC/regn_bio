company or a unit of an equity oriented fund, entered into in a recognised stock 
exchange, shall be determined in the following manner, namely:-

day in the netted settlement mode,- 

 

 

(i)  the quantity of shares or units purchased or sold in each trade in that 
equity  share  or  unit  executed  by  the  person  on  that  day,  shall  be 
multiplied by the price at which the trade is executed, to determine the 
trade value of each such trade; 

(ii) the aggregate trade value of all trades in the equity share or unit by the 
person  on  that  day  shall  be  arrived  at  by  totalling  the  trade  values 
determined under sub-clause (i); 

 
(iii) 

the aggregate trade value arrived at under sub-clause (ii), shall be

Page 2  

 

 

 

(iv) 

such volume weighted average price (rounded  off to the nearest 
paisa)  shall  be  taken  to  be  the  value  of  the  taxable  securities 
transaction relating to the equity share or unit. 

Explanation.-  For  the  removal  of  doubts,  it  is  hereby  clarified  that  the 
determination of the value of the taxable securities transaction 
under  this  clause  in  a  case  where  the  equity  share  or  unit  is 
purchased  or  sold  through  a  member  of  the  stock  exchange, 
shall  be  made  with  reference  to  the  trades  executed  in  the 
equity share or unit under a particular client Code through that 
member;  

 

(b) where the equity share or unit is purchased or sold by a person in the trade-
for-trade  settlement  mode,  the  value  of  the  taxable  securities  transaction 
shall be the price at which the equity share or unit is purchased or sold; 

 
(c) where the equity share or unit is purchased in the auction settlement mode, 
the value of the taxable securities transaction shall be the volume weighted 
average  price  of  the  equity  share  or  unit,  determined  in  the  manner 
specified in clause (a),  in respect of all trades in that equity share or unit 
carried out in the auction session; 

(d) where  the  equity  share  or  unit  is  sold  in  the  auction  settlement  mode,  the

equity share or unit is sold. 

 

Explan ation.- For the purposes of this rule –

transactions in a recognised stock exchange where the quantity of 
an equity share or unit purchased by a person on a trading day is set 
off against the quantity of that equity share or unit sold by him on 
that day and actual delivery is required to be taken or given by him 
as the case may be, only in respect of the net quantity purchased or 
sold as has not been so set off; 

 
(ii)  “trade-for-trade  settlement  mode”  means  a  mode  of  settlement  of 
transactions  in  a  recognised  stock  exchange  where  each  trade  is 
compulsorily required to be settled by actual delivery; 

 
(iii) “auction settlement mode” means a mode of settlement, in a stock 
exchange, of transactions carried out in the  auction session, being a 
trading  session  in  which  the  stock  exchange  makes  purchases  of 
equity shares or units through an auction process initiated by it, so 
as  to  settle  transactions  where  there  has  been  a  failure  to  deliver 
such equity shares or units which were required to be delivered.
