contracts  are  available,  scrips  that  fulfill  the  following  criteria  shall  be

MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-07/2005 dated February 23, 2005;  

AND 

(b)  Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) of the scrip, as defined at 
para  12  (a)  of  Annexure  2  of  the  MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir-14/2007 
dated December 20, 2007, shall not be less than Rs.100 crores; 

AND 

(c)  Average  monthly  trading  turnover  in  the  scrip  in  the  Cash 
Market  shall  not  be  less  than  Rs.100  crores  in  the  previous  six

SLB  transaction  shall  be  allowed  in  the  scrip  from  the  next  trading  day.
