It  is  observed  from  the  information  provided  by  the  depositories  that  the 
companies  listed  in  Annexure  ‘A’  have  established  connectivity  with  both  the 
depositories during the month of February 2008. 
 
The  stock  exchanges  may  consider  shifting  the  trading  in  these  securities  to 
rolling settlement subject to the following: 
 
a) 

At least 50% of other than promoter holdings as per clause 35 of Listing 
Agreement are in dematerialized mode before shifting the trading in the 
securities  of  the  company  from  TFT  segment  to  Rolling  segment.  For 
this  purpose,  the  listed  companies  shall  obtain  a  certificate  from  its 
Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) and submit the same to the stock 
exchange/s. However, if an issuer-company does not have a separate 
RTA, it may obtain a certificate in this regard from a practicing company 
Secretary/Chartered  Accountant  and  submit  the  same  to  the  stock 
exchange/s. 

There  are  no  other  grounds/reasons  for  continuation  of  the  trading  in 
TFTS. 

 
The  Stock  Exchanges  are  advised  to  report  to  SEBI,  the  action  taken  in  this 
regard in Section II, item no. 13 of the Monthly/Quarterly Development Report.

* Though the connectivity with both depositories took prior to February 2008, the name 
change was taken on record by BSE in December 2007. Subsequent to submission of 
requisite  documents  by  the  company,  the  scrip  is  now  eligible  for  shifting  to  rolling 
settlement subject to fulfillment of other applicable conditions of the listing agreement.
