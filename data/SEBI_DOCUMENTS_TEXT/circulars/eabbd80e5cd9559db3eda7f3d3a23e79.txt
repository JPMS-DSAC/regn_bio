The above-referred circulars provided for the conditions to be fulfilled for the acceptance of bank guarantees towards the base minimum and the incremental capital requirements of the brokers. In this respect, it was inter-alia mentioned that the bank guarantees should be from a specified scheduled commercial banks.
It has been represented to SEBI that Scheduled Co-operative Banks, which are being treated at par with the Scheduled Commercial Banks by the Reserve Bank of India, are also eligible to issue Bank Guarantee subject to the conditions specified by RBI from time to time. In view of this, in partial amendment to our circular dated July 31, 1997, it has been decided that the exchanges may also accept the bank guarantees from such Scheduled Co-operative Banks. The other provisions of the circulars mentioned above remain the same.
Yours faithfully
