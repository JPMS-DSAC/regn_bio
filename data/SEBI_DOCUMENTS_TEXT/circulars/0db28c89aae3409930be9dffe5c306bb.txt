Dear Sirs,
 
Sub : Key Information Memorandum
 
As you are aware, SEBI vide circular no. IIMARP/MF/CIR/06/793/98 dated March 31, 1998 had stipulated the details of the contents of Key Information Memorandum (KIM).
 
Considering the developments in the securities market in India and abroad and also keeping in view the interests of investors, SEBI had desired to revisit the KIM. Accordingly, SEBI had initiated a dialogue with the industry including AMFI for a standardised format of KIM. Taking into account the inputs received, a standardised format of KIM is being issued.
 
The Mutual Funds shall start using this standardised format as soon as possible but not later than September 30, 2004. This shall be updated at least once a year by 30th April of each financial year.
 
This is being issued in accordance with Regulation 77 of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.
 
Yours faithfully,Suresh Gupta
