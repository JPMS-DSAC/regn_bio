To 
All Recognized Stock Exchanges 
 
Sub:  Clarification regarding admission of Limited Liability Partnerships as 

members of Stock Exchanges. 

 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
We have received requests from various stock exchanges to permit Limited Liability 
Partnerships (LLPs) to be admitted as members of stock exchanges so as to enable them 
to get registration as stock broker under SEBI (Stock brokers and Sub-brokers) 
Regulations, 1992. 
 
2.             Securities  Contract  Regulation  Rules,  1957  (SCRR)  do  not  explicitly  mention 
LLPs as the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 was a subsequent development. As 
per  the  LLP  Act,  LLP  is  a  body  corporate.  Sub-rule  4A  and  5  of  Rule  8  of  the  SCRR 
provides that Limited Liability Companies (LLC) and partnership firms are eligible to be 
admitted as members of stock exchanges. In this context it may be stated that LLPs are 
akin to LLC and partnership firms. 
 
3.           In view of the above and since the Parliament has put in place a legal framework 
for LLPs, Stock Exchanges may consider granting membership to LLPs subject to LLP 
complying with the conditions laid down in Rule 8(4A) of the SCRR, as far as it can apply 
to LLPs.  

 

4.         The stock exchanges are advised to: 

a)  Bring  the  provisions  of  this  clarification  to  the  notice  of  the  Stock  Brokers 

and also disseminate the same on their websites. 

b)  Make  necessary  clarificatory  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules 
and regulations for the implementation of the above decision in coordination 
with one another to achieve uniformity in approach.
