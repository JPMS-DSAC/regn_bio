Dear Sir/Madam, 

Sub: Guidelines for Enabling Partial Two-Way Fungibility of Indian Depository Receipts 

 

(IDRs) 

 

1.  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of 

India 

(“SEBI”),  vide 

circular  No. 

CIR/CFD/DIL/10/2012  dated  August  28,  2012,  has  prescribed  the  framework  for 

redemption of IDRs into underlying equity shares. The circular has, inter alia, provided 

for partial fungibility of IDRs (i.e. redemption/conversion of IDRs into underlying equity 

shares)  in  a  financial  year  to  the  extent  of  25%  of  the  IDRs  originally  issued.  The 

Circular  also  stated  that  suitable  instructions  for  modifying  the  existing  legal 

framework governing IDRs, in order to implement the decision to allow redemption of 

IDRs  into  underlying  equity  shares  and  re-conversion  of  equity  shares  of  a  foreign 

issuer (which has already listed their IDRs) into IDRs, will be issued separately. 

 

2.  In order to encourage more number of foreign companies to issue IDRs in the Indian 

market and  also to  enable  the  investors  to  take  informed  investment  decision,  it  has 

been  decided  to  provide  a  detailed  roadmap  and  guidelines  for  the  future  IDR 

issuances as well as for the existing listed IDRs.  

 

3.  All  the  IDRs  shall  have  partial  two-way  fungibility.  The  partial  two-way  fungibility 

means  that  the  IDRs  can  be  converted  into  underlying  equity  shares  and  the 

underlying  equity  shares  can  be  converted  into  IDRs  within  the  available  headroom.  

The  headroom  for  this  purpose  shall  be  the  number  of  IDRs  originally  issued  minus 

the  number  of  IDRs  outstanding,  which  is  further  adjusted  for  IDRs  redeemed  into 

underlying equity shares (“Headroom”).
