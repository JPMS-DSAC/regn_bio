Cir/ CFD /DCR/5 /2010 
 
To 
The Managing Director/Executive Director/Administrator of all the Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 

Sub: Making Annual Reports of Listed Companies easily accessible.  

Pursuant  to  the  decision  to  discontinue  the  EDIFAR  site,  SEBI,  vide  its  circular  no. 
CIR/CFD/DCR/3/2010  dated  April  16,  2010,  has  advised  all  Stock  Exchanges  to  carry  out 
amendments  to  the  Equity  Listing  Agreement  viz  omission  of  Clause  51  from  the  Listing 
Agreement.  

Prior  to  its  omission,  Clause  51  of  the  Equity  Listing  Agreement  required  listed  companies  to 
inter-alia upload full version of Annual Report on EDIFAR website. However with discontinuation 
of EDIFAR site, it has become necessary to ensure that Annual Reports of listed companies are 
available/ easily accessible to investors on alternative sites. Accordingly all Stock Exchanges are 
advised to make the Annual Reports for the financial year 2009-10 onwards, submitted to Stock 
Exchange as per Clause 31 of Equity Listing Agreement, available on their respective websites.  

All  Stock  Exchanges  are  advised  to  take  immediate  steps  and  inform  us  the  status  of 
implementation at the earliest. 

 

 

 

Yours faithfully, 

Neelam Bhardwaj 
General Manager
