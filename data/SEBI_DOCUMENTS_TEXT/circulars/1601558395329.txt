Sir / Madam, 

 

Subject:  Review  of  provisions  regarding  valuation  of  debt  and  money  market 

instruments due to the COVID - 19 pandemic.  

 

1.  In  terms  of 

the  SEBI  Circular  No.  SEBI/HO/IMD/DF4/CIR/P/2019/102  dated 

September  24,  2019,  valuation  agencies  engaged  by  AMFI  recognize  default  of  a 

security under clause 5.1.1.2 and 9.1.2.  The said provisions were relaxed vide SEBI 

Circular  No.  SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/2020/70  dated  April  23,  2020  till  the  period  of 

moratorium permitted by Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  

 

2.  SEBI,  vide  Circular  No.  SEBI/HO/MIRSD/CRADT/CIR/P/2020/160  dated August 31, 

2020  has  provided  relaxation  to  Credit  Rating  Agencies  in  recognition  of  default for 

restructuring by the lender/ investors solely due to COVID-19 related stress.   

 

3.  In line with the same, discretion needs to be provided to valuation agencies engaged 

by AMCs/AMFI for recognition of default in case proposal of restructuring of debt is 

solely  due  to  COVID-19  related  stress.    For  the  said  purpose,  any  proposal  of 

restructuring  received  by  Debenture  Trustees  shall  be  communicated  to  investors 

immediately.  Further,  any  proposal 

received  by  Mutual  Funds 

from 

lenders/issuer/Debenture  Trustees  shall  be  reported  immediately  to  the  valuation 

agencies  (along  with  the  other  material  information  required  for  the  purpose  of 

valuation), Credit Rating Agencies and AMFI.  AMFI, on receipt of such information, 

shall immediately disseminate it to its members.

4.  Further,  if  the  valuation  agency,  based  on  its  assessment  of  the  proposal,  is  of  the 

view  that  the  proposed  restructuring  is  solely  due  to  fallout  of  COVID-19  pandemic 

then the valuation agency may not consider the restructuring / non receipt of the dues 

as a default for the purpose of valuation of money market or debt securities held by 

Mutual  Funds.  Further,  valuation  agencies  shall  ensure  that  change  in  terms  of 

investment,  financial  stress  of  the  issuer  and  the  capability  of  issuer  to  repay  the 

dues/borrowings on the extended dates are reflected in the valuation of the securities.  

 

5.  Further, in the scenario as stated above, if there is any difference in the valuation of 

securities  provided  by  two  valuation  agencies,  the  conservative  valuation  shall  be 

accepted.  

 

6.  The above modifications permitted to SEBI Circular dated September 24, 2019 shall 

be in force till December 31, 2020.   

 

7.  Further, as per the Principles of Fair Valuation specified in Eighth Schedule of SEBI 

(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, and other circulars issued, AMCs shall continue to 

be responsible for true and fairness of valuation of securities.  

 

8.  This Circular shall come into force with immediate effect.  

 

9.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  under  Section  11  (1)  of  the 

Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the  provisions  of 

Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to protect the interests of 

investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to  regulate  the 

securities market.
