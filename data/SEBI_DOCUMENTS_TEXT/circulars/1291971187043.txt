To All Registered Merchant Bankers / Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sirs, 

 

Sub:  Amendments to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 
 
I. 

In order to facilitate development of a vibrant primary market for corporate bonds in 
India, it has been decided to amend certain provisions of the SEBI (Disclosure and 
Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000.  Accordingly,  in  exercise  of  the  powers 
conferred  under  sub-section  (1)  of  Section  11  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Board of India Act, 1992, the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 
2000 have been amended.  

 
II.  The full text of amendments is given in detail in Annexure I and in brief as under: 
 

1.  Requirement  of  Credit  Rating:  For  public/  rights  issues  of  debt  instruments, 
SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 presently stipulate 
credit rating to be obtained from not less than two credit rating agencies. With 
a  view  to  reduce  the  cost  of  issuance  of  debt  instruments,  it  has now  been 
decided that credit rating from one credit rating agency would be sufficient.  

 
2.  Below  Investment  Grade  debt  instruments:  SEBI  (Disclosure  and  Investor 
Protection) Guidelines, 2000 currently require that the debt instruments issued 
through  a  public/rights  issue  shall  be  of  at  least  investment  grade.  In  a 
disclosure based regime, it should be left to the investor to decide whether or 
not  to  invest  in  a  non-investment  grade  debt  instrument.  Given  this,  and  in 
order  to  develop  market  for  debt  instruments,  it  has  been  decided  to  allow 
issuance of bonds which are below investment grade to the public to suit the 
risk/return appetite of investors. 

 

3.  Removal  of  Structural  Restrictions:  Further,  in  order  to  afford  issuers  with 
desired flexibility in structuring of instruments to suit their requirements, it has 
been decided  that  structural  restrictions  currently  placed  on  debt instruments 
such as those on maturity, put/call option on conversion, etc shall be removed. 

 

III.  The  amendments  made  vide  this  circular  shall  be  applicable  to  all  draft  offer 

documents filed with SEBI on or after the date of the circular. 

 
 

 

 
IV.  This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in under the  category 
“Legal Framework”. The entire text of the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) 
(DIP)  Guidelines,  2000,  including  the  amendments  issued  vide  this  circular,  is 
available on the SEBI website under the categories “Legal Framework”  and “Issues 
and Listing”. 

 
V.  All  registered  merchant  bankers  are  directed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the 

applicable amendments made vide this circular.  

 
VI.  All stock exchanges are advised to bring to the notice of all the listed companies, 
the amendments to norms on rating and removal of structural restrictions on  debt 
instruments.  

 
Yours faithfully, 
 
 
Parag Basu
