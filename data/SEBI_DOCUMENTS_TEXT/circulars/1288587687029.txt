SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 17/ 193751/2010 
February 04, 2010 

 
All Mutual Funds, Asset Management Companies (AMCs)  
  
 
Sir / Madam,  
 
 
Sub: Standard warning in Advertisements by Mutual Funds 
 
1.  Please refer to clause 2 of the circular SEBI/MFD/CIR No.6/ 12357/03 dated June 
26,  2003  and  SEBI  Circular  No.  SEBI/IMD/CIR  No.12/118340/08  dated February 
26, 2008 on Advertisements through Audio-Visual media and Standard warning in 
Advertisements by Mutual Funds, respectively. 

 
2.  As  per  the  present  guidelines,  in  advertisements  through  audio-visual  media  like 
television, a statement “Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read 
the  offer  document  carefully  before  investing”  is  required  to  be  displayed  on  the 
screen  for  at  least  5  seconds  and  be  accompanied  by  a  voice  over  reiteration. 
However, it has been observed that in some cases the visual and voice over were 
run for  less  than  5  seconds,  or  if  the  visual  stayed  for  5  seconds  the  voice  over 
either started late or ended early or both. In some cases extra words were inserted 
in the visual and voice over. As a result, the warning was rendered unintelligible to 
the viewer/listener. 

 
3.  In  order  to  improve  the  manner  in  which  the  said  message  is  conveyed  to  the 

investors it has been decided that with effect from May 01, 2010: 

 

i.  The  standard  warning  in  audio-visual  advertisement  shall  be  displayed  as 
“Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related 
documents carefully”.  

 
ii.  No addition or deletion of words shall be made in the standard warning. 

 
4.  It  is  evident  from  the  circular  dated  June  26,  2003,  that  the  visual  is  to  be 
accompanied by voice over. It is therefore re-emphasized that both the visual and 
the voice over of the standard warning will be run for at least 5 seconds. 

 
5.  All other conditions specified in the above mentioned circular remain unchanged. 
 
6.  All mutual funds shall comply with the above requirements in letter and spirit. 
 

7.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the  provisions  of 
Regulation  77  of  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  to  protect  the 
interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to 
regulate the securities market. 

 
Yours faithfully,  
 
 
 
Asha Shetty
