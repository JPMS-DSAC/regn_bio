SR.EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT
SMD/RCG/2796/96 July 16, 1996
To,
The Executive Directors of all Stock Exchanges at Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Gauhati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Ludhiana, Indore, Madras, Patna, Mangalore, Pune Rajkot, Kanpur & Vadodara
The Managing Directors of the NSEI and OTCEI.
Dear Sir,
Uniform Norms for Good/Bad Deliveries
One of the major problems afflicting the Secondary Market is that of bad deliveries caused by various factors, the main being, the non-transfer of shares of companies on account of signature differences. The different norms for good and bad deliveries adopted by Stock Exchanges further compound the problem.
SEBI has already taken several steps to deal with the problem. For example, SEBI has notified the Depositories Regulations facilitating setting up of depositories which will provide long term solution to the problem of bad deliveries and non-transfer of shares. SEBI has also advised all stock exchanges to amend their listing agreement to cast an obligation on the listed companies to transfer the shares within the prescribed period in case of minor signature difference, if no objection is received from the transferors. The problem has also been discussed by the Executive Committee of Inter Exchange Coordination Group of the Stock Exchanges. Based on their recommendations and further discussion with some of the major stock exchanges and custodians, SEBI has taken the following decisions on this subject:
i) All Stock Exchanges shall adopt uniform norms for good/bad deliveries (which are enclosed as Annexure "A") with immediate effect.
ii) Each Stock Exchange shall set up a separate Bad Delivery Cell (BDC) latest by August 31, 1996. This cell will deal with cases relating to bad deliveries received from its own members as well as those received from similar cells of other stock exchanges. The Exchanges will ensure that adequate insurance cover exists for possible transit loss.
iii) All stock exchanges shall adhere to the following time schedule for dealing with the cases of bad deliveries.
a) In case of deliveries coming under objection (objection cases), the first introducing broker of the same stock exchange shall be required to rectify the defects/replace the shares alongwith accrued benefits within 21 calendar days from the date of receipt of the objection and share certificates from the last buying broker of that exchange. If the former fails to rectify the defects or replace the shares or transfer deeds, the exchange shall hold an auction for shares in the immediately following Auction Session according to the usual exchange procedure. The shares obtained from such an auction shall be given by the Exchange to the concerned buying broker. Further, the exchange shall debit the price of the shares to the account of the introducing broker of that Exchange. In case the shares are not available through auction, the exchange shall close out the transaction according to the procedure of the exchange and the close out amount shall be debited to the first introducing broker and credited to the last buying broker of the exchange.

b) As regard the inter-exchange bad delivery cases, after the procedure outlined in para 2(iii)(a) has been followed, the introducing broker of the last exchange may submit his objection to the BDC of the Exchange of which he is the member. Such BDC of the last exchange (of which he is the member), in turn, within 7 days from receipt of such objection shall forward the objection along with share certificate to the BDC of the first exchange, where the shares were initially introduced. The BDC of the first exchange shall require its first introducing broker to rectify the objection or replace the shares within 21 days failing which the exchange shall take recourse to auction or thereafter close out, if required, and make consequent adjustment as indicated in para 2(iii)(a) above. Thereafter within 7 days BDC of the first exchange shall forward the rectified objection/replaced shares or shares received in auction or close out amount as the case may be to the BDC of the last exchange.
c) Procedures relating to inter-exchange bad deliveries shall be implemented on formation of BDCs (to be set up to August 31, 1996) at various exchanges pending which the present procedures may continue.

iv) All new objection cases on or after August 1, 1996 as well as all unrectified objection cases pending as on August 1, 1996 shall be settled according to the procedure and time schedule referred to in para 2 (iii) above.
v) In the event of shares coming under objection for the second time, they will be compulsorily auctioned /closed out as per the procedure of the Stock Exchange.
vi) The validity period of Company Objection by the last buying broker to be notified to the Exchange/introducing broker will be 36 months from the date of payment by the buyer.
vii) The Custodians shall also follow the uniform norms and procedures referred to above. Further, the custodian shall also be required to participate in settlement and bad delivery processes of clearing houses of the stock exchanges, so that on the one hand they get the benefit of the revised and expeditious system of speedy resolution of bad deliveries and on the other their risk would also be reduced.
viii) All the exchanges are directed to implement the decisions mentioned in para 2 above and send compliance reports to SEBI by September 15, 1996.
