A. Abridged Schemewise Annual Report Format
1.      Regulation 56 (1) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations 1996 (Regulations) prescribes the requirement of mailing Schemewise Annual Report of a mutual fund or an abridged summary thereof to the unitholders. 
2.      It was observed that there was a lack of uniformity in the contents of Abridged Schemewise Annual Report prepared by the Mutual Funds. In view of the same, in consultation with AMFI, a new format of Abridged Schemewise Annual Report is prescribed. The new format shall be applicable for the Abridged Schemewise Annual Report to be sent to the unitholders for the financial year 2007-08. 
3.      The Abridged Schemewise Annual Report may be mailed to the investors’ e-mail address if so mandated and the Schemewise Annual Report shall be displayed on the website of the mutual fund. However, as per regulation 56(3) of the Regulations, copy of Schemewise Annual Report shall be also made available to unitholder on payment of nominal fees.

Further, SEBI circular MFD/CIR/14/18337/2002 dated September 19, 2002 prescribes the additional information to be disclosed in the half yearly portfolio disclosures. In consultation with AMFI, it is now decided that a separate category of “Securitized Debt Instruments” shall be provided in the format under debt instruments.
