Sub:  Processing  of  Investor  Complaints  in  SEBI  Complaints  Redress 

System (SCORES) 

 
 

1.  SEBI has commenced processing of investor complaints in a centralized 
web based complaints redress system ‘SCORES’.  The salient features of 
this system are: 

 

•  Centralized database of all complaints. 
•  Online movement of complaints to the concerned intermediaries 
•  Online  upload  of  Action  Taken  Reports  (ATRs)  by  the  concerned 

entities, and 

•  Online  viewing  by  investors  of  action  on  the  complaints  and  its 

current status.  

 
 

2.  Accordingly,  henceforth  all  complaints  shall  be  forwarded  electronically 
through  SCORES  only.    You  are  hereby  directed  to  view  the  pending 
complaints  at  http://scores.gov.in/admin  and  submit  the  ATR  along  with 
supporting  documents  electronically  in  SCORES.  Please  note  that 
updation of action taken would not be possible with physical ATRs. Hence, 
submission of physical ATR will not be accepted for complaints lodged in 
SCORES.
