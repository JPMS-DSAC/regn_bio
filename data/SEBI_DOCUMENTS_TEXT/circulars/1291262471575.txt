The Managing Director / Executive Director / Administrator 
Of All Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub.:  Amendments to Equity Listing Agreement 
 
1. 

In order to bring more transparency and efficiency in the governance of a listed 
company,  it  has  been  decided  to  amend  certain  clauses  in  the  Equity  Listing 
Agreement. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred under sub-section 
(1) of Section 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, the 
Equity Listing Agreement is being amended to provide for the following: 

 
2. 

The full text of amendments is given in Annexure A and the brief amendments 
are as under: 

 
(i)  Clause 16 and 19: Notice period regarding Rights Issues 

In  order  to  reduce  the  time  duration  for  a  Rights  Issue,  SEBI  has  decided  to 
amend  the  SEBI  (DIP)  guidelines  and  the  Listing  Agreement.  The  reduction  in 
timelines  would  reduce  the  market  risk  faced  by  an  issuer  and  ensure  faster 
turnaround  of  money  for  investors.  There  are  also  certain  amendments  to  bring 
homogeneity in the number of days for notice period and for record date in case of 
rights issue.    

(ii)  Clause 24: “Fairness Opinion” of independent merchant banker 

In order to safeguard the interest of shareholders, the listed company as well as 
the unlisted company which are getting merged shall each be required to appoint 
an  independent  merchant  banker  for  giving  a  fairness  opinion  on  the  valuation 
done by valuers. Further, the “Fairness opinion” of the merchant bankers shall be 
made available to the shareholders at the time of approving the resolution under 
Clause 24. 

(iii)  Clause  41:  Submission  &  Publication  of  Financial  Results:  In  order  to  bring 
more efficiency in the disclosures of financial results, it has been decided to modify 
Clause 41 of the listing agreement. The major modifications are as follows: 

a.  Time limit for submission of financial results to stock exchanges: A listed 
entity  in  addition  to  submitting  quarterly  and  year  to  date  standalone 
financial results within one month of end of the quarter may also submit 
consolidated  financial  results  to  the  stock  exchange  within  two  months 
from the end of the quarter. 

2 

b.  Publication  of 

to  submit 
consolidated  financial  results  in  addition  to  standalone  results  to  the 
stock exchanges shall publish consolidated financial results only.  

financial  results:  A 

listed  entity  opting 

c.  Limited  review  report  to  be  placed  before  Board  of  Directors:  A  listed 
entity would be required to place the limited review report on un-audited 
financial  results  before  its  board  of  directors  /  committee  before 
submission to stock exchanges only if the variation (as defined in present 
Clause  41)  between  un-audited  financials  and  financials  amended 
pursuant to limited review for the same period exceeds 10%. 

d.  Submission  of  limited  review  report  in  case  of  last  quarter:  Where  the 
listed  entity  chooses  to  submit  un-audited  financial  results  for  the  last 
quarter  (instead  of  submitting  audited  financial  results  for  the  entire 
financial year within 3 months of end of financial year), the limited review 
report shall be submitted for the last quarter also.   

Applicability: 

Changes  in  Clauses  16,  19,  24  and  41  of  the  Equity  Listing  Agreement 
mentioned  above  would  be  applicable  with  immediate  effect.  However,  with 
regard to Clause 41, the provisions under sub-clause (VI) item (b) relating to 
submission and publication of the financial results shall be applicable from the 
second quarter onwards for the current financial year. 
 

This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the 
categories “Legal Framework” and “Issues and Listing”.

accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in India.  
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts disclosed as financial results.  An audit also 
includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by

These financial results incorporate the relevant returns of _____(number) branches audited by us, 
____  (number)  branches  including  _____  (number)  foreign  branches  audited    by  the  other 
auditors  specially  appointed  for  this  purpose  and  unaudited  returns  in  respect  of  _______

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us
