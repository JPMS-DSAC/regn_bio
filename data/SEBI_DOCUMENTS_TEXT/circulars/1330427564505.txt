All Mutual Funds/ Asset Management Companies (AMCs)  
 
Sir/Madam, 

Sub: Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 February 28, 2012 

A. Distributor Due Diligence  
 
1.  Please refer to SEBI circular no. SEBI/IMD/DF/13/2011 dated August 22, 2011 regarding the 

captioned matter. 

 
2.  It  is  hereby  clarified  that  the  due  diligence  of  distributors  is  solely  the  responsibility  of 
mutual  funds/AMCs.  This  responsibility  shall  not  be  delegated  to  any  agency.  However, 
mutual  funds/AMCs  may  take  assistance  of  an  agency  of  repute  while  carrying  out  due 
diligence process of distributors. 

 
B. Clarification to Regulation 24 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996  
 
1.  In  order  to  address  the  issue  of  conflict  of  interest  wherein  a  fund  manager  manages 
schemes of Mutual Fund and is engaged in other permissible activities of AMC, SEBI has 
amended Regulation 24 of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.  

2.  The amended Regulation mandates that AMCs shall appoint separate fund manager for 
each  separate  fund  managed  by  it  unless  the  investment  objectives  and  assets 
allocations are the same and the portfolio is replicated across all the funds managed by 
the fund manager.  

3.  It  has  been  represented  to  SEBI  that  the  perfect  replication  of  portfolio  between  the 
mutual  fund  scheme  and  schemes/products  under  other  permissible  activities  of  AMC 
may not be achieved at all times.  

4.  On examination of the same, it has been decided that the replication of minimum 70% of 
portfolio  value  shall  be  considered  as  adequate  for  the  purpose  of  said  compliance, 
provided that  AMC has in place  a written policy for trade allocation and  it ensures at all 
points of time that the fund manager shall not take directionally opposite positions in the 
schemes managed by him. 

5.  In order to bring transparency while addressing the issue of conflict of interest wherein  a 
fund  manager  is  common  across  mutual  fund  schemes  and  schemes/products  under 
other permissible activities of AMC, then the AMC shall :  

a)  disclose  on  their  websites,  the  returns  provided  by  the  said  manager  for  all  the 

schemes (mutual fund, pension funds, offshore funds etc) on a monthly basis.

the details of returns of all the schemes (mutual fund, pension funds, offshore funds 
etc) managed by that fund manager shall be provided. 

c)  in case the difference between the annual returns provided by the schemes managed 
by the same fund manager is more than 10% then the same shall be reported to the 
trustee and explanation for the same shall be disclosed on the website of the AMC. 

C. This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities 
and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the  provisions  of  Regulation  77  of  SEBI 
(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to
