Regulation  36(4)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations, 1996  and circulars  thereof,  at 

present  provides  information  in  terms  of  name  of  scheme/s  where  the  investor  has 

invested, number of units held and its market value, among other details. To increase 

transparency of information to investors, it has been decided that: 

1.  Each CAS issued to the investors shall also provide the total purchase value / cost 

of investment in each scheme.  

2.  Further,  CAS  issued  for  the  half-year  (ended  September/  March)  shall  also 

provide: 

a.  The  amount  of  actual  commission  paid  by  AMCs/Mutual  Funds  (MFs)  to 

distributors (in absolute terms) during the half-year period against the concerned 

investor’s  total  investments  in  each  MF  scheme.  The  term  ‘commission’  here 

refers to all direct monetary payments and other payments made in the form of 

gifts  /  rewards,  trips,  event  sponsorships  etc.  by  AMCs/MFs  to  distributors. 

Further,  a  mention  may  be  made  in  such  CAS  indicating  that  the  commission 

disclosed  is  gross  commission  and  does  not  exclude  costs  incurred  by 

distributors  such  as  service  tax  (wherever  applicable,  as  per  existing  rates), 

operating expenses, etc.
