which dealing may be permitted by stock exchanges operating in IFSC. Based on the 
recommendations of the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI, it has been

(hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‘Derivatives  on  equity  shares’)  as  permissible  security 
under sub-clause (vi) of Clause 7 of SEBI (IFSC) Guidelines, 2015. Accordingly, the 
recognized stock exchanges operating in IFSC may permit dealing in ‘Derivatives on 
equity shares’, subject to prior approval of SEBI.

SEBI  Circular  IMD/HO/FPIC/CIR/P/2017/003  dated  January  04,  2017,  and  eligible 
entities  which  are  incorporated  and  operating  in  IFSC  shall  be  eligible  to  trade  in 
‘derivatives on equity shares’.  

4.  The  applicable  position  limits  for  eligible  participants  shall  be  as  stipulated  vide

5.  The Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) for ‘derivatives on equity shares’ shall be 
equal to  ten percent of the number of shares held by non-promoters in the relevant 
underlying  security  (i.e.  free-float  holding).  Further,  the  MWPL  for  ‘derivatives  on 
equity shares’ in recognized stock exchanges in  IFSC shall be  reckoned  separately 
from that in recognized stock exchanges in domestic market and the MWPL (in value 
terms),  in  no  circumstances,  shall  exceed  the  fifty  percent  of  the  MWPL  (in  value 
terms) in recognized stock exchanges in domestic market. 

6.  This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) 
of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  to  protect  the  interests  of
