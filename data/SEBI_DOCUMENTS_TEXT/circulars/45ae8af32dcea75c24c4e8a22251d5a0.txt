Dear Sir/Madam
Segment Reporting in Quarterly Financial Results under Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement
This is in continuation to our circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir- 44/2001 dated August 31, 2001, advising the stock exchanges to amend Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement to provide that companies shall be required to furnish segment wise Revenue, Results and Capital Employed along with and as a part of the quarterly financial results with effect from the quarters ending on or after September 30, 2001 as per the format prescribed.
Representations have been received from some Chambers of Commerce and companies expressing difficulties in complying with the requirement of segment reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 and seeking some more time to be able to set up necessary and adequate systems for the purpose of this reporting.
In view of the representations and the difficulties expressed by Chambers and Companies, it has been decided to make the Segment Reporting requirement voluntary for the quarter ended September 30, 2001.
Yours faithfully,
