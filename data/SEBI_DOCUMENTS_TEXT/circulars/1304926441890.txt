To, 
 
All Depositories/ all Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:  Review of Annual Issuers’ charges 
 

1.  Please  refer  to  SEBI  Circulars  No.  MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir-4/2005  dated 
January  28,  2005  and  No.  MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir-2/2009  dated  February  10, 
2009 on the captioned subject matter. 
 

2.  In partial modification to the above circulars, it has been decided to modify the 
methodology  of  calculating  the  Annual  Issuers  charges.  The  annual  issuer 
charges would be based on the average no. of folios (ISIN positions) during 
the previous financial year instead of the total number of folios (ISIN positions) 
as on 31st March of the previous financial year.  
 

3.  The average no. of folios (ISIN positions) for an Issuer may be arrived at by 
dividing  the  total  number  of  folios  for  the  entire  financial  year  by  the  total 
number of working days in the said financial year.   
 

4.  All the Stock Exchanges are advised to:- 

 
4.1.   implement the above by making necessary amendments to the bye-laws 

and Listing Agreement, as applicable; 
 

4.2.  to  bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the  notice  of  the  listed 
companies/Issuers and also to put up the same on the website for easy 
access to the investors; and 
 

4.3.  communicate to SEBI the status of the implementation of the provisions 
of  this  circular  and  the  action  taken  in  this  regard  in  the  Monthly 
Development Report. 

 
5.  The Depositories are advised to:-
