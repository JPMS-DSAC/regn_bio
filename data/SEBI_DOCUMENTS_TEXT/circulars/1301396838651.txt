Despite the statutory requirement, large number of Sub-brokers in the Securities Market are unregistered. The issue was discussed during annual meeting of the Stock Exchanges held in SEBI on March 19, 1997. It was decided in the meeting that transfer deed bearing rubber stamps on the reverse thereof other than those of clearing members of the stock exchanges/clearing house/clearing corporations, SEBI registered sub-brokers and remisiers registered with the stock exchanges shall be treated as bad delivery in stock exchanges. This shall apply to all transfer deeds dated June 1, 1997 and thereafter. We had earlier circulated the guidelines for filing the applications for registration by the sub-brokers vide our letter no SMD/OPG/AA/1020/96 dated March 14,1996 (copy enclosed for ready reference).As referred in our aforesaid letter you are requested to keep sufficient Stocks of Form ‘B’(application form for registration as Sub-broker) and Form’C’(recommendation letter to be given by the member with whom the Sub-broker is affiliated),for free distribution amongst applicants. In September 1993,we had prescribed a model agreement to be entered between broker and the sub-broker. The model agreement has now been revised based upon suggestions received from the market participants. A copy of the revised agreement is enclosed The salient features of the revised model agreement are as under : 1.The registered sub-broker can transact only through the member broker who had recommended his application for registration by signing form C. If the Sub-broker is desirous of doing business with more than one broker, he will have to obtain separate registration in each case.   1.It will be mandatory for the sub-broker to disclose the name of all other sub-brokers/brokers where he is having direct or indirect interest. 1.It shall be the responsibility of the broker to report the default if any of his sub-broker to all other brokers with whom sub-broker is affiliated.     1.The earlier stipulation of keeping the deposits received from sub-brokers with the stock exchange has now been removed.     1.The agreement can be terminated by giving the notice in writing of not less than 6 months by either party.     1.Sub-brokers are obligated to enter into agreements and maintain the database of their clients / investors on the pattern of format forwarded to the stock exchanges by our circular No.SMD/POLICY/CIR/5-97 dated April 11 1997.It is clarified that the sub-broker already registered with SEBI have to maintain database of their client/investor. We advise you to bring the content of this letter to the notice of your members.

The applications from sub-brokers were invited in May, 1992 through recognised Stock Exchanges for registration with SEBI. A large number of applications were received and registration granted to approximately 1200 applicants fulfilling the requirements.     It is felt that a large number of sub-brokers still are not registered with SEBI and therefore carrying out their activities without any valid legal sanction. SEBI at its end has started returning all incomplete applications directly to the applicants. Those who were already in the business of sub-broking and had applied for registration before 21st May, 1992 are being advised to re-submit their applications complete in all respects within two months failing which it shall be construed that they are acting as sub-brokers without holding certificates of registration in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992. The applicants who had applied after 21st May, 1992, are being advised to stop the business of sub-broking immediately which can be re-started after they are duly registered with SEBI.      We have devised guidelines for making applications complete in all respects. A copy of the same is being enclosed for your perusal. Co-operation from the Stock Exchanges will help us immensely in registering and regulating this class of capital market intermediaries.     ... 2/-          -: 2 :-          We request you to keep sufficient stock of Form 'B' (application form for registration as sub-broker) and Form 'C'(recommendation letter to be given by the member with whom the sub-broker is affiliated), for free distribution amongst applicants. We are enclosing a copy of these forms. In September, 1993, we had sent a copy of model agreement advising you to circulate the same amongst your members. This agreement between broker and sub-broker specifies the scope of their rights and liabilities. A copy of the same is once again being enclosed with a request that sufficient number of copies may be kept available and supplied to desirous applicants.     We advise you to bring the contents of this letter to the notice of your members by suitable display on your notice board. Applicants who had applied earlier and not heard anything from SEBI may be advised in their own interest to make fresh application complete in all respects in accordance with attached guidelines.
