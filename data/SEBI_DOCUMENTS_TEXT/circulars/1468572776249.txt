All recognized Clearing Corporations 
 
Dear Sir / Madam, 

Sub: Acceptance of Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs) by Clearing Corporations 

1)  Currently, Fixed Deposit Receipts  of banks are accepted by Clearing Corporations 

as eligible collateral from the participants. 

2) 

It is observed that some banks who are also trading members/ clearing members on 
the  Stock  Exchange/Clearing  Corporation  have  placed  Fixed  Deposit  Receipts 
issued by themselves as Collateral, with the Clearing Corporation. 

3)  SEBI  as  a  member  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions 
(IOSCO) has implemented various standards of the Principles for Financial Market 
Infrastructures  (PFMIs).  The  Risk  Management  Review  Committee  of  SEBI  also 
considered  the  PFMI  principle  5  on  'Collateral'  while  deliberating  on  the  issue  of 
'deposit of collateral' with the Clearing Corporation. 

4)  Based on recommendations of the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI, it 
has  been  decided  to  further  align  the  risk  management  practices  of  the  securities 
market  with  the  PFMIs.  Therefore,  the  Clearing  Corporations  are  advised  to 
implement the following -  

a)  Clearing  corporation  shall  not  accept  Fixed  Deposit  Receipts  (FDRs)  from 
trading/clearing members as collateral, which are issued by the trading/ clearing 
member themselves or banks who are associate of trading/ clearing member.  
 
Explanation  -  for  this  purpose,  'associate'  shall  have  the  same  meaning  as 
defined under Regulation 2 (b) of SECC Regulations 2012. 
 

b)  Trading/Clearing  Members  who  have  deposited  their  own  FDRs  or  FDRs  of 
associate banks shall replace such collateral, with other eligible collateral as per 
extant  norms,  within  a  period  of  six  months  from  the  date  of  issuance  of  the 
circular. 

 

5)  Clearing corporations are directed to:
