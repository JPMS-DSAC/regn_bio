Dear Sir/Madam, 

Introduction of system-driven disclosures in securities market 

 

1.  SEBI has specified the disclosure requirements relating to acquisition, sale and pledge 

of  securities  under  the  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers) 

Regulations,  2011  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "SAST  Regulations")  and  SEBI 

(Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  2015  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "PIT 

Regulations")  in  order  to  bring  in  transparency  and  promote  orderly  conduct  in  the 

market.  Since  the  Stock  Exchanges,  Depositories  and  Registrar  and  Share  Transfer 

Agents  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "RTAs")  have  adopted  advanced  systems  and 

technologies,  it  has  been  decided  to  explore  the  possibility  of  disclosing  such 

information based on these systems.  

 

Implementation in phases:- 

2.  Since the entire information as required under the current disclosure obligations is not 

available in the current systems (e.g. details of instruments other than equity shares, 

PACs etc.), the proposed system shall be implemented in phases. In the first phase, 

the systems shall disclose the changes in shareholding of promoter/promoter group of 

the 

listed  entities.  The  disclosures 

in 

the 

first  phase  shall  pertain 

to 

acquisition/disposal of equity shares by promoters/promoter group based on specified 

thresholds  under  the  SAST  Regulations  and  PIT  Regulations  and  pledge  of  equity 

shares by promoters/promoter group under the SAST Regulations.

3.  Initially,  this  system  would  run  in  parallel  with  the  existing  system  i.e.  the 

promoters/promoter  group  shall  continue  to  comply  with  the  disclosure 

obligations as applicable to them.  

 

4.  Based  on  the  experience  gained  in  the  first  phase,  subsequent  phase(s)  would  be 

implemented to include the information for non-promoters and instruments other than 

equity shares.  

 

5.  The  listed  entities,  RTAs,  Depositories  and  Exchanges  shall  make  necessary 

arrangements in their systems such that the first phase is implemented from January 

01, 2016.  

 

6.  The procedure required for implementation of the first phase is provided at  Annexure 

- A. 

 

7.  The disclosures generated through the system shall be displayed separately from the 

regular disclosures filed with the exchanges.  

 

8.  The Depositories and Exchanges shall prescribe the detailed modalities for uploading 

and  exchange  of  data  with  RTAs  in  order  to  maintain  uniformity  and  consistency  of 

data. 

 

9.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  by  section  11(1)  of  the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interests of investors 

in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.  

 

10. This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  categories 

“Legal Framework/Circulars”.

ANNEXURE - A 

 

Procedure 

 

The following  would  be  the  steps  / process required  to  be  taken for  implementation  of 

the first phase: 

1.  The  first  step  would  be  to  build  an  accurate  database  of  the  existing  holdings  at 

ISIN  level  of  all  the  promoters  /  promoter  group.  The  listed  company  through  its 

RTA  will  be  required  to  provide  to  the  depositories  the  information  about 

promoters  and  promoter  groups  of  the  companies.  The  information  provided  by 

the listed company to the RTA must be authenticated and shall be provided within 

15 days from the date of this circular. The information provided by the RTAs to the 

depositories  shall  be  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  depositories  and  must  also 

include  the  PAN  of  the  promoter/promoter  group.  In  respect  of  PAN  exempt 

entities, the account numbers will be provided.  

 

2.  Based  on  the  PAN/account  numbers,  the  depositories  will  tag  such  demat 

accounts  in  their  depository  systems  at  ISIN  level  as  of  the  promoter/promoter 

group.  

 

3. 

In case of any subsequent changes in the promoter or promoter group of the listed 

company,  the  company  through  RTA  shall  provide  the  information  of  the  new 

promoter(s) to the depositories. 

 

4. 

In  respect  of  the  identified  promoters  and  promoter  groups  for  an  ISIN,  the 

respective  depositories  will  generate  the  required  information  and  send  it  to  the 

RTAs on a daily basis at the end of each working day.  

 

5.  The RTAs will then aggregate the dematerialised shareholding data received from 

both  the  depositories  and  the  physical  shareholding  of  the  promoter/promoter 

group.  Based  on  the  defined  criteria  as  per  the  regulations  (For  e.g.,  aggregate 

holding of a promoter across both depositories and physical shareholding exceed

a specified percentage or value), the RTAs will generate reports and provide it to 

the respective stock exchange(s). The stock exchanges shall then disseminate the 

data on its website in accordance with the respective regulations.  

 

6.  The  RTAs  may  then  check  the  disclosures  made  by  the  promoter  entities  as  per 

the  current  regulatory  requirements  and  match  the  same  with  the  disclosure 

generated by the systems so that any discrepancies may be found and necessary 

action  taken  for  rectification  of  the  same.  The  Promoters  or  members  of  the 

Promoter  Group  must  also  take  up  the  issue  of  discrepancy  with  the  respective 

Stock Exchanges which may then be communicated to the respective RTA.
