1.  The  disclosure  filings  under  Regulations  30(1),  30(2)  and  31(4)  of  the  SEBI 
(Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations,  2011  (SAST

logistical challenges.

of Regulations 30(1), 30(2) and 31(4) of the SAST Regulations for the financial 
year ending March 31, 2020 to June 01, 2020.
