Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:) Display of Details by Stock Brokers (including Trading Members 
 
1.  It is observed that a few stock brokers are using brand names / logos of their 
group  companies  in  their  portals,  notice/display  boards,  advertisements, 
publications,  correspondences  with  outsiders  and  various  documents.  They 
are  either  not  using  the  names  as  registered  with  SEBI  or  using  the  brand 
names / logos of group companies more prominently. This creates confusion 
in the minds of the investors in the market. 
 

2.  In consultation with the Investors Associations and major stock exchanges, it 
has been decided that while a stock broker may use the brand name / logo of 
its group companies, it must display more prominently: 

(a) its name as registered with SEBI, its own logo, if any, its registration 
number,  and  its  complete  address  with  telephone  numbers  in  its  portal 
/web  site,  if  any,  notice  /  display  boards,  advertisements,  publications, 
know your client forms, and member client agreements; 
 
(b) its name as registered with SEBI, its own logo, if any, its registration 
number, and its complete address with telephone numbers, the name of 
the  compliance  officer,  his  telephone  number  and  e-mail  address  in 
contract  notes,  statement  of  funds  and  securities,  and  correspondences 
with the clients.  

 
3.  The stock exchanges are directed to bring this to the notice of their members 
and make necessary amendments to the bye-laws, rules and regulations to 
implement the above decision. They shall include the compliance of the said 
circular as part of their inspection and internal audit by stock brokers. They 
shall  also  monitor  compliance  of  this  circular  by  stock  brokers  and  send 
annually a list of stock brokers who have not complied with the circular, while 
sending report on internal audit of the stock brokers.  
 

4.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interests 
of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate
