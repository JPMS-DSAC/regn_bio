It  is  observed  from  the  information  provided  by  the  depositories  that  the

At least 50% of other than promoter holdings as per clause 35 of Listing

this  purpose,  the  listed  companies  shall  obtain  a  certificate  from  its 
Registrar  and  Transfer  Agent  (RTA)  and  submit  the  same  to  the  stock 
exchange/s.  However,  if  an  issuer-company  does  not  have  a  separate

Secretary/Chartered  Accountant  and  submit  the  same  to  the  stock 
exchange/s.
