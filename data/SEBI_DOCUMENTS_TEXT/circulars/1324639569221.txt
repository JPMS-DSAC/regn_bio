3.     
 

In-Person Verification (IPV): 

With  regard  to  the  requirement  of  in-person’  verification  (IPV),  SEBI  has  issued 
guidelines  to  the  stock  brokers  and  depository  participants  (DPs).  However,  in  line 
with  the  uniformity  brought  out  in  the  KYC  procedure  across  intermediaries,  the  IPV 
requirements  for  all  the  intermediaries  have  now  been  streamlined  and  harmonized, 
as follows:  
 
i. 

It  shall  be  mandatory  for  all  the  intermediaries  addressed  in  this  circular  to  carry 
out IPV of their clients.  

iii. 

iv. 

ii.  The intermediary  shall  ensure  that  the  details  like  name  of  the  person  doing  IPV, 
his designation, organization with his signatures and date are recorded on the KYC 
form at the time of IPV.  
The  IPV  carried  out  by  one  SEBI  registered  intermediary  can  be  relied  upon  by 
another intermediary.  
In  case  of  Stock  brokers,  their  sub-brokers  or  Authorised  Persons  (appointed  by 
the  stock  brokers  after  getting  approval  from  the  concerned  Stock  Exchanges  in 
terms of SEBI Circular No. MIRSD/DR-1/Cir-16/09 dated November 06, 2009) can 
perform the IPV. 
In  case  of  Mutual  Funds,  their  Asset  Management  Companies  (AMCs)  and  the 
distributors  who  comply  with  the  certification  process  of  National  Institute  of 
Securities  Market  (NISM)  or  Association  of  Mutual  Funds  (AMFI)  and  have 
undergone  the  process  of  ‘Know  Your  Distributor  (KYD)’,  can  perform  the  IPV. 
However,  in  case  of  applications  received  by  the  mutual  funds  directly  from  the
