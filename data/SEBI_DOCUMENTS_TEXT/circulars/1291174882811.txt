The Managing Director / Executive Director 
of Derivative Segment of NSE & BSE 
and their Clearing House / Corporation. 
 
 
Dear Sir, 
 

Sub: Extending calendar spread treatment till expiry of the near month contract 

 
 
This  is  in  continuation  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  IES/DC/CIR-4/99  dated  July  28,  1999, 
Circular  No. 
IES/DC/CIR-5/00  dated  December  11,  2000  and  Circular  No. 
SMDRP/DC/CIR-10/01  dated  November  2,  2001  regarding  risk  containment  measures 
for Exchange traded equity derivatives, including calendar spread positions. 
 
In terms of the aforesaid circulars, a calendar spread is treated as a naked position in the 
far month contract three trading days prior to the expiry of the near month contract. The 
removal of calendar spread treatment three trading days prior to the expiry of the near 
month contract leads to a sudden increase in margins without any corresponding increase 
in the risk of the spread position. 
 
It has, therefore, been decided that henceforth a calendar spread position on Exchange 
traded equity derivatives may be granted calendar spread treatment till the expiry of the 
near month contract. 
 
This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 
11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, to protect the interests of 
investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities 
market. 
 
This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in,  under  the  category 
“Derivatives – Circulars”.  
 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
 
SUJIT PRASAD
