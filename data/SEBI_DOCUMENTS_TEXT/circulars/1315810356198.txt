Sir/Madam, 

 

Sub:  Redressal  of  investor  grievances  against  Depository  Participants  (DPs)  in 

SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES) 

  
1.  SEBI has commenced processing of investor grievances in a centralized web-based 

complaints redressal system, ‘SCORES’. The salient features of this system are: 

 

•  Centralized database of all complaints; 
•  Online movement of complaints to the concerned entities; 
•  Online upload of Action Taken Reports (ATRs) by the concerned entities; and 
•  Online tracking of status of complaints by investors. 

  
2.  The investor grievances received by SEBI against DPs will be taken up electronically 
with the concerned Depositories through SCORES (https://scores.gov.in/Admin). The 
Depositories shall, in turn, take up the matter with the concerned DPs. 

 
3.  The DPs shall take adequate steps for redressal of grievances within one month from 
the date of receipt of the complaint and keep the investor/Depositories duly informed 
of the action taken thereon. Failure to comply with the said requirement will render the 
DP liable for penal action.  

 

4.  The Depositories shall: 

 
a)  put  in  place  a  suitable  mechanism  to  follow  up  with  the  DPs,  wherever 

necessary; 

b)  devise  a  system  to  levy  penalty  on  DPs  for  any  non-compliance  with  the 

requirements specified in para 3 above; 

c)  update  the  status  of  the  complaints  in  SCORES,  at  every  stage,  along  with 

supporting documents; and  

d)  ensure that the status of investor complaints disclosed on their websites is in 

conformity with the status updated in SCORES.
