Dear Sir, 

 

Subject:  Uploading  of  the  existing  clients’  KYC  details  in  the  KYC  Registration 
Agency (KRA) system by the intermediaries 

Please  refer  to  SEBI  circular  no.  CIR/MIRSD/16/2011  dated  August  22,  2011, 
MIRSD/SE/Cir-21/2011  dated  October  5,  2011,  MIRSD/Cir-23/2011  dated  December  2, 
2011 and MIRSD/Cir- 26 /2011 dated December 23, 2011 on KYC related issues. 
 
1.  SEBI simplified the account opening process for investors and made it uniform across 
intermediaries  in  the  securities  markets  vide  aforementioned  circulars.  Further,  to 
avoid duplication of KYC process with every intermediary, KRA system was developed 
for centralization of the KYC records in the securities markets. The system was made 
applicable for new clients who opened accounts with the intermediaries from January 
1, 2012. 
 

2.  Now,  for  convenience  of  the  clients  registered  prior  to  January  1,  2012  (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘existing clients’) and to expand the centralized database of  the KYC 
records of the entire securities market, it is decided to upload the KYC details of the 
existing clients of the intermediaries in the current KRA system, in a phased manner.  
 

3.  The following guidelines for uploading the KYC data of the existing clients are being 
issued  in  consultation  with  the  major  Stock  Exchanges,  Depositories,  KRAs,  AMFI 
Brokers’ Associations and market participants: 
 
a.  For existing clients who trade / invest / deal with the intermediary anytime during 
the time period specified in the table given below starting from April 16, 2012, the 
intermediaries  shall  forthwith  upload  their  KYC  details  in  the  KRA  system.  They 
shall  also  send  original  KYC  documents  to  the  KRA  on  continuous  basis  and 
complete the process within the prescribed time limits.

Considering the representations made by the intermediaries, they may send print 
outs  of  scanned  documents  to  the  KRAs  instead  of  original  documents  in 
accordance with the schedule, certifying that they have retained the originals.  
 
However, they must complete the process of sending the original documents to the 
KRA by March 31, 2013.    
 
The KRAs shall update their systems and send letters to the clients for the receipt 
of the initial / updated KYC documents from intermediary in accordance with the 
time schedule.  
 
The  intermediaries  shall  maintain  electronic  records  of  the  KYCs  of  their  clients 
and keeping physical records would not be necessary.  
 
Schedule for implementation (For the year 2012-13): 
 

 
The  KYC  data  of  the  existing  clients,  who  trade  /  invest  or  deal  after  the  above 
mentioned schedule, shall be uploaded on a continuous basis. 
 

b.  While  uploading  the  existing  clients’  KYC  details  in  the  KRA  system,  the 
intermediary  shall  indicate  the  date  of  account  opening  /  activation  /  updation  of 
information. Necessary provisions shall be made by the KRAs in their systems. In 
case the KRA system indicates that the client’s KYC data already exists, the other 
intermediary shall upload the modifications, if any, after the aforesaid date so that 
the latest information about the client is available on the KRA system.  

 
c.  The intermediary shall highlight the KYC details about the existing client which is 
missing / not available, as per the KYC requirements specified vide circular dated 
October 5, 2011, only if it was not mandated earlier, when the client’s account was 
opened. KRAs shall make necessary provisions in their systems to categorize the
