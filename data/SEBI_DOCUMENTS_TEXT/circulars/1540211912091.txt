Sir / Madam, 

 

Subject:  Total  Expense  Ratio  (TER)  and  Performance  Disclosure  for  Mutual 

Funds 

 

A.  Transparency in TER 

 

In  order  to  bring  transparency  in  expenses,  reduce  portfolio  churning  and  mis-

selling in mutual fund (MF) schemes, the following shall be adhered to:   

 

1.  In  terms  of  Regulation  52(1)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  all 

scheme  related  expenses  including  commission  paid  to  distributors,  by 

whatever name it may be called and in whatever manner it may be paid, shall 

necessarily  be  paid  from  the  scheme  only  within  the  regulatory  limits  and  not 

from  the  books  of  the  Asset  Management  Companies  (AMC),  its  associate, 

sponsor, trustee or any other entity through any route. 

 

2.  MFs/  AMCs  shall  adopt  full  trail  model  of  commission  in  all  schemes,  without 

payment  of  any  upfront  commission  or  upfronting  of  any  trail  commission, 

directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, through sponsorships, or any other route.

However, upfronting of trail commission will be allowed only in case of  inflows 

through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs).  

 

 

3.  In  respect  of  inflows  through  SIPs  into  MF  schemes,  a  carve  out  has  been 

considered only for new investors to the MF industry (to be identified based on 

PAN). The upfronting of trail commissions, based on SIP inflows, shall be up to 

1%  payable  yearly  in  advance,  for  a  maximum  period  of  three  years. 

Implementation  of  this  would  require  system  integration  at  RTA’s  end.  A 

detailed guideline would be issued in this regard.  

 

4.  However, in the interim, upfronting of trail commission based on SIP inflows at 

mutual fund level would be available subject to the following: 

 

a. The upfronting of trail commission may be for total SIP inflows of upto Rs. 

5,000 per month, per investor, across all schemes of a mutual fund. For this 

purpose, unique investor at MF level should be identified based on PAN. 

 

b. Such  upfronting  of  trail  commission  shall  be  up  to  1%  of  the  total  SIP 

inflows for a maximum period of 3 years and shall be paid from AMC books. 

 

c. The said commission shall be amortized on daily basis to the scheme over 

the period for which the payment has been made. A complete audit trail for 

payments  made  from  the  AMCs’  books  and  amortized  to  schemes 

thereafter shall be made available for inspection.  

 

d. The  said  commission  should  be  charged  to  the  scheme  as  ‘commissions’ 

and should also account for computing the TER differential between regular 

and direct plans in each scheme. 

 

e. The  commission  paid  shall  be  recovered  on  pro-rata  basis  from  the 

distributors,  if  the  SIP  is  not  continued  for  the  period  for  which  the 

commission is paid.

The above interim measures shall be for a period of six months or the time by 

which  the  aforementioned  system  at  paragraph  3  above  is  put  in  place, 

whichever is earlier.  

 

5.  In  case  of  misuse  of the  carve  out  for  SIPs,  the  same  would  be  discontinued 

and appropriate action would be taken against the errant participants. Further, 

the need of this carve out would be reviewed by SEBI as and when required. 

 

6.  All  fees  and  expenses  charged  in  a  direct  plan  (in  percentage  terms)  under 

various  heads  including  the  investment  and advisory  fee  shall  not exceed  the 

fees and expenses charged under such heads in a regular plan. 

 

7.  No  pass  back,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  shall  be  given  by  MFs/  AMCs/ 

Distributors to the investors.  

 

8.  Training sessions and programmes conducted for distributors should continue 

and  should  not  be  misused for  providing  any  reward  or  non-cash  incentive  to 

the distributors. 

 

B.  Additional TER of 30 bps for penetration in B-30 cities 

 

1.  In  terms  of  Regulation  52(6A)(b)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996, 

additional TER can be charged upto 30 basis points on daily net assets of the 

scheme  based  on  inflows  from  beyond  top  30  cities  (B  30  cities)  subject  to 

certain  conditions.  In  this  regard,  it  has  been  decided  that  the  additional TER 

can be charged based on inflows only from retail investors from B 30 cities. Till 

the  time  the  term  ‘retail  investor’  is  defined,  as  an  interim  measure,  the 

additional  TER  shall  be  based  on  inflows  from  individual  investors  from  B  30 

cities, keeping all other conditions of SEBI Circular(s) on charging of additional 

TER of 30 bps unchanged. Thus, inflows from corporates and institutions from

B 30 cities henceforth will not be considered for computing the  inflows from B 

30 cities for the purpose of additional TER of 30 basis points.  

 

2.  The additional commission for B 30 cities shall be paid as trail only.

as under:

the break  up  between  Investment  and  Advisory  fees,  Commission  paid to  the 

distributor  and  Other  expenses  for  the  period  for  each  scheme’s  applicable 

plan  (regular  or  direct  or  both)  where  the  concerned  investor  has  actually 

invested in.” 

 

D.  Disclosure of scheme performance 

 

AMCs shall disclose the performance of all schemes on the website of AMFI. 

AMFI shall facilitate the disclosure in the following manner: 

 

1.  In  case  of  all  schemes,  the  scheme  returns  vis-à-vis  the  benchmark  return
