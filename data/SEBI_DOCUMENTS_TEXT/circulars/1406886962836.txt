CIRCULAR 
 

 

 

 

CIR/CFD/DIL/4/2014  
 
To  
All Recognized Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub: Monitoring of Compliance by Stock Exchanges 
 

1.  SEBI, vide Circular No. CIR / MRD / DSA / 31 /2013 dated September 30, 

2013  and  Circular  No.  CIR  /  CFD  /  POLICYCELL  /  13  /  2013  dated 

November  18,  2013  advised  stock  exchanges  to,  inter-alia,  put  in  place a 

system to monitor and review the compliance of listing conditions by listed 

companies.  Clause  5.2  of  the  Circular  dated  November  18,  2013  also 

advised  stock  exchanges  to  devise  framework  to  detect  any  non-

compliance / violation of the applicable laws. 

2.  SEBI vide circular dated April 17, 2014 has also made certain amendments 

to the Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement. The amended Clause 49, inter-

alia,  provides  for  Principles  of  Corporate  Governance  to  be  mandatorily 

complied with by listed companies. 

3.  The  Principles  of  Corporate  Governance, 

inter-alia,  provide 

that 

shareholders should have opportunity to participate effectively and vote in 

general shareholder meetings. These principles also require companies to 

facilitate  effective  shareholder  participation  and  exercise  of  ownership 

rights  and  require  that  company  procedures  shall  not  make  it  unduly 

difficult or expensive to cast votes.  

4.  In  this  regard,  it  is  observed  that  some  listed  companies  belonging  to  a 

common  group  have  held  their  AGMs,  with  a  time  gap  of  15  minutes 

between two AGMs. It is also observed that these companies were formed 

out of demergers and had 80% common shareholding thereby leaving only 

15 minutes each for the common shareholders to attend the AGM of these 

companies.

5.  It is observed that allocation of 15 minutes for conducting AGM of a public 

listed  company  having  more  than  one  lakh  shareholders  does  not  appear 

to  be  adequate  enough  to  facilitate  a  constructive  discussion  on  various 

matters  transacted  at  the  AGM.  Such  a  practice  affects  the  rights  of 

investors to seek clarifications/hold discussions and prima-facie appears to 

be prejudicial to the interest of the investors.  

6.  In view of the above, Clause 5.2 of the Circular dated November 18, 2013 

and  the  provisions  of  the  revised  Clause  49  which  are  scheduled  to  take 

effect from October 01, 2014, all recognised stock exchanges are advised 

to  step  up  and  equip  their  monitoring  framework  to  identify  and  monitor 

such practices and  to ensure that requirements laid down by Principles of 

Corporate  Governance  in  the  revised  Clause  49  of  the  Listing  Agreement 

are followed in letter and spirit. 

7.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11 

read with Section 11A of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 

1992.   

8.  Stock Exchanges are advised to ensure compliance with this circular.  

9.  This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the 

categories “Legal Framework” and “Issues and Listing”.  

 

Yours faithfully, 

 

Anindya Kumar Das
