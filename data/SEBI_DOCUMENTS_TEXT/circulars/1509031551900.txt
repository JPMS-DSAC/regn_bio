All Stock Exchanges (Except for Commodity Derivative Exchanges) 

 

 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

 

Sub: Review of Block Deal Window Mechanism. 

 

1.  SEBI  vide  circular  MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-19/2005  dated  September  02,  2005 

prescribed  guidelines  for  execution  of  large  size  trades  through  a  single 

transaction.  In  order  to  facilitate  execution  of  such  large  trades,  the  stock 

exchanges  were  permitted  to  provide  a  separate  trading  window.    A  trade 

executed on this separate trading window was termed as ‘block deal’. 

 

2.  SEBI has been receiving suggestions from market participants to review the block 

deal  framework.  The  suggestions  received  from  market  participants  were 

examined  and  deliberated  in  the  Secondary  Market  Advisory  Committee 

("SMAC").  

 

3.  Based on the deliberations, it has been decided to revise the framework for block 

deals by providing two block deal windows as follows: 

 

 

3.1. Morning  Block  Deal  Window:  This  window  shall  operate  between  08:45 

AM  to  09:00  AM.  The  reference  price  for  execution  of  block  deals  in  this 

window  shall  be  the  previous  day  closing  price  of  the  stock.  The  stock 

exchanges shall set their trading hours between 08:45AM to 5:00 PM with a 

stipulation that between 08:45AM and 09:00AM, the stock exchanges shall 

operate only for executing trades in the block deal window. 

 

3.2. Afternoon Block Deal Window: This window shall operate between 02:05 
PM to 2:20 PM. The reference price for block deals in this window shall be

the volume weighted average market price (VWAP) of the trades executed 
in the stock in the cash segment between 01:45 PM to 02:00 PM. Between 
the period 02:00 pm to 02:05 pm, the stock exchanges shall calculate and 
disseminate necessary information regarding the VWAP applicable for the 
execution of block deals in the Afternoon block deal window. 

 

5.  The  orders  placed  shall  be  within  ±1%  of  the  applicable  reference  price  in  the 

respective windows as stated above.  

 

6.  The minimum order size for execution of trades in the Block deal window shall be 

Rs.10 Crore.  

 

7.  Every trade executed in the block deal windows must result in delivery and shall 

not be squared off or reversed. 

 

8.  The stock exchanges shall disseminate the information on block deals such as 

the name of the scrip, name of the client, quantity of shares bought/sold, traded 

price, etc. to the general public on the same day, after the market hours. 

 

9.  The  stock  exchanges  shall  ensure  that  all  appropriate  trading  and  settlement 

practices  as  well  as  surveillance  and  risk  containment  measures,  etc.,  as 

applicable to the normal trading segment are made applicable and implemented 

in respect of the block deal windows also. 

 

10. This circular shall come into force with effect from January 01, 2018. The SEBI 

circular  no  MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-19/05  dated  September  2,  2005  shall  stand

47/2009  dated  October  23,  2009  shall  stand  modified  accordingly  to  enable 

opening of morning block deal window.
