Annexure I 
 

Comprehensive Risk Management Framework for National Commodity Derivatives 

Exchanges 

1.  Overview  
 
The core of the risk management system of national commodity derivatives exchanges 
(Exchanges) shall comprise of the following:  
 

a.  Liquid  Assets:  Liquid  assets  shall  be  deposited  by  members  with  the 
Exchanges in compliance with the norms specified herewith  to cover various 
margin and deposit requirements. 

b.  Initial Margins (IM): Value at risk (VaR) margins to cover potential losses for 
at  least  99%  of  the  days  subject  to  minimum  percentage  floor  value  as 
prescribed by SEBI from time to time.  

c.  Extreme Loss Margins (ELM): Margins to cover the loss in situations that lie 

outside the coverage of the VaR based initial margins. 

d.  Additional Margins: Margins imposed on both long and short sides over and 

above the other margins, would be called additional margins. 

e.  Tender  Period  Margin/Pre-expiry  Margin:  Exchanges  shall  levy  tender 
period/pre-expiry  margin  which  may  be  increased  gradually  every  day 
beginning  from  the  pre-determined  number  of  days  before  the  expiry  of  the 
contract as applicable. 

f.  Delivery Period Margin: Appropriate delivery period margin shall be levied by 
Exchanges on the long and short positions marked for delivery till the pay-in is 
completed  by  the  member.  Once  delivery  period  margin  is  levied,  all  other 
applicable margins may be released. 

g.  Minimum  Liquid  Networth  Requirement:  Initial  margins,  ELM,  Additional 
margins or any other margins as may be specified by SEBI from time to time 
shall  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  assets  of  a  clearing  member.  The  clearing 
member’s liquid assets after adjusting for applicable margins shall be referred 
to  as  ‘Liquid  Networth’  of  the  clearing  member.  Clearing  Members  shall 
maintain ‘Liquid Networth’ as specified by SEBI from time to time. 

h.  MTM  (Mark  to  Market)  Settlement:  Mark  to  market  settlement  on  all  open 

positions of clients/members shall be done on daily basis in cash. 

i.  Base  Minimum  Capital:  Exposure  free  deposit  required  from  all  members 

(Trading members/Clearing members). 

j.  Settlement  Guarantee  Fund  (SGF):  Exchanges  shall  maintain  SGF  which 
shall  be  used  by  Exchanges  only  for  the  purpose  of  providing  settlement 
guarantee. 

2.  Liquid Assets:  

The  types  of  liquid  assets  acceptable  by  Exchanges  from  their  members  and  the 
applicable haircuts and concentration limits are listed below:

(see Note ‘f’) 

a.  The  valuation  of  the  liquid  assets  shall  be  done  on  a  daily  basis  after  applying 

applicable haircuts.  

b.  The exchanges shall lay down exposure limits either in rupee terms or as percentage 
of the total Liquid Assets that can be exposed to a single bank directly or indirectly. 
The total exposure towards any bank would include Bank Guarantees issued by the 
bank as well as debt or equity securities of the bank which have been deposited by 
members towards total liquid assets.  

Not  more  than  1%  of  the  total  liquid  assets  deposited  with  the  exchange,  shall  be 
exposed to any single bank which has a net worth of less than INR 500 crores and is 
not  rated  P1  (or  P1+)  or  equivalent,  by  a  recognized  credit  rating  agency  or  by  a 
reputed foreign credit rating agency, and not more than 10% of the total liquid assets 
deposited with the exchanges shall be exposed to all such banks put together. 

c.  Cash equivalents shall be at least 50% of liquid assets. This would imply that Other 
Liquid Assets in excess of the total Cash Equivalents would not be regarded as part 
of member’s liquid assets as well as total liquid assets. 

d.  For determination of which Equity shares are falling in Group-I and what would be the 
appropriate VaR margin for these securities, data disseminated by Stock Exchanges 
having  equity  platform  shall  be  referred.  Stock  Exchanges  are  already  required  to 
compute

of exposure towards any single entity and the same shall be within the limits as may 
be prescribed by SEBI from time to time.

f.  Agricultural  commodities  to  be  accepted  as  collateral  should  be  of  same  quality 
specification  which  is  deliverable  under  the  contract  specification  of  agricultural 
commodities derivatives being traded on the Exchange. 

g.  Exchanges shall accept liquid assets as collateral only as per the list of liquid assets 
specified in the table above. However, exchanges may decide not to accept certain 
types  of  liquid  assets  specified  in  the  above  list  based  on  their  risk  perception, 
capability  to  hold  and arrangements for  timely  liquidation.  Exchanges  may  stipulate 
concentration limits at member level / across all members as may be necessary. 

h.  Exchanges  shall  make  necessary  arrangements  to  enable  timely  liquidation  of 

collaterals accepted by them. 

 

3.  Initial Margins (IM) 
 

Currently  Exchanges  are  computing  VaR  based  initial  margins  using  Exponentially 
Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) method to obtain the volatility estimate and then 
calculating initial margin by multiplying the volatility estimate by scaling factor. In order 
to bring uniformity in calculation of IM across all Exchanges, following is prescribed: 
 

a.  VaR Based: The Initial Margin requirement shall be so as to cover a 99% VaR 
over one day horizon. In order to achieve this, the estimated EWMA volatility 
(standard deviation) shall be scaled up by a factor of 3.5. 
 

b.  Minimum value for Initial Margin: Minimum value of initial margin would be 
subject to commodity specific floor value as may be specified by SEBI from time 
to time. Currently floor value of IM applicable for Nickel shall be 5% and for all 
other commodities it shall be 4%. 
 

c.  Margin Computation at client portfolio level: Margins shall be computed at 
the level of portfolio of each individual client comprising his positions in futures 
contracts  across  different  maturities.  For  Trading/Clearing  Member  level 
margins  computation,  margins  would  be  grossed  across  various  clients.  The 
proprietary positions of the Trading Member would also be treated as that of a 
client for margin computation.  
 

d.  Spread  margin  benefit:  –Spread  margin  benefit  shall  be  permitted  in  the 

following cases: 

i.  Different expiry date contracts of the same underlying 
ii.  Two contracts variants having the same underlying commodity 

 

Exchanges  shall  charge  minimum  25%  of  the  initial  margin  on  each  of  the 
individual  legs  of  the  spread.  In  case  of  such  spread  positions  additional 
margins shall not be levied.  No benefit in ELM would be provided for spread 
positions i.e. ELM shall be charged on both individual legs. Exchanges are free

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

to charge margins higher than the minimum specified depending upon their risk 
perceptions. 
 

e.  Real Time Computation: The margins should be computed on real time basis. 
The  computation  of  portfolio  initial  margin  would  have  two  components.  The 
first is the computation of initial margin (EWMA volatility scaled up by 3.5) for 
each  individual  contract.  At  the  second  stage,  these  contract  initial  margins 
would be applied to the actual portfolio positions to compute the portfolio initial 
margin. The exchanges are permitted to update EWMA volatility estimates for 
contracts at discrete time points each day (with a gap of not more than 2 hours 
between any two consecutive updates and at the end of the trading session) 
and the latest available scaled up WMA volatility estimates would be applied to 
member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 
 
 

4.  Extreme Loss Margin (ELM):  

 
ELM of 1% on gross open positions shall be levied and shall be deducted from the 
liquid assets of the clearing member on an online, real time basis. 
 
The ELM shall be implemented latest within six months of the date of this circular. Until 
the time any exchange starts charging ELM, the minimum value of initial margins shall 
be subject to following floor values:- 

  Minimum IM For Nickel: 6% 
  Minimum IM for other commodities:5% 

 

5.  Additional Margins:  

 
Exchanges may levy Additional Margins based on their evaluation in specific situations 
as may be necessary.  
 

6.  Tender Period Margin: 

 
Exchanges  shall  levy  Tender  period/Pre-expiry  margin  which  shall  be  increased 
gradually  every  day  beginning  from  the  pre-determined  number  of  days  before  the 
expiry of the contract as applicable. Exchanges shall determine the quantum of tender 
period  margin  as  appropriate  based  on  the  risk  characteristics  of  the  particular 
commodity. 
 

7.  Delivery Period Margin:

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

Appropriate delivery period margin shall be levied by Exchanges on the long and short 
positions marked for delivery till the pay-in is completed by the member. Once delivery 
period margin is levied, all other applicable margins may be released. 
 

8.  Margin Collection and Enforcement: 

 
All applicable margins shall be deducted by Exchanges from the Liquid Assets of the 
clearing members on an online, real time basis. 
 
Margins  applicable  on  client  positions  have  to  be  compulsorily  collected  from  the 
clients and reported to the Exchange by the members.  
 
The members are required to collect Initial Margin and ELM upfront from their clients 
as  applicable  at  the  time  of  the  trade.  For  other  margins  (MTM  margin,  Additional 
margin, delivery margin or any other margin as prescribed by the Exchange) members 
shall have time till ‘T+2’ working days to collect from their clients. The period of T+2 
days has been allowed to members to collect margin from clients taking into account 
the practical difficulties often faced by them only for the purpose of levy of penalty and 
it should not be construed that clients have been allowed two days to pay margin due 
from them. 
 

9.  Mark to Market (MTM) Settlement:  

 
All open positions of a futures contract would be settled daily, only in cash, based on 
the  Daily  Settlement  Price  (DSP).  DSP  shall  be  reckoned  and  disseminated  by  the 
Exchange at the end of every trading day. The mark to market gains and losses shall 
be settled in cash before the start of trading on T+1 day. If mark to market obligations 
are  not  collected  before  start  of  the  next  day’s  trading,  the  exchange  shall  collect 
correspondingly higher initial margin (scaling up by a factor of square root of two) to 
cover the potential losses over the time elapsed in the collection of margins. 
 

10. Base Minimum Capital (BMC): 

i.  Exchanges  shall  have  BMC 

(Trading 
members/Clearing  members)  as  given  below  (to  be  complied  within  six  months 
from the date of this circular coming into effect):  

their  members 

requirements 

for 

a.  Members without Algo trading – INR 10 Lacs 
b.  Members doing Algo trading – INR 50 Lacs 

 

ii.  No exposure will be given by the Exchange on this BMC. 

 

25% of the above deposit shall be in the form of cash and balance 75% can be in 
the form of Fixed Deposit/Bank Guarantee. 

iii.

iv.  These funds would be kept in a separate account by the Exchange. 

 

v.  BMC would be refunded to the members at the time of surrender of membership 
provided that there is no unsettled claim against member and no arbitration cases 
are pending against the member. 

 

 

11. Risk Reduction Mode (RRM) 

 
Exchanges shall ensure that the trading members/clearing members are mandatorily 
put  in  risk-reduction  mode  when  90%  of  the  member’s  Liquid  Assets  available  for 
adjustment against margins/deposits gets utilized for margins/deposits (to be complied 
within six months from the date of this circular coming into effect). Such risk reduction 
mode shall include the following: 

 

a.  All unexecuted orders shall be cancelled once trading member himself or 

his clearing member breaches 90% collateral utilization level. 

b.  Only  orders  with  Immediate  or  Cancel  attribute  shall  be  permitted  in  this 

mode. 

c.  All new orders shall be checked for sufficiency of margins and such potential 

margins shall be blocked while accepting the orders in the system. 

d.  The trading member shall be moved back to the normal risk management 
mode as and when the collateral utilization level of the trading member as 
well as his clearing member is lower than 90%. 

12. Additional Ad-hoc Margins  

 
Exchanges have the right to impose additional risk containment measures over and 
above  the  risk  containment  system  mandated  by  SEBI.  However,  the  Exchanges 
should keep the following three factors in mind while taking such action: 
 
a.  Additional  risk  management  measures  (like  ad-hoc  margins)  would  normally  be 
required  only  to  deal  with  circumstances  that  cannot  be  anticipated  or  were  not 
anticipated  while  designing  the  risk  management  system.  If  ad-hoc  margins  are 
imposed  with  any  degree  of  regularity,  exchanges  should  examine  whether  the 
circumstances that give rise to such margins can be reasonably anticipated and 
can  therefore  be  incorporated  into  the  risk  management  system  mandated  by 
SEBI. Exchanges are encouraged to analyse these situations and bring the matter 
to the attention of SEBI for further action. 
 

b.  Any additional margins that the exchanges may impose shall be based on objective

criteria  and  shall  not  discriminate  between  members  on  the  basis  of  subjective 
criteria. 
 

c.  Transparency is an important regulatory goal and therefore every effort must be 
made to make the risk management systems fully transparent by disclosing their 
details to the public.
