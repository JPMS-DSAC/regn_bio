Dear Sir/Madam,  

 

Sub: Compensation to Retail Individual Investors (RIIs) in an IPO  

1.  While the process of Applications Supported By Block Amount (ASBA) has resulted in 
almost  complete  elimination  of  complaints  pertaining  to  refunds,  there  have  been 
instances where the applicants in an Initial Public Offering have failed to get allotment of 
specified securities and in the process may have suffered an opportunity loss due to the 
following factors: 

 

a)  Failure on part of the Self Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs) to make bids in the 
concerned  Exchange  system  even  after  the  amount  has  been  blocked  in  the 
investors’ bank account with such SCSB. 

b)  Failure on part of the SCSB to process the ASBA applications even when they 

have been submitted within time. 

c)  Any other failures on part of an SCSB which has resulted in the rejection of the 

application form. 

 

2.  A need has been felt to have a uniform policy for calculation of minimum compensation 
payable to investors in scenarios mentioned in Para 1. a), b) and c) of this Circular.  While 
doing so, the following factors have been taken into account: 

 

a)  the opportunity loss suffered by the investor due to non-allotment of shares; 
b)  the number of times the issue was oversubscribed in the relevant category; 
c)  the probability of allotment; and  
d)  the listing gains if any on the day of listing. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3.  The proposed formula for calculation of minimum fair compensation is as follows: 

Compensation = 

(Listing price* - Issue Price)  X  No.  of  shares  that 
would  have  been 
allotted  if  bid  was 
successful 

X  Probability 

of 
of 

allotment 
shares 
determined 
the 
allotment 

on 
  basis  of 

*Listing price shall be taken as the highest of the opening prices on the day of listing across the recognized 
stock Exchanges. 

The  formula  has  been  explained  with  the  help  of  an  example  in  the  annexure  to  this 
Circular. 

4. 

It is also proposed that in case of issues which are subscribed between 90-100%, i.e. 
non  oversubscribed  issues,  the  applicants  would  be  compensated  for  all  the  shares 
which they would have been allotted. 
 

5.  No compensation would be payable to the applicant in case the listing price is below the 

issue price. 

 

6.  RTAs shall share the basis of allotment file, if sought by SCSBs, so that the SCSBs shall 

have access to the allotment ratio for the purpose of arriving at the compensation. 
 

7.  Any applicant whose application has not been considered for allotment, due to failure on 
the part of the SCSB, shall have the option to seek redressal of the same within  three 
months of the listing date with the concerned SCSB. On receipt of such application/s, the 
SCSB would be required to resolve the same within 15 days, failing which it would have 
to pay interest at the rate of 15% per annum for any delay beyond the said period of 15 
days. 

 

8. 

In case the SCSBs fail to redress such grievances within the stipulated time, additionally 
SEBI may initiate action as deemed fit. 
 

9.  This  circular  shall  come  into  force  with  immediate  effect.  SCSBs  are  also  advised  to 
resolve all pending issues related to non-allotment of specified securities whether on the 
SEBI  SCORES  portal  or  otherwise  using  the  compensation  policy  outlined  in  this 
Circular. 
 

10.  This  circular  is  being  issued  in  exercise  of  the  powers  under  section  11  read  with  

section 11A of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.  
 

11.  This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at www.sebi.gov.in under  the  categories  

“Legal Framework” and “Issues and Listing”. 

 
Yours faithfully,

In this case if the number of shares applied by an applicant whose bid was unsuccessful due to 
failure/error on part of SCSB is 20 shares or multiples thereof, then the minimum compensation 
is calculated as under: 

Compensation = (Rs.325-Rs.300)*20*(7/8) = Rs.437.50
