GENERAL ASPECTS:

The HYR is based on trades done during the half year period.

The files names to be used for submitting the report in soft copies are as follows:

Equity : hye<mmyy>.txt
Debt : hyd<mmyy>.txt 

The soft copy, in txt format, would contain only the data fields separated by “pipe” character.

All the fields are mandatory. If a field is left blank, an error would be encountered and the whole report would be returned to the custodian of securities.

The field width N (16,2) denotes Number with 14 integers and 2 decimal digits

The formats for month and year would MMYYYY

To avoid any confusion regarding the name of the security, ISIN codes should be used. The appropriate ISINs for scrips as applicable for the physical and demat are to be used.

The scrip name should encompass the entire details of the securities.

For the HYR ended September 2003, the opening balance would reflect the closing balance in terms of no. of shares corrected for all auctions/pending trades and other adjustments as on March 31, 2003. The value of opening balance would be the net of the sum of all reported daily trades in terms of purchase and sales. 

The scrip / instrument wise purchase and sale in no. of shares /value would be the transaction during the half year period. The closing balance of holding would the outstanding no. of shares as on September 30, 2003. The value of closing balance should be computed as mentioned at point 9. The closing market value of the holding should be valued at the closing price as on September 30, 2003. Where ever the last price is not available, appropriate value should be imputed for the same. 

FIIs through their custodians must ensure that the data submitted is accurate and complete and does not contain any blank or incomplete records.

Reports submitted late or incomplete or submitted with different parameters may result in problems and delay in compilation of data. All reports should be duly verified before submission by the Heads of Custodial Operations.
