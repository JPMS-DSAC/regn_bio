To,
The President/Executive Directors Managing Directors, all recognised Stock Exchanges in India
Dear Sir,
Please refer to our circular letter No SE/10453 dated September 9, 1991 in terms of which President/Executive Directors / Managing Directors of the Stock Exchanges are required to send a monthly D.O., letter addressed to our Chairman giving information on average daily turnover at the Stock Exchange during the month, delays in settlement and pay-outs compared to scheduled dates, steps taken to regulate the market, etc., Although the Stock Exchanges have been sending D.O. letters to SEBI more or less on a regular basis, it is observed that the required information is not furnished by them on a uniform basis. Each stock exchange has devised its own format for reporting monthly developments.
With a view to bring about uniformity in the matter of reporting monthly development at the Stock Exchanges a revised format of "monthly development report" has been devised and a copy of the same is enclosed.
You are requested to send the information in the enclosed format from the month of April 1996 onwards and despatch the same within 7 days from close of each month.
The information may please be forwarded to us with a covering letter addressed to Executive Director, SMD, SEBI.
The D.O. letter required to be sent in terms of our circular letter dated September 9, 1991 referred to above may please be discontinued.
Yours faithfully, sd/-
M.D. PATEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
