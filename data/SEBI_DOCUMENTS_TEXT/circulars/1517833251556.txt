Sir/ Madam, 

 

 

Subject: Total Expense Ratio – change and disclosure  

 

1.  It  is  observed  that  there  are  frequent  changes  carried  out  in  Total  Expense  Ratio 

(TER) and such changes are not prominently disclosed to investors. In order to bring 

uniformity in disclosure of actual TER charged to mutual fund schemes and to enable 

the investor to take informed decision, the following has been decided: 

 

a.  AMCs shall prominently disclose on a daily basis, the TER of all schemes under 

a  separate  head  –  “Total  Expense  Ratio  of  Mutual  Fund  Schemes”  on  their 

website in downloadable spreadsheet format as per Annexure A. 

 

b.  Any change in the base TER (i.e. TER excluding additional expenses provided in 

Regulation 52(6A)(b) and 52(6A)(c) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996) 

in  comparison  to  previous  base  TER  charged  to  any  scheme  shall  be 

communicated  to  investors  of  the  scheme  through  notice  via  email  or  SMS  at 

least three working days prior to effecting such change. (For example, if changed 

TER is to be effective from January 8, 2018, then notice shall be given latest by 

January 2, 2018, considering at least three working days prior to effective date). 

Further,  the  notice  of  change  in  base  TER  shall  be  updated  in  the  aforesaid 

section of website at least three working days prior to effecting such change.      

 
However, any decrease in TER due to decrease in applicable limits as prescribed 

in Regulation 52 (6) (i.e. due to increase in daily net assets of the scheme) would 

not require issuance of any prior notice to the investors. Further, such decrease
