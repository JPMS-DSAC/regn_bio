SEBI/RPM CIRCULAR NO.2 (2002-2003)January 14, 2003  
To all registered Portfolio Managers 
 
Dear Sirs,  
Sub.:Application procedure for registration/renewal as Portfolio Manager  
An applicant is required to furnish the application in Form A as specified in SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Rules & Regulation, 1993, to SEBI for registration/ renewal as a Portfolio Manager.On receipt of ‘Form A’, SEBI asks for more information for further processing. The information asked therein is very detailed and is also required to be supported by the relevant supporting documents. It has been our experience that the applicants take a few months to furnish full information. Quite often processing of registration/renewal applications gets delayed for want of complete information.  
SEBI, in its endeavor, to make processing of application for registration/renewal simpler, speedier and effective, advise all the existing/prospective 'Portfolio Managers' to note the following: 

All entities desirous to be registered as Portfolio Manager and all registered Portfolio Managers desirous of renewing their registration as Portfolio Managers, are required to furnish all the information as specified in 'Additional Information', available on SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in, alongwith 'Form A'.
The information submitted to SEBI at the time of registration/renewal application, shall be full and complete in all respects, otherwise it may delay processing of the registration/renewal application.

This circular shall come into force with immediate effect.
 
Yours faithfully,
 
NEELAM BHARDWAJ
