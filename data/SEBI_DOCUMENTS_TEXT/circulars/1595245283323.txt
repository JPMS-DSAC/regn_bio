All  Recognized  Stock  Exchanges  and  Clearing  Corporations  (except  Stock

Dear Sir / Madam 
 
Framework to Enable Verification of Upfront Collection of Margins from Clients 
in Cash and Derivatives segments 
 
1  With  respect  to  equity  derivatives  and  currency  derivatives  segments,  Stock 
Exchanges/  Clearing  Corporations  have  mandated  clearing  members/  trading 
members  to  collect  applicable  margins  from  their  clients/  constituents  on  an 
upfront  basis.  Similarly,  SEBI  Circulars  CIR/CDMRD/DRMP/01/2015  dated 
October  01,  2015  and  SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DRMP/CIR/P/2016/80  dated 
September  07,  2016  directed  to  National  Commodity  Derivatives  Exchanges, 
inter  alia,  require  members  to  collect  Initial  Margin  and  ELM  upfront  from  their 
clients as applicable at the time of the trade.

In  order  to  align  and  streamline  the  risk  management  framework  of  both  cash 
and derivatives segments, with respect to collection of margins from the clients 
and  reporting  of  short-collection/non-collection  of  margins,  SEBI,  vide  Circular 
no.  CIR/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2019/139  dated  November  19,  2019,  inter  alia, 
required  the  Trading  Members  (TMs)  /  Clearing  Members  (CMs)  in  cash 
segment as well to mandatorily collect upfront VaR margins and ELM from their 
clients. 

 
3  Subsequent to the aforesaid Circular dated November 19, 2019, representations 
were received from the market participants raising issues in operationalization of 
collection of upfront margin from clients. SEBI held detailed discussions with the 
market  participants  so  as  to  evolve  a  monitoring  mechanism  for  verification  of 
upfront collection of margin from clients. 
 

4  Based on deliberations with the market participants, with an objective to enable 
uniform verification of upfront collection of margins from clients by TM/ CM and 
levy of penalty across segments, it has been decided that the Stock Exchanges/ 
Clearing Corporations shall  adopt the framework specified in  the Annexure, for 
the  purpose  of  ‘Mechanism  for  regular  monitoring  of  and  penalty  for  short-
collection/  non-collection  of  margins  from  clients’  in  Cash  and  Derivatives 
segments, as specified vide SEBI Circulars CIR/DNPD/7/2011 dated August 10, 
2011,  SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DRMP/CIR/P/2016/80    dated    September    07,    2016, 
CIR/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2019/88 
and

from the clients in advance of the trade. The aforesaid framework  prescribed in 
the Annexure is only for the purpose of verification of upfront collection of margin 
and levy of penalty.

Annexure 

Framework to Enable Verification of Upfront Collection of Margins from Clients 

in Cash and Derivatives segments 

 

 

(i)  Clearing  Corporations  shall  send  minimum  4  snapshots  of  client  wise  margin 
requirement to TMs/CMs for them to know the intraday margin requirement per 
client in each segment. The number of times snapshots need to be sent in a day 
may  be  decided  by  the  respective  Clearing  Corporation  depending  on  market 
timings subject to a minimum of 4 snapshots in a day. The snapshots would be 
randomly taken in pre-defined time windows. 

 

for 

commodity 

derivatives 

segment,  SEBI 

Further, 
vide  Circular 
SEBI/HO/CDMRD/DRMP/CIR/P/2019/149  dated  November  29,  2019  has 
prescribed  that  though  trading  in  commodity  derivatives  is  happening  till  mid-
night,  Risk  Parameter  File  (RPF)  of  5  PM  shall  be  applicable  on  End  of  Day 
(EOD)  portfolio  for  margin  collection  from  clients.  Therefore  for  the  commodity 
derivatives segment, last snapshot for commodity derivatives shall be generated 
at  5  PM  and  EOD  margin  also  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the 
Circular. 

 

(ii)  The  client  wise  margin  file  (MG-12/13)  provided  by  the  CCs  to  TMs/CMs  shall 
contain  the  EOD  margin  requirements  of  the  client  as  well  as  the  peak  margin 
requirement of the client, across each of the intra-day snapshots. 

 

(iii) The  member  shall  have  to  report  the  margin  collected  from  each  client,  as  at 

EOD and peak margin collected during the day, in the following manner: 
 

a)  EOD margin obligation of the client shall be compared with the respective 

client margin available with the TM/CM at EOD. 

 

AND 

 

b)  Peak  margin  obligation  of  the  client,  across  the  snapshots,  shall  be 
compared  with  respective  client  peak  margin  available  with  the  TM/CM 
during the day. 

 

Higher of the shortfall in collection of the margin obligations at (a) and (b) above, 
shall be considered for levying of penalty as per the extant framework. 

 

(iv) The  verification  of  availability  of  margins  with  TM/  CM,  as  at  (iii)(a)  and  (iii)(b) 
above, shall be done by exchanges/ clearing corporations on a weekly basis by 
verification of the balances in the books/ ledgers of the TM/ CM in respect of the 
client. 

 
Phased adoption 
The peak margin obligation of client across snapshots, as at (iii)(b) above, shall be 
adopted in a phased manner, as given below: 
: 

 

Page 3 of 4 

 

  Phase  1  (for  3  months  from  the  date  of  implementation)-  25%  of  (Peak 
margin obligation of the client across the snapshots) shall be compared with 
respective client peak margin available with the TM/CM during the day. 

  Phase 2 (for subsequent 3 months)- 50% of (Peak margin obligation of the 
client  across  the  snapshots)  shall  be  compared  with  respective  client  peak 
margin available with the TM/CM during the day. 

  Phase 3 (for subsequent 3 months)- 75% of (Peak margin obligation of the 
client  across  the  snapshots)  shall  be  compared  with  respective  client  peak 
margin available with the TM/CM during the day. 

  Phase  4  (subsequently)-  100%  of  (Peak  margin  obligation  of  the  client 
across the snapshots) shall be compared with respective client peak margin 
available with the TM/CM during the day. 

 

Shortfall in collection of margins, as detailed in Para (iii) above, shall be calculated 
by taking into consideration the aforesaid phased adoption of peak margin obligation 
of  client.  Further,  during  the  aforesaid  period  of  phased  adoption,  the  member 
should  be  able  to demonstrate  that  the balance peak  margin  obligation  (i.e., [peak 
margin  obligation  of  the  client  across  the  snapshots]  minus  [25%/  50%/  75%1  of 
Peak  margin  obligation  of  the  client  across  the  snapshots])  has  been  funded  from 
the member’s own funds and not from any other client.
