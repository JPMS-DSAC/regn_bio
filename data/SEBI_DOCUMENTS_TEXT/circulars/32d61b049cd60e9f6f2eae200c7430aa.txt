Dear Sir,
The following clarification has been received by the Ministry of Finance.
Inter-depository trasfer of shares do not attract stamp duty. Inter-depository transfer of securities also do not require compliance with the formalities prescribed under section 108 of the Companies Act 1956.
You are advised to inform all companies whose shares have been admitted for dematerialisation and their registrars and share transfer agents accordingly for full compliance with the above.
Yours faithfully,
