All Issuers, through stock exchanges, where they are listed. 

 

Dear Sir/ Madam, 

Sub: Centralized Database for Corporate Bonds/ Debentures 

1.  "High  Level  Expert  Committee  on  Corporate  Bonds  and  Securitization"  ("Dr.  R.H. 

Patil  Committee")  had  recommended  creation  of  "Centralized  Database  of 

information  regarding  Bonds".  The  committee  report  has  recognized  that  historical 

database  on  all  corporate bonds  issued  is  very  important for  an  investor  to  take a 

valued decision.  

 

2.  While  currently  the  information  in  respect  of  various  bonds/debentures  issued  by 

issuers is available in a fragmented manner and available at multiple sources such 

as  websites  of  credit  rating  agencies,    depositories,  stock  exchanges  etc,  it  is  felt 

that there is a need for having a comprehensive database on corporate bonds at a 

single place. 

 

3.  Pursuant to consultation with various stakeholders, it has been decided to create a 

centralized database regarding corporate bonds which are available in demat form 

for public dissemination. Both the depositories viz. NSDL and CDSL, jointly, shall be 

the repository of information pertaining to the corporate bonds/debentures.
