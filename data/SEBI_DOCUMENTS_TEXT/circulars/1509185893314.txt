13, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as "the Stock Broker Regulation"). 
 

2.  Through  these  amendments,  restriction  on  stock  brokers  dealing  in  securities 
(other than commodity derivatives) to deal in commodity derivatives has been done 
away with. Similarly, restriction on stock brokers dealing in commodity derivatives

amendments,  a  stock  broker  can  deal  in  commodity  derivatives  and  other 
securities under a single entity, thereby facilitating ease of doing business.
