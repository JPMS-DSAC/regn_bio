Circular No. FITTC/CUST/11/2001  
May 18, 2001 

To  

All Custodians of Securities  
   

Dear Sir / Madam,  

Sub: Activities of Custodians of Securities 

In order to ensure efficient custodial operations and to facilitate offsite supervision the 
following decisions have been taken:  

A. Review of Custodial operations  

Regulation  14  of  SEBI  (Custodian  of  Securities)  Regulations,  1996  stipulates  an  annual 
review  of  the  systems,  procedures  &  controls  of  the  custodian  by  an  expert.  This  review 
covers the systems and procedures being followed by the custodian to meet its obligations 
towards its clients, regulators and other relevant bodies.  

A  copy  of  the  review  report  is  required  to  be  filed  with  SEBI.  It  has  been  decided  that 
henceforth  the  report  for  a  particular  calendar  year  would  be  filed  by  31st  March  of  the 
following year along with ‘Action Taken Report’, if any.  

Further, it is reiterated that this review report should also cover the aspect of reporting of FII 
transactions to SEBI and RBI as stipulated vide Regulation 16 of the SEBI (FII) Regulations, 
1995.  

B.  Monthly market value of investments  

 
With a view to have a more realistic assessment of the institutional investments it is 
proposed  that  custodians  should  provide  the  market  value  of  the  securities  held  in 
custody  with  them  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  market  value  on  the  last  day  of  each 
month may be submitted in the enclosed format (Annexure A). This format may be 
submitted by the seventh day of the following month. The value of securities as on 
April 
2001.  
   

submitted 

2001 

may 

be 

30, 

by 

May 

25, 

C.  Discontinuation of reporting of FII investment data in dBase  

 
Currently the custodians are reporting the FII equity and debt investment figures in 
dBase and text formats. It has been decided that the equity trade reports in dBase 
format be discontinued from May 21, 2001. Thereafter, the custodians may report the 
figures  only  in  text  mode.  Debt  reporting  would  however  continue  in  the  dBase 
format.  
   

D.  Reporting of Trades  

There are occasions when SEBI is closed on account of holiday, but the exchanges being a 
nationwide  trading  network  are  open  for  trading.  For  such  occasions,  custodians  are 
requested to submit separate reports - one would be the normal report and the other for the 
holiday. Care must be taken not to  submit a consolidated report, but different reports with 
proper reporting dates.  

E. Submission of company information for unlisted securities.  

The SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 permit FIIs to invest in unlisted 
securities. Currently the custodians are reporting trades for unlisted securities under 'no ISIN' 
or custodian generated codes. With a view to have a proper scrip identification, it would be 
necessary  to  have  ISINs  for  such  securities  also.  To  generate  ISINs,  information  in  the 
enclosed  format  (Annexure  B)  is  required  to  be  submitted  to  SEBI.  Information  on  scrips 
where investment has already been made in the past should be submitted within 10 days of 
issue  of  this  circular.  Information  with  respect  to  new  unlisted  scrips  should  be  submitted 
within 10 days from the date of reporting of the transaction.  

A copy of this circular is also available on our web page ‘Foreign Institutional Investors’ at 
our web site: www.sebi.gov.in.  

Yours faithfully,
