Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub:  Extension  in  time  for  compliance  with  Regulation  16(8)  of  SEBI  (Portfolio 
Managers) Regulations, 1993 
 
As  you  are  aware,  vide  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers)  (Amendment)  Regulations,  2008, 
which were notified on August 11, 2008, certain amendments have been carried out in 
the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers)  Regulations,  1993.  The  said  amendments  include 
amendments  to  sub-regulation  (8)  of  regulation  16  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers) 
Regulations, 1993, which inter alia, states that – 
 
 “……  any  portfolio  manager  holding  the  listed  securities  belonging  to  the  portfolio 
account  in  its  own  name  on  behalf  of  its  client  on  the  date  of  commencement  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Portfolio Managers) (Amendment) Regulations, 
2008 shall segregate each clients’ listed securities and keep them separately within six 
months from such commencement  ……”  
 
However,  SEBI  has  received  representations  from  a  number  of  portfolio  managers 
informing that due to various reasons they are unable to comply with the above within 
the given time line of February 10, 2009 and requested to allow them further extension 
under the provisions of the aforesaid regulation. In consideration of such requests it has 
been  decided  to  allow  a  general  extension  of  three  months  to  portfolio  managers  to 
comply with the above i.e. the portfolio managers are permitted to comply with the said 
requirements  of  sub-regulation(8)  of  regulation  16  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers) 
Regulations, 1993 up to May 10, 2009.  
 
In this regard, the portfolio managers shall furnish a compliance report to SEBI within a 
week of expiry of the above deadline. Any non compliance after the extended period i.e. 
after May 10, 2009 may attract penal action under the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 
and the regulations framed there under.     
 
This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  under  Section  11(1)  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with the provisions of Regulation 
16(8) and Regulation 39 of the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993, to protect 
the  interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to 
regulate the securities market. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
 
Satya Ranjan Prasad
