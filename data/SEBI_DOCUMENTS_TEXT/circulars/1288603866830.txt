1.  SEBI  has  received  feedback  from  investors  and  investor  associations  to 
improve  transparency  in  the  ‘grievance  redressal  mechanism’.  Based  on 
the  feedback  and  inputs  received  from  them  transparency  in  ‘grievance 
redressal’ is identified as a key area to augment investor protection. It is 
envisaged  that  transparency  will  also  improve  the  general  functioning  of 
the  market  by  providing  investors  the  wherewithal  to  make  informed 
choice. 

2.  Accordingly,  it  has  been  decided  that  the  Depositories  shall  henceforth 
disclose  the  details  of  complaints  lodged  by  Beneficiary  Owners  (BO’s)/

aforesaid disclosure shall also include details pertaining to arbitration and 
penal action against the DPs.

and their Registrar & Transfer Agents (RTA’s) and also to disseminate 
the same on the website;  

b.  arrange to disclose details as per the aforesaid reports in their website
