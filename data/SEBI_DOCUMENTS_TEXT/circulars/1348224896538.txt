All KYC Registration Agency (KRAs) 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 

Sub: Processing of Investor complaints against KRA {KYC (Know Your    Client) 

Registration Agency} in SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES) 

  
1.  SEBI has commenced processing of investor complaints in a centralized web based 

complaints redress system, “SCORES”. The salient features of this system are:  

  Centralised database of all complaints, 
  Online movement of complaints to the concerned KRA, 
  Online upload of Action Taker Report (ATRs) by the concerned KRA, and 
  Online  viewing  by  investors  of  actions  taken  on  the  complaint  and  its  current 

status. 
 

2.  Accordingly,  all  complaints  pertaining  to  KRAs  will  be  electronically  sent  through 
SCORES at http://scores.gov.in/Admin. You are hereby directed to view the pending 
complaints  and  submit  the  ATR  along  with  supporting  documents  electronically  in 
SCORES.  Please  note  that  updation  of  action  taken  would  not  be  possible  with 
physical ATRs. Hence, submission of physical ATR will not be accepted for complaints 
lodged in SCORES. 
 

3.  The user id and password for logging into SCORES at http://scores.gov.in/Admin are 

being communicated separately to KRAs. 

 
4.  KRAs shall take adequate steps for redressal of grievances within one month from the 
date of receipt of the complaint and keep the investor and SEBI duly informed on the 
action taken thereon. Failure to comply with the said requirement will render the KRA 
liable for penal action.
