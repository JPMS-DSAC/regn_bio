Dear Sir / Madam,  

Sub.: Submission of accounts for debt securities issued under the SEBI (Issue and Listing 
of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 

 

1.  Regulation  15  (1)  (b)  of  the  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities  by  Municipalities) 
Regulations,  2015  (SEBI  ILDM  regulations)  requires  that  an  issuer  making  issue  of  debt 
securities  under  these  regulations,  on  a  private  placement  basis,  shall  submit  its  accounts 
prepared in accordance with National Municipal Accounts Manual or in accordance with similar 
Municipal  Accounts  Manual  adopted  by  the  respective  State  Government  for  at  least  three 
immediately preceding financial years. 

 

2.  SEBI is in receipt of feedback that as per the processes followed by municipalities/ municipal 
corporations, the audited accounts for a financial year would be available by the end of the 
next financial year due to late approval of accounts. The accounts of a financial year, along 
with  the  budget  for  the  next  financial  year,  gets  approved  by  the  standing  committee  and 
governing body only in the next financial year. This leads to time lag of over one financial year.  

 

For example, as informed by municipalities, if the issue is made in the current financial year 
(FY)  i.e.  FY  2016-17,  the  accounts  would  be  required  to  be  submitted  for  the  FY  2013-14, 
2014-15 and 2015-16. In such a case, the municipalities would be able to submit the audited 
accounts  only  for  the  FY  2013-14  and  2014-15.  However,  for  the  FY  2015-16,  the  audited 
accounts would not be available before the month of June/July 2017.

In view of the above operational procedures followed by municipalities, it would be difficult for 
them  to  submit  the  audited  accounts  for  the  immediately  preceding  financial  year,  in  the 
information memorandum submitted to the stock exchanges, for the private placement issue 
of debt securities.  
 

3.  In order to kick-start and provide an impetus to the municipal bond market in India, it has been 
decided to provide following dispensation to the municipalities with respect to submission of 
accounts for private placement issues of debt securities under the SEBI ILDM regulations:- 
 

“Any issuer proposing to issue debt securities under these regulations, in the FY 2017-18, 
shall submit the following documents: 
 

a)  Audited  accounts  for  the  financial  years  2013-14,  2014-15  and  2015-16  in  the 

information memorandum to the stock exchanges.  

b)  For the immediately preceding FY i.e. FY 2016-17, the issuers shall submit the half 
yearly financial statements, as available (audited or unaudited) as on  September 
2016.  
 
However, the audited accounts for the said FY i.e 2016-17 shall be submitted within 
one year from the end of that FY (i.e. by March 31, 2018) to the recognized stock 
exchanges, where the debt securities have been listed. Such audited accounts shall 
be displayed on the website of the recognized stock exchanges and the issuer. The 
issuers shall also be required to provide on request, a copy (physical or electronic) 
of such audited accounts to its investors.” 

 

4.  The provisions of this circular shall be applicable for the debt securities issued, in accordance 
with SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 on or after 
April 01, 2017. 

 
5.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with regulation 29 of the SEBI ILDM Regulations, 
to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to 
regulate the securities markets.  
 

6.  This  Circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  categories  “Legal 

Framework”.
