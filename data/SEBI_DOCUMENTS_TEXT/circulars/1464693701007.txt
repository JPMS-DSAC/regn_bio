All Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies (AMCs)/  

Trustee Companies/Boards of Trustees of Mutual Funds  

 

Sir/ Madam, 

 

Subject: Restriction on redemption in Mutual Funds 

 

1.  Presently,  in  terms  of  circular  SEBI/IMD/CIR  No.5/126096/08  dated  May  23, 

2008, facility of restriction on redemption under any scheme of the mutual fund 

can be made  only after the approval from the Board of Directors of the Asset 

Management Company (AMC) and the Trustees. The provisions are general in 

nature  and  do  not  specifically  spell  out  the  circumstances  in  which  restriction 

on  redemption  may  be  applied;  leading  to  discretionary  disclosures  and 

practices in the industry.   

 

2.  Recent  instance  resulting  in  application  of  restriction  on  redemption  have 

necessitated  a  re-look  into  the  circumstances  that  require  such  restriction  on 

redemption.  As  a  philosophy,  restriction  on  redemption  should  apply  during 

excess redemption requests that could arise in overall market crisis situations 

rather  than  exceptional  circumstances  of  entity  specific  situations.  The 

circumstances  calling  for  restriction  on  redemption  should  be  such  that 

illiquidity is caused in almost all securities affecting the  market at large, rather 

than in any issuer specific securities. 

 

3.  Therefore,  in  order  to  bring  more  clarity  and  to  protect  the  interest  of  the 

investors,  the  following  requirement  shall  be  observed  before  imposing 

restriction on redemptions:

a.  Restriction may be imposed when there are circumstances leading to a 

systemic  crisis  or  event  that  severely  constricts  market  liquidity  or  the 

efficient functioning of markets such as:  

i.  Liquidity issues - when market at large becomes illiquid affecting 

almost  all  securities  rather  than  any  issuer  specific  security. 

AMCs should have in place sound internal liquidity management 

tools for schemes. Restriction  on redemption  cannot be used as 

an  ordinary  tool  in  order  to  manage  the  liquidity  of  a  scheme. 

Further,  restriction  on  redemption  due  to  illiquidity  of  a  specific 

security  in  the  portfolio  of  a  scheme  due  to  a  poor  investment 

decision, shall not be allowed. 

ii.  Market  failures,  exchange  closures  -  when  markets  are  affected 

by unexpected events which impact the functioning of exchanges 

or  the  regular  course  of  transactions.  Such  unexpected  events 

could also be related to political, economic, military, monetary or 

other emergencies. 

iii.  Operational issues – when exceptional circumstances are caused 

by 

force  majeure,  unpredictable  operational  problems  and 

technical  failures  (e.g.  a  black  out).  Such  cases  can  only  be 

considered  if  they  are  reasonably  unpredictable  and  occur  in 

spite  of  appropriate  diligence  of  third  parties,  adequate  and 

effective disaster recovery procedures and systems. 

b.  Restriction on redemption may be imposed for a specified period of time 

not exceeding 10 working days in any 90 days period. 

c.  Any imposition of restriction would require specific approval of Board of 

AMCs  and  Trustees  and  the  same  should  be  informed  to  SEBI 

immediately. 

d.  When  restriction  on  redemption  is  imposed,  the  following  procedure 

shall be applied:

i.  No redemption requests upto INR 2 lakh shall be subject to such 

restriction. 

ii.  Where  redemption  requests  are  above  INR  2  lakh,  AMCs  shall 

redeem the first INR 2 lakh without such restriction and remaining 

part  over  and  above  INR  2  lakh  shall  be  subject  to  such 

restriction. 

e.  Disclosure:  The  above  information  to  investors  shall  be  disclosed 

prominently and extensively in the scheme related documents regarding 

the  possibility  that  their  right  to  redeem  may  be  restricted  in  such 

exceptional  circumstances  and  the  time  limit  for  which  it  can  be 

restricted. 

 

4.  This circular shall be applicable immediately for (i) all schemes to be launched 

on or after the date of this circular and (ii) all the existing schemes with effect 

from July 01, 2016. 

 

5.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11 (1) 

of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act  1992,  read  with  the 

provision of Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulation, 1996 to protect 

the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and 

to regulate the securities market.
