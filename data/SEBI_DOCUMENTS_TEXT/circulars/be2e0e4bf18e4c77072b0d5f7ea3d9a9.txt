To,
All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ Custodians and AMFI/RAIN
Dear Sirs,
Compulsory Dematerialisation in Rolling Settlement effective January 02, 2002.
It has been decided that the stocks, which are not under compulsory rolling settlement as on July 02, 2001, would be brought under compulsory rolling settlement with effect from January 02, 2002.
All the Stock Exchanges are therefore, advised to ensure that the companies which have not established connectivity with both the Depositories are advised to do so on or before September 30, 2001 so as to facilitate compulsory trading in rolling settlement effective from January 02, 2002.
A compliance report by all the Stock Exchanges in this regard should be submitted to us by October 15, 2001.
Yours faithfully,
G. S. REDDY
