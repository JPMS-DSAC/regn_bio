Dear Sir, 
 
Sub:  Procedure for re-introduction of derivatives contracts and modified position 

limits 

 
This  circular  is  in  continuation  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  SMDRP/DC/CIR-13/02  dated 
December  18,  2002,  Circular  No  SEBI/DNPD/Cir-26/2004/07/16  dated  July  16,  2004, 
Circular  No  SEBI/DNPD/Cir-27/2004/07/16  dated  July  16,  2004  and  Circular  No 
DNPD/Cir-29/2005 dated September 14, 2005 issued to Derivative Exchange / Segment 
and their Clearing House / Corporation (hereinafter collectively referred to as Exchange).   
 
The  procedure  for  introduction,  dropping  and  re-introduction  of  derivatives  contracts, 
market  wide  position  limits  for  stock  based  derivatives  and  position  limits  for  index 
derivatives  were  reviewed  by  the  Secondary  Market  Advisory  Committee  (SMAC). 
Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  SMAC  the  procedure  for  re-introduction  of 
derivative contracts and modified position limits are as under. 
 
I.  PROCEDURE FOR  RE-INTRODUCTION OF DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS 

 

CHIEF GENERAL MANAGER 
DERIVATIVES AND NEW PRODUCTS DEPARTMENT 

 

1.  The procedure for introducing futures and option contracts on stocks for the first 
time shall continue to be in the manner specified under Clause I(3) of Circular No. 
SMDRP/DC/CIR-13/02 dated December 18, 2002.  

 
2.  The  exit  criteria  shall  be  more  flexible  as  compared  to  entry  criteria  in  order  to 
prevent frequent entry and exit of stocks in the derivatives segment. Therefore, for a 
stock  to  become  ineligible,  the  criteria  for  market  wide  position  limit  shall  be 
relaxed  upto  10%  of  the  criteria  applicable  for  the  stock  to  become  eligible  for 
derivatives  trading.  The  other  eligibility  conditions  would  be  applicable  mutas 
mutandis  for  the  stock  to  become  ineligible.  The  stock  should  fail  to  meet  the 
criteria  for  three  consecutive  months  for  the  stock  to  be  dropped  out  of  the 
derivatives segment. The procedure for dropping the stock would continue to be in 
the manner specified in Circular No. SMDRP/DC/CIR-13/02 dated December 18, 
2002.

II.  POSITION LIMITS 

3.  A stock which is dropped from derivatives trading may become eligible once again. 
In  such  instances,  the  stock  is  required  to  fulfill  the  eligibility  criteria  for  three 
consecutive months (instead of one month as specified earlier) to be re-introduced 
for derivatives trading. Derivative contracts on such stocks may be re-introduced by 
the  exchange  itself.  However,  introduction  of  futures  and  option  contracts  on  a 
stock for the first time would continue to be subject to SEBI approval.  
 

 
1.  Market wide position limits for single stock futures and stock option contracts 

 
The market wide position limit for single stock futures and stock option contracts 
prescribed  under  sub-clause  4(i)  of  clause  II  of  Circular  No.  SEBI/DNPD/Cir-
26/2004/07/16 dated July 16, 2004 stands modified. The market wide position limit 
shall henceforth be linked to the free float market capitalisation and shall be equal 
to 20% of the number of shares held by non-promoters in the relevant underlying 
security (i.e., free-float holding).   
 
This limit would be applicable on aggregate open positions in all futures and all 
option contracts on a particular underlying stock. 
 

2.  Trading Member/ FII/ Mutual Fund position limits in index derivative contracts 

 

Sub clause 4 (ii) of clause II of Circular No. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-26/2004/07/16 dated 
July 16, 2004, Clause I of Circular No. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-27/2004/07/16 dated July 
16,  2004  and  Clause  II  of  Circular  No.  DNPD/Cir-29/2005  dated  September  14, 
2005  on  trading  member/foreign  institutional  investor  (FII)/mutual  fund  position 
limits in equity index derivative contracts stand modified in the following manner–

dated July 16, 2004 shall continue to be applicable.
