Dear Sir/Madam,  
 

Sub: Modification of Client Codes of Non-institutional Trades Executed on Stock 

Exchanges (All Segments) 

  

1.  In  consultation  with  BSE,  MCX-SX,  NSE  and  USE,  it  has  been  decided  that  the  Stock 
Exchanges  may  allow  modifications  of  client  codes  of  non-institutional  trades  only  to 
rectify a genuine error in entry of client code at the time of placing / modifying the related 
order.  
 

2.  If  a  Stock  Exchange  wishes  to  allow  trading  members  to  modify  client  codes  of  non-

institutional trades, it shall  

 

a. lay  down  strict  objective  criteria,  with  the  approval  of  its  Governing  Board,  for 
identification  of  genuine  errors  in  client  codes  which  may  be  modified,  and 
disclose the same to market in advance,  

b. set up a mechanism to monitor that the trading members modify client codes only 

as per the strict objective criteria, and  

c. ensure that modification of client codes is covered in the internal audit of trading 
members prescribed by SEBI through its Circular No MRD/DMSCir-29/2008 dated 
October 21, 2008. 

 

3.  Notwithstanding the above,  

A. the Stock Exchanges shall levy a penalty from trading members and credit the same to 
its Investor Protection Fund as under:    
  

 

‘a’ as % of ‘b’  

≤ 5 
> 5 

Penalty as % of ‘a’

Where  
a = Value (turnover) of non-institutional trades where client codes have been modified by 
a trading member in a segment during a month. 
b  =  Value  (turnover)  of  non-institutional  trades  of  the  trading  member  in  the  segment 
during the month. 
 
B.  The  Stock  Exchange  shall  conduct  a  special  inspection  of  the  trading  member  to 
ascertain whether the modifications of client codes are being carried on as per the strict 
objective criteria set by the Stock Exchange, as directed in Para 2 above, if ‘a’ as % of ‘b’, 
as defined above, exceeds 1% during a month and take appropriate disciplinary action, if 
any deficiency is observed.
