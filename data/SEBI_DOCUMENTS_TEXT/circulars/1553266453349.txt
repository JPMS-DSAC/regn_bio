Sir / Madam, 

 

Sub: Valuation of money market and debt securities  

 

1.0  Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  of  short  term 

maturity: 

 

1.1  Kindly  refer  to  SEBI  circulars  IMD/CIR  No.16/  193388/2010  dated 

February 02, 2010 read with Cir/IMD/DF/6/2012 dated February 28, 2012. 

The  aforementioned  SEBI  circulars  currently  permit  amortization  based 

valuation  of  non-traded  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including 

floating rate securities,  with residual maturity of upto 60 days.  In order to 

make  the  existing  valuation  practices  for  aforesaid  securities  more 

reflective of the realizable value, the following has been decided: 

 

1.1.1 

The residual maturity for amortization based valuation as referred to in 

SEBI  circular  dated  February  28,  2012  shall  be  reduced  from  existing 

60 days to 30 days.  

  

1.1.2 

Further, the amortized price shall be compared with the reference price 

which shall be the average of the security level price of such security as 

provided  by  the  agency(ies)  appointed  by  AMFI  for  said  purpose 

(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “valuation  agencies”).  The  amortized  price

shall be used for valuation only if it is within a threshold of ±0.025% of 

the reference price. In case of deviation beyond this threshold, the price 

shall  be  adjusted  to  bring  it  within  the  threshold  of  ±0.025%  of  the 

reference price.  

 

 

 
 

2.0  Valuation of money market and debt securities which are rated below 

investment grade: 

 

2.1 

In  order  to  have  uniformity  and  consistency  across  the  Mutual  Fund 

industry  on  valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  rated  below 

investment grade, the following has been decided:  

 

2.1.1  All  money  market  and  debt  securities  which  are  rated  below  investment 

grade shall be valued at the price provided by valuation agencies.  

 

2.1.2  Till  such  time  the  valuation  agencies  compute  the  valuation  of  money 

market  and  debt  securities  classified  as  below  investment  grade,  such 

securities  shall  be  valued  on  the  basis  of  indicative  haircuts  provided  by 

these agencies. These  indicative  haircuts  shall  be  applied on  the  date of 

credit event i.e. migration of the security to sub-investment grade and shall 

continue  till  the  valuation  agencies  compute  the  valuation  price  of  such 

securities.  Further,  these  haircuts  shall  be  updated  and  refined,  as  and 

when  there  is  availability  of  material  information  which  impacts  the 

haircuts. 

 

2.1.3  Consideration of traded price for valuation: 

 

2.1.3.1 

In  case  of  trades  during  the  interim  period  between  date  of  credit 

event  and  receipt  of  valuation  price  from  valuation  agencies,  AMCs 

shall  consider  such  traded  price  for  valuation  if  it  is  lower  than  the 

price post standard haircut. The said traded price shall be considered

for  valuation  till  the  valuation  price  is  determined  by  the  valuation

2.1.3.2 

In  case  of  trades  after  the  valuation  price  is  computed  by  the 

valuation  agencies  as  referred  above  and  where  the  traded  price  is 

lower  than  such  computed  price,  such  traded  price  shall  be 

considered for the purpose of valuation and the valuation price may 

be revised accordingly.  

 

2.1.3.3  The trades referred above shall be of a minimum size as determined 

by valuation agencies. 

 

2.1.4  AMCs  may  deviate from  the  indicative  haircuts  and/or  the  valuation  price 

for  money  market  and  debt  securities  rated  below  investment  grade 

provided by the valuation agencies subject to the following:

price  provided  by  the  valuation  agencies  shall  be  recorded  by  the

impact of such deviation on scheme NAV (in amount and percentage
