Dear Sir / Madam,
 
Sub: Global Trust Bank Ltd

 
Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) has informed the exchanges that as per the Government of India Notifications, Global Trust Bank Ltd (GTB) has been amalgamated with OBC w.e.f August 14, 2004. Further, OBC has fixed August 31, 2004 as the Record Date for the purpose of determining the shareholders of erstwhile GTB.
 
 
On account of Scheme of Amalgamation and the fixation of August 31, 2004 as the record date, trading in the equity shares of GTB would be suspended w.e.f August 27, 2004 (i.e closing hours of August 26, 2004).
 
 
Further, in light of the above, the depositories shall also freeze the ISIN of GTB after the specified record date i.e w.e.f September 1, 2004. This would be necessary to ensure that no further transfers take place in the GTB scrip, including off market transactions, after the specified record date.
 
 
The Stock Exchanges / Depositories are advised to bring the aforesaid provisions to the notice of their constituents and also to disseminate the same on their websites, immediately.
 

 
Yours faithfully,
