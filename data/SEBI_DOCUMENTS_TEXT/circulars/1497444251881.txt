CIRCULAR

CIR/MRD/DP/56/2017 
 
 
To,  
The Depositories, 
 
 
Dear Sir / Madam, 
 

Subject: Recording of Non Disposal Undertaking (NDU) in the Depository System  

1.  The  depository  system  provides  a  transparent  mechanism  for  recording  pledge 

transactions entered between lenders and borrowers. 
  

2.  SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, requires 
promoters  of  a  company  to  disclose  details  of  their  encumbered  shares  including 
NDUs  by  promoters  which  are  covered  under  the  scope  of  disclosures  of 
'Encumbrances'.  

 

3.  It has been observed that some shareholders, primarily promoters, enter into non-
disposal  agreements/  non-disposal  undertaking  (NDU)  for  borrowing  funds  from 
various  lenders.  NDUs  are  typically  undertakings  given  by  a  shareholder  not  to 
transfer  or  otherwise  alienate  the  securities  and  are  in  the  nature  of  negative  lien 
given in favour of another party, usually a lender. 

 

4.  It is observed that currently there is no framework to capture the details of NDU in 
the  depository  system  as  these  happen  outside  the  depository  system  and  are  not 
captured and reflected in the records of the depositories. Therefore, in order to enable 
the shareholders to record the NDUs in the depository system, it has been decided to 
permit the depositories to offer a system for capturing and recording the NDUs.  

 

5.  In this regard, the depositories are advised the following: 

 

5.1.Depositories shall develop a separate module/ transaction type in their system for 

recording NDUs.  
 

5.2. Both parties to the NDU shall have a demat account with the same depository and 

be KYC compliant. 

 

5.3.Pursuant  to  entering  the  NDU,  the  Beneficial  Owner  (BO)  along  with  the  other 
party shall make an application through the participant (where the BO holds his 
securities) to the depository, for the purpose of recording the NDU transaction.

5.4. The  application  shall  necessarily  include  details  of  BO  ID,  PAN,  email-id, 
signature(s),    name  of  the  entity  in  whose  favor  such  NDU  is  entered  and  the 
quantity  of  securities.  Such  entity  in  whose  favor  NDU  is  entered  shall  also

recorded in that entity’s demat account. 

 

5.5. The participant after being satisfied that the securities are available for NDU shall 
record  the  NDU  and  freeze  for  debit  the  requisite  quantity  of  securities  under

5.6.The depositories shall make suitable provisions for capturing the details of BO ID 
and PAN of the entity in whose favor such NDU is entered by the participant.  The 
depositories  shall  also  make  available  to  the  said  participant,  the  details  of 
authorized signatories as recorded in the demat account of the entity in whose 
favor such NDU is entered.    
 

5.7.On creation of freeze in the depository system, the depository/ participant of the 
BO  holding  shares,  shall  inform  both  parties  of  the  NDU  regarding  creation  of 
freeze under NDU.   
 

5.8.The  depositories  shall  make  suitable  provisions  for  capturing  the  details  of 

company/ promoters if they are part of the NDU. 

 

5.9.In case if the participant does not create the NDU, it shall intimate the same to the 

parties of the NDU along with the reasons thereof. 

 

5.10.Once the freeze for debits is created under the NDU for a particular quantity of 
shares,  the  depository  shall  not  facilitate  or  effect  any  transfer,  pledge, 
hypothecation, lending, rematerialisation or in any manner alienate or otherwise 
allow dealing in the shares held under NDU till receipt of instructions from both 
parties for the cancellation of NDU. 

 

5.11.The  entry  of  NDU  made  as  per  para  5.5  above  may  be  cancelled  by  the 
depository/ participant of the BO through unfreeze of specified quantity if parties 
to  the  NDU  jointly  make  such  application  to  the  depository  through  the 
participant of the BO. 

 

5.12.On  unfreeze  of  shares  upon  termination/  cancellation  of  NDU,  the  depository 
shall inform both parties of the NDU in the form and manner agreed upon at the 
time  of  creating  the  freeze.  The  unfreeze  shall  be  effected  in  the  depository
