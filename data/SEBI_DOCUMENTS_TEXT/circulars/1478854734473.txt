Dear Sir / Madam,  

 

Sub.: Clarification on aspects related to day count convention  for debt securities issued 
under the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 

 

1.  SEBI vide circular no. SEBI/CBM/BOND/2/2007/13/04 dated April 13, 2007 had provided 
for  the  launch  of  trading  platform  for  the  corporate  bond  market.  Further,  SEBI,  vide 
Circular  no  CIR/IMD/DF/18/2013  dated  October  29,  2013  had  clarified  certain  issues 
pertaining to primary issuance of debt securities. SEBI vide the aforesaid circular dated 
October  29,  2013,  had  inter-alia  specified  that  the  cash flows  emanating  from  the  debt 
securities  shall  be  mentioned  in  the  prospectus/disclosure  document,  by  way  of  an 
illustration. It was mentioned that if the coupon payment date of the debt securities, falls 
on a Sunday or a holiday, the coupon payment shall be made on the next working day. If 
the maturity  date  of  the  debt  securities, falls  on  a Sunday  or  a  holiday,  the  redemption 
proceeds shall be paid on the previous working day.  

 
2.  SEBI  was  is  in  receipt  of  a  representation  from  the  market  participants,  wherein  it  was 
stated that different conventions are being followed with respect to calculation of interest 
payments  on  debt  securities,  multiple  standards  and  different  holiday  calendars  are 
considered  for  leap  year  calculations  and  payment  of  interest  and  maturity  proceeds 
respectively. 
 

3.  Based on the discussions with different stakeholders, following clarifications are made:

a)  If  the  interest  payment  date  falls  on  a  holiday,  the  payment  may  be  made  on  the 
following working day however the dates of the future coupon payments would be as 
per the schedule originally stipulated at the time of issuing the security. In other words, 
the subsequent coupon schedule would not be disturbed merely because the payment 
date in respect of one particular coupon payment has been postponed earlier because 
of it having fallen on a holiday. 
 

 This is illustrated with the help of the following example:   

 

 Date of Issue of Corporate bonds    : July 01, 2016  
Date of Maturity                               : June 30, 2018    
Date of coupon payments               : January 01 and July 01 

                                Coupon payable                              : semi-annually 

 

In this case, January 01, 2017 is a Sunday, thus the coupon would be payable 
on  January  02,  2017  i.e.  the  next  working  day.  However  the  calculation  for 
payment of interest will be only till December 31, 2016, which would have been 
the case if January 01, 2017 were not a holiday. Also, the next dates of payment 
would remain July 01, 2017 and January 01, 2018 despite the fact that one of 
the interest payment was made on January 02, 2017.  

 

b)  In order to ensure consistency for interest calculation, a uniform methodology shall be 
followed for calculation of interest payments in the case of leap year, which shall be as 
follows: 
 
In  case  of  a  leap  year,  if  February  29  falls  during  the  tenor  of  a  security,  then  the 
number of days shall be reckoned as 366 days (Actual/Actual day count convention) 
for a whole one year period, irrespective of whether the interest is payable annually, 
half yearly, quarterly or monthly etc. It is thus emphasized that for a half yearly interest 
payment, 366 days would be reckoned twice as the denominator; for quarterly interest, 
four times and for monthly interest payment, twelve times. 

 

 

This is illustrated with the help of the following example:  

                                Coupon payable                         :  semi-annually 

Date of issue of corporate bonds: January 01, 2016 

Date of coupon payments          :  July 01 and January 01

In the above example, in case of the leap year (i.e, 2016), 366 days would be 
reckoned  as  the  denominator  (Actual/Actual),  for  payment  of  interest,  in  both 
the half year periods i.e.  Jan 01, 2016 to Jul 01, 2016 and Jul 01, 2016 to Jan 
01, 2017. 

c)  In order to ensure uniformity for payment of interest/redemption with respect to debt 
securities, it has been decided that interest/redemption payments shall be made only 
on the days when the money market is functioning in Mumbai.  

 
4.  The  provisions  of  this  circular  shall  be  applicable  for  the  debt  securities  issued,  in 
accordance with SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008, on or after 
January 01, 2017. 

 
5.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interests of investors in securities 
and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities markets.  
 

6.  This Circular is available on SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in under the categories “Legal 

Framework”.
