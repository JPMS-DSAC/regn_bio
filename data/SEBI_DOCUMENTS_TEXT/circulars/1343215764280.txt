Dear Sir/Madam, 
 

Sub: Contents of Application Form and Abridged Prospectus for Public Issue of 

Debt Securities 

 
Background 
 
1.  SEBI had notified SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations in 2008 
specifying norms for public issue of debt securities and privately placed listed debt 
securities.  

2.  With  respect  to  public  issue  of  debt  securities,  there  is  currently  no  specified 
standard  format  for  the  Application  Form  and  Abridged  Prospectus.  This  has 
resulted in different application forms and abridged prospectus being used in public 
issues of debt securities. 

 
3.  In  order  to  standardize  the  Application  Form  and  Abridged  Prospectus  for  public 
issue of debt securities, the existing forms and abridged prospectus were discussed 
and  deliberated  upon  with  market  participants.  Based  on  the  discussions,  the 
structure, design, format, contents and organization of information in the Application 
Form  and  Abridged  Prospectus  have  been  standardized  and  made  uniform  for 
public issues of debt securities.
