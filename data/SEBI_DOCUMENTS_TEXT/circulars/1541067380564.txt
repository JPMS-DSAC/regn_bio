Dear Sir / Madam, 

 

Sub: Streamlining the Process of Public Issue of Equity Shares and convertibles 

 

1.  SEBI, in its endeavor to provide an efficient mechanism for raising funds, has been 

continuously  striving  to  streamline  the  process  and  methodologies  associated  with 

public  issue  fund  raising  process.  Towards  this  end,  the  time  duration  from  issue 

closure to listing was shortened from 12 working days to 6 working days with effect 

from  January  01,  2016,  making  Application  Supported  by  Blocked  Amount  (ASBA) 

mechanism as the sole payment mechanism in public issues. 

 

2.  As  a  part  of  the  continuing  efforts  to  further  streamline  the  process,  it  has  been 

decided,  in  consultation  with  the  stake  holders  to  introduce  the  use  of  Unified 

Payments  Interface  (UPI)  as  a  payment  mechanism  with  Application  Supported  by 

 

Page 1 of 40 

Block  Amount  (ASBA)  for applications  in public  issues  by  retail  individual  investors 

through intermediaries (Syndicate members, Registered Stock Brokers, Registrar and 

Transfer agent and Depository Participants). The proposed process would increase 

efficiency,  eliminate  the  need  for  manual  intervention  at  various  stages,  and  will 

reduce the time duration from issue closure to listing by upto 3 working days. 

 

3.  Considering the time required for making necessary changes to the systems and to 

ensure  complete  and  smooth  transition  to  UPI  payment  mechanism,  the  proposed 

alternate payment mechanism and consequent reduction in timelines is proposed to 

be introduced in a phased manner as under: 

 

3.1  Phase I: From January 01, 2019, the UPI mechanism for retail individual investors 

through intermediaries will be made effective along with the existing process and 

existing timeline of T+6 days. The same will continue, for a period of 3 months or 

floating of 5 main board public issues, whichever is later.  

 

3.2  Phase  II:  Thereafter,  for  applications  by  retail  individual  investors  through 

intermediaries,  the  existing  process  of  physical  movement  of  forms  from 

intermediaries  to  Self-Certified  Syndicate  Banks  (SCSBs)  for  blocking  of  funds 

will  be  discontinued and  only  the  UPI  mechanism  with  existing  timeline of T+6 

days  will  continue,  for  a  period  of  3  months  or  floating  of  5  main  board  public 

issues, whichever is later.  

 

3.3  Phase III: Subsequently, final reduced timeline will be made effective using the 

UPI mechanism.  

 

4.  New  entities  /  mechanisms  part  of  the  public  issue  process  using  UPI  with 

ASBA 

National  Payments  Corporation  of  India  (NPCI):  NPCI,  a  Reserve  Bank of India 

(RBI) initiative, is an umbrella organization for all retail payments in India. It has been 

 

Page 2 of 40 

set up with the guidance and support of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Indian 

Banks Association (IBA); 

 

Unified Payments Interface (UPI): UPI is an instant payment system developed by 

the  NPCI.  It  enables  merging  several  banking  features,  seamless  fund  routing  & 

merchant payments into one hood. UPI allows instant transfer of money between any 

two  persons’  bank  accounts  using  a  payment  address  which  uniquely  identifies  a 

person's bank a/c.  

 

Sponsor Bank: Sponsor Bank  means a Banker to the Issue registered with  SEBI 

which is appointed by the Issuer to act as a conduit between the Stock Exchanges 

and NPCI in order to push the mandate collect requests and / or payment instructions 

of the retail investors into the UPI; 

 

5.  Channels for making application  

5.1  For the purpose of public issues, UPI would allow facility to block the funds at the 

time of application. With the introduction of UPI as a payment mechanism, various 

channels for making application in public issue by various categories of investors, 

in Phase I would be as below:

in  such  intimation.  The  RII  would  also  be  able  to  view  an  attachment

the  details  properly,  RII  would  be  required  to  proceed  to  authorize  the

mandate for each application in the IPO.

would also be received by the RII. 

2.2.6.  The information containing status of block request (e.g. – accepted / decline

exchange with RTA in the form of a file for the purpose of reconciliation. 

2.2.8.  RIIs would continue to have the option to modify or withdraw the bid till the 

closure  of  the  bidding  period.  For  each  such  modification  of  bid,  RII  will 

submit  a  revised  bid  and  shall  receive  a  mandate  request  from  sponsor 

bank to be validated as per the process indicated above. 

 

2.3. Post  issue  closure  –  Finalization  of  basis  of  allotment  of  shares,  debit  of 

blocked amount, credit of shares and listing 

2.3.1.  Post  closure  of  the  offer,  the  stock  exchange  would  share  the bid  details 

with  RTA.  Further,  stock  exchange  would  also  provide  RTA  the  final  file 

received  from  Sponsor  Bank,  containing  status  of  blocked  funds  or 

otherwise, along with the bank account details with respect to applications

Page 15 of 40 

confirmation corresponding to the bids by all investor category applications 

(with and without the use of UPI) and prepare the basis of allotment.  

2.3.3.  Upon  approval  of  basis  of  allotment,  RTA  will  share  the  debit  file  with 

Sponsor  bank  (through  Stock  exchange)  and  SCSBs,  as  applicable,  for 

credit of funds in the public issue account and unblocking of excess funds 

in the RIIs account. The Sponsor bank based on the mandate approved by 

the RII at the time of blocking of funds, will raise the debit / collect request 

from RIIs bank account, whereupon the funds will be transferred from RIIs 

account  to  public  issue  account  and  remaining  funds,  if  any,  will  be 

unblocked without any manual intervention by RII or his / her bank.  

2.3.4.  Upon  confirmation  of  receipt of funds  in the public  issue  account, shares 

would be credited to the RII’s account. RII will be notified for full/partial/no 

allotment.  For  partial  allotment  the  remaining  funds  would  be  unblocked. 

For no allotment, mandate would be revoked and application amount would 

be unblocked for the RII. 

2.3.5.  Thereafter, Stock Exchanges will issue the listing and trading approval and 

trading will commence next working day.
