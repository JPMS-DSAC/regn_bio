Dear Sir / Madam, 

 

Sub: Streamlining the Process of Public Issue of Equity Shares and convertibles- 

Implementation  of  Phase  II  of  Unified  Payments  Interface  with  Application 

Supported by Block Amount 

 

1.  This  refers  to  SEBI  circular  No.  SEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2018/138      dated 

November 1, 2018, vide which SEBI had introduced the use of Unified Payments 

Interface  (UPI)  as  a  payment  mechanism  with  Application  Supported  by  Block 

Amount  (ASBA)  for  applications  in  public  issues  by  retail  individual  investors 

through intermediaries (Syndicate members, Registered Stock Brokers, Registrar 

and Transfer agent and Depository Participants), with effect from January 1, 2019. 

Implementation of the same was to be carried out in a phased manner to ensure 

gradual transition to UPI with ASBA. 

 

 

2.  In  order  to  ensure  that  the  transition  to  UPI  in  ASBA  is  smooth  for  all  the 

stakeholders, the timeline for implementation of Phase I of the aforesaid Circular 

was  extended  by  3  months 

i.e. 

till  June  30,  2019  vide  Circular  No. 

SEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2019/50 dated April 3, 2019.  

 

Implementation of Phase II 

3.  Accordingly,  Phase  II  of  the  aforesaid  Circular  dated  November  01,  2018,  shall 

become effective from July 1, 2019. Thereafter, for applications by retail individual 

investors through intermediaries, the existing process of, investor submitting bid-

cum-application form with any intermediary along with bank account details, and 

movement  of  such  application  forms  from  intermediaries  to  Self-Certified 

Syndicate Banks (SCSBs) for blocking of funds, will be discontinued i.e. Channel 

III at Para 5.1 of Circular dated November 01, 2018 would discontinue. For such 

applications only the UPI mechanism would be the permissible mode i.e. Channel 

IV at Para 5.1 of the said Circular. 

 

4.  In Phase II, the existing timeline of T+6 days will continue, for a period of 3 months 

or floating of 5 main board public issues, whichever is later. The implementation of 

Phase III shall continue unchanged as per the aforesaid Circular from the date of 

completion of Phase II, as above.
