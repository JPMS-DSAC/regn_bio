Sub: Rationalisation of Debt Limits 

1.  The Government of India has issued a Press Release dated March  23, 2013 wherein, inter 
alia,  the  following  measures  have  been  proposed  to  simplify  the  framework  of  FII  debt 
limits : 
 

a.  Merger of existing debt limits into following two broad categories :  

 

 

i.  Government  securities  of  US$  25  billion  (  by  merging  Government  Debt  – 

Old of US$ 10 billion and Government Debt – Long Term of US$ 15 billion).  

ii.  Corporate bonds of US$ 51 billion (by merging US$ 1 billion for QFIs, US$ 25 

billion for FIIs and US$ 25 billion for FIIs in long term infra bonds). 

 

 

b.  On  account  of  the  room  created  by  unifying  the  debt  categories,  the  current  SEBI 
auction mechanism  of  allocating  debt  limits for corporate  bonds, shall  be  replaced 
by the ‘on tap system’ currently in place for infrastructure bonds. 

2.  Accordingly,  in  partial  modification  of  Para  4  of  the  SEBI  circular  CIR/IMD/FIIC/3/2013 
dated  February  08,  2013,  the  categories  of  Government  Debt  Old  (US$  10  billion)  and 
Government Debt Long Term (US$ 15 billion) shall be merged into a single category named 
'Government  Debt'  and  the  combined  limit  shall  be  US$  25  billion,  equivalent  to  INR 
124,432  crores. 
 

3.  Further, in partial modification to Para 4 of the SEBI circular CIR/IMD/FIIC/3/2013 dated 
February  08,  2013,  the  following  categories  of  debt  limits  shall  be  merged  into  a  single 
category named 'Corporate Debt' : 

a.  Corporate Debt – Old for FIIs (US$ 20 billion) 
b.  Corporate Debt – Old for QFIs (US$ 1 billion) 
c.  Corporate Debt – Long Term (US$ 5 billion)

5.  Vide  circular  CIR/IMD/FIIC/12/2012  dated  April  27,  2012,  SEBI  had  indicated  that  the 
auction  of  debt  limits  would  be  conducted  on  20th  of  every  month  (if  20th  is  holiday, 
auction shall be done on the next working day), based on availability of free limits at the end 
of respective previous month. In partial modification of the said circular, it has been decided 
that  FIIs  can  now  invest  in  Corporate  Debt  without  purchasing  debt  limits  till  the  overall 
investment  reaches  90%  after  which  the  auction  mechanism  would  be  initiated  for 
allocation  of  the  remaining  limits,  as  currently  in  place  for  Corporate  Debt  Long  Term 
Infrastructure bonds. 
 

6.  It is clarified that consequent to the changes as above, the facility of re-investment provided 
vide  SEBI  circular  CIR/IMD/FIIC/18/2010  dated  November  26,  2010  as  well  as  the 
restrictions  on  re-investment  as  given  in  the  SEBI  circulars  CIR/IMD/FIIC/1/2012  dated 
January  03,  2012,  CIR/IMD/FIIC/22/2012  dated  November  07,  2012 
and 
CIR/IMD/FIIC/1/2013  dated  January  01,  2013    shall  no  longer  apply  in  respect  of  limits 
held/investments made by FIIs in  the Corporate Debt category, till the limits are available 
on tap. 
 

7.  It  is  further  clarified  that  for  those  FIIs  which  had  obtained  Debt  limits  in  the  debt  limit 
auctions held on February 20, 2013 and on March 20, 2013, the time period for utilization

of Corporate Debt limits allocated through the bidding process shall be 60 days , in terms of 
the SEBI circular CIR/IMD/FIIC/22/2012 dated November 07, 2012.  
 

8.  The status of utilization of debt limits as on March 31, 2013 indicating the quantum of limits 
which are freely available for investments by FIIs and QFIs shall be put on the SEBI website 
and  thereafter,  the  monitoring  of  investments  by  FIIs  and  the  dissemination  of  daily  data 
shall be done by the depositories in the same manner as is being done in the case of QFIs. 
For this purpose`e, the mechanism laid down in Para 4 of the SEBI circular CIR/IMD/FII&C/ 
17/2012 dated July 18, 2012 shall apply mutatis mutandis. The custodians shall provide the 
necessary data to the depositories on a daily basis for this purpose. Accordingly, the present 
practice of dissemination of fortnightly debt utilization status shall be discontinued.  

 

This  circular  shall  come  into  effect  immediately.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers 
conferred  under  SEBI  Section  11  (1)  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  to
