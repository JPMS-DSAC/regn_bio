Dear Sirs, 

Subject: Investor Grievance Redressal Mechanism at Stock Exchanges. 

1.  Please refer to SEBI circular no. CIR/MRD/DSA/03/2012 dated January 20, 2012 and 
SEBI  circular  no.  SMD/Policy/Cir-32/1997  regarding  the  investor  service  centres.  At 
present,  the  stock  exchanges  having  nationwide  terminals,  such  as  National  Stock 
Exchange  of  India  Ltd.(NSE)  and  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  Ltd.(BSE)  operating  in 
equity  as  well  as  equity  derivative  segments  are  providing  investor  grievance 
redressal  mechanism  and  arbitration  facility  (arbitration  as  well  as  appellate 
arbitration) at four regional centres (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai). 

 
2.  With a view to increase investor confidence in the securities market and in order to 
make it more convenient to the investors to file their grievances and arbitration cases 
near to their places, SEBI has initiated steps to set-up this facility by stock exchanges 
at  more  centres  after  examining  the  data  on  complaints  and  arbitrations  filed  by 
investors from various regions.  In consultation with all the major stock exchanges, it 
has been decided that initially:  

i.  NSE  and  BSE  shall  set  up  Investor  grievance  redressal  mechanism  at  Ahmedabad 
and Hyderabad by March 31, 2012 and at Kanpur and Indore by September 30, 2012.  

 

 

ii.  NSE  and  BSE  shall  provide  arbitration  facility  (arbitration  as  well  as  appellate 
arbitration) at all the above mentioned four new centers by September 30, 2012. They 
shall abide by all the applicable circulars issued by SEBI in this regard. 

 
iii.  NSE  and  BSE  shall  have  adequate  infrastructure  and  manpower,  as  considered 
appropriate, at these new centres to handle investor grievance redressal mechanism 
and arbitration facility effectively.  

 
3.  The Stock Exchanges are directed to: 
 

a. bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the Stock Brokers and also    
    disseminate the same on their websites. 
b. make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations 
    for the implementation of the above decision in co-ordination with one another 
    to achieve uniformity in approach. 
c. communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of 
    this circular in the Monthly Development Report of the following month;
