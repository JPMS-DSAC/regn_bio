Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
Sub:  Separate  limit  of  Interest  Rate  Futures  (IRFs)  for  Foreign  Portfolio  Investors 
(FPIs) 
 
1.  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  in  its  Statement  on  Developmental  and  Regulatory  Policies, 
released on August 02, 2017, proposed to allocate a separate limit of INR 5,000 crore to 
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) for taking long position in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) 
in order to facilitate further market development and to ensure that FPIs’ access to bond 
futures  remains  uninterrupted  during  the  phase  when  FPI  limits  on  Government 
securities are under auction.  
 

2.  Accordingly, it has been decided to allocate a separate limit of INR 5,000 crore to FPIs 
for  taking  long  position  in  IRFs.  Para    13  (d)  of  Annexure  1  to  SEBI  Circular 
CIR/MRD/DRMNP/35/2013 dated December 05, 2013 and Para 13 (c) of Annexure 1 to 
SEBI Circular CIR/MRD/DRMNP/11/2015 dated June 12, 2015 stand partially modified 
to that extent.  

 

3.  This limit will be calculated as follows: 

 

a.  For each interest rate futures instrument, position of FPIs with a net long position will 
be aggregated. FPIs with a net short position in the instrument will not be reckoned. 

 

 

b.  No  FPI  can  acquire net  long  position  in  excess  of  INR  1,800  crore  at  any  point of 

time. 
 

4.  For  monitoring  the  limit  as  mentioned  in  Paragraph  ‘3’  above  and  in  SEBI    Circular 
CIR/MRD/DRMNP/2/2014 dated January 20, 2014,  Stock Exchanges, after consulting 
amongst themselves, shall adhere to the following mechanism: 

 

a.  Stock  Exchanges  shall  put  in  place  necessary  mechanism  for  monitoring  and 

enforcing limits of FPIs in IRFs.

b.  Stock Exchanges shall aggregate net long position in IRF of all FPIs taken together 
at end of the day and shall jointly publish/ disseminate the same on their website on 
daily basis. 

 

c.  Once  90%  of  the  limit  is  utilized,  Stock  Exchanges  shall  put  in  place  necessary 
mechanism to get alerts and publish on their websites the available limit, on a daily 
basis. 
 

d.  In case, there is any breach of the threshold limit, the FPI/s whose investment caused 
the breach shall square off their excess position/s within five trading days or by expiry 
of contract, whichever is earlier. 

 

5.  The  limits  prescribed  for  investment  by  FPIs  in  Government  Securities  (currently  INR 
301,500 crore) shall be exclusively available for investment in Government Securities.  

 

This circular shall come into effect immediately. This circular is issued in exercise of powers 
conferred under Section 11(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.
