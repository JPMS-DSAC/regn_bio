INSTRUCTIONS TO REGISTRARS TO AN ISSUE /  

SHARE TRANSFER AGENTS 

______________________________________________ 

 

In exercise of the powers conferred on it generally by the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 
and especially those contained in section 11 thereof as also in implementation of the SEBI 
(Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Regulations, 1993,  SEBI has, from 
time to time, been issuing circulars containing operational guidelines / instructions to be 
followed by all Registrars to an Issue (RTI) and / or Share Transfer Agents (STA) holding a 
certificate of registration granted to them in accordance with the Regulations. 
 
In  continuation  of  the  previous  Circular,  dated  November  5,  1993,  all  Registrars  to  an 
Issue  and  Share  Transfer  Agents  are  advised  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  Instructions 
contained herein.   
 
Agreement to be entered into with Issuer / body corporate.  
 
1.   In terms of rule 4(1)(b) of the SEBI (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) 
Rules, 1993,  all Registrars to an Issue / Share Transfer Agents are required to enter 
into a legally valid agreement with the Issuers / Body corporate.  SEBI has evolved 
models of Agreement to be entered into between RTI and Issuer (Annexure A) and 
STA and Body corporate (Annexure B). The models have been formulated with a view  
to bringing about standardisation in the legal relationship between the RTI and Issuer 
and STA and body corporate.  While the RTI / STA and the Issuer / body corporate 
may suitably modify the agreement depending upon the circumstances of each case, 
they  should,  as  far  as  possible,  observe  the  spirit  behind  the  various  clauses 
contained  in  the  model  agreements.    While  doing  so,  it  must  also  be  ensured  that 
neither  party  should  reserve  for  itself  any  rights  which  would  have  the  effect  of 
diminishing in any way its liabilities and obligations under the Companies Act, 1956 
and SEBI (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Rules and Regulations, 
1993.   

Where the Registrar to an Issue / Share Transfer agent is a company the agreement 
should be executed by persons authorized to execute documents in accordance with 
the  Articles  of  Associations  of  the  company;    in  case  of  partnership  firms  the 
Agreement  should  be  executed  by  all  the  partners  or  the  Managing  partner  acting 
under the authority of the other partners; and in the case of a proprietary concern, by 
the proprietor himself.   

The  Agreement  must  be  stamped  according  to  the  Local  Stamp  Laws  for  the  time 
being in force at the place of execution.   

In the case of a large issue, the Issuer may decide to appoint / associate more than 
one RTI.  In such a case the Agreement shall be executed by all the RTIs and the 
Issuer  and  the  Lead  Manager  shall  be  a  confirming  party.    The  scope  of  work  and 
responsibilities of each Registrar shall be clearly spelt out in the Agreement. 

The Agreement entered into by a RTI with an Issuer shall be valid at least until the 
expiry  of  one  year  from  the  date  of  closing  of  the  Issue  and  in  the  case  of  an 
Agreement    entered  into  by  a  STA  with  a  body  corporate,  it  shall  be  valid  for  a 
minimum period of one year renewable if the circumstances so require.

(ii) 

(iii) 

Keeping  the  investors  interest  in  mind,  RTI  /  STA  shall  not  accept  work 
disproportionate  to  its  capacity.  RTI  /  STA  shall  not  unload  the  entire  / 
substantial  portion  of  its  activities  to  outside  agencies  except  in  case  of 
exigencies beyond its control. 
 
RTI / STA shall handle its activities  only from the offices declared to SEBI and 
approved  by  it.    The  addresses  of  such  offices  shall  only  be  informed  to  the 
investors and printed in issue stationery, etc.  If a RTI / STA has a full-fledged 
Investor  Relations  Centre  (IRC)  and  has  obtained  SEBI’s  approval  for  the 
same,  the  address    of  the  IRC  may  be  stated,  but  only  in  addition  to  the 
approval of the same, the address of the IRC may be sated, but only in addition 
to the approved offices.  The RTI / STA shall neither close its offices nor carry 
on  activities  from  other  places,  without  the  prior  written  permission  of  SEBI.  
This will override the earlier instructions given in this regard. 
 
RTIs shall not handover applications and other documents / records pertaining 
to an Issue to the Issuer or to any other persons for any purpose whatsoever 
until completion of despatch of allotment letters / share / debenture certificates / 
refund orders and cancelled stock invests.  The issuer / persons authorized by 
it may have access to the applications / records in the office of RTI only.

It  has  also  come  to  notice  of  SEBI  that  certain  issuers  are  taking  over  the 
allotment letters  / share debenture certificates, etc., for despatch citing various 
reasons like payment of stamp duty, etc.  It is  clarified that the RTI shall not 
handover  these  to  the  Issuer  and  it  shall  only  make  the  despatches  to  the 
investors  directly.    Any  violation  on  this  account  will  be  viewed  seriously  by 
SEBI. 
 
It  has  been  observed  that  the  correct  date  of  despatch  of  share  /  debenture 
certificates    /  allotment  letters,  to  allottees  who  have  applied  through  stock 
invests is not being mentioned in the 90 days and other reports submitted to 
SEBI / Stock Exchanges.  It is hereby clarified that while furnishing / certifying 
the  reports,  the  RTI  should  furnish  separately  the  actual  date  of  the  above 
despatches.   
 
Under Regulation 15 of the Regulations, RTI / STA are required to maintain the 
records and documents stipulated in regulation 14  for a minimum period of 3 
years.    These  records  /  documents  to  be  maintained  include  the  records 
pertaining to any issue handled by the RTI / Share transfer work carried out by 
the  STA.    Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  the  RTI  /  STA  shall  redress  the 
investors  complaints  for  a  minimum  period  of  3  years,  irrespective  of  the 
termination of the Agreement entered into with the Issuer / Body corporate.  It 
may be pointed out that the complaints are to be redressed within 1 month as 
stipulated  in  rule  4  (e)  of  SEBI  (Registrars  to  an  Issue  and  Share  Transfer 
Agents) Rules, 1993. 
 
It has also come to light that certain RTI / STA hold up their services due to 
delay  /  despatch  in  payments  by  the  Issuer  /  Body  Corporate  causing  great 
inconvenience  to  investors.    It  is  needless  to  mention  that  by  holding  up  the 
work, RTI / STA contribute to the violation of the provisions of the Companies 
Act, listing agreement and the Regulations of SEBI.  It is felt that the RTI / STA 
should negotiate the payment  terms with  Issuer / Body Corporate and arrange 
to procure the funds in advance for meeting the various expenses.  In case of 
any substantial delay / despatch the matter should be immediately brought to 
the notice of SEBI / Stock Exchanges.  In any case, it is desired that services to 
investors should not be affected.  
  
It  has  been  noted  that  RTI  /  STA  do  not  keep  complete  records  of  receipt, 
utilisation, wastage and returns to the Issuer Companies / Body Corporate, of 
the  pre-printed  stationery  like  share  /  debenture  certificates,  refund  orders, 
interest, dividend warrants, etc.   In the interest of the investors and in their own 
interest  RTI  /  STA  should  maintain  proper  records  and  keep  these  securities   
items in control to prevent any misuse. 
 
Authorization of transfer on certificates and the authorization of endorsement of 
a  call  /  allotment  money  is  not  delegated  by  certain  body  corporates  to  the 
share transfer agents thereby resulting in immense delay in sending back the 
certificates  to  the  investors,  as  the  certificates  have  to  move  back  and  forth 
between the body corporate and the STA.  This usually results in not complying 
with the time limit stipulated under section 113 of the companies Act, 1956 and 
listing agreement and the STAs also become responsible for violation.  In view 

 

Page 5 of 23 

of this the STA may insist on the Body Corporates authorising them to carry out 
the authorisation. 
 
The STA are advised that they shall issue acknowledgement to   the investors 
for  having  received  their  requests  for  endorsement,  transfer,  transmission, 
consolidation / sub-division, etc.,  within 7 days of the date of receipt of such  
requests. 
 
The  RTI  /  STA  are  now  required  to  maintain  proper  records  of  mail  returned 
undelivered.    While  attending  to  requests  for  issue  of  transfer,  issue  of 
duplicate  refund  orders,  etc.,    they  may  verify  the  returned  mail  records  to 
prevent any fraudulent activities.
