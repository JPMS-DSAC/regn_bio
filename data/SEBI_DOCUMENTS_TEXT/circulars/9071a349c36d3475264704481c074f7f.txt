Dear Sir,
Sub : List of Companies allowed to be traded under Normal Rolling Settlement Mode
As per our earlier Circular No.D&CC/FITTC/CIR-05/2001 dated December 26, 2001, it was decided that those companies which do not establish electronic connectivity would be put under “trade for trade” settlement mode and would be allowed to be shifted to regular rolling settlement mode only after establishing electronic connectivity with both the Depositories.In this regard, both the Depositories have informed us that 81 more companies have established electronic connectivity with them and as such these companies were admitted into their depository systems. As per the enclosed list of companies, 56 companies beginning from Sr. No.1 to 56 have established connectivity before 31st December, 2002.These companies from Sr. No.1 to 56 are therefore eligible to be traded in normal rolling settlement mode with immediate effect.The remaining companies and the effective eligible dates for trading in the normal rolling settlement mode are as follows :
1)Companies at Sr. No.57 to 66 – eligible to be traded from May 1, 2003.
2)Companies at Sr. No.67 to 70 – eligible to be traded from June 1, 2003.
3)Companies at Sr. No.71 to 81 – eligible to be traded from July 1, 2003.
