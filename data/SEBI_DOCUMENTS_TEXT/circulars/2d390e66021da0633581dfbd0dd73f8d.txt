Dear Sirs,
Re : Clients Codes For Mutual Funds
In terms of SEBI circular SMDRP/Policy/Cir-39/2001 dated July 18, 2001 issued to the stock exchanges, it is mandatory for the stock brokers to use unique codes for their clients w.e.f. August 01, 2001. Accordingly, the mutual funds will be required to furnish codes to the brokers while executing securities transactions. In this connection, you are advised to use the SEBI registration number as your client code to be followed by any number given by you to denote the scheme/plan. The codes so generated may be informed to your stockbrokers and custodians. A list of the codes may be provided to SEBI.  
Yours faithfully,  
P.K. Nagpal Chief General Manager Mutual Funds Department
