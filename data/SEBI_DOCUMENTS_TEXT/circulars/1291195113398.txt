Dear Sir, 
 
                                                  Sub: Annual Systems Audit  
 
Considering  the  importance  of  systems  audit  in  a  highly  technology  driven  securities 
market,  it  has  been  decided  that  exchanges  shall  conduct  audit  of  their  systems  by  a 
reputed  independent  auditor  on  an  annual  basis.  The  systems  audit  should  be 
comprehensive encompassing audit of systems and processes related to examination of 
Trading  Systems,  Clearing  and  Settlement  Systems  (Clearing  Corporation/Clearing 
House),  Risk  Management,  Databases,  Disaster  Recovery  Sites,  Business  Continuity 
Planning, Security, Capacity Management and Information Security Audit. 
 
Accordingly,  you  are  advised  to  get  the  above  systems  audit  conducted  on  an  annual 
basis. You are further advised to place the Systems Audit Report and Compliance Status 
before the Governing Board of the exchange. The systems audit report/findings alongwith 
your  comments  should  be  communicated  to  SEBI.  For  the  year  2008-09,  the  systems 
audit should be completed before December 31, 2008. 
 
This  circular  is  being  issued  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  Section  11(1)  of 
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interest of investors in 
securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.   
 
Yours faithfully,
