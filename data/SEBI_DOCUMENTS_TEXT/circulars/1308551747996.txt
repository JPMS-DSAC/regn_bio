To, 
 
All Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
Sub: Modification  to  Investor  Protection  Fund  (IPF)/  Customer  Protection 

Fund (CPF) Guidelines 

 

 

 
1.  SEBI  vide  circular  no  MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-38/2004  dated  October  28,  2004 
had  issued  comprehensive  guidelines  for  regulation  of  Investor  Protection 
Fund (IPF)/ Customer Protection Fund (CPF) required to be maintained by 
Stock Exchanges. Further vide circular No. MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-21/2006 dated 
December  14,  2006,  SEBI  issued  a  clarification  to  Clause  24  of  the 
Annexure  to  Circular  dated  October  28,  2004,  specifying  that  in  case  of 
defaulting  brokers  with  multiple  memberships,  the  residual  amount  after 
satisfying  claims  of  SEBI,  the  concerned  stock  exchange,  and  all  other 
exchanges, would be credited to the IPF/CPF of the concerned exchange. 
The  Circular  dated  October  28,  2004  as  clarified  by  Circular  dated 
December 14, 2006 shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Comprehensive 
Guidelines  on  IPF/CPF  of  Stock  Exchanges”  or  “The  Comprehensive 
Guidelines”. 

 
2.  Exemptions have been sought by Stock Exchanges from strict compliance 
with Clause 24 of the Annexure to Circular dated October 28, 2004 on the 
ground  that  the  residual  amount  remaining  after  satisfaction  of  claims 
against  the  defaulting  broker  should  be  refunded  to  the  broker  and  not 
credited to the IPF/CPF. SEBI has decided to modify certain clauses of the 
abovementioned Annexure, with a view to harmonise the practices followed 
by various exchanges to meet investor claims. 

 
3.  Thus it has been decided to modify the Comprehensive Guidelines -  
 

a)  Clause 8 shall be substituted with the following – 

8.”The specified period for inviting legitimate claims against a defaulter 
member, shall be a minimum of ninety days.”

b)  Clause 13 shall be substituted with the following –  
 

13.”If any eligible claims arise within three years from the date of expiry 
of  the  specified  period  such  claims  shall  be  borne  by  the  stock 
exchanges without any recourse to the IPF/CPF. 

Provided  that  any  claims  received  after  three  years  from  the  date  of 
expiry of the specified period may be dealt with as a civil dispute. 
 
Provided further that in cases where any litigations are pending against 
the defaulter member, the residual amount, if any, may be retained by 
the stock exchange until such litigations are concluded.” 
 

Disbursement of Claims from the IPF/ CPF 
 
c)  Clause 22 shall be deleted. 
 
d)  Clause 23 shall be substituted with the following - 

23. “The compensation shall be disbursed to the investor from the IPF/ 
CPF  incase  there  is  a  shortage  of  defaulter  broker’s  assets  after  its 
realization.” 

 
e)  Clause  24,  as  it  reads  after  incorporation  of  clarification  vide  Circular 

dated December 14, 2006, shall be substituted with the following –  

 

24.”The Stock Exchange shall ensure that the amount realized from the 
assets of the defaulter member is returned to the defaulter member after 
satisfying  the  claims  of  the  Stock  Exchange  and  SEBI  in  accordance 
with the bye-laws of the Stock Exchange. 

Provided  that  in  case  of  a  member  broker  having  membership  on 
multiple  stock  exchanges,  amount  realized  from  the  assets  of  the 
defaulter  member  shall  be  returned  to  the  said  member  only  after 
satisfying  eligible  claims  of  the  concerned  stock  exchange,  SEBI,  and 
other stock exchanges.”
