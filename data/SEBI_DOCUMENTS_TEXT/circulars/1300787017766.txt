The Presidents/ Executive Directors and 
Managing Directors of all the Stock Exchanges 

Sir, 

Statement on utilisation of funds - Clause 43 of the Listing Agreement.

In terms of our circular nos. SMD/SED/N/JJ/4984/94 dated September 23, 1994 and 
SMD/Policy/Cir-12 dated April 07, 1998 it was provided by Clause 43 of the listing agreement 
that the companies which mobilise funds from the public through public/rights issues would 
provide to the Stock Exchanges and publish a statement showing the variations between the 
projected utilisation of the fund and/or projected profitability statement made by it in its 
prospectus or letter of offer and the actual utilisation of funds and/or actual profitability on an 
half yearly basis.

In order to enhance the continual disclosure standards it has now been decided that the 
statements required to be provided vide Clause 43 would now be on a quarterly basis. It 
should be published along with the un-audited/audited financial results as required under 
Clause 41. 

Accordingly, you are advised to amend the listing agreement of the exchange immediately and 
intimate the same to SEBI. 
  

Yours faithfully,
