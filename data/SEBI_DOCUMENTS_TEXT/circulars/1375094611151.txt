3.4 Prudential requirements 

All Category III AIFs  which undertake leverage, whether through investment in 
derivatives  or  by  borrowing  or  by  any  other  means  shall  comply  with  the 
following prudential requirements: 

i.  For the purpose of arriving at leverage undertaken by an AIF, leverage shall 
be calculated as the ratio of the exposure to the Net Asset Value of the AIF. 

ii.  Leverage shall be calculated as under: 

 Leverage =Total exposure {Longs+Shorts (after offsetting as permitted)} 

     

 

 

 

Net Asset Value (NAV) 

iii.  The  leverage of a Category III AIF shall not exceed 2 times of the  NAV of 
the fund. i.e. If an AIF’s NAV is Rs. 100 crore, its exposure (Longs+shorts) 
after offsetting positions as permitted shall not exceed Rs. 200 crore. 

Calculation of exposure and NAV 

i.  The total exposure of the fund for the purpose of computing leverage shall 
generally be the sum of the market value of all the securities/ contracts held 
by  the  fund.  The  total  exposure  at  any  point  of  time  will  be  a  sum  of 
exposure  through  instruments  in  both  the  spot  market  and  the  derivative 
market. 

ii.  Exposure shall generally be calculated as below: 

1.  Futures (long and short)= Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts   
2.  Options bought= Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts 
3.  Options  sold=  Market  price  of  underlying  *  Lot  size  *  Number  of 

contracts  

4.  In case of any other derivative exposure, the exposure is proposed to be 

calculated as the notional market value of the contract 

iii.  Idle  cash  and  cash  equivalents  shall  not  be  included  in  the  calculation  of 
total  exposure.  Long  put  positions  shall  be  considered  as  short  exposure 
and short put positions shall be considered as long exposure. Short selling 
of  a  stock  through  SLBM  shall  be  treated  as  short  exposure.  Temporary 
borrowing  arrangements  which  relate  to  and  are  fully  covered  by  capital 
commitments from investors need not be included in calculation of leverage.  

iv.  Offsetting  of  positions  shall  be  allowed  for  calculation  of  leverage  for 
transactions entered into for  hedging and portfolio rebalancing  as provided 
in the circular No. MFD/CIR/21/ 25467/2002 dated December 31, 2002 and 
to the extent as specified in the circular.  

v.  Sum  of  all  exposures  without  offsetting  transactions  for  hedging  and 
portfolio  rebalancing  shall  be  termed  as  'gross  exposure'  and  the  ratio  of 
such  gross  exposure  and  Net  Asset  Value  shall  be  termed  as  'gross 
leverage'.  

vi.  Net Asset Value (NAV) of the AIF shall be the sum of value of all securities 
adjusted  for  Mark  to  market  gains/losses  (including  cash  and  cash 
equivalents). The NAV shall exclude any funds borrowed by the AIF.  

vii.  All the above restrictions/limits shall apply at the scheme-level. 

Breach of leverage limits 

i.  All Category III AIFs shall have adequate systems in place to monitor their 
exposures.  It  shall  be  responsibility  of  the  AIFs  to  shall  ensure  that  the 
leverage shall not exceed the prescribed limit at all times. 

ii.  All  Category  III  AIFs  shall  report  to  the  custodian  on  a  daily  basis  the 
amount  of  leverage  at  the  end  of  the  day  (based  on  closing  prices)  and 
whether there has been any breach of limit during the day.  

iii.  In case of a breach in limit:

ii.  The  AIF  shall  send a report  to all  its  clients  before  10  a.m.  on  the 
next working day stating that there is a breach in the limit along with 
reasons for the same.   

iii.  The  AIF  shall  square  off  the  excess  exposure  and  bring  back  the 
leverage within the prescribed limit by end of next working day. This 
shall however not prejudice any action that may be taken by SEBI 
against
