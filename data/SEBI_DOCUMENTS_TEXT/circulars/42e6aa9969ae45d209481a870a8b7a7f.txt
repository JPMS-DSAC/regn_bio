DIVISION CHIEF SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT
SMD (N)/JJ/8890/95 23 January, 1995
To,
The President/Executive Director of all the Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir,
Turnover to reported single side
This has reference to our letter no. SMD (N)/JJ/4311/94 dated July 20, 1994 regarding submission of report of turnover and delivery figures of your stock exchange.
We find that some exchanges are reporting the turnover figures on the basis of sales and purchases and some are reporting only one side. Henceforth, turnover figures may be reported to SEBI by counting one side of the transaction i.e., only sales on only purchases. This will ensure uniformity of reporting.
Yours faithfully, sd/- Â 
R.V. NABAR
