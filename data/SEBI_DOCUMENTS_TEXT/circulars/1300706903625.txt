Dear Sir, 

Sub: Vanishing Companies.

PMD/AK/VC/19771 /2000 
December 13, 2000

Please refer to our earlier letter PMD/VC/DT/152/00 dated 5th January 2000 requesting to 
forward information on vanishing companies. 

SEBI has been receiving complaints from Investors' Associations and investors about certain 
companies suspected by them to have vanished. Upon perusal of the complaints it was observed 
that basic information required for considering whether such company/s apparently fall within 
the category of vanishing companies, is not contained in the complaints. 

In this connection, it may be noted that the following criteria are adopted to classify a company 
as a vanished company. 

 Companies which have not complied with listing requirements/ filing requirements 

of Stock Exchange/ROC respectively for a period of 2 years

 No correspondence has been received by the exchange from the company for a long 

time.

 No office of the company is located at the mentioned registered office address at the 

time of Stock Exchange inspection.

It may also be noted that non trading of the shares of the company on the stock exchanges may 
not be considered as a reason for suspecting a company as a vanishing company as trading is a 
market phenomenon. 

We have also come across complaints alleging that the companies have vanished on the reason 
that the correspondences made to them have returned undelivered . In this regard,the investors 
may ensure that their correspondences are made to the current address/ changed address of the 
company after obtaining the same from the respective ROCs and Stock Exchanges. 

SEBI has a separate section operating under the Primary Market Department, which handles the 
complaints about vanishing companies and further action against the companies and their 
Directors. 

With a view to effectively deal with the complaints regarding vanishing companies and to 
further initiate actions expeditiously against them, if so called for, it will be necessary to have 
the basic information about the vanishing companies then nature of defaults, details of 
grievances, etc. A format for this purpose has been devised and is enclosed. 

The Investor Associations/ Investors are advised to submit their complaints about the 
companies prima facie falling under the category of vanishing companies in the prescribed 
format to Vanishing Companies Section of Primary Market Department of SEBI at Head 
Offices or the respective Regional Offices of SEBI. The addresses of Head Office and Regional 
Offices and their jurdisction are given in Annexure I. 

The format is also made available on the SEBI web site www.sebi.gov.in. 

However it may be noted that the general investors’ complaints other than complaints about 
vanishing companies such as non receipt of refund, non receipt of dividend, non receipt of 

share certificates, bonds & debentures and for non receipt of miscellaneous reports, shall 
continue to be made to SEBI Investors Grievance and Guidance Division at Head Office or 
respective Regional Office as given in Annexure II.
