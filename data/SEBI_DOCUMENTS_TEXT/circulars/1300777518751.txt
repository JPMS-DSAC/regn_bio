Dear Sir,

Modified Carry Forward System (MCFS)

Based on the recommendations of the Risk Management Group constituted by SEBI the 
following decisions have been taken : 

Incremental Carry Forward Margin (ICFM)

The Incremental Carry Forward Margin as prescribed by SEBI vide its Circular 19 dated July 2, 
1999 will now be charged as a combination of slabs based on percentage (of total number of 
shares paid up) and absolute outstanding market-wide carry forward position in a scrip. 

Accordingly, in case the carry forward gross position in any exchange, in any scrip, exceeds the 
parameters mentioned below, the ICFM shall be levied, in addition to the carry forward margin, 
at a rate which is higher of the rates determined as per the tables below : 
  

Gross Outstanding 
Market Position (Rs. In 
crores) 

Rate of 
Margin

  Carry Forward Gross 
Position (in number of 
shares as % of total number 
of shares paid-up)

  Exceeding 3% going upto 4% 5%

  Exceeding 4% going upto 5% 8%

Once this margin is imposed by any Exchange having ALBM or MCFS facility, the other 
Exchanges having ALBM or MCFS will also follow the same from the start of next settlement. 

Mark to Market Margin (MTM)

Mark to Market Margin shall be collected separately from daily/exposure margin as the purpose 
of these margins is different. 

Collection of Margins

The Carry Forward Margin in respect of positions carried forward would be paid 100% in cash 
or fixed deposits or government securities, or a combination of three. 

The Stock Exchanges are advised to implement these decisions immediately. 
  

Yours faithfully,
