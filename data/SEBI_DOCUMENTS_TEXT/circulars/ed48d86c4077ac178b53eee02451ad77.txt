Dear Sirs,
MONTHLY CUMULATIVE REPORT (MCR)
Please refer to our circular letter dated February 12, 1999 advising you to provide us data pertaining to funds mobilised, repurchases/redemptions, net inflow/outflow and cumulative position of net assets. We have revised the format so that some meaningful inferences about the trends in mutual funds industry may be drawn. According to revised format enclosed herewith, the information is required to be given on the basis of type of schemes - income/debt, growth/equity and balanced scheme. As you collect data on each scheme at the end of the month, the compiling of report in the revised format would not take any additional time. You are advised to send the monthly cumulative report (MCR) in the revised format from August onwards by fax (fax no. 022 - 2870966) or e-mail it at reginap@sebi.gov.in by the 3rd of each month. The hard copies should also be sent by hand delivery/courier. The report should be compiled for each financial year on a cumulative basis; the first report will be for the period April - July 2000.
The monthly detailed statistical reports (MSTATs) as advised in our letter of May 7, 1997 may be sent only by soft copies/e-mail. Hard copies of the reports need not be sent.
In case of any clarification, you may contact us.
Yours faithfully,
P. K. NAGPAL DIVISION CHIEF MUTUAL FUNDS DEPARTMENT
