address  the  risks  involved  in  the  cash  and  derivatives  market.  With  a  view  to 
keeping up pace with the changing market dynamics and to bring more efficiency 
in  the  risk  management  framework,  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  margin 
framework  was  done  in  consultation  with  the  Risk  Management  Review 
Committee (RMRC) of SEBI. Based on the review, it has been decided to effect 
the following changes to the existing risk management framework.

Based on 6σ, subject to minimum of 21.5% 
50%  if  traded  atleast  once  per  week  on  any  stock 
exchange; 75% otherwise

estimation  changes  in  the  Exponential  Weighted  Moving  Average  (EWMA) 
method, shall be fixed at 0.995. 
 
The value of λ shall, accordingly, also get changed for volatility calculation in 
the cash market.

more than 9 months, the price scan range shall be based 
on  6σ,  scaled  up  by  √2  subject  to  at  least  17.7%  of  the 
underlying price after considering scaling up.
