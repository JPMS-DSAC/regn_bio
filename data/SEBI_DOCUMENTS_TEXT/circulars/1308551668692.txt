To, 
 
All Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:  Change of Name by Listed Companies 
 

1.  Please  refer  to  SEBI  Circulars  No.  SMDRP/Policy/Cir-8/99  dated  April  26, 
1999  and  No.  SEBI/MRD/Policy/AT/Cir-20/2004  dated  April  30,  2004  on  the 
captioned subject matter. 
 

2.  The  aforementioned  SEBI  circular  dated  April  30,  2004  required  all  listed 
companies  seeking  change  of  name  to  comply  inter  alia  with  the  following 
provision:  
 

2.2.  At least 50% of its total revenue in the preceding 1 year period 
should have been accounted for by the new activity suggested by 
the new name.     

 

3.  It  is  observed  from  the  representations  received  from  few  companies  and 
feedback received from the Stock Exchanges that the companies, where the 
gestation  period  of  the  business  is  usually  longer  and  the  revenue  stream 
often delayed, find it difficult to comply with the aforesaid provision.  
 

4.  In view of the above, it is decided to modify the para 2.2 of the aforementioned 

circular as under: 
 

2.2.  At least 50% of its total revenue in the preceding 1 year period 
should have been accounted for by the new activity suggested by 
the new name  
    
Or 
 
The amount invested in the new activity/project (Fixed Assets + 
Advances  +  Works  In  Progress)  is  atleast  50%  of  the  assets  of 
the company. The ‘Advances’ shall include only those extended 
to contractors and suppliers towards execution of project, specific 
to new activity as reflected in the new name.
