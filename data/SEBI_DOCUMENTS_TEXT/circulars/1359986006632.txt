CIRCULAR 

 

 

Date: February 4, 2013 

 

 

 

 
 
CIR/CFD/DIL/5/2013  
 
To 
The Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sir/Madam 
 
 
Sub:  Scheme of Arrangement under the Companies Act, 1956 – Revised 
 
 

requirements for the Stock Exchanges and Listed Companies 

 
Vide  Circular  No.  SEBI/CFD/SCRR/01/2009/03/09,  dated  September  03,  2009 
(“Circular”) certain requirements were prescribed for seeking exemption under sub-
rule  (7)  of  rule  19  of  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957  (“SCRR, 
1957”)  from  strict  enforcement  of  clause  (b)  to  sub-rule  (2)  of  rule  19  by  listed 
companies.  
 
The existing Clause 24(f) of the Listing Agreement mandates that a listed company 
shall  file  any  scheme/petition,  proposed  to  be  filed  before  any  Court  or  Tribunal 
under  sections  391,  394  and  101  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956,  with  the  stock 
exchange,  for  approval,  at  least  a  month  before  it  is  presented  to  the  Court  or 
Tribunal.  
 
In terms of the above mentioned Circular, pursuant to a scheme of reconstruction or 
amalgamation being sanctioned by the Hon’ble High Court under sections 391-394 
or  101  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956  (“Scheme”),  the  listed  companies  desirous  of 
getting  their  equity  shares  listed  after  merger/de-merger/amalgamation  etc.  were 
required  to  seek  an  exemption  from  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
(“SEBI”)  from  the  requirements  of  Rule  19(2)(b)  of  SCRR,  1957.  In  terms  of  Rule 
19(7) of SCRR, 1957, SEBI has been granting exemption to such listed companies 
from time to time, on a case to case basis.   
 
However,  in  the  recent  past,  SEBI  has  received  applications,  seeking  exemption, 
from certain entities containing, inter alia, (a) inadequate disclosures, (b) convoluted 
schemes  of  arrangement,  (c)  exaggerated  valuations,  etc.  SEBI  is  of  the  view  that 
granting  listing  permission  or  exemption  from  the  requirements  of  Rule  19(2)(b)  of 
SCRR,  1957  based  on  such  applications  may  not  be  in  the  interest  of  minority 
shareholders.  At  the  same  time,  if  listing  permission  or  such  an  exemption  is 
delayed or  denied, it  would  add to the  uncertainty  and  would  deprive  shareholders 
of an exit opportunity.  
 
In  order  to  avoid  such  situations,  the  existing  requirements  are  being  revised.  The 
salient features of the revised requirements, include the following:
