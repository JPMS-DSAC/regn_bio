CIRCULAR 

                        

         September 28, 2011 

 

 

Cir. /IMD/DF/17/2011 
 
 
All Registered Merchant Bankers 
All Recognized Stock Exchanges 
All Registered Credit Rating Agencies 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 

Sub: Guidelines for Issue and Listing of Structured Products/ Market Linked 

Debentures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  SEBI had prescribed initial and continuous disclosure norms applicable to issue 
and listing of debt securities through the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008  and  the  Simplified 
Listing Agreement for Debt Securities.  

2.  It has been observed that a variety of hybrid securities that combine features of 
plain  vanilla  debt  securities  and  exchange  traded  derivatives  are  being  issued 
through private placements and listed on stock exchanges. It is seen that such 
securities  differ  from  plain  vanilla  debt  securities  or  debt  securities  issued  with 
embedded  call  or  put  options,  i.e.,  by  offering  market  linked  returns  obtained 
through exposures on exchange traded derivatives. Since such returns are linked 
to  equity  markets,  such  securities  are  also  called  equity  linked  debentures  or 
stock linked debentures etc. 

3.  In view of the fact that such securities are different in their nature and their risk-
return  relationship,  it  has  been  decided  to  specify  additional  disclosures  and 
other  requirements  in  offer  documents  for  issue  of  structured  products/  market 
linked debentures that seek listing on stock exchanges. 

4.  The following conditions shall be complied with in respect of listing of structured 

debt/ equity linked debentures:   

a.  Applicability: These guidelines shall be applicable to ‘structured products’ 
or ‘market linked debentures’, by whatever name they are called including 
all such securities that have an underlying principal component in the form 
of  debt  securities  as  defined  under  R.2(d)  of  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of 
Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008  and  where  the  returns  are  linked  to 
market returns on other underlying securities/ indices.

b.  Securities which do not promise to return the principal amount in full at the 
end of the tenor of the instrument, i.e., ‘principal non-protected’ shall not 
be considered as debt securities under R.2(d) of SEBI (Issue and Listing 
of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 and therefore will not be eligible for 
issue and listing under the said regulations.  

 
c.  Eligibility  criteria  for  issuers:  As  such  securities  expose  the  issuer  to 
market  risk,  the  issuer  should  have  a  minimum  net  worth  of  at  least 
`100cr.  

d.  Minimum  Ticket  Size:  While  the  issuers  are  free  to  determine  the  face 
value for such securities, no invitations for subscription or allotments shall 
be made for an amount less than Rs.10lakh in any issue. 

 

e.  Disclosure  Requirements:  In  addition  to  the  disclosure  requirement 
specified under Schedule I of Debt Regulations read with Regulation 21(1) 
of  the  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  the 
following  additional  disclosures  shall  be  made  in  all  offer  documents  for 
such securities: 

i.  Credit  rating  by  any  registered  Credit  Rating  Agency  shall  bear  a 
prefix 
‘PP-MLD’  denoting  Principal  Protected  Market  Linked 
Debentures  followed  by  the  standardized  rating  symbols  for  long/ 
short  term  debt  on  the  lines  specified  in  SEBI  Circular  No. 
CIR/MIRSD/4/2011 dated June 15, 2011.  

ii.  A detailed scenario analysis/ valuation matrix showing value of the 
security under different market conditions such as rising, stable and 
falling market conditions shall be disclosed in a table along with a 
suitable graphic representation. 

iii.  A risk factor shall be prominently displayed that such securities are 
subject to model risk, i.e., the securities are created on the basis of 
complex  mathematical  models 
involving  multiple  derivative 
exposures  which  may  or  may  not  be  hedged  and  the  actual 
behavior  of  the  securities  selected  for  hedging  may  significantly 
differ from the returns predicted by the mathematical models.  

iv.  A risk factor shall be prominently displayed stating that in case of 
Principal/  Capital  Protected  Market  Linked  Debentures, 
the 
principal amount is subject to the credit risk of the issuer whereby 
the investor may or may not recover all or part of the funds in case 
of default by the issuer.
