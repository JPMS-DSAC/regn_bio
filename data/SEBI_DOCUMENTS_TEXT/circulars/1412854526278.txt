Sir / Madam, 

Sub: Clarification on Government Debt Investment Limits 

1.  SEBI had issued a circular CIR/IMD/FIIC/ 17/2014 dated July 23, 2014 whereby the investment 
limit  in  government  securities  available  to  all  FPIs  was  enhanced  by  USD  5  billion  by 
correspondingly reducing the amount available to long term FPIs from USD 10 billion to USD 5 
billion within the overall limit of USD 30 billion. It was also stated in the aforesaid circular that 
all  future  investments  in  this  USD  25  billion  debt  limit  shall  be  required  to  be  made  in 
government bonds with a minimum residual maturity of three years. 
 

2.  It  is  clarified  that  all  investments  by  Long  Term  FPIs  (Sovereign  Wealth  Funds  (SWFs), 
Multilateral Agencies, Endowment Funds, Insurance Funds, Pension Funds and Foreign 
Central  Banks)  in  the  USD  5  billion  Government  debt  limit  shall  continue  to  be  made  in 
Government bonds  having a minimum residual maturity of 1 year.

4.  In accordance with SEBI circular CIR/IMD/FIIC/15/2013 dated September 13, 2013, FPIs shall 
be permitted to invest in the USD 25 billion Government debt limit till  the  overall investment  
reaches  90%  after  which  the  auction  mechanism  would  be  initiated  for allocation  of  the  
remaining  limits.  

5.  In  the  event  the  overall  FPI  investment  exceeds  90%  in  either  of  the  debt  limit categories  (as 
indicated  by  the debt  utilisation status  updated  daily  on  the  websites  of  NSDL  and  CDSL),  the 
following procedure shall be followed: 
 

a.  The depositories (NSDL and CDSL) shall direct the DDPs to halt all FPI purchases in debt 

securities in that category  
 

b.  The  depositories  shall  then  inform  NSE  (since  the  last  auction  was  held  on  BSE) 
regarding the unutilised debt limits for conduct of auction. Upon receipt of information 
from the depositories, NSE shall conduct an auction for the allocation of unutilised debt 
limits on the second working day  

 

 

 

c.  The auction would be held only if the free limit is greater than or equal to INR 100 cr. 

The auction shall be conducted in the following manner :

d. 

 Once the limits have been auctioned, the FPIs will have an utilisation period of 15 days 
within  which  they  have  to  make  the  investments.  The  limits  not  utilised  within  this 
period would come back to the pool of free limits.   

e.  Upon  sale/redemption  of  debt  securities,  the  FPI  will  have  a  re-investment  period  5 
days. If the reinvestment is not made within 5 working days, then the limits shall come 
back to the pool of free limits. 
 

f.  The subsequent auction would be held 20 days after the previous auction, subject to the 
fulfilment of the condition mentioned at Point (C) above. The auction mechanism shall 
be discontinued and the limits shall be once again available for investment on tap when 
the debt limit utilisation falls below 85%. 

  

g. 

In order to provide operational flexibility to FPIs, it is clarified that there would be no 
other re-investment restrictions 

 

 

This  circular  shall  come  into  effect  immediately.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers 
conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. 

A  copy  of  this  circular  is  available  at  the  web  page  “Circulars”  on  our  website  www.sebi.gov.in. 
Custodians are requested to bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their FPI clients.
