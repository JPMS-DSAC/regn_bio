Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub.: Contents of Application-Cum-Bidding Form and Manner of disclosure  
 
1.  SEBI  has  reviewed  the  structure,  design,  format,  contents  and  order  of 
information of Application-Cum-Bidding-Form to make it investor friendly and 
also to ensure uniformity in bidding and accuracy.  

 
2.  The  form  has  been  standardized  and  it  has  been  decided  that  henceforth 
there would only be a single form for ASBA and Non-ASBA applicants. It has 
also been decided that the Application-Cum-Bidding Form (accompanied with 
abridged prospectus) would be printed in a booklet form of A4 size paper.  

 
3.  In order to ensure uniformity and to facilitate easier identification, it has been 
decided  to  standardize  the  colour  of  the  Application-Cum-Bidding  Form  as 
under: 

•  White  form  for  Resident  Indian,  Eligible  NRIs  applying  on  a  non 

repatriation basis  

•  Blue form for Eligible NRIs, FVCIs, FIIs, their Sub-Accounts (other than 
Sub-Accounts  which  are  foreign  corporates  or  foreign  individuals
