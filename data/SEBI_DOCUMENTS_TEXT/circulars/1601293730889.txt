1.  Clause 2.6 of the Guidelines is modified as under: 

 
“The REIT shall not make any subsequent institutional placement until the expiry 
of two weeks from the date of the prior institutional placement made pursuant to 
one or more special resolutions.” 
 

2.  After clause 2.1 and before clause 2.2 of sub-paragraph (A) of paragraph 2 of 

Annexure 

Annexure-I, the following provisos shall be inserted: 
 
“Provided that, for any preferential issue made between the date of this circular 
and December 31, 2020, the REIT may opt for a pricing method where the price 
of the units to be allotted pursuant to the preferential issue shall not be less than 
the higher of the following: 
 
(a) the average of the weekly high and low of the volume weighted average price 
of  the  related  units  quoted  on  the  recognised  stock  exchange  during  the 
twelve weeks preceding the relevant date; or 
 

(b) the  average  of  the  weekly  high  and  low  of  the  volume  weighted  average 
prices of the related units quoted on a recognised stock exchange during the 
two weeks preceding the relevant date. 

 

Provided  further  that,  units  allotted  on  a  preferential  basis  using  the  pricing 
method set out in the first proviso shall be locked-in for a period of three years: 
 
Provided further that, all allotments arising out of the same unitholders approval 
shall follow the same pricing method.” 
 

3.  After clause 3.1 of paragraph 3 of Annexure-I, the following explanation shall be 

inserted: 
 
Explanation: For the computation of the lock-in requirement, the units held by the 
sponsor(s) and locked-in for three years, in the past in terms of Regulation 11 (3) 
of the REIT Regulations shall be taken into account. The units locked-in pursuant 
to Regulation 11(3) of the REIT Regulations shall not be put under fresh lock-in 
again, even though they are considered for computing the lock-in requirement, 
in case the said units are free of lock-in at the time of the preferential issue.
