All Recognized Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations and Depositories 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam 
 
Reporting  for  Artificial 
Intelligence  (AI)  and  Machine  Learning  (ML) 
applications  and  systems  offered  and  used  by  Market  Infrastructure 
Institutions (MIIs) 
 

 

Background 

1.  SEBI is conducting a survey and creating an inventory of the AI / ML landscape 
in the Indian financial markets to gain an in-depth understanding of the adoption 
of such technologies in the markets and to ensure preparedness for any AI / 
ML policies that may arise in the future. 

 

Scope definition 

2.  Any set of applications / software / programs / executable / systems (computer 
systems)  –  cumulatively  called  application  and  systems,  to  carry  out 
compliance  operations  /  activities,  where  AI  /  ML  is  used  for  compliance  or 
management  purposes,  is  included  in  the  scope  of  this  circular.  In  order  to 
make the scope of this circular inclusive of various AI and ML technologies in 
use, the scope also covers Fin-Tech and Reg-Tech initiatives undertaken by 
MIIs that involves AI and ML. 

3.  Technologies that are considered to be categorized as AI and ML technologies 

in the scope of this circular, are explained in Annexure A. 

 
Regulatory requirements 

4.  All MIIs shall fill in the AI / ML reporting form (Annexure B) in respect of the AI 
or ML based applications or systems as defined in Annexure A offered or used 
by them, and submit the same in soft copy only at AI_MII_SE@sebi.gov.in (for

basis within 15 days of the expiry of the quarter, with effect from quarter ending 
March 31, 2019. 

(for  Depositories) 

5.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  the powers  conferred  under  Section  
11(1)  of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act  1992,  read  with

Annexure A – Systems deemed to be based on AI and ML technology 
 
Applications  and  Systems  belonging  but  not  limited  to  following  categories  or  a 
combination of these:  
 

1.  Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis or text mining systems that gather 
intelligence from unstructured data. – In this case, Voice to text, text to intelligence systems 
in any natural language will be considered in scope.  Eg: robo chat bots, big data intelligence 
gathering systems. 

2.  Neural Networks or a modified form of it. – In this case, any systems that uses a number of 
nodes  (physical  or  software  simulated  nodes)  mimicking  natural  neural  networks  of  any 
scale, so  as to carry out learning from previous  firing of the nodes  will be considered in 
scope. Eg: Recurrent Neural networks and Deep learning Neural Networks 

3.  Machine learning through supervised, unsupervised learning or a combination of both. – In 
this case, any application or systems that carry out knowledge representation to form  a 
knowledge base of domain, by learning and creating its outputs with real world input data 
and deciding future outputs based upon the knowledge base. Eg: System based on Decision 
tree, random forest,  K mean, Markov decision process, Gradient boosting Algorithms. 

4.  A  system  that  uses  statistical  heuristics  method  instead  of  procedural  algorithms  or  the 
system  /  application  applies  clustering  or  categorization  algorithms  to  categorize  data 
without a predefined set of categories 

5.  A  system  that  uses  a  feedback  mechanism  to  improve  its  parameters  and  bases  it 

subsequent execution steps on these parameters. 

6.  A system that does knowledge representation and maintains a knowledge base.
