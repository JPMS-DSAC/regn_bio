Dear Sirs,  
Sub: Amendments to the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000  The Board, in its meeting held on March 15, 2001, considered and approved certain modifications in the SEBI (DIP) guidelines in order to introduce the facility of issue of debt securities without issue of equity, for companies desirous of coming out with a public issue.
Accordingly, the amendments that have been made in the Guidelines are enclosed.
Further, the existing clause 8.2.2.1 stands deleted as the same appears as clause 8.21.2 of the guidelines.
These amendments shall come into force from the date of the circular.    
Yours faithfully,
