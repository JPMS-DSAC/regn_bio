Custodians and AMFI/RAIN 

Dear Sirs, 

Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities.

Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-23/2000 dated May 29, 2000 
advising inter-alia the list of 300 scrips (serial numbers 1 to 300 of annexure "A" to the 
circular) for compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form for all investors with effect 
from July 24, 2000. 

Some of the companies, whose scrips were included in the list of securities for compulsory 
trading in dematerialised form for all investors, could not sign agreements and establish 
connectivity with either or both the depositories well on time or are in the process of doing so. 
It has been decided that the effective date for compulsory trading by all investors in 
dematerialised form for these scrips (39 scrips as per annexure A) therefore stands postponed 
and the revised date would be announced later. 

ANNEXURE A

Yours faithfully,
