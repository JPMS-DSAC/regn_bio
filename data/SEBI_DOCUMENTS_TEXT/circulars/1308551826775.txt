investors,  and  (ii)  to  achieve  high  standards  of  integrity  and  fairness  in 
ratings.

Securitisation  Advisory  Committee  of  SEBI.  The  Committee  recommended 
that the rating symbols and their definitions should be standardised.

devised for the following:   

 

 

 

a)  Long term debt instruments;  
b)  Short term debt instruments;  
c)  Long term structured finance instruments;  
d)  Short term structured finance instruments;  
e)  Long term mutual fund schemes; and 
f)  Short term mutual fund schemes. 

 
5.  The new symbols and definitions as given in Annexures 1-6 shall henceforth 

be used for the new ratings/ reviews by the CRAs.

(iii)  inform  their  clients  about  the  change  in  the  rating  symbols  and 
definitions  and  specifying  that  this  should  not  be  construed  as  a 
change in the ratings.
