III. 

In  order  to  implement  the  Union  budget  proposal  on  creation  of  a  unified 
platform for trading of Corporate Bonds, it has been decided to establish, in the 
first  phase,  a  system  to  capture  all  information  related  to  trading  in  corporate 
bonds  as  accurately  and  as  close  to  execution  as  possible  through  an 
authorized  reporting  platform.  In  the  second  phase  of  development,  it  is 
proposed  to  permit  recognized  stock  exchanges  having  nationwide  access  to 
set up a corporate bond trading platform to enable efficient price discovery and 
reliable clearing and settlement in a gradual manner.  

It has been decided that Bombay Stock Exchange Limited would be setting up 
and  maintaining  a  corporate  bond  reporting  platform  as  envisaged  in  the  first 
phase.  For  the  purpose,  the  following  shall  be  implemented  with  effect  from 
January 1, 2007: 
 
1.  The  term  ‘Corporate  Bonds’  for  this  purpose  shall  include  all  listed  debt 
securities issued by institutions such as Banks, Public Sector Undertakings, 
Municipal Corporations, bodies corporate and companies. 

 
2.  All issuers, intermediaries and contracting parties shall be granted access 
to  the  corporate  bond  reporting  platform  for  reporting  of  trades.  Where 
transactions are executed through the intermediary, reporting responsibility 
shall lie with the intermediary. If executed otherwise, reporting will be made 
either  through  an  authorized  intermediary  or  directly  by  the  contracting 
parties.  

 

 

 

 

 

3.  All transactions in corporate bonds of the value of Rs.1,00,000 or above are 
required  to  be  reported  to  the  corporate  bond  platform.  The  transactions 
shall be reported within 30 minutes of closing the deal. The information on 
settlement shall be reported by the parties involved in the transaction within 
1 trading day from completion of the settlement.  

4.  The  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  Limited  (BSE)  shall  ensure  that  the 
Corporate Bond Reporting platform for the purpose shall be available from 
10.00 am to 5.30 pm on all trading days.  

5.  The access to the platform for the purpose of reporting will be given to all 
market intermediaries who approach BSE for the purpose. The connectivity 
to  the  non-members  of  the  Exchange  would  be  enabled  through  Virtual 
Private Network (VPN).  

6.  The BSE shall populate the data reported on their platform on their website 

on a real time basis for information of investors/public.  

7.  Since  the  platform  is  purely  for  reporting  purposes,  the  stock  exchange 
shall  have  no  role  or  liability  for  settlement  of  these  trades.  The 
intermediaries/ contracting parties shall settle the trades bilaterally. 

 
8. 

Issuers  are  required  to  disclose/  update  regularly  all  material  information 
such as rating obtained on the instruments and the rating migrations as and 
when they take place, record date, reasons for record date, put/call option 
dates, units exercised under put/call option etc, failing which action may be 
initiated against the issuer and/or its directors/promoters. 

 
IV.  Applicability  
 

1.  The reporting shall be made for all trades in listed debt securities issued by 
all  institutions  such  as  Banks,  Public  Sector  Undertakings,  Municipal 
Corporations, bodies corporate and companies.  

 
2.  The reporting of trades in Corporate Bonds shall be made by all person(s) 
dealing  in  such  corporate  bonds  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  SEBI 
registered intermediaries or otherwise. 

 

V.  Direction to Stock Exchanges  

 
All Stock Exchanges are directed to: 

 

a.  Make necessary amendments to the listing agreement, bye- laws, rules and 
regulations  for  the  implementation  of  the  above  decision  immediately,  as 
may be applicable and necessary.
