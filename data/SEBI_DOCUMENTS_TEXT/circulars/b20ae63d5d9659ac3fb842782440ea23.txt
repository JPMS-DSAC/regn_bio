Your attention is invited to the last paragraph of the circular No SEBI /CFD /DIL /DIP /12 /2004 /8 /4 dated April 8, 2004, which states as under :
 
SEBI is in the process of issuing digitally signed circulars to the intermediaries. In this regard, all registered merchant bankers are advised to communicate the e-mail ids to the Division of Issues and Listing (email to ushar@sebi.gov.in) so that their email ids can be registered on the server for establishing relevant mailing list. Thereafter, you may check your email accounts periodically as physical dispatch of circulars may be discontinued in due course.

 
In this regard, you are advised to note that circulars pertaining to amendments to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 would henceforth be issued only in electronic form with digital signatures in conformity with the information Technology Act, 2000 and that physical dispatch of circulars would be discontinued.

In view of above, all registered Merchant Bankers are once again advised to communicate their email ids as instructed above at (1), at the earliest.

 
Yours faithfully,
