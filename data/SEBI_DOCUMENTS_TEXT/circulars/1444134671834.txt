5.  With  regard  to  FPI  investments  in  Central  Government  securities,  it  has  also  been  decided  to 
prospectively  put  in  place  a  security-wise  limit  of 20% of  the  amount  outstanding  under  each 
Central Government security. Existing investments in the Central Government securities where 
aggregate FPI investment is over 20% may continue. However, fresh purchases by FPIs in these 
securities  shall  not  be  permitted  till  the  corresponding  security-wise  investments  fall  below 
20%. 
 

6.  The Central Government securities in which the aggregate FPI investment is more than 20% of 
the outstanding would be placed in a negative investment category in which fresh investments 
would  not  be  permitted.  This  negative  investment  list  as  well  as  the  aggregate  security-wise 
holdings by FPIs at the end of every day will be made available by the depositories (NSDL and 
CDSL) on their websites. The security-wise limit shall be effective from October 12, 2015. 
 

7.  In  partial  modification  to  Para  2  of  SEBI  circular  CIR/IMD/FIIC/19/2014  dated  October  09, 
2014, all future investments by Long Term FPIs, including the limits vacated when the current 
investment by a Long Term FPI runs off either through sale or redemption, shall be required to 
be made in Central Government securities having a minimum residual maturity of 3 years.  
 

8.  The stipulation on minimum residual maturity of three years shall also apply to SDLs. 

 

9.  The free limit as on October 09, 2015 within the INR 124,432 cr limit along with the new debt 
limits  of  INR  5,468  cr  shall  be  auctioned  on  the  exchange  platform  on  October  12,  2015.  All 
other existing terms and conditions pertaining to FPI debt limit auctions shall continue to apply. 
 

10. The incremental limit of INR 7,463 cr for Long Term FPIs shall be available for investment on 

tap with effect from October 12, 2015.  
 

11. The separate additional limit for SDLs shall also be available for investment on tap by FPIs with

12. Investment  of  coupons  received  by  FPIs  on  their  existing  investments  in  Central  Government 
securities  as  well  as  SDLs  shall  continue  to  be  outside  the  applicable  limits.  The  terms  and 
conditions for investment of coupons specified vide SEBI circular CIR/IND/FIIC/2/2015 dated 
February 05, 2015 shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to SDLs. 
 

13. The  depositories  (NSDL  and  CDSL)  shall  put  in  place  the  necessary  systems  for  the  daily 
reporting  by  the  custodians  of  the  FPIs  and  shall  also  disseminate  on  their  websites  the 
negative  investment  list,  the  aggregate  security-wise  holdings  by  FPIs  and  the  coupon 
investment data along with the daily debt utilization data. 

 

This  circular  shall  come  into  effect  immediately.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers 
conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.
