Sir / Madam, 
Sub:  Relaxation  in  Regulation  24(i)(f)  of  the  SEBI  (Buy-back  of  Securities) 
Regulations, 2018 due to the COVID 19 pandemic 
 
1.  Considering the developments relating to the COVID 19 pandemic, SEBI has received 
a  number  of  suggestions  for  relaxation  of  conditions  with  respect  to  raising  of  funds 
from the securities market.  
 

2.  Currently, regulation 24(i)(f) of SEBI (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 (“Buy-
back  Regulations”)  provides  a  restriction  that  the  companies  shall  not  raise  further 
capital for a period of one year from the expiry of buyback period, except in discharge 
of their subsisting obligations. It has been represented that the said period of one year 
may  be  reduced  to  six  months,  which  would  be  in  line  with  section  68(8)  of  the 
Companies Act, 2013.  

 

3.  To enable relatively quicker access to capital, it has been decided to temporarily relax 
the  period  of  restriction  provided  in  Regulation  24(i)(f)  of  the  Buy-back  Regulations. 
Accordingly the words “one year” shall be read as “six months” in the said regulation.   

 

4.  This relaxation will be applicable till December 31, 2020. 

 

5.  This  circular  shall  come  into  force  with  immediate  effect.  The  stock  exchanges  are 
advised  to  bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the  notice  of  all  the  stakeholders 
including the listed entities and also disseminate on their websites.  
 

6.  The circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. 
 

7.  The  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  category  - 

'Legal - Circulars'.
