The quotation would be similar to the quoted price of the GoI security.  
 
Tenor of the contract 
The maximum maturity of the contract would be 12 months. 
 
Contract months 
To begin with, three serial monthly contracts can be introduced. 
 
Settlement mechanism 
The  futures  on  notional  GoI  security  would  be  settled  in  cash  in  Indian  Rupees. 
The settlement price of the notional bond would be determined on the basis of the 
yields of a basket of eligible bond(s) selected by the exchange with the yields of 
the bonds in the basket to be determined through a polling process carried out by 
Fixed Income, Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) as detailed in 
Annexure-1a.

The contract value would be: = Quoted price * 2000 
 
Daily Contract Settlement Value 
The Daily Contract Settlement Value would be: = 2000 * Pw 
 
(Here Pw is weighted average futures quote of last half an hour). 
In  the  absence  of  last  half  an  hour  trading,  theoretical  futures  price  would  be 
considered for computation of Daily Contract Settlement Value. Exchanges would 
be required to disclose the model/methodology used for arriving at the theoretical 
price.

10  Expiry/Last trading day 

 

The  expiry  /  last  trading  day  for  the  contract  would  be  the  last  Thursday  of  the 
expiry month. If any expiry day is a trading holiday, then the expiry/ last trading day 
would be the previous trading day.

Final Contract Settlement Value 
The Final Contract Settlement Value would be = 2000 * Pf  
 
where Pf is the settlement price of the notional bond. 
 
Initial Margin 
The Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an  individual  client  across  various  scenarios  of  price  changes.  The  various 
scenarios of price changes would be so computed so as to cover a 99% VaR over 
a one day horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be 
fixed at 3.5 standard deviation. The initial margin so computed would be subject to 
a minimum of 0.35 % of the notional value of the contract on the first day of trading 
in Futures on 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security 
and 0.3 % of the notional value of the contract thereafter. The initial margin shall 
be deducted from the liquid net  worth  of  the  clearing  member on an online, real 
time basis.  

13  Extreme Loss margin 

Extreme  loss  margin  of  0.1  %  of  the  notional  value  of  the  contract  for  all  gross 
open positions shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on 
an on line, real time basis. 

14  Calendar spread margin 

15 

 

2  Year  Notional  Coupon  Bearing  Government  of  India  (GoI)  Security  futures 
position at one maturity hedged by an offsetting 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing 
Government of India (GoI) Security futures position at a different maturity would be 
treated as a calendar spread.  The calendar spread margin shall be at a value of ` 
300 for spread of one month and ` 450 for spread of two months.  The benefit for a 
calendar spread would continue till expiry of the near month contract.  
 
Formula for determining standard deviation 

The  exponential  moving  average  method  would  be  used  to  obtain  the  volatility 
estimate every day. The estimate of volatility (σt) for the time period t is estimated 
using the volatility estimate (σt-1) for the previous time period and the return (rt-1) 
observed in the futures market during the previous time period. The formula would 
be as under:  
(σt)2 = λ (σt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rt-1)2 

where 

λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates change. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.

σt (sigma) means the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of futures 
price of 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security 
at time t. 

The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Pt/Pt-1) where Pt is the 
futures price of 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) 
Security at time t. The plus/minus 3.5 sigma limits for a 99% VaR based on 
logarithmic returns would have to be converted into percentage price change 
by reversing the logarithmic transformation. The percentage margin on short 
positions would be equal to 100(exp(3.5σ)-1) and the percentage margin on 
long positions would be equal to 100(1-exp(-3.5σ)). This implies slightly larger 
margins  on  short  positions 
long  positions.  The  derivatives 
exchange/clearing corporation may apply the higher margin on both the buy 
and sell side. 

than  on 

iii.  The  volatility  estimation  and  margin  fixation  methodology  should  be  clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin 
for  any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the 
trading software itself should provide this information on a real time basis on 
the trading workstation screen.  

iv.  During  the  first  time-period  on  the  first  day  of  trading  in  2  Year  Notional 
Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security futures, the sigma would 
be equal to 0.10 %. 

16  Position Limits 

i.  Client level:  The gross open positions of the client across all contracts should 
not exceed 6% of the total open interest or Rs 300 crores whichever is higher.  
The Exchange will disseminate alerts whenever the gross open position of the 
client  exceeds  3%  of  the  total  open  interest  at  the  end  of  the  previous  day’s 
trade. 

ii.  Trading  Member  level:  The  gross  open  positions  of  the  trading  member 
across  all  contracts  should  not  exceed  15%  of  the  total  open  interest  or  Rs. 
1000 crores whichever is higher.  

iii.  Clearing Member level:  No separate position limit is prescribed at the level of 
clearing  member.    However,  the  clearing  member  shall  ensure  that  his  own 
trading position and the positions of each trading member clearing through him 
is within the limits specified above. 

iv.  FIIs:    In  case  of  Foreign  Institutional  Investors  registered  with  Securities  and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  the  total  gross  long  (bought)  position  in  cash  and 
Interest Rate Futures markets taken together should not exceed their individual 
permissible  limit  for  investment  in  government  securities  and  the  total  gross 
short (sold) position, for the purpose of hedging only, should not exceed their 
long position in the government securities and in Interest Rate Futures, at any 
point in time.

Settlement Mechanism 
 

a.  Polling  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Fixed  Income,  Money  Market  and 

Derivatives Association, i.e., FIMMDA; 

b.  The yields (Bid and Ask) of the GoI  securities shall be polled from Primary 

Dealers (PDs) registered with the Reserve Bank of India; 

c.  Each poll shall involve ten PDs who would be selected at random from the 

universe of PDs; 

12.00 pm daily; 

d.  Polling would be conducted at three instances, i.e., 11.00 am, 11.30 am and 

e.  At  each  instance  of  polling,  for  each  bond,  out  of  the  ten  buy  yields,  two 
highest  and  two  lowest  yields  would  be  treated  as  outliers  and  would  be 
ignored. Similarly outliers from ten sell yields would be identified and ignored. 
f.  After rejecting the outliers in above step, there will be [6 * 2 * 3 * Number of 

Bonds in Basket] number of remaining yields. 

g.  Average settlement yield (Ys) is the simple average of the remaining yields. 

Ys will be rounded off to 4 decimal digits. 

h.  Ys  determined  in  above  step  would  be  used  to  calculate  present  value  of 
notional underlying bond on the basis of formula given below. This will be the 
final settlement price of the contract.

using the volatility estimate (σt-1) for the previous time period and the return (rt-1) 
observed in the futures market during the previous time period. The formula would 
be as under:  
(σt)2 = λ (σt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rt-1)2 

where 

λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates change. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.

i.  σt (sigma) means the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of futures 
price of 5 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security at 
time t. 

ii. 

The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Pt/Pt-1) where Pt is the 
futures  price  of  5  Year  Notional  Coupon  Bearing  GoI  Security  at  time  t.  The 
plus/minus 3.5 sigma limits for a 99% VaR based on logarithmic returns would 
have to be converted into percentage price change by reversing the logarithmic 
transformation.  The  percentage  margin  on  short  positions  would  be  equal  to 
100(exp(3.5σ)-1) and the percentage margin on long positions would be equal 
to 100(1-exp(-3.5σ)). This implies slightly larger margins on short positions than 
on long positions. The derivatives exchange/clearing corporation may apply the 
higher margin on both the buy and sell side. 

iii.  The  volatility  estimation  and  margin  fixation  methodology  should  be  clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin for 
any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the  trading 
software  itself  should  provide  this  information  on  a  real  time  basis  on  the 
trading workstation screen.  

iv.  During the first time-period on the first day of trading in 5 Year Notional Coupon 

Bearing GoI Security futures, the sigma would be equal to 0.2 %.

Position Limits 

i.  Client level:  The gross open positions of the client across all contracts should 
not exceed 6% of the total open interest or Rs 300 crores whichever is higher.  
The Exchange will disseminate alerts whenever the gross open position of the 
client  exceeds  3%  of  the  total  open  interest  at  the  end  of  the  previous  day’s 
trade. 

ii.  Trading  Member  level:  The  gross  open  positions  of  the  trading  member 
across  all  contracts  should  not  exceed  15%  of  the  total  open  interest  or  Rs. 
1000 crores whichever is higher.  

iii.  Clearing Member level:  No separate position limit is prescribed at the level of 
clearing  member.    However,  the  clearing  member  shall  ensure  that  his  own 
trading position and the positions of each trading member clearing through him 
is within the limits specified above. 

iv.  FIIs:    In  case  of  Foreign  Institutional  Investors  registered  with  Securities  and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  the  total  gross  long  (bought)  position  in  cash  and 
Interest Rate Futures markets taken together should not exceed their individual 
permissible  limit  for  investment  in  government  securities  and  the  total  gross 
short (sold) position, for the purpose of hedging only, should not exceed their

ANNEXURE-2a 
 
Settlement Mechanism 

a.  Polling  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Fixed  Income,  Money  Market  and 

Derivatives Association, i.e., FIMMDA; 

b.  The yields (Bid and Ask) of the GoI  securities shall be polled from Primary 

Dealers (PDs) registered with the Reserve Bank of India; 

c.  Each poll shall involve ten PDs who would be selected at random from the 

universe of PDs; 

12.00 pm daily; 

d.  Polling would be conducted at three instances, i.e., 11.00 am, 11.30 am and 

e.  At  each  instance  of  polling,  for  each  bond,  out  of  the  ten  buy  yields,  two 
highest  and  two  lowest  yields  would  be  treated  as  outliers  and  would  be 
ignored. Similarly outliers from ten sell yields would be identified and ignored. 
f.  After rejecting the outliers in above step, there will be [6 * 2 * 3 * Number of 

Bonds in Basket] number of remaining yields. 

g.  Average settlement yield (Ys) is the simple average of the remaining yields. 

Ys will be rounded off to 4 decimal digits. 

h.  Ys  determined  in  above  step  would  be  used  to  calculate  present  value  of 
notional underlying bond on the basis of formula given below. This will be the 
final settlement price of the contract.
