SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-09/2001 February 09, 2001

To,
All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ Custodians and AMFI/RAIN
Dear Sirs,
Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities
Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-49/2000 dated October 16, 2000 advising that there should be a time gap of three months between the date for establishing connectivity by the companies with both the depositories and the date of commencement of compulsory dematerialised trading. It was further advised that the date announced for compulsory dematerialised trading for the scrips as per SEBI circular no. SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-23/2000 dated May 29, 2000 would henceforth be treated as the date by which the company should establish connectivity with both the depositories. The compulsory dematerialized trading in these companies will commence after three month from that date. It was also mentioned in the circular that the companies which fail to establish connectivity with both the depositories on the scheduled date would be traded only on the 'trade for trade' settlement window of the exchanges from the following settlement period.
In accordance with the aforementioned circulars dated May 29, 2000 and October 16, 2000, out of the 275 scrips required to establish connectivity with both the depositories by January 29, 2001, 122 companies have now established connectivity. These 122 scrips (Serial No. 1 to 122 of annexure 'A') would be traded compulsorily in dematerialized form by all investors with effect from April 28, 2001. The 153 scrips (Serial No. 123 to 275 of annexure 'A') which have not established connectivity would be traded only on "trade for trade" segment of the stock exchanges, from the settlement period commencing on or immediately after February 19, 2001.
Currently scrips of 497 companies have been included for trading only on 'trade for trade' settlement window of the exchanges. Out of these, 82 companies (Serial Nos. 276 to 357 of annexure 'A') have established connectivity with both the depositories. These scrips shall be traded on the normal trading segment where deliveries can be made either in physical or dematerialised form with effect from February 26, 2001 and compulsorily in dematerialised form 3 months after that date i.e. from May 28, 2001.
Yours faithfully,
P. K. KURIACHEN DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER SECONDARY MARKET, DEPOSITORIES, RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS DEPARTMENT
