SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 9/141601/08 
October 18, 2008 

To,  
All Mutual Funds Registered with SEBI 
Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) 
 
Sir/ Madam, 
 
Sub: Valuation of Debt securities by Mutual Funds 
 
This  is  in  partial  modification  of  SEBI  Circular  No.  MFD/CIR/8/92/2000  dated 
September  18,  2000  and  MFD/CIR  No.  14/442/2002  dated  February  20,  2002, 
which,  inter-alia,  specified  the  discount  adjustments  for  debt  securities  rated  by 
external agencies for ill-liquidity risk, promoter background, finance company risk 
and issuer class risk. 
 
It  has  been  brought  to  notice  of  SEBI  by  AMFI  and  CRISIL  that  the  current 
valuation  methodology  which  allows  the  discretion  of  -50  basis  points  (bps)  to 
+100  bps  to  account  for  the  aforesaid  risks  is  inadequate  as  debt  securities  of 
similar maturity and credit rating are being traded over wide range of yields.  With 
a  view  to  ensure  that  the  value  of  debt  securities  reflects  the  current  market 
scenario  in  calculation  of  net  asset  value,  it  has  been  decided  to  increase  the 
discretion permitted.   
 
Accordingly, the clauses C(I) and C(II) of the circular dated September 18, 2000 
and clause 4 of the circular dated February 20, 2002 shall be revised as follows:
