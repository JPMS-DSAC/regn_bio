SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2018/04

Sir/ Madam, 
 
Subject: Benchmarking of Scheme’s performance to Total Return Index  

                   January 4, 2018 

 

 

1.  Mutual  Funds  are  required  to  disclose  the  name(s)  of  benchmark  index/indices  with 
which the AMC and trustees would compare the performance of the scheme in scheme 
related documents. 
 

2.  At  present,  most  of  the  mutual  fund  schemes  (other  than  debt  schemes)  are 
benchmarked to the Price Return variant of an Index (PRI). PRI only captures capital 
gains of the index constituents. On the other hand, Total Return variant of an Index (TRI) 
takes into account all dividends/ interest payments that are generated from the basket 
of  constituents  that make  up  the  index  in  addition  to  the  capital  gains.  Hence,  TRI  is 
more appropriate as a benchmark to compare the performance of mutual fund schemes.  
 

3.  With an objective to enable the investors to compare the performance of a scheme vis-

à-vis an appropriate benchmark, it has been decided that: 
(a) Selection of a benchmark for the scheme of a mutual fund shall be in alignment with 
the  investment  objective,  asset  allocation  pattern  and  investment  strategy  of  the 
scheme. 
 

(b) The performance of the schemes of a mutual fund shall be benchmarked to the Total 

Return variant of the Index chosen as a benchmark as stated in para (a) above.  
 

(c)  (i)  Mutual  funds  shall  use  a  composite  CAGR  figure  of  the  performance  of  the  PRI 
benchmark  (till  the  date  from  which  TRI  is  available)  and  the  TRI  (subsequently)  to 
compare the performance of their scheme in case TRI is not available for that particular 
period(s).  
 
(ii) The calculation of composite CAGR is elaborated with an example in the following 
paragraph.  

 

 

 

For instance, ABC scheme had been launched on August 2, 1995. The benchmark 
PRI values are available from the date of inception of the fund. The benchmark TRI 
values are available from June 30, 1999. The calculation of a composite benchmark 
performance return in CAGR terms would be as given below:

The aforesaid is explained with an example: 

Example: Consolidated Benchmark  CAGR (PRI and TRI)  

Date 

Benchmark PRI values 

Benchmark TRI values 

02/08/1995 
30/06/1999 
30/11/2017 

CAGR 

1007.57 
1187.70 
10226.55 

 

1256.38 
13966.58 

12.20% 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Thus, in the above example (for advertisements in the month of December, 2017 the last of the 
preceding month would be November 30, 2017), 
 
CAGR= [(1187.70/1007.57)*(13966.58/1256.38) ^ (1/22.3452)]-1  

[1 year= 365 days] 

 
CAGR= 12.20% 

 

(iii) Mutual funds shall use the composite CAGR as explained above, subject to making 
the following disclosure: 

 
*As TRI data is not available since inception of the scheme, benchmark performance is 
calculated  using  composite  CAGR  of  XYZ  (name  of  the  benchmark  index)  PRI  values 
from date…. to date… and TRI values since date….” 
 

4.  This circular is applicable to all schemes of Mutual Funds with effect from February 1, 

2018. 

 
This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities 
and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the  provision  of  Regulation  77  of  SEBI 
(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to 
promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
