Dear Sir/Madam, 

Issues pertaining to primary issuance of debt securities 

 

SEBI  has  been  holding  discussions  with  issuers  and  various  other  market  participants 
regarding the issues concerning development of Corporate Bond Market. Based on the 
suggestions  received  in  the  aforesaid  meetings,  it  has  been  decided  to  implement  the 
following measures:

circular 

no. 
SEBI/CBM/BOND/2/2007/13/04 dated April 13, 2007 specified that day count 
convention  for  calculation  of  interest  payments  for  listed  corporate  debt 
securities (for all new issues of corporate bonds) shall be Actual/Actual. This 
is  reiterated  in  the  circular  dated  January  24,  2013  providing  Guidelines  for 
Setting  up  Dedicated  Debt  Segment.  It  has  been  pointed  out  by  the  market 
participants  that  the  disclosures  can  further  be  improved,  if  cash  flows 
concerning  interest  payment  and  redemption  of  debt  securities  are  given  by 
way of illustration in the offer document.  
 
Considering  the  same,  it  has  been  decided  that  the  cash  flows  emanating 
from  the  debt  securities  shall  be  mentioned  in  the  Prospectus/Disclosure 
Document,  by  way  of  an 
the  purpose  of 
standardization  and  in  line  with  the  dated  government  securities,  it  has  also 
been decided that if the coupon payment date of the debt securities, falls on a 
Sunday or a holiday the coupon payment shall be made on the next working 
day. If the maturity date of the debt securities, falls on a Sunday or a holiday, 
the  redemption  proceeds  shall  be  paid  on  the  previous  working  day.  An 
illustration  for  guidance  in  this  regard  is  prescribed  in  Annexure  A  to  this

II.  Withdrawal  of  requirement  to  upload  bids  on  date-time  priority:  Vide 
circular  dated  July  27,  2012,  SEBI  has  advised  that  in  public  issues  of  debt 
securities,  where  the  issuer  has  signed  agreement  with  multiple  stock 
exchanges,  the  registrar  shall  ensure  that  allotment  is  done  on  date-time 
priority  basis.  However,  SEBI  is  receipt  of  requests from market  participants 
to relax the said requirement, stating the operational difficulties at present  in 
making  allotment  on  date  time  priority  basis,  such  as  time  gap  between 
receipt  of  application  and  upload,  uploading  of  applications 
lots, 
acknowledgement stamp and upload may not happen simultaneously, etc.  
 
In  this  regard,  it  has  been  decided  that  the  allotment  in  the  public  issue  of 
debt  securities  should  be  made  on  the  basis  of  date  of  upload  of  each 
application  into  the  electronic  book  of  the  stock  exchange.  However,  on  the 
date of oversubscription, the allotments should be made  to the applicants on 
proportionate basis.

III.  Disclosure  of  unaudited  financials  with  limited  review  report:  Presently, 
the companies proposing to make public issue of debt securities are required 
to give the audited financials in the offer document, which are not older than 6 
months  from  the  date  of  the  prospectus,  as  per  the  disclosure  requirements 
specified in SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations read with 
Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act,  1956.  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and 
Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009  enables  listed  issuers  to 
disclose unaudited financials  for stub period with limited review report in the 
offer  document,  in  case  of  further  public  issues  or  rights  issue  of  equities, 
where audited accounts as at such date are not available. 
 
To  avoid  hardships  to  frequent  debt  issuers,  it  has  been  decided  that  listed 
issuers (who have already listed their equity shares or debentures) who are in 
compliance with the listing agreement, may disclose unaudited financials with 
limited review report in the offer document, as filed with the stock exchanges 
in accordance with the listing agreement, instead of audited financials, for the 
stub  period,  subject  to  making  necessary  disclosures  in  this  regard  in  offer 
document including risk factors.  
 

IV.  Disclosure of contact details of Debenture Trustees in Annual Report: It 
has  been  decided  to  amend  the  Listing  Agreement  for  Debt  Securities  (as 
specified  in  Annexure  B)  by  inserting  a  clause  stating  that  the  companies,
