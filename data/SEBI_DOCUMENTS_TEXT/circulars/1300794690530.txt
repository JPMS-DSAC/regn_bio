shall come into force with immediate effect for all ‘securitised debt instruments, 
as defined under regulation 2(1)(s) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Public  Offer  and  Listing  of  Securitised  Debt  Instruments)  Regulations,  2008, 
seeking listing on the Stock Exchange. 

4.  In respect of listed securitized debt instruments, it is clarified that SPDEs which 
make  frequent  issues  of  securitized  debt  instruments  are  permitted  to  file 
umbrella offer documents on the lines of a ‘shelf prospectus’. 

5.  In  order  to  ensure  uniform  market  convention  for  secondary  market  trades  of 
securitized  debt  instruments,  Actual/  Actual  day  count  convention,  shall  be 
mandatory for all listed securitized debt instruments.

may be applicable and necessary. 

 
7.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the
