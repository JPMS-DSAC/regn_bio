All Foreign Institutional Investors  
and Custodians of Securities 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

Circular No.FITTC/CUST/12/2001 
June 04, 2001 

Sub : Clarifications regarding investment by Foreign Institutional Investors 

Some  FIIs/  sub  accounts  which  are  not  desirous  of  renewing  registration  but  are  holding 
certain  unsaleable  securities  /  securities  of  nominal  value  have  approached  SEBI  seeking 
permission to hold such securities after the expiry of registration. This may happen due to 
reasons  beyond  control  of  the  FIIs/Sub  accounts  such  as  securities  being  illiquid  or  being 
held  up  as  an  objection  case/  court  order.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
(Foreign Institutional Investors ) Regulations, 1995 have, therefore, been amended to permit 
such FIIs/Sub accounts  to hold residual securities for subsequent disposal, after the expiry 
of FIIs/Sub accounts registration subject to receipt of specific permission from SEBI in this 
regard. The procedure for seeking such permission is given in this circular. 

Further,  to  facilitate  a  more  co-ordinated  compliance  by  FIIs  with  SEBI  Regulations  and 
directives  as  well  as  easier  communication  between  FIIs  and  SEBI,  appointment  of  a 
compliance  officer  by  FIIs  is  being  stipulated.  Information  regarding  compliance  officer 
required to be submitted to SEBI is explained in this circular. 

A. 

Permitting disinvestment after expiry of registration 

The procedure for seeking permission for disinvestment by FIIs after expiry of registration is 
given below: 

1.  At the time of expiry of registration, the FII desiring permission for disinvestment for 
itself  or  its  sub  account/s  shall  make  a  request  to  SEBI  along  with  details  of  its 
holdings as per format in Annexure- A. Such requests shall be submitted within 45 
days  of  expiry  of  registration  (For  those  FIIs/Sub  accounts  whose  registration  has 
expired before the date of this circular, requests can be made within one month from 
the date of this circular) 

2.  SEBI  would,  if  appropriate,  grant  such  permission  for  a  period  of  6  months  under 
intimation to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requesting the latter to grant necessary 
approval  under  Foreign  Change  Management  Act  at  it  s  end.  The  required  sale 
trades can be carried out after the receipt of RBI’s approval. 

3.  The permission would generally permit only sale of the securities held by the FII/SA 
as  on  date  of  expiry  of  registration.  No  purchase  transactions  shall  be  undertaken 
after the expiry of registration. However, credit of corporate benefits and application 
for  rights  issue  in  respect  of  existing  securities  would  be  permitted.  Ina  case  any 
fresh  purchase  transactions  are  undertaken,  the  FII  would  be  bound  to  seek  fresh 

registration  besides  being  liable  for  penal  action  for  making  investments  without 
holding valid registration. 

4.  FIIs and their custodians shall be responsible for reporting these trades carried out 

5. 

as per the SEBI permission appropriately.  
If  the  FII  is  unable  to  sell  the  seucties  within  6  months,  it  can  approach  SEBI  for 
extension  and  be  also  accompanied  by  a  statement  of  current  holdings  in  the 
required format. These requests would be granted based on the merits of the case. 

B.  Appointment of compliance officer  

All FIIs are requested to provide the same, designation and contact particulars including 
email  did  of  the  compliance  officer  who  would  be  responsible  for  compliance  with  the 
provisions  of  the  SEBI  (FII)  Regulations,  1995  and  the  other  relevant  provisions.  This 
information  may  be  submitted  by  letter,  fax  or  email  so  as  to  reach  SEBI  by  June  30, 
2001. The relative addresses/ fax numbers are mentioned on the top of this circular.
