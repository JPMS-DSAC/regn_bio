Sub: Indicative Portfolios and Yields in Mutual Fund schemes 

 
1.  Advisory Committee of Mutual Funds discussed the practice of Mutual Funds 
offering  indicative  portfolios  and  indicative  yields  in  their  debt  /fixed  income 
products. There was a consensus that this practice should be prohibited as 
the indicative portfolio and indicative yield may be misleading to the investors.   

  
2.  It  is,  therefore,  decided  that  the  Mutual  Funds  shall  not  offer  any  indicative 
portfolio  and  indicative  yield.  No  communication  regarding  the  same  in  any 
manner whatsoever, shall be issued by any Mutual Fund or distributors of its 
products.  The  compliance  of  the  same  shall  be  monitored  by  the  AMC  and 
Trustees and reported in their respective reports to SEBI. 

 
3.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under section 11(1) of 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the 
provisions  of  regulation  77  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  to 
protect the interests of Investors in securities and to promote the development
