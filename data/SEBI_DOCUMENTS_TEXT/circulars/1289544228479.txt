administration  and  servicing  systems  for  customer  service,  funds  flow  process, 
system  processes  for  meeting  regulatory  requirements,  prudential  investment 
limits and access rights to systems interface.  
 
Accordingly, you are advised to get the above systems audit conducted once in 
two  years.  You  are  further  advised  to  place  the  Systems  Audit  Report  and 
compliance  status  before  the  Trustees  of  the  mutual  fund.  The  systems  audit
