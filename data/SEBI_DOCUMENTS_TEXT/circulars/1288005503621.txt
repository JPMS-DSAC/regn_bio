In  terms  of  SEBI  notification  No.  LAD-NRO/GN/2010-11/09/6422  dated  May  31, 
2010,  under  regulation  3  (1)  of  the  (Certification  of  Associated  Persons  in  the 
Securities  Markets)  Regulations,  2007,  (Certification  Regulations)  it  has  been 
decided  that  from  June  01,  2010,  the  certification  examination  for  distributors, 
agents or any other persons employed or engaged or to be employed or engaged 
in the sale and/or distribution of mutual fund products, would be conducted by the 
National  Institute  of  Securities  Markets  (NISM).  A  copy  of  the  notification  is 
attached. 

Under the existing instructions, the agent/ distributor was exempted from the AMFI 
certification examination if he had completed fifty years of age and had at least five 
years of experience in distribution of mutual fund units. As per regulation 4 (3) of 
the Certification Regulations, persons who have attained the age of fifty years or 
who have at least ten years experience in the securities markets in the sale and/ or 
distribution of mutual fund products as on May 31, 2010, will be given the option of

classroom credits as may be specified by NISM from time to time. 

The  Certification  Regulations  require  the  persons  referred  to  in  para  2  above  to 
comply  with  the  requirements  for  CPE  as  specified  by  NISM  within  the  validity 
period  of  the  certificate  obtained  by  passing  the  certification  examination. 
However,  to  facilitate  the  transition  process  from  AMFI  to  NISM,    it  has  been 
decided  that  a  person  holding  a  valid  AMFI  certification  whose  validity  expires 
between June 01, 2010 and December 31, 2010, would be required to comply with 
the  CPE  requirements  as  laid  down  by  NISM  under  the  relevant  clauses  of  the 
Certification Regulations, by December 31, 2010.
