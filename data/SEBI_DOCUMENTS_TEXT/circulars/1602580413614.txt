2.  For the purpose of evaluation of risk level, AUM of the security forming part 

of the scheme portfolio shall be as on last day of the given month. 

 

3.  The evaluation of risk parameters are as detailed below:

shall include the accrued interest i.e. dirty price. 

  For the above purpose, credit rating of the instrument as on last

  Liquidity Risk Value of a portfolio shall be assigned based on the 

weighted average of such values (weights based on the AUM) of 

each instrument.  

  For  the  above  purpose,  instruments  held  by  the  scheme  as  on 

last day of the month shall be considered. 

 

d)  Risk value for the debt portfolio shall be simple average of credit risk 

value, interest rate risk value and liquidity risk value. However, if the 

liquidity  risk  value  is  higher  than  the  average  of  credit  risk  value, 

liquidity  risk  value  and  interest  rate  risk  value  then  the  value  of 

liquidity risk shall be considered as risk value of the debt portfolio. 

 

e)  For  investment  by  mutual  funds  in  instruments  having  short  term 

ratings,  the  liquidity  risk  value  and  the  credit  risk  value  shall  be 

based  on  the  lowest  long  term  rating  of  the  instrument  of  the  same 

issuer  as  shown  above  (in  order  to  follow  conservative  approach) 

across credit rating agencies. However, if there is no long term rating 

of  the  same  issuer,  then  based  on  credit  rating  mapping  most 

conservative  long  term  rating  shall  be  taken  for  a  given  short  term

  Based on the weighted average of above volatility values of each 

security (weights being AUM of the security), Volatility Value of a

If  an  instrument  is  traded  on  multiple  stock  exchanges,  then  the 

most  conservative  volatility  value  across  stock  exchanges  for  a 

given month shall be considered.

on  the  average  impact  cost  of  the  security  for  previous  three 

months including the month under consideration following values

 

If  an  instrument  is  traded  on  multiple  stock  exchanges,  then  the 

impact  cost  shall  be  based  on  average  value  of  impact  costs 

across stock exchanges for a given month.  

 

d)  For  investment  in  IPOs  or  recently  listed  securities,  the  following 

process  shall  be  adopted  for  arriving  at  weighted  average  value  for

  Market Capitalisation value: Market capitalisation of a security as 

on the last trading day of the month shall be compared with that 

of the market capitalisation of the threshold for large cap, mid cap 

and  small  cap  as  published  by  AMFI  and 

then  market 

capitalisation  parameter  of  risk  shall  be  valued  based  on  the 

Table 4 mentioned above.  

  Volatility value: For the first three months of trading of a security, 

the  value  for  volatility  shall  be  assigned  as  6.  From  the 

subsequent  months,  volatility  shall  be  calculated  based  on  the 

available security prices as mentioned at Table 5 above.  

 

Impact  cost  value:  For  the  first  three  months  of  trading  of  a 

security, the impact cost value  shall be assigned as  5. From the

e)  Risk  value  for  equity  portfolio  shall  be  simple  average  of  market 

capitalisation value, volatility value and impact cost value.  

 

iii.  Equity Derivatives 

  For  hedging  positions,  the  underlying  security  held  and  its 

corresponding  derivative  instrument  shall  not  be  included  for 

arriving at risk value. For instance, if XYZ security in cash market 

is  being  hedged  by  its  futures  instrument,  then  the  XYZ  cash 

market  security  and  short  futures  position  in  XYZ  security  both 

shall not be considered for arriving at risk value.  

 

If the quantity of  derivative positions taken for hedging purposes 

are  in  excess  of  the  underlying  position  against  which  the 

hedging  position  has  been  taken,  the  excess  position  shall  be 

included while calculating the risk value. 

 

 

iv.  Index Futures and Stock Futures

vi.  Other derivative instruments  

 

If the derivative instrument is used for hedging, then the hedging 

instrument shall not be included for calculating the risk value only 

if the quantity of derivative instrument is less than or equal to the 

quantity  of  underlying/instrument  being  hedged.  If  the  derivative 

instrument position is in excess of the underlying then the excess 

position shall be considered while calculating the risk value. 



PORTFOLIO RISK-O-METER VALUE:  

  Simple average of the above three parameters comes out to 3.8 

([3.5+3+4.8]/3) 

  Since  the  liquidity  risk  value  of  4.8  is  higher  than  the  average 

value of above three parameters i.e. 3.8, the risk value assigned 

to  the  scheme  will  be  4.8.  Hence,  the  risk  level  as  per  Risk-o-

meter is High. 

  Therefore,  risk-o-meter  for  the  abovementioned  debt  scheme 

would be High, and shall be as depicted below: 

B.  Equity scheme

  Since  the  value  of  risk  is  higher  than  5,  it  shall  fall  into  range  of 

Very High Risk.  

  Therefore,  risk-o-meter  for  the  abovementioned  equity  scheme
