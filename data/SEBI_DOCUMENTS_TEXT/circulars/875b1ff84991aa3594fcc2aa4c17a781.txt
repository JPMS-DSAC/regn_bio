To,
The Presidents/Executive Directors Stock Exchanges
Dear Sir,
Inter-linking of exchanges through e-mail facility
In order to ensure timely and proper dissemination of price sensitive information, company news and to improve co-ordination between exchanges, so as to bring uniformity in decisions regarding trading restrictions/permissions, it has been suggested to us that all the Stock Exchanges be connected through E-Mail facility. This will enable Stock Exchanges to communicate with all the other Stock Exchange, without any extra effort. This is expected to reduce distortions in prices/price manipulations. The initial cost in the first year is expected to be Rs.26,000/- which will be reduced to Rs.15,000/- from the second year onwards. However, recurring communication charges would be extra.
You are requested to send your views regarding the feasibility and usefulness of the above to us latest by 15th May 1995.
Yours faithfully, sd/- Â 
(J.N. GUPTA) DIVISION CHIEF - SMD
