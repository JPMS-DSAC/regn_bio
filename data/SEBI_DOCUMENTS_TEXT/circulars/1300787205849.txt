Dear Sir, 

Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities

Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-9/2000 dated February 16, 2000 
advising inter alia the list of scrips and the scheduled dates for compulsory settlement of trades 
in dematerialised form for all investors and institutional investors viz. domestic financial 
institutions, foreign institution investors, banks, mutual funds and overseas corporate bodies 
(OCBs). 

1. Some of the companies, whose scrips were included in the list of securities (serial 

number 164 to 372 of annexure "B" to the circular) for compulsory trading in 
dematerialised form for institutional investors and OCBs effective from May 15, 2000, 
could not sign agreements and establish connectivity with both the depositories well on 
time or are in the process of doing so. The effective date for compulsory trading by 
institutional investors and OCBs in dematerialised form for these scrips (63 scrips as per 
the enclosed list) therefore stands postponed and the revised date would be announced 
later. 
It was also decided to include Hughes Software Systems Limited in the list of securities 
for compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form for all investors effective 
from June 26, 2000. 

2.

Yours faithfully,
