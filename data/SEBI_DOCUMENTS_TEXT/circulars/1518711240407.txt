 Sir/ Madam,  
 
Subject: Easing of Access Norms for investment by FPIs 
 
SEBI  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  has  decided  to  make  following  changes  in 
extant  regulatory  provisions  to  ease  the  access  norms  for  investment  by  Foreign 
Portfolio Investors (FPIs):- 
 
(a) Discontinuance of requirements for seeking prior approval from SEBI in case 

of change in local custodian/ Designated Depository Participant (DDP):  

 
A  Global  Custodian  generally  manages  a  large  number  of  FPI  accounts  in  India.  
Sometimes they shift these FPIs accounts from one local custodian to another. At that 
time, taking specific request letter from each FPI regarding change of local custodian 
may create operational and logistical challenges. Accordingly, the following changes 
have been made:-:  
 

Clause 5.4 of Operational Guidelines for DDPs ref. SEBI circular dated 

January 08, 2014 – Change in DDP/Custodian 

Existing provision 

Revised provision 

In  case  the  FPI  wishes  to  change 
the DDP/Custodian, the request for 
change  shall  be  intimated  to  SEBI 
through 
concerned 
DDP/Custodian.  On  receipt  of  no 
objection 
existing 
transferor  DDP/Custodian  and 
acceptance 
the  proposed 
transferee  DDP/Custodian, 
then 
approval from SEBI shall be sought 
by concerned FPI.

from 

In  case,  the  FPI  or  its  Global  Custodian 
wishes  to  change  the  local  custodian/DDP, 
the request for change  shall be forwarded to 
new local custodian/DDP. In case, the Global 
Custodian  of  FPI  wishes  to  change  the  local 
custodian/DDP,  then  the  request  for  change 
can be sent by the Global Custodian on behalf 
of  its  underlying  FPI  clients  provided  such 
Global  Custodian  has  been  explicitly 
authorized to take such steps by the client.

custodian/DDP, 

Upon  receipt  of  no  objection  from  the 
local 
transferor 
the 
transferee 
local  custodian/DDP  shall 
approve  the  change  and  intimate  SEBI 
about the change. In case, the request for 
change in local custodian/DDP is received 
from Global Custodian, the transferee local 
custodian/DDP  shall  inform  Compliance 
Officer  of  the  concerned  FPI(s)  regarding 
the change in their local custodian/DDP. 

(b) Rationalization of procedure for submission of PCC/MCV Declarations and 
Undertakings  (D&U)  and  Investor  grouping  requirement  at  the  time  of 
continuance of registration of FPIs:  
 
At  the  time  of  FPI  registration  /  conversion,  PCC/MCV  D&U  and  information 
regarding  FPI  investor  group  is  provided  and  the  same  are  recorded  in  NSDL 
portal.  In  case  there  is  no  change  in  the  information  already  submitted,  the 
requirement  to  resubmit  PCC/MCV  D&U  and  information  regarding  FPI  investor 
groups at the time of continuance is being dispensed with. Accordingly, FAQ 51 
has been changed in the following manner: 

 

documents 

FAQ 51. Is a DDP required to collect Form A from an FPI at the time of 
payment of registration fee for continuance of its registration as FPI?  
Existing provision 
In the FII regime, an FII/SA at the time 
of  payment  of  registration  fee  for 
continuance  of 
its  registration  as 
FII/SA is not required to submit Form 
A.  However,  it  is  required  to  submit 
certain 
namely 
Declaration  and  Undertaking  as 
specified 
in  SEBI  circular  No. 
CIR/IMD/FIIC/1/  2010  dated  April  15, 
2010  and  Information  regarding  FII 
groups  along  with  a  confirmation  to 
the  effect  that  there  is  no  change  in 
structure  of 
the  FII  and  SA  as 
compared  to  that  furnished  to  SEBI 
earlier.  The  same  practice  shall 
continue in the FPI regime. 
 

Revised provision 
In the FII regime, an FII/SA at the time 
of  payment  of  registration  fee  for 
continuance  of 
its  registration  as 
FII/SA  was  not  required  to  submit 
Form  A.  The  same  practice  shall 
continue  in  the  FPI  regime.  Further, 
FPIs  are  not  required  to  re-submit 
‘Declaration  and  Undertaking’  (as 
specified  in  the  SEBI  Circular  No. 
CIR/IMD/FIIC/1/  2010  dated  April  15, 
2010)  and  information  regarding  FPI 
investor  groups,  in  case  there  is  no 
change 
information  as 
compared to that furnished to the DDP 
earlier. 
 
DDPs  may

declaration  from the  FPI  that  there  is 
no  change  in  the  information,  as

previously furnished. However, it may 
be noted that the DDP/Custodians will 
continue  to  ensure  compliance  with 
the  KYC  due  diligence  requirement 
prescribed by SEBI/RBI and changes 
therein as may be notified from time to 
time. 

 

(c) Placing reliance on due diligence carried out by erstwhile DDP at the time of 
change of Custodian/ DDP of FPIs: At the time of change of local custodian/DDP 
by an FPI, the new local custodian/DDP is required to carry out the adequate due 
diligence requirement to ascertain the eligibility of the FPI. The due diligence by 
the  new  DDP  on  an  already  registered  FPI  at  the  time  of  change  of  local 
custodian/DDP often leads to increased documentation and sometimes delays the 
transition. Accordingly, the following change has been made:-:  

 

 

Existing  provision  (e-mail  dated 
July 02, 2015) 
With respect to the process of change 
of  Custodian/DDP  by  an  FPI,  it  is 
informed that both old (i.e. transferor) 
as  well  as  new  Custodian/DDP  (i.e. 
transferee)  shall  be  required  to  carry 
out the adequate due diligence in the 
process. 
 

Revised provision 

With respect to the process of change 
of local custodian/DDP by an FPI, it is 
informed  that  the  new  DDP  (i.e. 
transferee)  may  rely  on 
the  due 
diligence carried out by the old DDP. 
However, the new DDP is required to 
carry  out  adequate  due  diligence  at 
the  time  when  the  FPI  applies  for 
continuance  of  its  registration  on  an 
ongoing basis. 

(d) Exemption to FPIs having Multiple Investment Managers (MIM)  structure from 
seeking  prior  approval  from  SEBI  in  case  of  Free  of  Cost  (FOC)  transfer  of 
assets:  
 
As  per  Regulation  21(4)(d)  of  SEBI  (FPI)  Regulations,  2014,  “the    transaction    of  
business  in  securities  by  a foreign portfolio investor  shall  be only through stock 
brokers registered by the Board.” 
 
Notwithstanding  the  above,  it  is  proposed  that  requests  for  FOC  between  FPIs 
operating under MIM structure (with same PAN issued by Income Tax Department) 
shall  be  permitted  and  can  be  processed  by  DDPs  at  their  end.  Accordingly,  the 
following change has been made:- 

 

FAQ  28.  Who  would  consider  application  for  free  of  cost  transfer  of 
assets?   
Existing provision 
The request for free of cost transfer of 
assets by the FPI should be forwarded 

Revised provision 
The request for free of cost transfer of 
assets  between  FPIs  having  same 
PAN  and  also  registered  with  SEBI

(e) Simplification of process for addition of share class: FAQs 49 and 100 have 

been changed as below:  
 

FAQ 49. Does every fund / sub fund / share class need to separately fulfil 
broad based criteria? Is prior approval required for launch of new share 
class from DDP? 

Existing provision 

Revised provision 

In  case  common  portfolio  of  Indian 
securities  is  maintained  across  all 
classes  of  shares/fund/sub-fund  and 
broad  based  criteria  are  fulfilled  at 
portfolio  level  after  addition  of  share 
class, prior approval from DDP is not 
required.  
 
However, 
in  case  of  segregated 
portfolio in India, every fund / sub fund 
/ share class needs to separately fulfil 
broad based criteria. Further, in case 
of  addition  of  classes  of  shares  for 
segregated portfolio, the FPI shall be 
required to obtain prior approval from 
DDP.  However,  for  deletion  of  share 
classes  of  shares  of  segregated

shall  be  required 
to  obtain  prior 
approval  from  DDP.  For  granting  of 
such prior approval, DDPs shall obtain 
following  documents  from  the  FPI 
applicant:  a)  A  declaration  and 
undertaking  with  respect  to  PCC, 
MCV  status  as  specified  in  SEBI 
circular ref. no. CIR/IMD/FIIC/1/ 2010

FAQ 100. If the prospectus of a fund (registered as FPI) allows for share 
classes such as various currencies, can such an FPI request for addition 
of  share  class  for  every  single  iteration/variant  of  a  share-class  at  one 
time irrespective of whether it actually launches the share-class or not?  
Existing provision 
It has already been clarified in reply to 
Q  49  of  FAQs 
in  case  of 
simultaneous  addition  of  more  than 
one share class, which are not broad 
based,  then  an  undertaking  is  to  be 
obtained by the DDP that all the newly 
added  share  classes  will  become 
broad  based  within  15  days  from  the 
date of DDP approval letter. However, 
where 
is 
maintained, the approval of launch of 
share class/variant shall be taken prior 
to its launch. 

Revised provision 
It has already been clarified in reply to 
Q  49  of  FAQs

simultaneous  addition  of  more  than 
one  share  class  (where  segregated
