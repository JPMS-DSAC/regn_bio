To,

All Stock Exchanges/Depositories/ Custodians and AMFI/RAIN
Dear Sirs,
Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities.
Please refer to our earlier circular no. SMDRP/Policy/Cir-27/2000 dated July 12, 2000 advising inter-alia the list of 39 scrips (serial numbers 1 to 39 of annexure "A" to the circular) for which compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form stand postponed originally proposed for investors with effect from July 24, 2000.
NSDL has now informed us that SIBAR SOFTWARE SERVICES, which was erroneously added in the list of non-available companies, is now available for dematerialisation with NSDL. It has therfore been decided that trading would be compulsory in dematerialised form for all investors in the scrip of SIBAR SOFTWARE SERVICES with effect from July 24, 2000 as was mentioned in our earlier circular 23/2000 dated May 29,2000.
Yours faithfully,
J R VARMA
