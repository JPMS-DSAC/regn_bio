CIRCULAR 

 

 

 

January 3, 2011 

 

 

 
CIR/DNPD/01/2011  
 
To 
Recognised Stock Exchanges of India 
 
Dear Sir, 
 

Sub: Modifications to client code post trade execution 

 
1.  Stock Exchanges can permit modifications to client code post trade execution only in 
case of genuine error or wrong data entry made by trading members.  This facility has 
been provided for the smooth functioning of the system and is expected to be used 
more as an exception rather than routine.  Accordingly, Stock Exchanges are advised 
to:  
 
•  Set objective parameters for identification of client code modifications arising as 
a  result  of  genuine  error  or  wrong  data  entry.  These  objective  parameters 
should be approved by the Governing Board of the Exchange and disclosed to 
the trading members. 
 
Impose  monetary  penalty  in  addition  to  disciplinary  action  against  members 
who do not meet the laid down objective parameters. 

• 

• 

Include  verification  of  client  code  modification  as  a  reporting  item  in  internal 
audit report of the trading members. 

 
2.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act  1992,  read  with  Section  10  of  the 
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in 
securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market. 

 

3.  The circular shall come into force from the date of the circular. 
 
4.  This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in,  under  the  category 

“Derivatives- Circulars”. 

 
Yours faithfully,
