Memorandum to the Board
No. /99
ISSUE RELATED TO CONTINUOUS DISCLOSURE BY THE LISTED COMPANIES
SEBI Board, in its meeting held on March 19, 1999, decided to relax the period of two months for publication of audited results for the last quarter of the financial year to three months in case of Banks for the current year on the advice of Reserve Bank of India.
The Accounting Standards Committee appointed by SEBI under the chairmanship of Shri Y H Malegam, inter-alia, to review the continuous disclosure requirements by the listed companies, in its meeting held on April 26, 1999 considered the views of the representative of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and other members regarding difficulties in publication/submission of audited results for the last quarter of the financial year within two months. The committee recommended that all the listed companies may be permitted to publish/submit the audited results within three months instead of two months from the end of the last quarter of the financial year to ensure the quality of the audit. It is therefore, proposed to amend the Listing Agreement to the effect that in case, the company prefers to give audited results instead of unaudited results for the last quarter of the financial year of the company, then the company shall publish/submit audited results within three months from the last quarter of the financial year.
The memorandum is submitted for the approval of the Board.
