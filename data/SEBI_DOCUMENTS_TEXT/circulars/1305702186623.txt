CIR/CFD/DIL/2/2011 
 
To All Stock Exchanges  
To All Registered Merchant Bankers 
To All Registered Registrars to an Issue 
To All Registered Bankers to an Issue 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub.:  Adjustment  of  differential  pricing  amount  at  the  time  of  application  for 

allotment of specified securities  

 
This refers to the provisions of Regulation 29 of SEBI (Issue of  Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2009  which  provide  for  offer  of  specified  securities  at 
different prices to certain investors.  
 
2.  It has been observed that presently, the effect of such differential pricing, if any, in a 
public issue, is being given to the eligible investors only at the stage of allotment of 
specified securities and not at the time of filing an application for such allotment. This 
takes away certain benefits from the investors such as lower cash outflow at a price 
net of discount, the ability to apply for more shares with the same cash outlay, etc.  

 
3.  In order to address the aforesaid issue, it has been decided to allow investors eligible 
for differential pricing in public issues to make payment at a price net of discount, if 
any, at the time of bidding itself, and in this context, it is clarified that -  

a.  Merchant  Bankers  shall  ensure  that  appropriate  disclosures  are  given  in  the 
offer  document  /  application  forms  to  the  effect  that  investors  eligible  for 
discount  can  make  payment  after  adjusting  the  discount,  if  any.  It  shall  be 
disclosed that such investors shall in the relevant column indicate the bid price 
before adjusting for discount, if any. Further, it shall be clearly disclosed under 
what circumstances application would be liable for rejection in case of errors, if 
any, in this regard. 

b.  For  the  ease  of  calculation  by  investors  eligible  for  differential  pricing,  it  is 
preferable  that  discount,  if  any,  is  stated  in  absolute  rupee  terms  subject  to 
maximum  discount,  as  per  SEBI 
(Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2009, that can be given at the issue price.

c.  Stock  Exchanges  shall  ensure  that  appropriate  provisions  for  discount 
adjustment  are  provided  in  the  bidding  platform.  Whenever  the  net  payment 
(post  discount)  is  more  than  two  lakh  rupees,  the  bidding  system  should  be 
capable of ensuring that such applications are not eligible for discount.  

d.  Syndicate  /Sub  syndicate  members  and  SCSBs  shall  enter  the  bid  price  as 

indicated by the applicant in the price column. 

e.  Segregation  of  Investor  Categories  (i.e.  two  lakh  rupees  for  retail  category), 

shall be based on the net payment amount(after adjusting for discount).  
f.  SCSBs shall carry out the necessary system changes at their end, if any. 

 

4.  Merchant Bankers shall create awareness among the investors eligible for discount on 

account of differential pricing to make payment at price net of discount.  

 
5.  All concerned intermediaries are directed to comply with the instructions contained in 

this circular.  
 

6.  This  circular  shall  be  applicable  on  Red  Herring  Prospectus/Prospectus  filed  with 
Registrar of Companies on or after June 15, 2011. This is to enable changes in the 
systems at Stock Exchanges and SCSBs level.  
 

7.  This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11 read with 
Section  11A  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  read  with 
Regulation 108 of the SEBI(ICDR) Regulations, 2009.  

 
8.  This  circular  is  available  on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  categories
