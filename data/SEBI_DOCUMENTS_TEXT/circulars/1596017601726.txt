Madam / Sir, 

Sub:  Extension  of  time  for  submission  of  financial  results  for  the  quarter/half  year/

1.  SEBI,  vide  circular  No.  SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD1/CIR/P/2020/106  dated  June  24,  2020,  had 

extended the timeline for submission of financial results by listed entities for the quarter / half-

year / financial year ended 31st March 2020 to July 31, 2020 due to the impact of the CoVID-

19 pandemic. 

 

2.  Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 

2015 (‘LODR Regulations’) requires a listed entity to submit its quarterly/half year/annual 

financial  results  within  forty  five  days  or  sixty  days,  as  applicable,  from  the  end  of  each 

quarter/half year/financial year. Accordingly, listed entities are required to submit the financial 

results for the quarter/half year ended June 30, 2020, on or before August 14, 2020.  

 

3.  SEBI has received representations requesting extension of time for submission of financial 

results for the quarter/half year ended June 30, 2020, due to the shortened time gap between 

the extended deadline for submission of financial results for the period ended March 31, 2020 

(31st July) and the quarter/half year ended June 30, 2020 (14th August).   

 

4.  After  consideration,  it  has  been  decided  to  extend  the  timeline  for  submission  of  financial 

results under Regulation 33 of the LODR Regulations, for the quarter/half year/financial year 

ended 30th June 2020, to September 15, 2020.
