Review Report to …………………….  
  
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of _________ 
(Name of the Company) for the period ended ______. This statement is the responsibility of 
the  Company’s  management  and  has  been  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  Our 
responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review.   
  
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagement  (SRE) 
2400,  Engagements  to  Review  Financial  Statements  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
A  review  is  limited  primarily  to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical  procedures 
applied  to  financial  data  and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not 
performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.   
  
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to  believe  that  the  accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  prepared  in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards and other recognised accounting practices 
and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 
52  of  the  Listing  Regulations  including  the  manner  in  which  it  is  to  be  disclosed,  or  that  it 
contains any material misstatement.

Review Report to …………………….  
  
We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  of  ___________ 
(Name  of  the  Company)  for  the  period  ended  ____.  This  statement  is  the  responsibility  of  the 
Company’s Management and has been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to 
issue a report on these financial statements based on our review.   
  
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2400, 
Engagements to Review Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily 
to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical  procedures  applied  to  financial  data  and  thus 
provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion.  
  
In the conduct of our Review we have relied on the review reports in respect of non-performing 
assets received from concurrent auditors of _________ branches, inspection teams of the bank of 
_______ branches and other firms of auditors of _________ branches specifically appointed for 
this purpose. These review reports cover ______ per cent of the advances portfolio of the bank. 
Apart from these review reports, in the conduct of our review, we have also relied upon various 
returns received from the branches of the bank.   
  
Based on our review  conducted as above, nothing has  come to our attention that causes  us  to 
believe that the accompanying  statement of unaudited financial results prepared in  accordance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has 
not  disclosed  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  terms  of  Regulation  52  of  the  Listing 
Regulations  including  the  manner  in  which  it  is  to  be  disclosed,  or  that  it  contains  any  material 
misstatement or that it has not been prepared in accordance with the relevant prudential norms 
issued  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  in  respect  of  income  recognition,  asset  classification, 
provisioning and other related matters."
