1.      Capital Protection Oriented Scheme
In case of Capital Protection Oriented Scheme, the mutual funds shall disclose in the offer document, Key Information Memorandum (KIM) as well as in the advertisements that the scheme offered is “oriented towards protection of capital” and “not with guaranteed returns”. It should also be indicated that the orientation towards protection of the capital originates from the portfolio structure of the scheme and not from any bank guarantee, insurance cover etc. 
The proposed portfolio structure indicated in the offer document and KIM must be rated by a SEBI registered credit rating agency from the view point of assessing the degree of certainty for achieving the objective of capital protection. Moreover, the rating should be reviewed on a quarterly basis.
In this regard, the Trustees should also continuously monitor the structure of the portfolio of the capital protection oriented scheme and should report the same in the half-yearly Trustee Report. The AMC should also report about the same in the bi-monthly Compliance Test Report. 
Further, it should also be ensured that the debt component of the portfolio structure has the highest investment grade rating. 
2.      Revision in Fees payable by Mutual Funds
Regarding filing fees for offer documents it is clarified that the revised filing fee would be applicable to those scheme(s) whose offer document(s) has been filed with SEBI on or after the date of the aforesaid gazette notification. Therefore, the mutual funds which have filed offer document(s) on or after August 3, 2006 are advised to comply with the regulatory provisions to enable SEBI to give its observations on the said scheme offer document(s).
Further, the mutual funds should confirm compliance with the provisions of Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 while filing the New Scheme Report.
This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
