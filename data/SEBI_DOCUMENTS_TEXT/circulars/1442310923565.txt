Dear Sir/Madam, 

Disclosures to be made by NBFCs in the Offer Documents for public issue of

Regulations, 2008.

alia,  prescribed  additional  disclosures  to  be  provided  for  public  issue  of 
debt securities by NBFCs.  
  

2.  Based  on  the  feedback  from  market  participants  on  disclosures  in  offer 
document by NBFCs, after due deliberations, it has been decided to align 
the  disclosures  made  in  the  offer  documents  to  be  in  line  with  the 
stipulations as required by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).   
 

3.  In line with the above, the following modifications are being made to the

4.  NBFCs are frequent issuers of debt securities and amongst other things, 
generally also utilize the issue proceeds for onward lending.  Thus, there 
may  be  a  possibility  that  such  onward  lending  may  be  made  to  such 
persons, which are connected to the NBFCs or are a part of its "Group".  

 
Given  this,  it  is  imperative  that  adequate  disclosures  are  provided  for,  to 
keep  the  investors  informed  with  regards  to  such  onward  lending  to 
"Group" entities.   
 
Therefore, it has been decided that in case any of the borrower(s) of the 
NBFCs  form  part  of  the  "Group"  as  defined  by  RBI,  then  appropriate 
disclosures shall be made in the following format:

5.  Further, in order to allow investors to better assess the NBFC issue, it has 
been  decided  that  the  following  additional  disclosures  shall  be  made  by 
NBFCs in their offer documents: -  

 

 

i.  A  portfolio  summary  with  regards  to  industries/  sectors  to  which 

borrowings have been made by NBFCs.  

ii.  Quantum and percentage of secured vis-à-vis unsecured borrowings 

made by NBFCs.  

iii.  Any change in promoter’s holdings in NBFCs during the last financial 
year  beyond  a  particular  threshold. At  present,  RBI  has  prescribed 
such  a  threshold  level  at  26%.  The  same  threshold  shall  be 
applicable or as may be prescribed by RBI from time to time. 
 

6.  NBFCs may provide disclosures on the basis of the draft template, as far 

as possible, as provided in Annexure I of this Circular. 

7.  The  provisions  of  this  circular  shall  be  applicable  for  the  draft  offer
