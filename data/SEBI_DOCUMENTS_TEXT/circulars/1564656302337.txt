guidelines are issued: 

a.  The  Stock  Exchanges  and  Clearing  Corporations,  in  all  segments,  in 
consultation with one another, shall devise a standard  framework for  imposition 
of  fine  on  the  Trading  Member/  Clearing  Member  for  incorrect/false  reporting 
and non-reporting of margin collected from the clients. 

b.  Considering  the    principle  of  ‘proportionality’,  the  fine  shall  be  charged  to  the 
member based on the materiality of non-compliance done by the member which 
may  include factors such as number of instances, repeated violations, etc. The  
amount of fine  to be charged upon the member may extend to 100%  of such 
false/incorrectly/non reported amount of margin and/or suspension of trading for 
appropriate number of days.
