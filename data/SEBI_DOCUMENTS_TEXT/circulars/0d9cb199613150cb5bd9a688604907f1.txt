To
All Stock Exchanges, Depositories and Custodians
Dear Sir/Madam,
DEPOSITORIES AND CUSTODIANS DIVISION --- CIRCULAR NO. 13
Sub: Mandatory admission of debt instruments on both the Depositories.
It has been observed that debt instruments issued by some of the issuer companies are admitted only on one of the Depositories. The issue of admission of debt instruments on both the Depositories was discussed in the meeting of Working Group on Dematerialisation held on 18th October 2002. It has now been decided that such debt instruments be mandatorily admitted on both the Depositories.
Yours faithfully,  G S REDDY
