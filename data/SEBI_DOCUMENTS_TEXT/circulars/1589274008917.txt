provided certain relaxations for companies, including conducting Extraordinary General Meeting

dispensed with for listed entities who conduct their AGMs during the calendar year 2020 (i.e. till

securities in all cases mentioning that a holder may vote either for or against a resolution. 

6.  The  requirement  under  regulation 44 (4) of  the LODR is  dispensed with temporarily, in  case  of 
meetings held through electronic mode  only. This relaxation is available for listed  entities who 
conduct their AGMs through electronic mode during the calendar year 2020 (i.e. till December 31, 
2020). 

iii.  Requirement of dividend warrants/cheques

obtain their bank account details and use the electronic modes of payment specified in Schedule 
I of the LODR.

8.  SEBI, vide circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD1/CIR/P/2020/48 dated March 26, 2020 had exempted 
publication  of  advertisements  in  newspapers,  as  required  under  regulation  47,  for  all  events 
scheduled  till  May  15,  2020,  since  some  newspapers  had  stopped  their  print  versions  due  to 
CoVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, vide circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD1/CIR/P/2020/63 dated April 
17, 2020, a similar requirement that exists in regulation 52(8) of the LODR Regulations and applies

newspapers,  the  aforesaid  exemptions  from  publication  of  advertisements  in  newspapers  are 
extended for all events scheduled till June 30, 2020.

11. The Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind-AS)) Rules, 2015 stipulate the adoption and 
applicability of Ind-AS in a phased manner beginning from the financial year 2016-17. Currently, 
Ind-AS is applicable to all listed entities with the exception of those in the banking and insurance 
sectors. RBI and IRDA have not yet notified the date of implementation of Ind-AS for banks and 
insurance companies, respectively. 

 
12. SEBI has received representations from listed entities that are banks or insurance companies as 
well  as  those  that  have  banks  and  /  or  insurance  companies  as  subsidiaries,  highlighting  the 
challenges in preparing consolidated financial results under regulation 33(3)(b) in view of different 
accounting standards being followed by companies belonging to same group and the difficulties 
in restating those financials as per IND-AS due to the prevailing circumstances in view of CoVID-
19 pandemic.  

 
13. After considering the representations, the following have been decided: 
 

a)  Listed entities which are banking and / or insurance companies or having subsidiaries which 
are banking and / or insurance companies may submit consolidated financial results under 
regulation 33(3)(b) for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 on a voluntary basis. However, they 
shall continue to submit the standalone financial results as required under regulation 33(3)(a) 
of the LODR. 

 
b)  If such listed entities choose to publish only standalone financial results and not consolidated 

financial results, they shall give reasons for the same.   
 

14. This Circular shall come into force with immediate effect. The Stock Exchanges are advised to 
bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of all listed entities and also disseminate on their 
websites. 
  

15. The Circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the Securities 

and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Regulation 101 of the LODR.
