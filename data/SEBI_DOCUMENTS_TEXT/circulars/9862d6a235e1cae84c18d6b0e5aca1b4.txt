To All registered Debenture Trustees,
 
Dear Sir,
Sub: Amendment to periodical report.
 
 
SEBI has decided that Debenture Trustees would be allowed to associate with privately placed unlisted debt issues. The debenture trustees would be responsible for such issues and are accountable. It is considered necessary to monitor the exposure of SEBI registered debenture trustees in such unlisted debt issues. Accordingly, it has been decided to elicit relevant additional information in this regard in the periodical report submitted by debenture trustees.
 
In view of the above decision, SEBI Circular No. 2(1999-2000) dated April 19, 1999 has been partially amended to incorporate the below mentioned additional information as a last item in the report.
 
 
DETAILS OF ASSOCIATION WITH PRIVATELY PLACED UNLISTED DEBT ISSUES

Name of the Issuer

 

Issue Size

You are therefore advised to take note of the above modification and submit, in future, periodical report in the revised format.
 
This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992, to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
 
Yours faithfully
