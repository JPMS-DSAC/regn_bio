Madam/ Sir, 
 
Sub: Rationalization of process relating to surrender of registration by sub-brokers  
 

1.  Please refer to SEBI Circular MIRSD-DR1/SRP/Cir-43/28408/04 dated December 
15, 2004 regarding, inter-alia, surrender of certificate of registration of sub-brokers.  
 

2.  Considering the present role of sub-broker where he is not permitted to deal with 
funds  and  securities  of  the  investors,  in  consultation  with  the  major  stock 
exchanges and stock brokers’ associations, it has been decided to rationalize the 
procedure for surrender of sub-broker registration, as follows.  
 
(i) 

The  affiliating  stock  broker  shall  issue  a  public  advertisement  in  a  local 
newspaper  with  wide  circulation  where  the  sub-broker’s  place  of  work  is 
situated,  informing  the  investors/general  public  about  the  surrender  of 
registration of his sub-broker and not to deal with such sub-broker.  

 
(ii) 

 
(iii) 

 

changes. 
 

Further,  in  case  of  transition  from  sub  broker  to  Authorized  Person  (AP) 
(where the sub broker surrenders registration while seeking approval as AP) 
with  the  same  stock  broker  and  the  same  stock  exchange,  issue  of 
advertisement in newspaper regarding surrender of sub broker registration 
shall not be required. However, the affiliating stock broker shall furnish an 
undertaking/ confirmation to the stock exchanges at the time of surrender of 
sub broker registration that he has sent communication to the clients of the 
sub broker individually about the surrender of sub brokership and also the 
fact of approval as AP.  

The affiliating stock broker and/or stock exchange shall publish the details of 
sub-brokers whose registration has been surrendered or their new status as 
AP, as the case may be on their respective websites for the information of 
the investors.  

3.  The  aforesaid  SEBI  circular  shall  stand  modified  to  the  extent  of  the  above 

4.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  to  protect  the  interests  of 
investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to  regulate  the 
securities market.
