CIR/IMD/DF/10/2010 
 
 
All Mutual Funds/Asset Management Companies/

Exchanges/NSDL/CDSL/All registered Registrars and Share transfer Agents/AMFI 
 
Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub: Transferability of Mutual Fund units 
 
 

1.  Regulation  37(1)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Fund)  Regulations,  1996  states  that  “a  unit  unless 
otherwise restricted or prohibited under the scheme, shall be freely transferable by act of 
parties or by operation of law.”The spirit and intention of this regulation is not to prohibit 
transferability of units as a general rule or practice.  However, it is noticed that mutual fund 
schemes prohibit transfer on a regular basis instead of on an exceptional basis.  
 

2.  In order to facilitate transferability of units of mutual funds held in one demat account to 
another  demat  account,  it  has  been  decided  that  all  AMCs  shall  clarify  by  way  of  an 
addendum  that  units  of  all  mutual  fund  schemes  held  in  demat  form  shall  be  freely 
transferable  from  the  date  of  the  issue  of  said  addendum  which  shall  be  not  later  than 
October 1, 2010. However, restrictions on transfer of units of ELSS schemes during the 
lock-in period shall continue to be applicable as per the ELSS Guidelines. 
 

3.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under section 11(1) of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of regulation 77 of SEBI 
(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 to protect the interests of Investors in securities and to 
promote the development of and to regulate the securities market.  

 
 
 

 

Yours faithfully,
