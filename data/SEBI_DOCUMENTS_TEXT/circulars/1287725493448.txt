Cir / IMD / DF / 9 / 2010                                                                              August 12, 2010 
 
 
 
All Mutual Funds, Asset Management Companies (AMCs)  
 
 
Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:   Updation of investor related documents 
 
1.  SEBI vide circular No. SEBI/IMD/CIR No.12 /186868 /2009 dated December 11, 2009 
has  inter  alia  advised  mutual  funds  to  confirm  whether  all  the  investor  related 
documents  are  maintained/  available  with  them.  Further  in  case  the  investor  related 
documentation was incomplete, the trustees of the mutual funds were advised not to 
make further payment to such distributors till full compliance/ completion of the steps 
enumerated in the said circular and to send a status to SEBI as and when process is 
completed to satisfaction. 
 

2.  SEBI has not received any confirmation from the trustees of the mutual funds on the 
completion of the process as mandated in the said circular. Thus it appears that all the 
investor related documentation is not available with the AMCs. It has been observed 
that  due  to  such  incomplete  documentation  investors’  rights  to  approach  the  AMCs 
directly  are  restricted  and  investors  are  forced  to  depend  on  the  distributors  for 
executing any financial or non-financial transactions. 

 
3.  In  order  to  ensure  that  investors  have  unrestricted  access  to  AMCs  and  to  enable 
AMCs to provide prompt investor service including execution of investors’ financial or 
non-financial transactions, all mutual funds/ AMCs are directed that: 

  

  All new folios/ accounts shall be opened only after ensuring that all investor related 
documents including account opening documents, PAN, KYC, PoA (if applicable), 
specimen signature are available with AMCs/RTAs and not just with the distributor. 
 

  For  existing  folios,  AMCs  shall  be responsible for updation  of  the  investor  related 
documents including account opening documents, PAN, KYC, PoA (if applicable), 
specimen signature by November 15, 2010. 

 
4.  The  trustees  shall  submit  a  confirmation  after  they  receive  certification  from  an 

Independent auditor on completion of the said process latest by November 22, 2010. 
 

5.  Mutual  Funds/Asset  Management  Companies  shall  comply  with 

the  above 

requirements in letter and spirit.
