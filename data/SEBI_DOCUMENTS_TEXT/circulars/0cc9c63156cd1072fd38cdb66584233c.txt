SR. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
March 1, 1995 NO.SMD/SED/CIR/95/005
 
TO,
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ALL STOCK EXCHANGES
Dear Sir,
Appointment of Compliance officer
SEBI is examining the question of appointing a Compliance Officer for each stock exchange whose function would be to ensure that violations of stock exchange rules and regulations do not remain undetected or unreported. We feel that such an Officer should be identified by the stock exchange from within its own officials and should report any instances of violation directly to the Executive Director.
We would request you to send your suggestions to us in this regard by March 20, 1995 at the latest.
Yours faithfully, sd/-
