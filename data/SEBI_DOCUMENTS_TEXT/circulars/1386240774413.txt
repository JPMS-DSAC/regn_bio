trading  on  NDS-OM.  If  less  than  5  trades  are  executed  in  the  underlying 
bond during the last two hours of trading, then FIMMDA price shall be used 
for final settlement. 

Option-B: 

The final settlement price shall be based on average settlement yield (Ys) 
which  shall  be  the  weighted  average  of  the  yields  of  bonds  in  the 
underlying basket, where weights will be the assigned weight of the bonds 
in  the  underlying  basket.  Ys  will  be  rounded  off  to  4  decimal  digits.  For 
each bond in the basket, yield shall be calculated by determining weighted 
average  yield of the bond based on last two hours of the trading in NDS-
OM.  If  less  than  5  trades  are  executed  in  the  bond  during  the  last  two 
hours  of  trading,  then  FIMMDA  price  shall  be  used  for  determining  the
