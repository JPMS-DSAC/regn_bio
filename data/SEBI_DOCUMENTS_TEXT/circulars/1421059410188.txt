CIRCULAR 

CIR/MRD/DP/02/2015 

 

 

 

 

               January 12, 2015 

To, 

All Stock Exchanges. 

Dear Sir / Madam, 

Subject: Index based market-wide circuit breaker mechanism 

 
SEBI  had  issued  circulars  SMDRPD/Policy/Cir-37/2001  dated  June  28, 
2001  and  CIR/MRD/DP/25/2013  dated  September  03,  2013  advising  stock 
exchanges to implement an index based market wide circuit breaker system to 
bring about a coordinated trading halt in all equity and equity derivative markets 
nationwide  on  10%,  15%  and  20%  movement  either  way  of BSE  SENSEX  or 
NSE NIFTY. 

2.  The  mechanism  implemented  by  the  stock  exchanges  for  ‘Index  based 
market-wide  circuit  breakers’  was  discussed  with  SEBI’s  Technical  Advisory 
Committee (TAC) and Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC). Based on 
the  recommendations  of  TAC  and  SMAC,  it  has  been  decided  to  further 
strengthen the mechanism of index based market-wide circuit breaker as under: 

(a)  NSE  and  BSE  shall  compute  their  market-wide  index  (NIFTY  and 
SENSEX respectively) after every trade in the index constituent stocks and 
shall check for breach of market-wide circuit breaker limits after every such 
computation of the market-wide index.  

(b) 
In  the  event  of  breach  of  market-wide  circuit  breaker  limit,  stock 
exchange shall stop matching of orders in order to bring about a trading halt 
as mandated vide SEBI circular dated June 28, 2001. All unmatched orders 
present in the system shall thereupon be purged by the stock exchange.  

(c)  BSE and NSE shall implement suitable mechanism to ensure that all 
messages  related  to  market-wide  index  circuit  breakers  are  given  higher 
priority over other messages. Further, the systems (including the network) 
for computation of market-wide index, checking for breach of circuit breaker 
limits  and  initiating  message  to  stop  matching  of  executable  order  and 
acceptance of fresh orders, shall not be used for any other purposes.

(d)  BSE and NSE shall include in the scope of their annual system audit a 
review  of  its  index  based market-wide  circuit  breaker mechanism with  the 
view to identify improvements. 

3.  All  other  conditions  shall  be  as  per  SEBI  circular  SMDRPD/Policy/Cir-
37/2001  dated  June  28,  2001  and  SEBI  circular  dated  CIR/MRD/DP/25/2013 
dated September 03, 2013. 

4.  BSE and NSE are directed to make necessary amendments to the relevant 
bye-laws,  rules  and  regulations  and  take  necessary  steps  to  put  in  place 
necessary systems for implementation of the provisions of this circular. All stock 
exchanges are directed to bring provisions of this circular to the notice of their 
stock brokers and also disseminate the same on their website. 

5.  This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 
11  (1)  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  to  protect  the 
interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to 
regulate the securities market. 

Yours faithfully,
