Dear Sir,
Trading and settlement of trades in dematerialised securities
Please refer to our earlier circulars on the subject wherein we have advised the list of scrips for compulsory delivery by all investors in dematerialised form as well as the list of scrips for compulsory dematerialised trading by institutional investors viz., banks, mutual funds, domestic financial institutions, foreign institutional investors and OCB’s.

It has now been decided to add four more scrips namely; Zee Telefilms, Satyam Computers, Pentafour Software and LIC Housing Finance to the list of scrips (annexure ‘A’ to our circular No.SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-38/98 dated December 10, 1998) announced for compulsory delivery in dematerialised form for all investors from April 5, 1999. The revised list is given in annexure ‘A’.
 

Further, effective from May 31, 1999, delivery of shares in dematerialised form is compulsory for all investors in respect of 40 more scrips as given in annexure ‘B’.
 

It has also been decided to add 25 more scrips as given in annexure ‘C’ for compulsory dematerialised trading by institutional investors and OCB’s with effect from April 5, 1999.
 

The following three companies which were included in annexure ‘A’ of circular No. SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-32/98 dated November 9, 1998, for compulsory dematerialised trading by institutional investors and OCB’s from February 15, 1999 are in the process of completing the formalities with the depository for dematerialised trading:
