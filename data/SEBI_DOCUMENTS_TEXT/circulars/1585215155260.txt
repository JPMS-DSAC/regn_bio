SEBI vide circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD/CIR/P/2020/12 dated January 22, 2020 issued the Standard 
Operating   Procedure (SoP) on imposition of fines and other enforcement actions for non-compliances 
with provisions of the LODR, the effective date of operation of which is for compliance periods ending 
on or after March 31, 2020. The said circular dated January 22, 2020 shall now come into force with 
effect from compliance periods ending on or after June 30, 2020. It may be noted that the SoP circular 
dated May 03, 2018 would be applicable till such date. 

D.  Publication of advertisements in the newspapers: 

 

Regulation 47 of the LODR requires publishing, in the newspapers, information such as notice of the 
board meeting, financial results etc. It has been brought to the notice of SEBI that some newspapers 
are not bringing their print versions for a limited period; some newspapers that are still printing are not 
accepting  a  ‘e-copy’  of  the  information  to  be  published  which  acts  as  a  challenge  in  ensuring 
compliance with this regulation. Hence it has been decided to exempt publication of advertisements in 
newspapers as required under regulation 47 for all events scheduled till May 15, 2020.  

 

2.  This  Circular  shall  come into force  with  immediate  effect. The  Stock  Exchanges  are  advised  to 
bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the  notice  of  all  listed  entities  that  have  issued  specified 
securities and their material subsidiaries and also disseminate on their websites.   

  
3.  The Circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with regulations 101 and 102 of the LODR and the 
relaxations contained herein are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules 
made thereunder.  

  
4.  The circular is available on SEBI website at  www.sebi.gov.in  under the category - 'Legal - 

Circulars'.
