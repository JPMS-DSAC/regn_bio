CIR/MRD/DRMNP/ 36 /2012 

 
To  
All stock exchanges. 
 

Sir / Ma’am, 
 

Sub: Requirement of Base Minimum Capital for Stock Broker and Trading 

Member 

 
1.  SEBI  vide  circular  no  SMD/SED/RCG/270/96  dated  January  19,  1996  and 
circular no MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-07/2005 dated February 23, 2005 had prescribed 
the requirement of Base Minimum Capital (BMC) for stock brokers trading on 
stock  exchange.  BMC  is  the  deposit  given  by  the  member  of  the  exchange 
against which no exposure for trades is allowed.  

2.  The  BMC  deposit  requirement  was  prescribed  to  be  commensurate  with  the 
risks, other than market risk, that the broker may bring to the system. Over the 
years the market structure has undergone significant structural changes. The 
various  technological  changes  and  the  increased  speeds  of  trading  have 
brought  to  fore  the  greater  quantum  of  risks  arising  during  the  course  of 
execution  of  transactions.  In  light  of  this,  based  on  deliberations  at  various 
forums,  it  has  been  decided  to  realign  the  BMC  requirements  with  the  risk 
profiles of the stock brokers / trading members in cash / derivative segment of 
the stock exchange.  

3.  Accordingly,  the  requirement  of  BMC  would  be  implemented  in  the  following 

manner –  

a.  It shall be enhanced for members holding registration as “stock-broker” in 

cash segment. 

b.  BMC  shall  be  introduced  for  members  holding  registration  as  “trading 

member” in any derivative segment. 

c.  Stock brokers / trading members shall maintain the prescribed BMC based 

on their profiles –

Explanation: The profiling of members may be explained with the following 
example – A scenario may arise, wherein, a member has registration as a 
“stock broker” as well as a “trading member” and is engaged as a principal 
doing proprietary trading on cash segment and is also engaged as an agent 
and  transacting  only  on  behalf  of  the  clients  in  the  derivatives  segment. 
Further, the member may not have availed facility for algorithmic trading. In 
such a case, the profile of such a member shall be assessed as “Proprietary 
trading  and  trading  on  behalf  of  client  without  Algo”.  The  applicable  BMC 
deposit for such a member shall be ` 25 Lacs. 

d.  This  BMC  deposit  requirement  stipulated  in  the  table  at  3  (c)  above,  is 
applicable  to  all  stock  brokers  /  trading  members  of  exchanges  having 
nation-wide trading terminals.  

e.  For stock brokers / trading members of exchanges not having nation-wide 
trading terminals, the deposit requirement shall be 40% of the above said 
BMC deposit requirements. 

f.  The  BMC  deposit  shall  be  maintained  for  meeting  contingencies  in  any 
segment of the exchange. For members having registration for more than 
one segment of the same exchange, the BMC deposit requirement shall not 
be  additive  for  such  number  of  segments  and  shall  be  the  highest 
applicable BMC deposit, across various segment. 

g.  No  exposure  shall  be  granted  against  such  BMC  deposit.  The  Stock 
Exchanges  shall  be  permitted  to  prescribe  suitable  deposit  requirements, 
over and above the SEBI prescribed norms, based on their perception and 
evaluation of risks involved. 

h.  Minimum  50%  of  the  deposit  shall  be  in  the  form  of  cash  and  cash 
equivalents. The existing guidelines on collateral composition shall continue 
to remain applicable.  

4.  The SEBI circulars specified at para 1 above, stand modified suitably. All other 

relevant provisions shall continue to remain applicable.  

5.  The provisions of this circular shall be implemented by March 31, 2013 

6.  Stock exchanges are directed to: 

(i)  make  necessary  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules  and 

regulations for the implementation of the above decision. 

(ii)  bring  the  provisions  of  this  circular  to  the  notice  of  the  stock  brokers  / 
trading  members  of  the  stock  exchange  and  also  to  disseminate  the
