depositories  with  regard  to  the  inspection  of  depository  participants  (DPs). 
Considering  the  recommendations  of  the  committee,  it  has  been  decided 
that depositories shall ensure the following while inspecting their DPs. 

Inspection Areas and Sample Size 

3.  For  conducting  inspection  of  DPs,  depositories  shall  inspect  the  areas  as 
mentioned  in  Annexure  -  I.  During  inspection,  depositories  shall  cover 
implementation  of  circulars  /  guidelines  issued  by  SEBI  and  guidelines  / 
operating instructions / directions by depositories in respect of these areas. 
In addition, Depositories may include such other areas as felt appropriate. 

4.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  the  size  of  sample,  depositories  shall  be 
guided by 'Adaptive Sample Size determination methodology' as mentioned 
at Annexure - II. 

Categorization / Risk Rating of DPs 

5.  For the purpose of computing total risk score of DPs,  depositories shall be 
guided by “DP Rating Model / Categorization” as mentioned at Annexure – 
III.  

6.  Depositories should periodically undertake risk - impact analysis for each of 
the  inspection  areas,  assign  appropriate  risk  weightage,  calculate  risk 
scores for each DPs in the lines mentioned below.  

a)  Risk  Weightage:    Depositories  shall  assign  risk  weights  for  each  of

3.  Size of Operation 
4.  Repetitive violations 
5.  IT Security and BCP 
6.  Complaints received and redressed

Quantitative  Risk  Score  for  each  inspection  area  by  multiplying 
percentage  of  non-compliance 
the 
corresponding assigned risk weight. 

the  sample  size  with 

to 

 
c)  Qualitative  Score  Calculation:  Depositories  shall  arrive  at  a 
Qualitative  Risk  Score  for  each  qualitative  area  by  multiplying  the  
score  assigned  by  inspection  team  to  DP  with  corresponding 
assigned risk weight.  

 
d)  Total  DP  Risk  Score  shall  be  the  summation  of  quantitative  and 

qualitative scores assigned to the DP. 

 
e)  Depositories shall suitably normalize the scales of the qualitative and 

quantitative scores in arriving at the Total DP risk score.   

 

7.  Depositories shall categorize their DPs as 'High Risk', 'Medium to High Risk', 

'Medium Risk', and 'Low Risk' DPs based on the percentile of risk score.   

 

 

DP Risk Rating / Categorization  Percentile of Risk Score 

High 

Medium-High 

Medium 

Low 

≥ 80

≤ 20 

Other requirements 

8.  After  arriving  at  the  risk  rating  /  categorization  as  mentioned  above,  for 
subsequent  inspections,  depositories  shall  use  the  DP  risk  rating  / 
categorization to decide on the frequency of inspection of DPs. 

9.  Apart  from  the  above,  depositories  may  undertake  specific  purpose 
inspections  for  DPs  which  score  high  in  the  specific  inspection  areas  as 
mentioned at Annexure - I.

10. Depositories  shall  jointly  inspect  DPs  which  are  registered  with  both 
depositories  to  have  better  control  over  DPs,  avoid  duplicity  of  manpower, 
time  and  cost  and  also  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  regulatory  arbitrage,  if 
any. Depositories shall share the risk rating / categorization of common DPs 
with each other. For the purpose of determining sample size and frequency 
of  the  joint  inspection  of  such  common  DPs,  the  higher  risk  categorization 
assigned by any of the Depository shall prevail. 

11. Depositories  shall  put in  place  appropriate  technological  tools  to  undertake 
off-site inspections of DPs in order to reduce time and manpower resources. 
Depositories are directed to: 

a.  take  necessary  steps  and  put  in  place  necessary  systems  for 

implementation of the above.  

b.  make  necessary  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules  and 
regulations  for  the  implementation  of  the  above  decision,  wherever 
applicable.
