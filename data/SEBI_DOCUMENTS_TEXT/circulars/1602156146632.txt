Sir/ Madam, 

 

Sub: Guidelines on Inter Scheme Transfers of Securities 

 

Presently, transfers of securities from one scheme to another scheme in the same mutual fund is 

allowed  only  if  such  transfers  are  done  at  the  prevailing  market  price  for  quoted  instruments  on 

spot basis and  the securities so transferred  are in conformity with the investment objective of the 

scheme to which such transfer has been made. 

 

In order to ensure that such Inter Schemes Transfers (ISTs) of securities are in conformity with the 

above objective, the following additional safeguards have been prescribed: 

 

1.  In  case  of  Close  Ended  Schemes,  IST  purchases  would  be  allowed  within  “three”  business 

days of allotment pursuant to New Fund Offer (NFO) and thereafter, no ISTs shall be permitted 

to/from Close Ended Schemes.  

 

2.  In case of Open Ended Schemes, ISTs may be allowed in the following scenarios: 

 

a)  For  meeting  liquidity  requirement  in  a  scheme  in  case  of  unanticipated  redemption 

pressure: 

AMCs shall have an appropriate Liquidity Risk Management (LRM) Model at scheme level, 

approved  by  trustees,  to  ensure  that  reasonable  liquidity  requirements  are  adequately 

provided for. Recourse to ISTs for managing liquidity will only be taken after the following 

avenues for raising liquidity have been attempted and exhausted:  

 

I.  Use of scheme cash & cash equivalent

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

II.  Use of market borrowing  

III.  Selling of scheme securities in the market 

IV.  After attempting all the above, if there is still a scheme level liquidity deficit, then out of 

the  remaining  securities,  outward  ISTs  of  the  optimal  mix  of  low  duration  paper  with 

highest quality shall be effected.  

 

The  use  of  market  borrowing  before  ISTs  will  be  optional  and  Fund  Manager  may  at  his 

discretion  take  decision  on  borrowing  in  the  best  interest  of  unitholders.  The  option  of 

market borrowing or selling of security as mentioned at para .2.a.II & 2.a.III above may be 

used in any combination and not necessarily in the above order. In case option of market 

borrowing and/or selling of security is not used, the reason for the same shall be recorded 

with evidence.  

 

b)  For Duration/ Issuer/ Sector/ Group rebalancing 

 

 

 

I. 

ISTs shall be allowed only to rebalance the breach of regulatory limit. 

 

II. 

ISTs can be done where any one of duration, issuer, sector and group balancing is 

required in both the transferor and transferee schemes. Different reasons cannot be 

cited for transferor and transferee schemes except in case of transferee schemes is 

being a Credit Risk scheme. 

III. 

In order to guard against  possible mis-use of ISTs in Credit Risk  scheme, trustees 

shall  ensure  to  have  a  mechanism  in  place  to  negatively  impact  the  performance 

incentives  of  Fund  Managers,  Chief  Investment  Officers  (CIOs),  etc.  involved  in 

process of ISTs in Credit Risk scheme, in case the security becomes default grade 

after  the  ISTs  within  a  period  of  one  year.  Such  negative  impact  on  performance 

shall mirror the existing mechanism for performance incentives of the AMC.  

3.  No ISTs of a security shall be allowed, if there is negative news or rumors in the mainstream 

media  or  an  alert  is generated  about  the  security,  based  on  internal credit risk  assessment  in 

terms of clause F of  SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2019/104 dated October 01, 

2019 during the previous four months.

4.  AMC  shall  ensure  that  Compliance  Officer,  Chief  Investment  Officer  and  Fund  Managers  of 

transferor  and  transferee  schemes  have  satisfied  themselves  that  ISTs  undertaken  are  in 

compliance  with  the  regulatory  requirements.  “Template”  (Annexure  –  A)  and  documentary 

evidence in this regard shall be maintained by the AMC for all ISTs. 

 

5.  If  security  gets  downgraded  following  ISTs,  within  a  period  of  four  months,  Fund  Manager  of 

buying  scheme  has  to  provide  detailed  justification  /rationale  to  the  trustees  for  buying  such 

security. 

 

6.  The circular shall be applicable with effect from January 1, 2021. 

 

7.  This  circular  is  issued  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  under  Section  11  (1)  of  the  Securities 

and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the  provisions  of  Regulation  77  of  SEBI 

(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to
