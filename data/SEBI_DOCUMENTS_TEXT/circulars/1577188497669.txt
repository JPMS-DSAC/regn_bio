CIRCULAR 

 

 

CIR/CFD/CMD1/ 168 /2019 

December 24, 2019 

 
To 
 
All Mutual Funds (MFs)/ Asset Management Companies (AMCs)/ 
Trustee Companies/ Boards of Trustees of Mutual Funds 
All Alternative Investment Funds  
 

Subject:  Stewardship  Code  for  all  Mutual  Funds  and  all  categories  of 

AIFs, in relation to their investment in listed equities 

 

1.  The importance of institutional investors in capital markets across the world 

is  increasing  the  world  over;  they  are  expected  to  shoulder  greater 

responsibility towards their clients / beneficiaries by enhancing monitoring 

and  engagement  with  their  investee  companies.  Such  activities  are 

commonly  referred  to as  ‘Stewardship  Responsibilities’  of  the  institutional 

investors and are intended to protect their clients' wealth. Such increased 

engagement is also seen as an important step towards improved corporate 

governance  in  the  investee  companies  and  gives  a  greater  fillip  to  the 

protection of the interest of investors in such companies. 

 

2.  SEBI  has  already  implemented  principles  on  voting  for  Mutual  Funds 

through  Circulars  dated  March  15,  2010  and  March  24,  2014,  which 

prescribed  detailed  mandatory  requirements  for  Mutual  Funds  in  India  to 

disclose their voting policies and actual voting by Mutual Funds on different 

resolutions of investee companies. 

 

3.  SEBI along with Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India 

(IRDAI) and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) 

had  subsequently  examined  a  proposal  for  introducing  stewardship 

principles in India, which was approved by a sub-committee of the Financial 

Stability and Development Council (FSDC-SC).

  Principle 1 

Stewardship Code 

Annex A 

 

Institutional  Investors  should  formulate  a  comprehensive  policy  on  the 
discharge of their stewardship responsibilities, publicly disclose it, review and 
update it periodically. 
 
Guidance 
Stewardship  responsibilities  include  monitoring  and  actively  engaging  with 
investee  companies  on  various  matters  including  performance  (operational, 
financial,  etc.),  strategy,  corporate  governance  (including  board  structure, 
remuneration,  etc.),  material  environmental,  social,  and  governance  (ESG) 
opportunities or risks, capital structure, etc. Such engagement may be through 
detailed  discussions  with  management,  interaction  with  investee  company 
boards, voting in board or shareholders meetings, etc.  
 
Every institutional investor should formulate a comprehensive policy on how it 
intends  to  fulfill  the  aforesaid  stewardship  responsibilities  and  disclose  it 
publicly. In case any of the activities are outsourced, the policy should provide 
for the mechanism to  ensure that in such cases, stewardship responsibilities 
are exercised properly and diligently.  
 
The policy should be reviewed and updated periodically and the updated policy 
should  be  publicly  disclosed  on  the  entity's  website.  A  training  policy  for 
personnel involved on implementation of the principles is crucial and may form 
a part of the policy.  
 
  Principle 2 

Institutional investors should have a clear policy on how they manage conflicts 
of interest in fulfilling their stewardship responsibilities and publicly disclose it. 
 
Guidance 
As a part of the aforesaid comprehensive policy, institutional investors should 
formulate a detailed policy for identifying and managing conflicts of interest. The 
policy shall be intended to ensure that the interest of the client/beneficiary is 
placed  before  the  interest  of  the  entity.  The  policy  should  also  address  how 
matters are handled when the interests of clients or beneficiaries diverge from 
each other.

The conflict of interest policy formulated shall, among other aspects, address 
the following: 
 

1.  Identifying possible situations where conflict of interest may arise. E.g. 

in case of investee companies being associates of the entity.  

2.  Procedures  put  in  place  by  the  entity  in  case  such  conflict  of  interest 

situations arise which may, inter alia, include: 

a.  Blanket bans on investments in certain cases 
b.  Having a  ‘Conflict of Interest’ Committee to which such matters 

may be referred to.   

c.  Clear  segregation  of  voting  function  and  client  relations/  sales 

functions. 

d.  Policy for persons to recuse from decision making in case of the 
person  having  any  actual/  potential  conflict  of  interest  in  the 
transaction.  

e.  Maintenance of records of minutes of decisions taken to address 

such conflicts.  

3.  Periodical review and update of such policy and public disclosure.  

 

  Principle 3 

Institutional investors should monitor their investee companies. 
 
Guidance 
As a part of the aforesaid comprehensive policy, institutional investors should 
have a policy on continuous monitoring of their investee companies in respect 
of all aspects they consider important which  shall include performance of the 
companies, corporate governance, strategy, risks etc. 
 
The  investors  should  identify  the  levels  of  monitoring  for  different  investee 
companies, areas for monitoring, mechanism for monitoring etc. The investors 
may also specifically identify situations where they do not wish to be actively 
involved with the investee companies e.g. in case of small investments.  
 
The  investors  should  also  keep  in  mind  regulations  on  insider  trading  while 
seeking information from the investee companies for the purpose of monitoring.  
 
Accordingly,  the  institutional  investors  shall  formulate  a  policy  on  monitoring 
specifying, inter-alia, the following: 

1.  Different  levels  of  monitoring  in  different  investee  companies.  E.g. 
companies where larger investments are made may involve higher levels 
of monitoring vis-à-vis companies where amount invested in insignificant 
from the point of view of its assets under management.

  Principle 4

companies.  Institutional  investors  should  also  have  a  clear  policy  for 
collaboration with other institutional investors where required, to preserve the 
interests of the ultimate investors, which should be disclosed. 
 
Guidance 
Institutional investors should have a clear policy identifying the circumstances 
for  active  intervention  in  the  investee  companies  and  the  manner  of  such 
intervention.  The  policy  should  also  involve  regular  assessment  of  the 
outcomes of such intervention. Intervention should be considered even when a 
passive investment policy is followed or if the volume of investment is low, if the 
circumstances so demand.  
 
Circumstances

performance  of  the  company,  corporate  governance  related  practices, 
remuneration, strategy, ESG risks, leadership issues, litigation etc.

management for constructive resolution of the issue and in case of escalation 
thereof,  meetings  with  the  boards,  collaboration  with  other  investors,  voting 
against  decisions,  etc.  Various  levels  of  intervention  and  circumstances  in 
which  escalation  is  required  may  be  identified  and  disclosed.  This  may  also 
include 
investor 
associations (E.g. AMFI).  A committee may also be formed to consider which

Guidance 
Institutional investors shall report to their clients/ beneficiaries periodically on 
how they have fulfilled their stewardship responsibilities as per their policy in an 
easy-to-understand format.

conflict  of  interest  policy  may  be  disclosed  on  an  annual  basis.  Any 
updation of policy may be disclosed as and when done.  

2.  The report may also be sent as a part of annual intimation to its clients/ 

beneficiaries.
