Dear Sirs,
Re: Unique Client Code (UCC) for Mutual Fund Schemes/Plans
1. Please refer to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/IMD/CIR No.10/1756/04 dated January 27,2004, on the captioned subject. Under point no. 4 of the said SEBI circular, it has been mentioned inter alia that the secrecy of the UCC shall be maintained by the mutual funds and the same shall be furnished only to the member broker through whom the mutual funds are trading. SEBI has received a request from AMFI that mutual funds should be allowed to share the UCC with their clients (unitholders) for complying with the Income Tax Rules pertaining to claiming of Tax benefit linked to payment of  Securities Transaction Tax (STT).
 
2. In order to facilitate the unitholders to claim the tax benefit associated with payment of STT, it has now been decided to allow mutual funds to share the UCC of their schemes/plans with their unitholders.  
3. All other provisions of the aforesaid Circular dated January 27,2004 remain unchanged.
4. These guidelines are issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.
 
Yours faithfully,
D. Chanda
