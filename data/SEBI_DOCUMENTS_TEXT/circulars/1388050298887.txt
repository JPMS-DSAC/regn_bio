Dear Sir/Madam, 

Sub: Know Your Client Requirements 

1.  Please refer to SEBI circulars no. CIR/MIRSD/16/2011 dated August 22, 2011 and 
MIRSD/SE/Cir-21/2011  dated  October  5,  2011  on  uniform  Know  Your  Client 
(‘KYC’) norms.  
 

2.  Vide  above  mentioned  circulars,  SEBI  simplified  the  account  opening  process for 
the  investors.  A  standard  Account  Opening  Form  (AOF)  has  been  prescribed 
which  is  divided  in  2  parts  -  Part  I  contains  the  basic  KYC  details  of  the  investor 
used  by  all  SEBI  registered  intermediaries  and  Part  II  captures  additional 
information  specific  to  the  area  of  activity  of  the  intermediary.  Further,  with  the 
centralised KRA system in place, the client has to undertake the KYC process i.e. 
Part I of the AOF only once which means he need not undergo the KYC process 
again when he approaches different intermediaries in securities markets.  
 

3.  It  has  now  been  decided  in  consultation  with  various  market  participants  to  shift 
certain information in Section C of Part I to Part II of the AOF (for both individuals 
and non-individuals). Revised Part I of AOF is enclosed. Part II shall be modified 
by the intermediary accordingly.  
 

4.  Information  as  contained  in  revised  Part  I  of  AOF  shall  only  be  required  to  be 
captured in the systems of KRAs from the date of this circular. However, in view of 
existing  pre-printed  forms  available  with  the  intermediaries,  a  time  period  of  six 
months,  effective  from  the  date  of  this  circular,  is  provided  to  bring  about  the 
aforementioned modifications in the KYC form. 
 

5.  The  above  modifications  would  assist  in  avoiding  repeated  modifications  in  the 
KRA  system  as  information  provided  by  the  clients  in  Section  C  changes  over  a 
period of time and will facilitate in making the KYC uniform for the entire financial 
sector.
