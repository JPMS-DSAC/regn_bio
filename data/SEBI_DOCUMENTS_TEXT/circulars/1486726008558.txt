Dear Sir/Madam,  
 
 

Sub: Review of Financial close out and Auction framework for corporate 

bonds traded on the Stock exchanges platform.   

 
1.  SEBI  vide  circulars  no.  CIR/MRD/DP/03/2013  January  24,  2013,  and  no  

CIR/MRD/DP/  27  /2013  dated  September  12,  2013  issued  guidelines  for 

providing  dedicated  debt  segment  in  the  stock  exchange  for  trading,  clearing 

and settlement  of  debt securities including  trading, clearing and settlement of 

corporate bonds.  

 

2.  Report of the Working Group on Development of Corporate Bond Market in India 

chaired  by  Shri  H  R  Khan  recommended  rationalization  of  the  penalty  for 

financial close out in case of the shortage of delivery in the corporate bonds that 

are traded in the exchange platform. Based on the recommendation of the said 

committee  and  the  feedback  received  from  stock  exchanges,  it  has  been 

decided to review extant penalty structure for financial closeout in cases of short 

delivery and to put in place a feasible auction mechanism to deal with settlement 

shortages.

12, 2013 stands modified as under;  

 

3.1. In case of shortage of delivery, stock exchanges/clearing corporations may 

conduct  financial  close-out.  The  financial  close  out  shall  take  place  at

highest  price  on  Trade  date  (which  becomes  the  trade  price)  with  a  1%

mechanism to deal with settlement shortages by March 31, 2017.     

 

4.  Stock Exchanges are directed to:  

 

4.1. take  necessary  steps  and  put 

in  place  necessary  systems 

for 

implementation of this circular immediately; 

4.2. make  necessary  amendments  to  the  relevant  bye-laws,  rules  and 

regulations for the implementation of the above decision;  

4.3. bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the member brokers of
