Dear Sir/ Madam 

 

Sub: SARAL Account Opening Form for resident individuals 

 

1.  It  is  gathered  that  a  majority  of  new  investors  in  the  securities  market  begin  with 
participation in the cash segment without obtaining various other facilities such as 
internet trading, margin trading, derivative trading and use of power of attorney.  
 

2.  The account opening process can be simplified for such individual investors. With 
a view to encourage their participation, it is, therefore, decided that such individual 
investors can open a trading account and demat  account by filling up a simplified 
Account Opening Form ('AOF') termed as 'SARAL AOF' given at Annexure A. This 
form  will  be  separately  available  with  the  intermediaries  and  can  also  be 
downloaded  from  the  Exchanges'  and  Depositories'  website.  The  investors  who 
open  account  through  SARAL  AOF  will  also  have  the  option  to  obtain  other 
facilities,  whenever  they  require,  on  furnishing  of  additional  information  as  per 
prescribed regulations/circulars. 
 

3.  The  standard  set  of  documents  viz.  Rights  and  Obligations  document,  Uniform 
Risk  Disclosure  Document  and  Guidance  Note  and  documentary  proof  related  to 
identity  and  address  as  specified  in  SEBI  Circulars  dated  August  22,  2011  and 
October  5,  2011  shall  continue  to  remain  applicable.  It  is further  clarified  that  the 
provisions laid down under the PML Act, PML Rules, SEBI Master Circular on AML 
dated December 31, 2010 and SEBI Circular on AML dated March 12, 2014 shall 
also  continue  to  remain  applicable  for  set  of  individual  investors  mentioned  in 
paragraph 2 above.  
 

4.  For  these  set  of  individual  investors,  it  has  been  decided  to  simplify  the 
requirement of submission of ‘proof of address’. The matter has been examined in 
the light of amendment to the PML Rules, 2005 and accordingly, the requirement 
of submission of ‘proof of address’ is as follows:  

a.  Henceforth,  individual  investor  may  submit  only  one  documentary  proof  of 
address  (either  residence/correspondence  or  permanent)  while  opening  a 
trading account and / or demat account or while undergoing updation.

b.  In  case  the  proof  of  address  furnished  by  the  said  investor  is  not  the  address 
where the investor is currently residing, the intermediary may take a declaration 
of  the  residence/correspondence  address  on  which  all  correspondence  will  be 
made by the intermediary with the investor. No proof is required to be submitted 
for  such  correspondence/residence    address.  In  the  event  of  change  in  this 
address  due  to  relocation  or  any  other  reason,  investor  may  intimate  the  new 
address  for  correspondence  to  the  intermediary  within  two  weeks  of  such  a 
change. The residence/ correspondence address and any such change thereof 
may  be  verified  by  the  intermediary  through  ‘positive  confirmation’  such  as  (i) 
acknowledgment  of  receipt  Welcome  Kit/  dispatch  of  contract  notes  /  any 
periodical statement, etc. (ii) telephonic conversation; (iii) visits, etc.  

5.  This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.
