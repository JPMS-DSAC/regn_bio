Dear Sirs,
 
Re: Applicability of Investment Restrictions for Securitised Debt 
This has reference to the e-mail dated February 25, 2005 on the captioned matter.
The applicability of restrictions on investments in Debt Securities including securitised debt are specified under Clause 1 of Schedule VII to the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.
It is now clarified that for investments made in securitised debt (mortgage backed securities/asset backed securities) restrictions at the originator level would not be applicable.
This circular is issued under Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. 
Yours faithfully,
D. Chanda
