Subject: Review of advertisement guidelines for Mutual Funds 

 

A.  Disclosing Performance related information in Mutual Fund advertisements 

Please  refer  to  Clause  C  of  SEBI  circular  dated  August  22,  2011  on  transparency  of 

performance  related  information  in  advertisements  of  Mutual  Fund  schemes.  With  an 

objective  to  disclose  Mutual  Fund  scheme’s  performance  related  information  in  a  more 

effective and simple manner in advertisements, it has been decided that: 

1.  Performance  of  Mutual  Fund  schemes  shall  be  required  to  be  advertised  in  terms  of 

CAGR  for  the  past  1  year,  3  years,  5  years  and  since  inception;  in  place  of  current 

requirement to publish scheme’s returns for as many twelve month periods as possible 

for the past 3 years. 

 

2.  Performance advertisement of Mutual Fund schemes should provide information based 

on  period  computed  from  last  day  of  month-end  preceding  the  date  of  advertisement, 

instead  of  current  requirement  of  publishing  such  information  based  on  last  day  of 

preceding quarter-end. 

 

3.  Performance of other schemes managed by the fund manager shall be disclosed in  a 

summarized manner, by providing performance of such other schemes managed by the 

concerned fund manager in terms of CAGR for the past of 1 year, 3 years and 5 years 

along-with the respective scheme’s benchmark. Further, for advertisement published in 

internet-enabled  media,  Mutual  Funds  shall  be  permitted  to  provide  an  exact  website 

link to such summarized information on performance of other schemes managed by the 

concerned fund manager.
