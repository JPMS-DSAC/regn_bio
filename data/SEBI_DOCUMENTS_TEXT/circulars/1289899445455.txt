The Managing Director / Administrator 
Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sirs, 

 

 
 
SEBI/IMD/BOND/1/2009/11/05   
May 11, 2009 

Sub:  Simplified Listing Agreement for Debt Securities 
 
I. 

In order to develop the primary market for corporate bonds in India, SEBI has 
notified the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Debt 
Securities)  Regulations,  2008.  The  regulations  provide 
for  a  simplified 
regulatory framework for issuance and listing of non-convertible debt securities 
by any issuer company, public sector undertaking or statutory corporation.  

 
II.  Continuing with rationalization of disclosure norms for listing of debt issuances, 
it  has  been  decided  to  put  in  place  a  simplified  Listing  Agreement  for  debt 
securities.  This  agreement,  which  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  the 
Bombay  Stock  Exchange  Limited  (BSE)  and  the  National  Stock  Exchange  of 
India Limited (NSE), is based on the following principles: 

 

 

1.  Where the equity of an issuer is listed, and such an issuer seeks listing of 
debt securities (whether by way of a public issue or a private placement), 
minimal incremental disclosures related to the debt security issuance would 
be sufficient, since large amount of information is already in public domain 
and  material  developments  are  disclosed  under 
the  equity  Listing 
Agreement on a nearly continuous basis. 

2.  Where the equity of an issuer is not listed, and such an issuer seeks listing 
of  debt  securities  (whether  issued  by  way  of  a  public  issue  or  a  private 
placement), detailed disclosures, fewer than those made under the equity 
Listing Agreement, would need to be made.  

 
III.  The  Listing  Agreement  for  debt  securities  as  set  out  at  Annexure  consists  of 
two  parts.  The  first  part  prescribes  only  incremental  disclosures  which  are 
relevant for debt securities of such issuers whose equity shares are listed on the 
Exchange. The second part, which is applicable to issuers whose equity shares 
are  not  listed  on  the  Exchange,  prescribes  detailed  disclosures.  During  the 
currency  of  listing  of  equity  shares,  the  issuer  shall  comply  with  provisions  in 
Part A. In all other cases, the Issuer shall comply with provisions in Part B.

IV.  Applicability  
 

The Listing Agreement for debt securities shall come into force with immediate 
effect  for  all  ‘debt  securities’,  as  defined  under  regulation  2(1)(e)  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) 
Regulations, 2008, seeking listing on the Stock Exchange. 

 
V.  Pursuant to this issue of circular and SEBI Circulars numbered SEBI/CFD/DIL/ 
BOND/1/2006/12/12 dated December 12, 2006, SEBI/CBM/BOND/1/2007/02/03

Notwithstanding such supersession, any action taken or purported to have been

issued in respect of the said guidelines shall be deemed to have been done or 
taken under the corresponding provisions of the circulars in force. 
 

VI.  Direction to Stock Exchanges

Review Report to ……………………. 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of _________ 
(Name of the Company) for the period ended ______. This statement is the responsibility of 
the Company’s management and has been approved by the Board of Directors/ committee of 
Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based 
on our review.  
 
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagement  (SRE) 
2400,  Engagements  to  Review  Financial  Statements  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
A  review  is  limited  primarily  to  inquiries  of  company  personnel  and  analytical  procedures 
applied  to  financial  data  and  thus  provides  less  assurance  than  an  audit.  We  have  not 
performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to  believe  that  the  accompanying  statement  of  unaudited  financial  results  prepared  in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards1 and other recognised accounting practices 
and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Clause 29 
of the Listing Agreement for debt securities including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement.

teams of the bank of _______ branches and other firms of auditors of _________ branches 
specifically appointed for this purpose.  These  review reports cover ______ per cent. of the 
advances portfolio of the bank. Apart from these review reports, in the conduct of our review, 
we have also relied upon various returns received from the branches of the bank.  
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us
