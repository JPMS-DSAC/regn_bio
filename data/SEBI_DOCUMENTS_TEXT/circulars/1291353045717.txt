the combined offering of NCDs with warrants or to the individual instruments, 

i.e.,  either  NCDs  or  warrants,  where  separate  books  are  run  for  NCDs/ 

warrants. 

 

The company is however required to obtain relaxation from the applicability of 

the  provisions  of  Rule  19(2)(b),  read  with  Rule  19(4)  of  the  Securities 

Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 for listing/ trading of the warrants.
