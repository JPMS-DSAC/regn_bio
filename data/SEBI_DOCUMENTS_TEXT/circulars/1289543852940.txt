September 3, 2009 

To, 
All Registered Merchant Bankers 
All Recognized Stock Exchanges 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub.:  Notification of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital 

and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 

 
1.  SEBI (hereinafter referred to as “the Board”) has been empowered in terms of 
section  11A(1)(a)  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) to specify by regulations, for the protection 
of investors, the matters relating to issue of capital, the manner in which such 
matters shall be disclosed and other matters incidental thereto.  

 
2.  Accordingly, in exercise of powers conferred by section 30 of the Act, the Board 
has  framed  the  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulations,  2009  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  ICDR  Regulations”),  which 
have been notified on August 26, 2009. 

  
3. 

The  ICDR  Regulations  have  been  made  primarily  by  conversion  of  the  SEBI 
(Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000  (since  rescinded) 
(hereinafter referred to as “the rescinded Guidelines”).  

 
4.  While  incorporating  the  provisions  of  the  rescinded  Guidelines  into  the  ICDR 
Regulations,  certain  changes  have  been  made  by  removing  the  redundant 
provisions,  modifying  certain  provisions  on  account  of  changes  necessitated 

 

2 

due  to  market  design  and  bringing  more  clarity  to  the  provisions  of  the 
rescinded Guidelines. The significant changes are listed in Annexure I to this 
circular for easy reference. Merchant bankers are, however, advised to refer to 
the  exact  provisions  of  the  ICDR  regulations  for  doing  due  diligence  and 
ensuring compliance with the ICDR regulations.  

 
5.  Merchant  Bankers  are  also  advised  to  continue  to  comply  with  the  following 
instruction circulars, contents of which do not form part of the ICDR Regulations 
and  shall  therefore  continue  to  remain  in  force.  In  this  context,  merchant 
bankers  are  advised  to  note  that  any  reference  to  the  provisions  of  the 
rescinded Guidelines in these circulars shall be deemed to be a reference to the 
corresponding provisions of the ICDR Regulations.

The rescinded Guidelines contained certain provisions pertaining to regulation 
of  the  activities  of  merchant  bankers,  debenture  trustees  and  registrars  to  an 
issue.  These  provisions  have  now  been  incorporated  in  the  respective 
regulations, through Schedule XX of the ICDR Regulations. 

The rescinded Guidelines also contained a provision relating to compliance of 
listing conditions by a listed issuer. A circular of even date has been issued to 
all recognised stock exchanges for amending their equity listing agreements. 

Further,  the  SEBI  (Employee  Stock  Option  Scheme  and  Employee  Stock 
Purchase  Scheme)  Guidelines,  1999  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  SEBI 
(ESOS  and  ESPS)  Guidelines”)  contained  certain  provisions  which  were 
required  to  be  complied  with  by  an  unlisted  issuer  at  the  time  of  making  an 
initial  public  offer.  These  provisions  have  now  been  incorporated  in  the  ICDR 
Regulations  and  consequently  removed  from  the  SEBI  (ESOS  and  ESPS) 
Guidelines, through issuance of a circular of even date. 

In  terms  of  regulation  111  of  the  ICDR  Regulations,  any  offer  document, 
whether  draft  or  otherwise,  filed  under  the  rescinded  Guidelines  and  pending 
before  the  Board  or  any  observation  made  in  respect  of  any  offer  document, 
draft or otherwise, filed in respect of the rescinded Guidelines shall be deemed 
to  have  been  filed  or  made  under  the  corresponding  provisions  of  the  ICDR

Regulations. In this context, merchant bankers are advised to be guided by the 
contents of Annexure II to this circular.  

 
10.  This  circular  and  the  text  of  the  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2009, as notified on August 26, 2009 are available 
on  SEBI  website  at  www.sebi.gov.in  under  the  categories  “Legal  Framework” 
and “Issues and Listing”. 

 
Yours faithfully,
