Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:   Disclosure of investor complaints with respect to Mutual Funds  
 
1. 

SEBI has received feedback from investors and Investors’ Associations to improve 
transparency  in  the  ‘grievance  redressal  mechanism’.  Based  on  the  same, 
transparency in ‘grievance redressal’ is identified as a key area to augment investor 
protection. It is envisaged that transparency will also improve the general functioning 
of the market by providing investors the wherewithal to make an informed choice. 

Accordingly,  it  has  been  decided  that  Mutual  Funds  shall  henceforth  disclose  on 
their  websites,  on  the  AMFI  website  as  well  as  in  their  Annual  Reports,  details  of 
investor complaints received  by them from all sources. The said details should be 
vetted and signed off by the Trustees of the concerned Mutual Fund. 

The format for the aforesaid disclosure is given as Annexure to this Circular. 

The Mutual Funds are accordingly advised to : 

a.  Upload the report for the year 2009-10 by June 30, 2010. 
b.  Upload the report for the following financial years within 2 months of the close 

of the financial year. 

c.  Include  the  report  in  their  annual  reports,  as  part  of  the  Report  of  the 

Trustees, beginning with the annual report for the year 2009-10. 

   This Circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of 
Regulation 77 of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to protect the interests
