the award amount to the member/ depository participant as directed in the IGRP/

of  redressal  mechanism  within  the  timelines  prescribed  by  SEBI  or  file  an

Arbitration  and  Conciliation  Act,  1996  (in  case  of  aggrieved  by  arbitration/ 
appellate award). 

E.  Empanelment of  arbitrators and segregation of arbitration  and appellate 

arbitration panel

expenses attributable to a client over and above the fee structure specified in
