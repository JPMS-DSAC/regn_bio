Order under Section 8 of the SCRA Act

SO/573(E) dated July 3, 1992 issued under 29 A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as " the Board") had through its communication dated August 19, 1992 consulted the stock exchanges on certain specific issues relating to the reconstitution of the governing bodies of the stock exchanges (hereinafter referred to as "governing bodies"), the appointment of Executive Directors including the constitution of disciplinary, arbitration and default committees of the stock exchanges; AND
2. After taking into account, the views expressed by several stock exchanges, the Board by its communication dated November 20, 1992 advised all the stock exchanges to take steps to amend their Rules or Articles of Association; AND
3. In response to the said communication dated November 20, 1992, while several stock exchanges have expressed their willingness to carry out the amendments to their respective Rules and Articles of Association, others have either suggested modifications or opposed or shown reluctance to carry out such amendments; AND
4. By a further communication dated January 1, 1993 the Board had proposed specific terms of office for President and Vice-President of the Stock Exchanges, AND
5. The Board has since considered various proposals in the light of further suggestions received from the stock exchanges pursuant to above mentioned communications and it is of the opinion that in interest of the investors and the capital market as also in the public interest , it is necessary and expedient to amend the Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, of the stock exchanges in the manner indicated in this Order for the following reasons namely :
(i) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to effectively and promptly implement the directives issued by the Central Government;
(ii) Some governing bodies have shown reluctance or indifference or have failed to take adequate steps for the appointment of Executive Director;
(iii) The disciplinary, arbitration and default committees as constituted at present have failed to take quick, effective or timely action against erring brokers;
(iv) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to enforce the Articles of Association, Rules, Regulations and Bye-laws of the stock exchanges;
(v) It is a matter of common knowledge that when some members get elected on the governing board including as President or Vice-President or as members for several years they get into a position whereby they can exert excessive influence in the affairs of the stock exchange which is not desirable in the public interest;
(vi) There is a need to broad base the membership of the governing bodies, and make them fully representative of various interests in the securities market in order to ensure that the affairs of the stock exchanges are conducted on healthy lines with the highest standards of professional conduct, business ethics and morality to inspire and sustain the confidence of the investing public.
