SEBI vide circular No. SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 5/126096/08 dated May 23, 2008 has 
simplified the formats for Offer Document and Key Information Memorandum of 
Mutual  Funds  Scheme.  The  simplified  Scheme  Information  Document  format 
provides that “Wherever quantitative discounts are involved the following shall be 
disclosed – The Mutual Fund may charge the load within the stipulated limit of 
7% and without any discrimination to any specific group of unit holders. However, 
any change at a later stage shall not affect the existing unit holders adversely” 

It  is  observed  that  the  mutual  funds  are  making  distinction  between  the  unit 
holders by charging differential exit loads based on the amount of subscription. In 
order to have parity among all classes of unit holders, it has now been decided 
that no distinction among unit holders should be made based on the amount of 
subscription while charging exit loads. 
 

This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  read  with  the  provisions  of 
Regulation  77  of  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  to  protect  the 
interests  of  investors  in  securities  and  to  promote  the  development  of,  and  to 
regulate the securities market. 

  

  
Yours faithfully,
