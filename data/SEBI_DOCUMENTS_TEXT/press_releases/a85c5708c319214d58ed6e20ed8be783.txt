PR No.:  
49/2014


 
1. Consequent upon approval of the proposals for revision in regulatory fees, by the SEBI Board in its meeting held on March 20, 2014, the SEBI (Payment of Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 2014 has been notified on May 23, 2014.
2. The revised fees structure is essentially to help in strengthening the investor awareness and education measures, enlarging reach among investors / potential investors through regional and new local offices, enhancing focus on capacity building and raising standards of supervision and enforcement function in the market place such as strengthening market surveillance and investigation function.
3. It has been notified that fees for mutual funds, stock exchanges, brokers as also for the listed and to-be-listed companies for filing of offer documents, rights issues and takeover has been revised. While revising the fees, care has been taken to ensure that the impact on retail investors is minimal.  For example, for a cash market transaction of Rupees One crores the fees has been enhanced from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 i.e. the total cost for the investors for such a transaction will change from Rs. 33,330 to Rs. 33,340. The fee collected by SEBI will be only 6 basis point of such cost of transaction. As in the past SEBI will be periodically reviewing its fees structure downward or upward as the need arise.
 
4. The details of the revised fees is available on SEBI website https://www.sebi.gov.in.
