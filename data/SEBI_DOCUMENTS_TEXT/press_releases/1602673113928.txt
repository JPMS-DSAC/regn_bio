Caution to Investors against unsolicited investment tips 

 

It  has  come  to  the  notice  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  that 

unsolicited  messages  containing  stock  tips/  investment  advice  with  respect  to  listed 

companies are increasingly being circulated through bulk SMS, websites and social media 

platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram,etc. Such messages are sent to investors and  general 

public  usually  recommending  to  deal  in  specific  stocks  of  listed  companies,  indicating 

target  prices  and  giving  fraudulent,  misleading/false  information  relating  to  listed 

companies, inducing  them to deal in these stocks.  

 

The circulation of such misleading messages is not only detrimental to the interest of the 

investors but also adversely affects the integrity of the securities market. 

 

All  investors  and  the  general  public  are  hereby  advised/cautioned  not  to  rely  on  such 

unsolicited stock tips / investment advice circulated through bulk SMS, websites and social 

media platforms. Investors are further advised  to exercise appropriate due diligence before 

dealing in the securities market.
