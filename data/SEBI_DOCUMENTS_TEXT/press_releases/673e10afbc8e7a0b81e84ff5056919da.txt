PRESS RELEASE
July 26, 2004 PR No.170/2004

Moratorium on operations of GTB declared by RBI
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has reviewed with Stock Exchanges and the Depositories the likely implications of the moratorium imposed on Global Trust Bank Ltd. (GTB) for the securities market and has taken appropriate precautionary steps. GTB is a clearing bank only for BSE. It has been ascertained from BSE that pay-in amount made through GTB as clearing bank of BSE has been only by a few members and the amount involved is not significant. Further, these members have made necessary alternative arrangements. NSE and BSE have also informed that the amount of bank guarantees and Fixed Deposits of GTB furnished by members towards their base minimum capital/ additional capital is moderate and the relevant exposure not covered by other collaterals is also not much as to create any adverse impact and there will not be any need to deactivate trading terminals of any member. Thus no payment/ settlement related problems are anticipated.   Broker Members have been given time to replace bank guarantees and Fixed Deposits of GTB by that of other banks.
GTB also is a depository participant of both NSDL and CDSL. In terms of clarification of RBI, operation of demat account will not be affected in any way by the order of moratorium.
The behaviour of trading in the scrip of GTB would be closely watched by the Stock Exchanges and appropriate surveillance action will be taken.
Any price manipulation in the scrip of GTB or any manipulative operations in the Demat accounts will invite severe regulatory action.
