Sub: Reduction in the size of derivative contract close to but not less than Rs. 2 lakh

 
It has been noticed that in several derivative contracts the value has exceeded Rs. 2 lakh. In such cases it has been decided to reduce the value of the contract to close to but not less than Rs. 2 lakh by using an appropriate lot size / multiplier which could be half or 50%. The exchanges could determine any other lot size / multipliers to keep the contract size of derivatives close to Rs. 2 lakh, but in any case not less than Rs. 2 lakh.
 
A detailed circular will be issued to the exchanges shortly. The exchanges would be able to reduce the contract size of a derivative contract by submitting a detailed proposal to SEBI and after giving at least two weeks prior notice to the market.
