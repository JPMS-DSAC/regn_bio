The National Centre for Financial Education, at the behest of the Technical Group of the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy, has appointed Mott MacDonald India, a global management and development consultancy organisation, to carry out a nationwide baseline survey i.e. NCFE-Financial Literacy and Inclusion Survey (NCFE-FLIS) for assessing the state of financial literacy and financial inclusion.
This study covering approximately 75000 people across 35 states and UTs, would not only assess the present state of financial literacy and financial inclusion, but also yield benchmarks of core financial literacy and financial inclusion indicators at various socio-economic sub group levels and measure its rate of change on a continual basis to assess the efficacy of various financial education interventions including those under NCFE. This study would also provide comparative analysis of states/ UTs and help evaluate India’s standing at global level.
This study is very important for the purpose of research to understand and improve delivery of financial education which in turn will lead to a higher level of financial literacy and financial inclusion in India.
This study is scheduled to be completed by August 2014.
