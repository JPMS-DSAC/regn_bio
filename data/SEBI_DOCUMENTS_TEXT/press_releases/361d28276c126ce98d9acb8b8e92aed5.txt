FII investments in debt
Following the Government of India’s announcement of enhanced debt limit from US$ 3 billion to US$ 6 billion for investments by FIIs in corporate debt, SEBI has issued Circular No. IMD/FII & C/ 33 /2007 dated October 16, 2008 to the custodians inviting requests for debt allocation.
Further in order to accord flexibility to the FIIs to allocate the investments across equity and debt, it has been decided to do away with the conditions provided in regulation 15(2) of SEBI FII regulations pertaining to restrictions of 70:30  ratio of investment in equity and debt respectively, with immediate effect.
