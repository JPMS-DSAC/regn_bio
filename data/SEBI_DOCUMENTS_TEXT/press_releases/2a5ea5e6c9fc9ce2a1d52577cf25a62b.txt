PRESS RELEASE
PR No.239/2008 
 
Consolidation of holdings under Takeover Regulations 
SEBI Board has decided that henceforth consolidation through creeping acquisition upto 5% be allowed to persons holding 55% and above but below 75%, subject to the condition that such acquisition can only be via open market purchases in the normal segment, and for the purpose, no consolidation via bulk/ block/ negotiated deal or through preferential allotment would be permitted.
Further, hitherto for any increase in the holding of promoters pursuant to buy back, exemption under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations was required to be sought. It has now been decided to automatically exempt increase/ consolidation upto 5% per annum as a result of buy back by a company.
Necessary amendments to SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations are being carried out separately.
