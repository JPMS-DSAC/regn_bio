The order was passed by Shri T. M. Nagarajan, Whole Time Member, SEBI on June 15, 2004.
This order confirmed an earlier interim order dated January 15, 2004 passed by the Member in respect of the matter involving preferential allotment of 93 lakhs shares by the company. SEBI investigation brought out that the company had not received complete consideration in respect of the allotment and funds were re-circulated between the company and preferential allotee / associated entities. This resulted in violation of SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 and the SEBI Act.
This order shall come into force with immediate effect. The detailed order dated June 15, 2004 has been posted at SEBI’s website (www.sebi.gov.in).
