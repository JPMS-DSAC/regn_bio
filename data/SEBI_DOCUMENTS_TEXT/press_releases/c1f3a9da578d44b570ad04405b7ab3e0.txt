Independent Equity Research Reports on listed companies made available on Stock Exchange websites
 
In a meeting of SEBI recognized Investors’ Associations held on February 11, 2010, it was decided that independent equity research coverage on 20 listed companies each, for which research reports were not available hitherto, would be made available by Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) on their websites by July 30, 2010 for the benefit of investors. Accordingly, both the exchanges have since made available on their respective websites, the first set of research reports. Further, exchanges have agreed to jointly frame the criteria for selection of further companies for such research coverage in future.
