In the matter of proposed acquisition of shares of Oswal Spinning & Weaving Mills Ltd.: Grant of exemption under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 {Regulations}
Smt. Satya Rani Oswal, Smt. Taru Oswal, Smt. Karuna Oswal, M/s Ashok Oswal & Sons, (HUF), M/s Satish Oswal & Sons, Oswal Cottex Exports Ltd., Anant Portfolio Pvt. Ltd., Sidhant Investment Pvt. Ltd. and Oswal Industries Pvt. Ltd. (acquirers) propose to acquire 20,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each of the equity capital of Oswal Spinning and Weaving Mills Limited (OSWML).
An application was made to SEBI seeking exemption from making open offer to the shareholders of OSWML as required in terms of the provisions of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997. It was stated that the entire networth of OSWML had been eroded and the company had been declared as sick industrial company by BIFR. The proposed allotment of shares to the acquirers in pursuance to a package approved by financial institutions and banks under corporate debt restructuring mechanism is for the purpose of revival of the company and would not therefore adversely affect the interest of minority shareholders.
The said application was considered by the Takeover Panel which recommended the grant of exemption.
SEBI in terms of Regulation 4(6) of the Regulations has passed an order dated 12.05.2004, granting exemption, to the acquirers from complying with the provisions of Regulations 10 of the Takeover Regulations with regard to the proposed acquisition of shares of OSWML.
The full text of the Order is available on the SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in
