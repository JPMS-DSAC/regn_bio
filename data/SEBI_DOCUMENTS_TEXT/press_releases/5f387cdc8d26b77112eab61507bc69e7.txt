Safal Investments; (11) Shri Gaje Singh Chahl and (12) Shri Arun Goyal. from buying, selling and dealing in the securities market for a period of three years for their involvement in price manipulation in the shares of Warner Multimedia Ltd.  It was observed that the company had deliberately delayed dematerialisation of shares held by common shareholders with a view to create artificial scarcity and thereby manipulate the price of the shares.
