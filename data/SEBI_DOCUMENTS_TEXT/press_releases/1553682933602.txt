The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions: 

 

I.  Consultation Paper on Self Regulatory Organizations in Securities Market 

The Board approved the proposal for undertaking a public consultation process to 

amend  the  SEBI  (Self  Regulatory  Organizations)  Regulations,  2004  with  an 

objective  of  defining  SRO,  rationalising 

the  process  of  recognition  and 

strengthening the role of Self Regulatory Organizations in the securities market.    

II.  Amendments  to  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 

Regulations, 2015  â€“ payment relating to royalty and brand usage 

As  per  Regulation  23(1A)  of  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 

Requirements)  Regulations,  payments  made  to  related  parties  towards  brand 

usage or royalty are to be considered material if the transaction(s) exceed 2% of 

the annual consolidated turnover of the listed entity during a financial year. This 

requires  approval  of  the  shareholders,  with  no  related  party  having  a  vote  to 

approve such resolutions. This provision was to come into effect from April 1, 2019. 

 

In view of the representations received on the subject and with a view to analyzing 

them,  the  Board  decided  to  defer  the  implementation  of  this  provision  for  three 

months i.e. till June 30, 2019. 

III.  Budget Estimates for the Financial Year 2019-2020
