The above order has been passed by Shri G Anantharaman, Whole Time Member, SEBI in the following context:
 
Based on the findings of preliminary investigations, SEBI had earlier passed order dated September 28, 2005 prohibiting inter-alia Jay Shah from dealing in the scrip of IFSL. It has come to the notice of SEBI that the said Jay Shah during the period of SEBI’s prohibition has been found to be dealing in the shares of IFSL Ltd. through another broker viz. Pilot Credit Capital Ltd., a member of BSE Ltd. 
 
It is noticed that Jay Shah was aware of the prohibitory order imposed upon him by SEBI but deliberately chose to ignore it and traded in the shares of IFSL Ltd. on October 11, 2005 and October 14, 2005 while the prohibition was in force. It was found that Jay Shah has willfully and knowingly dealt in the shares of IFSL Ltd., while paying scant regard to the SEBI Order dated September 28, 2005.
 
The above developments in the share of the company warranted an immediate inquiry in to the dealings of Jay Shah in the shares of IFSL Ltd. While the inquiry is in progress, based on findings of the preliminary inquiry, SEBI has issued the above directions.
