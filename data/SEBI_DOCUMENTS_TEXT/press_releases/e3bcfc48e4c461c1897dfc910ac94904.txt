SEBI allows NSE to set up reporting platform for Corporate Bonds  trading
 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) vide circular dated March 1, 2007, has authorized the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) to set up and maintain a corporate bond reporting platform with immediate effect. Earlier SEBI had authorized the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (BSE) to set up such a platform.
 
Pursuant to launch of the corporate bond reporting platform at NSE, reporting of trades in Corporate Bonds may either be made to the platform of BSE or NSE. However, reporting is not to be done to both platforms for the same transaction. BSE and NSE would ensure that all the relevant details are disseminated by both the stock exchanges on their websites without segregation of data between the exchanges on the basis of its reporting origin. 
 
The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) which at present is bringing out a daily valuation report of all Central Government Securities, would also disseminate information made available on Corporate bond trading by the two exchanges with appropriate value addition.
 
The full text of the above circular is available on the website: www.sebi.gov.in
