SEBI Committee on Disclosures and Accounting Standards (SCODA) meets in Mumbai
In the light of recent developments with respect to Satyam Computer Services Ltd., the SEBI Committee on Disclosures and Accounting Standards (SCODA) met today in Mumbai to discuss the course of action required to be taken by the regulatory agencies to boost the investor confidence in the financial disclosures made by listed entities.
In this context, after detailed deliberations, the SCODA recommended that a peer review of the working papers (relating to financial statements of listed entities) of auditors would be conducted in respect of the companies constituting the NSE – Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex. Such a review would be in relation to the last quarterly results and the last audited annual financial results. For this purpose, a panel of auditors would be prepared by SEBI. This exercise would be taken up following the publication of 3rd quarter results and is expected to be completed by end of February 2009.
SEBI has accepted this suggestion. Some listed companies (on a random basis) outside the list of Nifty 50 and Sensex would also be covered in the exercise.
