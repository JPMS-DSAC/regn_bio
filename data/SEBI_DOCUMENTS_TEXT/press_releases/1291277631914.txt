Ministry of Finance

 Statement of Chairman, SEBI 

11:44 IST 

Following is the text of the statement made by Shri C.B. Bhave, Chairman, SEBI here 
today:  
 
“SEBI  is  closely  monitoring  markets  and  has  verified  with  the  stock  exchanges  that 
there are no settlement issues. Yesterday’s settlement went through smoothly and it is 
expected that the settlement tomorrow also will be smooth. The clearing and settlement 
mechanism of the stock exchanges is a time tested mechanism which has been tested 
in times of great volatility.  
 
At present, the rules regarding short sale are that institutions are allowed to short sell 
only if they have borrowed the stock on the stock exchanges. At present, there are no 
volumes  in  the  borrowing/lending  market.  Therefore,  there  is  no  concern  that 
institutions may be short selling. Short sales by retail are permissible but the stock has 
to be delivered on a T+2 basis. If any entity delivers short, the position is auctioned. If 
SEBI finds that any institution has violated the short sale rule, SEBI will take the most 
stringent action against such entity, if any. At present, there are no indications that such 
a violation has occurred.”
