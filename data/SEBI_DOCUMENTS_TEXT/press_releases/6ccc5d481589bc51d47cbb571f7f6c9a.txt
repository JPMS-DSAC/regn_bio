In the recent past, there was an unprecedented increase in price and trading interest in the share of Eltrol (which has recently changed its name to “Shree Mahaganga Sugar Mills Ltd.”), on BSE. During the period from March 1, 2005 to September 23, 2005, the price of the share of Eltrol (face value Re.1/-), duly adjusted for corporate actions, on BSE, opened at Rs.0.47 touched a high of Rs. 3.52 on September 1, 2005, a low of Rs. 0.43 on March 2, 2005 and closed at Rs.1.85 on September 29, 2005. Thus, during the 128 trading days from March 1, 2005 to September 1, 2005, the price of the share on BSE has shown a rise of 649%. Upon examination, SEBI found that there is no identifiable promoter of Eltrol. The directors of the company who claim to be professional directors do not appear to have any knowledge about the industry in which the company is purportedly operating. The directors of the company are engaged in courier business which has no apparent relation with engineering or sugar business that Eltrol is purportedly engaged in.
 
The past financial performance of the company has been dismal and the company has accumulated losses. The company has not declared any dividend for the past many years. The company has discontinued production activities and is purportedly exploring entering into new business areas. The company has made preferential allotment to two NBFCs namely Oudh Finance & Investment Private Limited and Basmati Securities Pvt. Ltd. at a premium of Rs.6.50 per share (face value of Re.1/-). The source of funds of these NBFCs is not known and probably these NBFCs have taken Fixed Deposits from the public, the repayment of which could be imperiled by the unwise if not blatantly manipulative action of the promoters / management of these NBFCs. In any case, the rationale for the two NBFCs to invest in Eltrol shares at such a huge premium needs further probe. That apart, Eltrol has apparently diverted the money received through preferential allotment to stock brokers for indulging in stock market operations and has tried to hide this fact by claiming that the funds have been invested in the assets of the company. The issue of working capital funds belonging to corporates being diverted for stock market operations which activity is not in consonance with the regular business activities of corporates has been a major concern for SEBI in the recent past. The activities of Eltrol as detailed above confirm the concerns of SEBI in this regard.
 
Besides the above, SEBI found that there were various other announcements by the company such as announcement of bonus issue, taking over of another company etc. probably made with a view to paint a rosy picture. During this period, various major trading clients at BSE were found to have made off-market transfers to certain common entities indicating that all these entities were connected with / related to each other. In view of the above, SEBI is initiating investigations into the matter and in the meanwhile, SEBI has, under Sections 11B, 11D and 11(4)(b) of SEBI Act, 1992, issued ex-parte ad interim directions with immediate effect as above.
