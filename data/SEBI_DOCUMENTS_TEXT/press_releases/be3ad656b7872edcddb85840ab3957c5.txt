Under the Chairmanship of Justice D.P. Wadhwa, former Judge of Supreme Court of India, a committee was set up namely 'Wadhwa Committee', which recommended the procedure of identification of persons who have been deprived in the said IPOs and the manner in which reallocation of shares to such persons should take place.  As per the recommendations of Wadhwa Committee, 12.75 lakh persons had been  identified as eligible investors for distribution. SEBI has already distributed Rs.23.28 crore to 12.75 lakh investors in April 2010,  out of which 7.99 lakh investors were paid the full eligible amounts. In the present tranche-2 exercise, SEBI is  distributing amounts to those investors to whom  partial amount was paid earlier and are entitled to receive additional amounts.
