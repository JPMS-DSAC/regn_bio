SEBI invites comments on discussion paper on 
Risk Management for the Cash Market 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has from time to time put in place various risk containment measures to address the risks involved in the cash and derivatives market. These measures have successfully and efficaciously addressed the market risks.  But as the market is always in a dynamic state, the risk management system cannot remain static and has to constantly address the changing risk profile of the market. Besides, there are certain differences between the risk management system in the cash and derivatives markets. These differences also need to be addressed.
A discussion paper on the Risk Management for the Cash Market is placed on SEBI’s website www.sebi.gov.in for public comments. This discussion paper is based on the recommendations of the SEBI’s Advisory Committee on Risk Management for the Cash and Derivatives Market. The objectives of this paper is to review the risk management system for the cash market, to align and streamline the margining structure across the cash and derivatives markets and to consolidate the circulars on risk management for the cash market and issue a consolidated circular.
