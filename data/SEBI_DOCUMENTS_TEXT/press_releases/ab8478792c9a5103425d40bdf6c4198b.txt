A tentative time-schedule in this regard which was agreed upon during the meeting is enclosed.
 
As per the time-schedule, discussions have been held with individual stock exchanges to understand / clarify the specific issues relevant to respective stock exchanges and accordingly, the stock exchanges were advised to submit their draft corporatisation and demutualisation schemes to SEBI on or before December 15, 2004. All stock exchanges, except one, have submitted their draft schemes, and the same are being examined. Further, the various issues emanating from the provisions of the Ordinance, specific issues relevant to respective stock exchanges such as stamp duty on conversion are being examined. It will be SEBI’s endeavor to complete the process of corporatisation and demutualisation by March 31, 2005.
