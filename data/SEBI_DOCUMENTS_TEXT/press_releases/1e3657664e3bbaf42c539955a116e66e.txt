50/2015


It is gathered that a majority of new investors in the securities market begin with participation in the cash segment without obtaining various other facilities such as internet trading, margin trading, derivative trading and use of power of attorney.
 
With a view to facilitate the entry of these new investors and encourage them to participate in the cash market including the disinvestment of PSUs through OFS process, SEBI, vide circular dated March 04, 2015, has prescribed that individual investors can open a trading as well as  demat account by filling up a simplified one page Account Opening Form termed as 'SARAL AOF'. There will not be any requirement of separate form for opening demat account.
 
This simplified form will be separately available with the intermediaries and can also be downloaded from the Exchanges' and Depositories' website. It is clarified that individual investors who open account through SARAL AOF will also have the option to obtain other facilities, whenever they require, on furnishing of additional information as per regulations.
 
The full text of the circular is available on the website www.sebi.gov.in
