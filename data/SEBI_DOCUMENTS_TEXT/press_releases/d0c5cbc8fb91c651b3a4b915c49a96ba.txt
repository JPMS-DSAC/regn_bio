As part of the corporatisation and demutualisation initiative, the stock exchanges that were set up as Association of Persons will have to incorporate a for-profit company limited by shares and demutualise. The exchanges which were set up as companies limited by guarantee will have to convert / re-register themselves to companies limited by shares and demutualise, while the stock exchanges that are already companies limited by share will have to only demutualise. Accordingly –
 

MPSE which is presently an association of persons shall be incorporated as a for-profit company limited by shares. 
MSE, PSE, HySE, and GSE, which are companies limited by guarantee will be converted into for-profit companies limited by shares. 
CSE, DSE, UPSE, BgSE and CoSE, which are already companies limited by shares will continue as such and will have to demutualise only. 

 
With the corporatisation and demutualisation of these exchanges, their ownership and management shall be segregated from their trading rights.
 
The other salient features of the Corporatisation and Demutualisation Schemes of these ten exchanges, in conformity with the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, are as follows –
 

After corporatisation and demutualisation, there will be only one class of trading members with similar rights and privileges, and uniform standards shall be followed in terms of capital adequacy, deposits, fees, etc. while admitting any person as a trading member or for accepting his surrender. 


The Governing Boards of the Stock Exchanges shall be so constituted that the representatives of the trading members do not exceed one-fourth of the total strength of the Governing Board.
Voting rights of the shareholders, who are also trading members, shall be restricted to 5%.
Stock Exchanges shall ensure that atleast 51% of their equity shares are held by public other than shareholders having trading rights.
All activities mentioned in the Schemes, except divesting the 51% shareholding, shall be completed by the Due Date, which shall not be later than three months from the date of publication of the respective Schemes.
The Clearing and Settlement functions of the Stock Exchanges shall be transferred to a recognised Clearing Corporation, within two years from their respective Due Dates.
