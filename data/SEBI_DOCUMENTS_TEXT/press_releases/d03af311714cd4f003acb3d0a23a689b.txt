Grant of exemption for proposed acquisition of shares of
N. R. Agarwal Industries Limited
 
An Order dated August 5, 2004 was passed by Shri A. K. Batra, Whole Time Member, SEBI granting exemption from making an open offer under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 to the acquirers viz. Shri Nagindas R Agarwal, Smt. Suman N Agarwal, Shri Rajendra N Agarwal, Smt. Reena R Agarwal & persons acting in concert (PACs) with them in the matter of proposed acquisition of shares of N. R. Agarwal Industries Limited (NRAIL) subject to the fulfilment of the conditions specified in the said order. 
The promoter group (including the acquirers and PACs) are holding 28.44% shares in NRAIL and are already in control of the company. NRAIL, in its effort to reduce cost and remain competitive, decided to install a power plant. The said power project has been appraised by Bank of India. The Bank has sanctioned a term loan of Rs. 700 lakhs for the said project, with the margin money to be brought in by the promoters. The promoters of the target company have decided to bring in the margin money by way of the proposed issue of 41,00,000 equity shares on preferential basis, at Rs. 10 per share. Pursuant to the proposed acquisition, promoters would hold 57.06%. 
The application seeking exemption was forwarded by SEBI to the Takeover Panel. The Panel recommended for exemption to the acquirers from making an open offer.
