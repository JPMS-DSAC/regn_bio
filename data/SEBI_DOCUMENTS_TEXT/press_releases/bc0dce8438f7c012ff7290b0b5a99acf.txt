 The CoVID 19 virus has hit populations around the world and has
restricted free movement of people, thereby hampering businesses and day to day
functioning of companies. It has been declared a ‘pandemic’ by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Developments arising due to the spread of the virus have
warranted the need for temporary relaxations in compliance requirements for
listed entities.
