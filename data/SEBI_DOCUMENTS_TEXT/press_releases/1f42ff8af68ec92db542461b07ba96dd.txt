On 11th and 12th January this year, students of classes VIII to X, across the country appeared for the First ever National Financial Literacy Assessment Test (NFLAT). The response to the first initiative of National Centre for Financial Education (NCFE) had been overwhelming with around 1,00,000 students and 2000 schools registering for the test from all over the country. NCFE has been set up under National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) with the support of RBI, SEBI, IRDA, PFRDA and FMC. NISM is the body set up by Securities and Exchange Board of India to lead, catalyze and deliver educational initiatives to enhance the quality of securities markets through financial literacy, professional education, research etc.
The test had been conceptualized by the Technical Group on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy of the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) chaired by Dr.K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, RBI. Recognizing the significance of the test, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) also issued a circular to all the schools affiliated to the board encouraging them to participate. Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) partnered with NCFE and graciously waived their fee for the administration of the test in more than 250 test centres in India.
Abhinav Agarwal of Kendriya Vidyalaya, ONGC, Panvel, Maharashtra secured the All India 1st rank. The test saw the maximum participation from Rani Public School, Kozhikode, Kerala with a total of 929 students appearing for the test from this school. Darbari Lal Dev Model School and Sachdeva Public School, both from New Delhi were the best performing schools in the test with a 100% students scoring more than 50 percentile. All the winners will be felicitated at an Award Ceremony later in the year. The detailed results will be displayed on NCFE’s and NISM’s website (www.ncfeindia.org and www.nism.ac.in).
