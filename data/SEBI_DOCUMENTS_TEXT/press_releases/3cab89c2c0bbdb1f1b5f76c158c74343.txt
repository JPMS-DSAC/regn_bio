SEBI approves 540 applications under Consent and Compounding  Scheme 
 
SEBI settles the pending enforcement actions through consent and compounding in terms of its Circular dated April 20, 2007. The Circular provides the process for different kinds of enforcement actions such as prosecution, adjudication, section 11B proceedings, etc. The process broadly followed is as under:
On receipt of an application from the concerned entity for settlement, an internal Committee of Division Chiefs after meeting the applicant examines if the terms offered by it are appropriate for settlement. The terms finally offered by the applicant are placed before the High Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC), which is headed by a former Judge of a High Court, to ascertain if the terms are fair and reasonable. The HPAC, after taking into account facts and circumstances of the case and the factors specified in the Circular, makes its recommendations accepting, declining or suggesting modifications in the terms offered by the applicant. A panel of two Whole Time Members considers the recommendations of the HPAC and takes a decision whether to settle the enforcement action on the said terms or decline the settlement. On compliance of the terms of settlement, as approved by the panel, a consent order is passed by SEBI, if the matter is pending before it. The agreed consent terms are placed before the Securities Appellate Tribunal or Courts, as the case may be, if the matter is pending before them, for appropriate orders. In case of compounding, the approved compounding terms are submitted before the Court for its consideration. 
Till March 2009, SEBI has approved 540 applications settling various kinds of enforcement actions. These include 45 consent applications where after the consent terms were placed before the Securities Appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court, consent orders were passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court respectively. The number (540) also includes 58 compounding applications where the compounding orders were passed by the respective criminal courts. SEBI has also rejected 264 applications and declined to pass consent orders for various reasons including the reason that the terms of settlement proposed by the applicants were not found adequate (in 228 cases) by the HPAC. The details of disposal of applications under the said scheme till March 31, 2009 are as under:
