PR- 286/2004 
Grant of exemption for proposed acquisition of shares of Color Chips Entertainment & Media Ltd. 
Securities and Exchange Board of India(SEBI) passed an Order on October 14, 2004 granting exemption to Shri R S Sudhish and persons acting in concert (acquirers) from making a public announcement in the newspapers as required under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 in the matter of proposed acquisition of shares of Color Chips Entertainment & Media Ltd (CCEML).
The acquirers propose to acquire 1,65,100 shares, representing 66.30% of voting capital of the target company, through share purchase agreement with various shareholders @ Rs. 4/- per share, which would attract open offer requirement in terms of the said Regulations. Exemption was sought from obligations of making a public announcement, submission of draft letter of offer to SEBI, appointment of merchant banker etc. Instead, the acquirer proposes to make an offer to remaining public shareholders of target company, by writing individual letters to each public shareholder.
The application seeking exemption was forwarded by SEBI to the Takeover Panel. The Panel recommended for exemption to the acquirers from making public announcement subject to certain conditions.
As per the SEBI Order, the acquirer shall make individual offer to each shareholder by a letter under registered acknowledgement due post. However, all other requirements including submission of Letter of offer to SEBI, appointment of merchant banker as specified under the Regulations will be applicable in respect of proposed acquisition.
