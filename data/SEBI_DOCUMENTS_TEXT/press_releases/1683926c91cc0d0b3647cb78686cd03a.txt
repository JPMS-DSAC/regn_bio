Shri Rajeev Kumar Agarwal, Whole Time Member, SEBI, passed an ad interim ex -parte order dated August 20, 2015 restraining 59 entities from accessing Indian Securities market on the basis of their suspicious trading in stock options in equity derivative segment.
Based on the surveillance alert generated by DWBIS, SEBI's key surveillance system, it was gathered that a set of entities repeatedly and consistently made only trading loss and another set of entities repeatedly and consistently made only trading profit by their trades in Stock options segment.
Further scrutiny revealed that the entities making the loss were able to do so by selling stock option to a set of entities at a price much lesser than its intrinsic value and subsequently reversing the trade at a much higher price within a short span of time.
The examination, prima facie, shows that the execution of reversal trades at arbitrary/ irrational price by the loss-making and the profitâ€“making entities is non-genuine and defies basic economic sense with the possible intent of tax evasion or portraying artificial increase in net worth of a private company/individual.
