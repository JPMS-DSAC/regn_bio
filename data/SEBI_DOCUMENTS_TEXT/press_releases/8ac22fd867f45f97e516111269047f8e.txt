Clarification on “Information
to public on complaints” This has reference to an observation
expressed in a section of media that SEBI “will henceforth entertain complaints
against market participants only if the whistleblower is reachable to
substantiate allegations and provide supporting documents.  It has also said that complaints made to it must
be from an identified source.” Reference has also been drawn to a public notice
published on SEBI website regarding a complaint against an MII. 
It is clarified that SEBI
gives utmost importance to all complaints either received anonymous or
otherwise and takes necessary action after verifying the contents. However,
SEBI may not be able to handle complaints which are anonymous and not specific
or substantiated or verifiable. Any complaint which has verifiable or
substantiated facts, even if it is anonymous, is considered by SEBI, for
further necessary action.
