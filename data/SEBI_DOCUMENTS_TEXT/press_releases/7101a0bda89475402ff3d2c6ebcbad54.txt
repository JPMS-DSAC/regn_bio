Budget for 2014-15
The Board considered the proposal  relating to Budget Estimates for the Financial Year 2014-15 and proposals for Fee Revision based on recommendation of Committee on Rationalization of Financial Resources. The budget for the financial year 2014-15 has been prepared keeping in view the need to place greater emphasis to achieve the mandated statutory objectives.
The Board identified following core areas for SEBI's activities in 2014-15:
(i)   Strengthening the investor awareness and education measures
(ii)  Enlarging reach amongst investors/potential investors through regional and local offices.
(iii) Enhanced focus on capacity building
