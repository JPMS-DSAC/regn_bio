PRESS RELEASE 
PR No.312/2007SEBI amends DIP Guidelines Rating requirements for Corporate Bonds simplifiedStructural Restrictions on Corporate Bond issuances removed
 
 
In order to facilitate development of a vibrant primary market for corporate bonds in India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has amended the provisions pertaining to issuances of Corporate Bonds under the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 vide circular dated December 03, 2007. The highlights of the amendments are:
 
1.      For public/ rights issues of debt instruments, issuers will now need to obtain rating from only one credit rating agency instead of from two as required at present. This is with a view to reduce the cost of issuances. 
 
2.      In order to facilitate issuance of below investment grade bonds to suit the risk/ return appetite of investors, the stipulation that debt instruments issued through public/ rights issues shall be of at least investment grade has been removed.
 
3.      Further, in order to afford issuers with desired flexibility in structuring of debt instruments, it has been decided that structural restrictions such as those on maturity, put/call option, on conversion, etc currently in place have been done away with. 
 
The full text of the circular and the entire text of SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, including the amendments issued vide the aforementioned circular, are available on the website at www.sebi.gov.in.
