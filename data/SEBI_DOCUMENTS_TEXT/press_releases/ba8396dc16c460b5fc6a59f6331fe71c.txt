Global talent to assist NISM


SEBI has ambitious plans to position the National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) as an institution of global standard. NISM would have a world-class campus. Significant progress has been made in forging collaboration with the Stem School of Business, New York University. SEBI is of the view that NISM should attract the best finance faculty to establish strong programmes in financial markets research, graduate education and executive education.  NISM  has been
successful in attracting a number of endowments to establish Chair Professorships. It is proposed that renowned finance professors from top institutions of USA, Europe and East Asia would be invited to visit NISM as  Chair Professors.  NISM plans to engage about twenty five chair professors over the next three years.
 
A committee, chaired by Mr. M G Bhide, former Chairman & Managing Director of Bank of India, has been formed to identify suitable persons to occupy these chairs. The visiting professors would assist NISM in institution building mentoring young faculty recruits and to help NISM build a strong research programme in financial markets.
 
In addition to Mr. Bhide, the Committee would comprise Dr. P G Apte, former Director, llM, Bangalore, Shri Nimesh Kampani, Chairman, J M Morgan Stanley, Dr. T C Nair, Whole Time Member, SEBI and Prof G Sethu, NISM.
