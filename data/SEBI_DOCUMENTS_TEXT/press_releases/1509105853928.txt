The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  has  entered  into  a  Memorandum  of 

Understanding  (MoU)  with The  European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  under 

the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).  

  

The  MoU  establishes  cooperation  arrangements,  including  the  exchange  of  information 

regarding  Central  Counterparties  (CCPs)  which  are  established  and  authorised  or 

recognised in India by SEBI, and which have applied for EU recognition under EMIR.  

 

EMIR  provides  for  signing  of  a  cooperation  arrangement  between  ESMA  and  the  relevant 

non-EU  authorities,  whose  legal  and  supervisory  framework  for  CCPs  have  been  deemed 

equivalent to EMIR by the European Commission. Signing of MoU is one of the conditions 

for recognition of third country CCPs by ESMA under EMIR.
