149/2014


Shri Rajeev Kumar Agarwal, Whole Time Member, SEBI, has passed an order dated December 04, 2014 in the matter of M/s. Moryo Industries Ltd.
 
SEBI had conducted a preliminary examination, upon noticing huge rise in the traded volumes and price of the shares of the company during the period from January 15, 2013 to August 31, 2014. A few individuals/ entities (referred to as 'Moryo Group')  have misused the stock exchange system to generate fictitious long term capital gains (LTCG) so as to convert their unaccounted income into accounted one with no payment of taxes as LTCG is tax exempt. The funds were  brought in the company through preferential allotment and was invested in the shares of connected companies by way of purported loans to a group of companies  connected  with Moryo and for purposes other than those disclosed. The preferential allotment route resulted in tax free ill gotten gains to the tune of Rs.141 crore based upon the facts available on record. The whole modus operandi of raising money through preferential allotment, splitting the shares to increase liquidity and then providing exit to preferential allottees (at a prices much higher than that supported by company fundamentals) was a well devised scheme  to convert illegitimate money into legitimate money by misusing the stock exchange mechanism.
 
In view of the pending inquiry/investigation and passing of final order in the matter, ninety one (91) suspected entities have been barred from buying, selling or dealing in the securities markets, either directly or indirectly, in any manner, till further directions.
