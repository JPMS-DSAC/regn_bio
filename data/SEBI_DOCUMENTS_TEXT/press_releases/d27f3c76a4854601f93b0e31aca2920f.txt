SEBI notifies
Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges) Regulations, 2006
 
SEBI has notified the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges) Regulations, 2006. The Regulations are notified under section 4B (8) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.
 
The Regulations shall be applicable to all recognised stock exchanges in respect of which the scheme for corporatisation and / or demutualisation has been approved by SEBI. These Regulations specify that the public shareholding in recognised stock exchanges may be increased in the following manner:
 
(a)      offer for sale, by issue of prospectus, of shares held by shareholders having trading rights therein; or
(b)      placement of shares held by shareholders having trading rights to such persons  or institutions as may be shortlisted by the recognised stock exchange with the approval of SEBI; or
(c)      issue of equity shares on private placement basis by the recognised stock exchange to any  person or group of persons not being shareholders having trading rights or their associates subject to the approval of SEBI; or
(d)      any combination of the above.   
 
The above are in addition to the mode permitted by Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act itself, i.e. by fresh issue of equity shares to the public.
 
The Regulations further specify that no person shall, directly or indirectly, acquire or hold more than five per cent in the paid up equity capital of a recognised stock exchange. Further, no person shall, either individually or together with persons acting in concert with him, acquire and/or hold more than one per cent of the paid up equity capital of a recognised stock exchange, unless he is a fit and proper person and has taken prior approval of SEBI for doing so. 
 
Presently, SEBI has approved and notified the corporatisation and / or demutualisation schemes of nineteen stock exchanges.
 
The full text of the Regulations is available on the website:  www.sebi.gov.in
