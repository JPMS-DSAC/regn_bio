It has come to the notice of SEBI that many entities have been luring investors through unsolicited calls/SMS and assuring guaranteed profits on the trading tips provided by them. It is observed that this activity is carried out mostly by the entities based in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
 
In this context, investors are cautioned to:
    i.  deal with only SEBI registered intermediaries and check their registration status on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in before availing the services.
   ii.  be wary of any misleading advertisements which solicit investments in securities market assuring guaranteed profits.
  iii.  to take informed investment decision without being influenced by trading tips.
 
Under the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992, read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 and SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014, no person shall act as an investment adviser or a research analyst without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI. Engaging in the investment advisory/ research activity without registration from SEBI may entail initiation of strict action as deemed appropriate under the SEBI Act, 1992.
SEBI has already taken action against various entities for acting as unregistered investment adviser. The list of the entities against whom orders have been passed is given below.
