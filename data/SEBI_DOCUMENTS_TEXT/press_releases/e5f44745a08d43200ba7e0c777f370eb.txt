PRESS RELEASE
April 8, 2004 PR No.84/2004

In the matter of proposed acquisition of shares of Gujarat Ambuja Exports Ltd.: Grant of exemption under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 

 
Shri Vijay Kumar Gupta, Smt. Sulochana V Gupta, Shri Manish V Gupta, Ms Shilpa Manish Gupta, Shri Mohit V Gupta [‘Acquirers’],are the promoters of Gujarat Ambuja Exports Ltd. (GAEL) and hold 54.50% of total paid up equity share capital. The acquirers proposed to acquire 1,71,36,302 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each by way of preferential issue of additional equity shares. After the proposed acquisition the total holding of acquirers would be 73.77%.
The Acquirers made an application to SEBI seeking exemption from making open offer to the shareholders of GAEL as required in terms of the aforesaid (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 on the ground that the proposed acquisition is not in the nature of acquisition of control.  It was also said that preferential issue would be preferable over rights issue as it would enable the company to save time and cost.
The Takeover Panel did not recommend grant of exemption. The acquirers were given an opportunity of personal hearing with Whole Time Member, SEBI. During the hearing, further submission was made by the acquirers stating that the right issue, if made, would be successful only if promoters subscribed. 
SEBI in terms of Regulation 4(6) of the said Regulations has passed an order dated 31.03.2004, rejecting the application for grant of exemption to acquirers for the proposed acquisition of shares of GAEL.
The full text of the Order is available on the SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in
