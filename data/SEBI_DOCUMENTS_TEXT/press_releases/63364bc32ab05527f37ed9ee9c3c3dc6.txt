A dynamic and efficient capital market is a vital and indispensable part of a nation‟s financial infrastructure. Indian stock market is the fourth best-performing market in the world. Resolution of securities market dispute could result in lowering the cost of equity/capital in the country.

The main findings of the study are: (a) SCORES fare very well on both the attributes of accessibility to investors as well the efficiency of the mechanism. (b) It is recommended that the SCORES system monitor repeat players (RP) who tend to “play for rules” to the disadvantage of individuals as „one shooters‟ (OSs). (c) SEBI may consider extending the mediation and arbitration model prevalent among broking community to the company level (primary and secondary market) (d) Social media could be used extensively in investor education and communicating the good news about the regulator.
