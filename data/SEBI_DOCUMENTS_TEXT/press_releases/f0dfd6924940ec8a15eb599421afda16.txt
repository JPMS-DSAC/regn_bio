PRESS RELEASE
November 25, 2003 PR No.284/2003
 
 
SUBJECT: LAUNCH OF CENTRAL DATABASE OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS 
  
ISSUED BY: OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN 

Securities and Exchange Board of India has notified the SEBI [Central Database of Market Participants] Regulations 2003 for creation of a central database of market participants and Investors and grant of Unique Identification Numbers [MAPIN DATABASE]. The Database was launched on November 25, 2003 by Shri G. N. Bajpai, Chairman, SEBI. Shri C. B. Bhave, Managing Director, NSDL gave the first unique identification number and identity card to Shri Bajpai on this occasion. 
SEBI intends to achieve the following through these Regulations: 

Develop an inventory of Market Participants and Investors; 
Set up a standard for client code (Unique identification number); 

These Regulations place a mandatory obligation on intermediaries and other entities under the jurisdiction of SEBI, listed companies and specified investors to obtain unique identification number under MAPIN database. If these entities do not obtain the unique identification numbers by the specified date (to be notified by SEBI from time to time), they will not be permitted to continue their business. 
In the first phase, intermediaries mentioned in the Annexure I and their related persons would need to obtain the Unique Identification Numbers during the period December 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004. 
The text of these notifications and application forms for the purpose of obtaining unique identification numbers can be downloaded from Internet sites www.nsdl.co.in or www.mapin.nsdl.com. 
Every entity obtaining the unique identification number under the MAPIN database will have one identification number (unique) in the system The unique number is permanent and does not change even if some attributes of the entity change (such as its SEBI registration number, address, etc). In case of individuals, as well, the number remains the same even if the individual changes his job, etc. 
SEBI has appointed National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) for creating and maintaining MAPIN database. After a reasonable build-up of data in the MAPIN database, it will provide the following facilities: 

Investors can view basic information of an intermediary and whether the intermediary is facing any disciplinary action. 
An intermediary can verify whether unique identification number given by the investor is correct as per the database. 
SEBI / SROs will be enabled to update regulatory record of the intermediary. 
Brokers and Depository Participants will be enabled to correct the address of investors. 

NSDL has appointed the Points of Service (POS) [Contact details of POS is givenin Annexure - II] to provide application forms, accept application forms and collect bio-metric details of the applicants. POS will set up camp offices at various locations in each state to provide the required service. Camping details will be published through different channels like website, brokers’ offices, etc. from time to time. 
Application forms, biometric details along with fees of Rs.300/- may be submitted to these POSs to obtain unique identification number. The identity cards will be issued to the applicants within two weeks of submission of application. The process of allotting unique identification number at full scale will start from December 1, 2003.
