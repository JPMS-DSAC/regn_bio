Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has constituted the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee (TRAC) to review the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (Takeover Regulations) and to suggest suitable recommendations for amendments to the Takeover Regulations as it considers necessary.
The first meeting of the TRAC was held on September 17, 2009.  As part of a consultative process in the exercise of reviewing this significant piece of legislation, the TRAC has decided to seek inputs and suggestions from the public, at the outset, on any aspect of the Takeover Regulations, which in their opinion may merit a review.
A Format for the purpose is available on the website (www.sebi.gov.in) under the section “Reports for Public Comments”.
