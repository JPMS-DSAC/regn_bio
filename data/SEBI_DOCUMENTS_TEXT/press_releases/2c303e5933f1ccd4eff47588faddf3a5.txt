It is observed from some recent newspaper reports that fraudulent telephone calls are being made to individuals/investors in the name of the regulatory officials giving advice on financial products. In this regard, the attention of the public is drawn to the fact that SEBI neither offers any investment advice or recommend any investment products/schemes nor seeks any personal information of investors for this purpose.Â  If any prospective investor is contacted by any person purporting to be a SEBI official and offering such investment advice or seeking such information, individuals may not entertain such calls and deny him/her such access and verify the details of such purported official from SEBI website.
