Shri Krishna Hullatti (alias) Hullatti Krishna B (alias) Krishnaraj, Proprietor of M/s. Matrix Web, Bangalore, barred from dealing in the capital market
 

Shri Krishna Hullatti (alias) Hullatti Krishna B (alias) Krishnaraj, Proprietor of M/s. Matrix Web, Bangalore, has been directed not to buy, sell or deal in securities in any manner, directly or indirectly and not to accept any loans or deposits intended for share market, from the public with immediate effect under Section 11B and 11(4)(b) of the SEBI Act. The order has been passed by Shri G.N.Bajpai, Chairman, SEBI on September 10, 2004. 
Shri Krishna Hullatti, without any registration from SEBI to act in the capacity of a stock broker or a sub broker or as a Portfolio Manager, is acting on behalf of the investing public in the capital market in buying and selling of shares for them and luring the investors with a promise of huge returns and only profits. It is needless to state that such an activity is not only illegal but also fraught with huge risks and would be detrimental to the financial interests of the unsuspecting investors. Hence, it is imperative to restrain the said individual from dealing further with the public in the capital market transactions, in the interest of the investors and the Securities market. 
SEBI passed the above order based on the facts and circumstances of the case. The order comes into force with immediate effect.
