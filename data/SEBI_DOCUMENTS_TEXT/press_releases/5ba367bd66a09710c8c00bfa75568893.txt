PRESS RELEASE
PR No.149/2005

Grant of exemption for proposed acquisition of shares of 
Shriram Pistons and Rings Ltd.
An Order dated November 11, 2005 was passed by Shri Madhukar, Whole Time Member, SEBI granting exemption to Deepak Shriram Family Benefit Trust from making an open offer under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 in the matter of proposed acquisition of shares of Shriram Pistons and Rings Ltd. (SPRL) from two trustees viz.  Shri Deepak C. Shriram and Shri Sanjiv Dass.
 
The proposed acquisition of 66,69,336 (29.81%) shares is not for the purpose of acquiring control and management over the target company. The proposed transfer is from the two existing joint promoter shareholders of SPRL to themselves in the capacity of Trustees of a family trust owned and controlled by them/their relatives. Post proposed acquisition, the shareholding of the promoter group would remain at 47.76% as the Trust is also covered in the promoter group category.
 
The application seeking exemption was forwarded by SEBI to the Takeover Panel. The Panel recommended for exemption to the acquirer from making an open offer.
