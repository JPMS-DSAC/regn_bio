80/2013


Shri S. Raman, Whole Time Member, SEBI, has passed an order on August 30, 2013 under sections 11(1), 11B and 11(4) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Regulation 65 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 in the matter of M/s. Maitreya Plotters and Structures Pvt. Ltd. The order directed the company and its directors viz. Mrs. Varsha Madhusudan Satpalkar and Mr. Janardan Arvind Parulekar not to collect any more money from investors including under the existing schemes, not to launch any new schemes, not to dispose of any of the properties or alienate any of the assets of the schemes and not to divert any funds raised from public at large which are kept in bank account(s) and/or in the custody of the company.
 
M/s. Maitreya Plotters and Structures Pvt. Ltd. was prima facie found to be engaged in fund mobilising activity from public by floating ‘collective investment schemes’ as defined in Section 11AA of the SEBI Act.
 
The company had launched various collective investment schemes without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI, thus contravening the provisions of section 12 (1B) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999.
