under SCRA and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing
Corporations) Regulations, 2018 to undertake the activity of clearing and
settlement of trades in securities or other instruments or products that are
dealt with or traded on recognized stock exchanges.
Clearing Corporations are designated as Market
Infrastructure Institutions (MII) for oversight considering its systemic
importance in Securities markets regulated by the SEBI. As such, it was
subjected to regulation and supervision using the PFMIs framework thus

These were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing,
settlement and recording arrangements and more broadly, to limit systemic risk
and foster transparency and financial stability. The members of CPSS and IOSCO
are required to strive to adopt the PFMIs in their respective jurisdictions in
line with the G20 expectations. SEBI, as a member of Financial Stability Board
(FSB) and IOSCO, is committed to adoption and implementation of the PFMIs.
