Wherever SEBI has found schemes offered by these entities, to be in the nature of Collective Investment Schemes (CIS), appropriate actions have been taken against the entity/ies and its Directors. In this regard, since January 01, 2011, SEBI has passed orders against 63 entities and its Directors, for carrying on unregistered CIS. As part of interim directions, SEBI directs the entities and its Directors to stop collecting further money under existing / new schemes, not to launch any new scheme or float any new companies/firm to raise fresh money, not to divert or alienate any assets or money collected etc., and through final directions SEBI debars the company and its Directors from accessing the Capital markets, etc. List of the Companies against whom orders have been passed by SEBI is given below with this press release. The orders are also available on SEBI website at www.sebi.gov.in
Investors and general public are hereby cautioned that other than "GIFT Collective Investment Management Company Limited" no other entity is registered with SEBI under the CIS Regulations.
