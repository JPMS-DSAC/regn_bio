SEBI
constitutes Group to review Institutional Trading Platform (ITP) framework to facilitate
the listing of start ups  SEBI has
constituted a group to look into the existing Institutional Trading Platform
(ITP) framework and suggest measures to facilitate listing of startups. SEBI had
put in place the ITP framework in 2015 with a view to facilitating listing of new
age companies in sectors like e-commerce, data analytics, bio-technology and
other startups. However, this framework failed to gain any traction.  SEBI
has discussed the issue with various stakeholders and formed a group primarily
with the following objectives: a.
To review the need for present ITP framework in the current context.b. To revisit the current ITP framework and
identify the areas, if any, which require further changes.c. Any other issue relevant to ITP which the
group may like to assess.The
members of the group include representatives from the Indian
Software Product Industry Round Table (iSPIRT), The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE),
the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA), law firms, merchant bankers, and
stock exchanges.
The
group shall endeavour to submit the report to SEBI within a period of one
month.
