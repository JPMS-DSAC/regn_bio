The Hong Kong SAR Government Financial Secretary Mr. John C Tsang visited SEBI today (Thursday, December 13, 2007) along with a high powered business delegation comprising industry representatives from various fields to discuss issues of cross border participation and mutual understanding.

The objective of LOI between the two authorities is to facilitate the development of deeper and broader investment markets in both jurisdictions and attain closer regulatory cooperation in a mutually beneficial manner, which would result in harmonisation of regulatory framework under the respective regimes in the area of regulation, supervision and marketing of mutually acceptable investment products.
