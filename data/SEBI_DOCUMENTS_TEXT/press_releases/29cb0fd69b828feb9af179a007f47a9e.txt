Clarification on news
item This
is with reference to a news item published in a section of media headlined “MEA,
SEBI provided positive report on Mehul Choksi in 2017, says Antigua’s CIU”. The
news item, inter-alia, states that “According to
the Antiguan authorities, even SEBI provided a positive report when asked about
Mehul Choksi. The CIU received documentation of two instances in which the
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in 2014 and 2017, opened
investigations on a corporate entity owned by Choksi. We requested updates on
the status of the investigations and received documentary confirmation, issued
by the SEBI stating that in one case, the matter had been satisfactorily
closed, and indicating in the other that there is not sufficient evidence to
pursue the matter further.”In this
connection, it is clarified as follows:“SEBI has
neither received any request from the Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU) of
Antigua for updates on any investigation nor provided any such information to
CIU”.
