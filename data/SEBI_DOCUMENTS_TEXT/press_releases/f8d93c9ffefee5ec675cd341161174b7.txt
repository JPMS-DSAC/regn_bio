Shri Rajeev Kumar Agarwal, Whole Time Member, SEBI inaugurated the two day conference of the fourth Asia Pacific Regulators Dialogue on Market Surveillance (ARMS) held in Mumbai on September 22, 2016.
The Asia Pacific Regulators Dialogue on Market Surveillance was started three years back, by the Securities Commission, Malaysia, along with other fellow regulators responsible for market surveillance in the Asia Pacific Region. The aim behind this initiative is to create a platform for the Regulators to come together and discuss surveillance strategies, share their views w.r.t. issues related to market integrity, maintaining fair and efficient markets among others. The initiative also found support from the Asia Pacific Regional Committee, one of the four regional committees constituted by IOSCO.
This year Securities and Exchange Board of India hosted the dialogue in Mumbai, in which nine Asia Pacific countries participated.
In his opening remarks, Shri. Rajeev Kumar Agarwal, Whole Time Member said that Surveillance of the market by the Regulator is very crucial for maintaining market integrity, which is directly linked to the investor protection. The investor protection is the most important mandate given to SEBI by the statute and as such most of the regulations flow from this mandate. Participation of as large number of investors as possible is desirable from the angle of democratizing the price discovery process as well as from the angle of making best use of the markets. Investors will get attracted to the market only when they feel that the markets are free from manipulation and in case of any manipulation regulator will take suitable enforcement action. In this context, the role of surveillance department and investigation department in the regulation of any jurisdiction is important. He added that in view of globalization of markets interaction amongst regulators is need of the hour.
