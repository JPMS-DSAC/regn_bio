Shri Rajeev Kumar Agarwal, Whole Time Member, SEBI, has passed an order dated February 20, 2013 in the matter of acquisition of shares of CG-Vak Software and Exports Limited by Mr. G.Suresh. In the said order, it was, inter-alia, stated that in view of the mitigating facts and circumstances, even if the impugned acquisition by Mr. G.Suresh breached the threshold limit prescribed under regulation 10 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (Takeover Regulations, 1997), it would not be appropriate to insist public announcement under regulation 14(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 in this case. The Board may, however, take any other appropriate action at appropriate stage.
