It is, therefore, reiterated that an individual needs to obtain only one UIN which can then be linked to other organizations / intermediaries under the circumstances enumerated above, including change of employment. Similarly, an entity needs to obtain UIN only once even though it may be registered with SEBI in various capacities.
 
It may also be noted that obtaining a second UIN, by an individual or an entity is a violation of the provisions of SEBI, MAPIN regulations 2003 and the concerned person is therefore, liable for appropriate penal action.
