SEBI  Board Meeting
The 123rd Meeting of the SEBI Board was held in New Delhi today.
Proceedings against NSDL 
The Board decided, with one Member dissenting, that it would seek the opinion of an eminent legal counsel on the issue of whether the SEBI Board has the legal authority to examine whether the Committee appointed by the Board to deal with the matter involving a conflict of interest of the current Chairman in relation to NSDL has acted within the framework and terms of reference established by the Board Resolution.  Pending that, the Board decided, with one member dissenting, to withhold the orders of the Committee.
As per past practice, Mr. C. B. Bhave, Chairman recused himself from these discussions and decisions.
Mutual Fund Exposure to Money Market Instruments of an Issuer
In order to mitigate concentration risk, the Board decided to amend the Seventh Schedule of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations to provide that no mutual fund scheme shall invest more than 30% of its net assets in money market instruments of an issuer.  The schemes may, however, continue to invest up to 15% or 20% of net assets, as the case may be, in other investment grade debt instruments of an issuer as already provided in the Regulations.  These limits will not cover investments in government securities, T-Bills and Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligations (CBLO).  
IDR Issues
The Board approved proposals to enable (a) mutual funds and FIIs to invest in IDRs subject to FEMA, (b) demat holding of IDRs, (c) issue of depository receipts by custodians on behalf of issuers.
