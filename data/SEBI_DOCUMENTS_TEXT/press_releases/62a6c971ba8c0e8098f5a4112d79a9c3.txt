Shri Prashant Saran, Whole Time Member, SEBI, has passed an order dated February 03, 2014 in the matter of irregularities in the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in respect of M/s. Karvy Computershare Private Limited, Registrar to Issue and Share Transfer Agent.  The Member noted that Karvy Computershare Private Limited has already undergone the prohibition for approximately ten months period.  In view of the same, no further penalty is warranted.
SEBI had conducted a preliminary examination, upon noticing certain irregularities with respect to IPO of different companies. A few individuals/ entities (referred to as 'the key operators') had opened various demat accounts (referred to as 'afferent accounts') in fictitious/ benami names and cornered/ acquired the shares of IPOs in the category of retail investors using these accounts. Pursuant to the allotment, the shares were transferred to the demat account of these key operators and from thereon to ultimate beneficiaries, who were the financiers in the process. It was observed that KCPL had extended special treatment to the Karvy group companies comprising of Karvy Stock Broking Limited (Stock Broker, DP and Portfolio Manager), Karvy Consultants Limited (formerly Non Banking Finance Company) and enabled the key operators to corner the shares meant for retail investors in the IPO allotment.
