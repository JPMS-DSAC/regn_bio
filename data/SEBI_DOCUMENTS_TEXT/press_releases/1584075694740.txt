SEBI  and  Stock  Exchanges  have  a  robust  risk  management  framework  in  place 
which automatically gets  triggered in response to movements in the indices (BSE 
Sensex  and  NSE  Nifty)  as  well  as  individual  stocks  both  in  cash  and  derivatives 
market. Some of these measures include: 

  Value  at  Risk  (VaR)  Margin  with  initial  margin  to  cover  99%  risk  of  a 

transaction  

  Extreme Loss Margin (ELM) to cover the residual risk of a transaction 

  Collection of mark to market losses on daily basis 

  Additional surveillance margins based on stress tests  

  Circuit filters at index levels 

  Circuit filters at stock levels 

  Action on the basis of surveillance inputs 

  Regular follow up by the clearing corporations with the clearing members for 

collection of margin and pay-in obligations. 

The positions of margin payments, margin utilization, adequacy of collaterals (securities 
deposited  by  the  brokers  with  the  clearing  corporations)  and  the  pay-in’s  obligations 
being  met  by  the  clearing  members  (brokers)  are  being  continuously  monitored. 
Similarly, the settlement and clearance of trades are also being constantly monitored.  

SEBI and Stock Exchanges are prepared to take suitable actions as may be required.
