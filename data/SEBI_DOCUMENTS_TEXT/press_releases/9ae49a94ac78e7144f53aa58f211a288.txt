An application was made to SEBI seeking exemption from making open offer to the shareholders of ORG as required in terms of the aforesaid (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997. It was stated that financial position of ORG is very weak. The networth of the company has been eroded more than 50% during last four financial years and it is not in a position to repay the loan taken from Global Asia Partners LP. The shareholders of ORG by special resolution gave consent to Global Asia Partners LP to work as joint controller along with Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. single largest shareholder in ORG. It was also stated that the main objective of converting loan into equity shares is to revive the target company by additional capitalization.
The said application was considered by the Takeover Panel which has recommended grant of exemption.
