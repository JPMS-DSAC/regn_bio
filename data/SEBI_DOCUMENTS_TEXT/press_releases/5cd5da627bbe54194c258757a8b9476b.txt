Shri S Raman, Whole Time Member (WTM), SEBI passed an order on March 7, 2014 in the matter of M/s. Royal Twinkle Star Club Private Ltd. directing the company and its directors viz. Shri Omprakash Basantlal Goenka, Shri Prakash Ganpat Utekar, Shri Venkatraman Natrajan and Shri Narayan Shivram Kotnis not to collect any more money from investors including under the existing schemes, not to launch any new schemes, not to dispose of any of the properties or alienate any of the assets of the schemes and not to divert any funds raised from public at large which are kept in bank account(s) and/or in the custody of the company.
 
M/s. Royal Twinkle Star Club Private Ltd was prima facie found to be engaged in fund mobilising activity from public by floating ‘collective investment schemes’ as defined in Section 11AA of the SEBI Act.
 
The company had launched collective investment schemes without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI, thus contravening the provisions of section 12 (1B) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999.
