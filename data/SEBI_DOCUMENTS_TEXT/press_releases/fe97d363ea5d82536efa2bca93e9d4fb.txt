PR No.293/2008


SEBI amends DIP Guidelines to provide for combined offering of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) with warrants, through Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) mechanism


The Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his announcement in the Union Budget for the year 2007-08, has proposed, inter-alia, to enhance the tradability of Domestic Convertible Bonds (DCBs). This requires a mechanism that will enable investors to separate the embedded equity option from the convertible bond and trade it separately. This mechanism requires basic enablers like existence of long tenor callable Credit Derivatives market, ability to borrow stock for long tenors to enable short selling, etc.
SEBI, in consultation with market participants, explored alternate structures which would yield the same benefits as that of DCBs to the issuer and enhance the suite of products from the investors’ point of view. SEBI has now put in place a framework whereby a listed company can make a combined offering of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) with warrants to QIBs, under the Qualified Institutions Placement mechanism. SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 have been amended today to this effect.
Qualified Institutional Buyers can subscribe to the combined offering of NCDs with warrants or to the individual instruments, i.e., either NCDs or warrants, where separate books are run for NCDs/ warrants.
