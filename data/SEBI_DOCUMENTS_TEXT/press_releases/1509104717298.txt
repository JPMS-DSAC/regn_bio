SEBI  held  a  meeting  today  with  NSE  officials  on  the  reported  technical  glitch.    Senior 

PR No. 45/2017 

 

officials of SEBI and NSE attended the meeting. 

 
During the meeting, NSE, inter-alia, submitted as follows: 
 

* NSE cash market segment did not function normally at the time of opening of market 
on  July  10,  2017  due  to  technical  problems  and  therefore  was  closed.  After  giving 
notice to the market, the F&O segment was also closed. Two attempts to reopen the 
market  were  not  successful.  Finally  the  market  was  pre-opened  at  12.15  pm  and 
opened  at  12.30  pm  for  both  cash  and  F&O  segments.  However,  a  market  display 
problem was observed in the cash market and was rectified subsequently. 

*  On  preliminary  analysis,  the  technical  problem  apparently  is  related  to  software.  It 

does not seem to be related to any cyber security related compromise. 

*  All the markets closed normally at the appointed time 

*  The  matter  is  being  examined  by  the  internal  technical  team  of  NSE  and  external 
vendors,  to  analyse  and  identify  the  cause  which  led  to  the  issue  and  to  suggest 
solutions to prevent recurrence. 

 

 

 

 

*  All executed trades in cash and F&O segments remain valid. 

 
SEBI  has  directed  NSE  to  submit  a  detailed  report  on  the  matter.  SEBI  has  also  asked 

NSE to have a review of their Business Continuity Plans and  to submit a detailed plan as 

to what measures are going to be taken to avoid such recurrences. 

 
SEBI  is  also  looking  at  the  matter  comprehensively  and    will    interact  with  different 

stakeholders to explore as to what more needs to be done to avoid such recurrences.
