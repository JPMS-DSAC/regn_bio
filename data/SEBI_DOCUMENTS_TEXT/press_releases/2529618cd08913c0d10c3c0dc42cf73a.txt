PR No.69/2010
Order in the matter of M/s. Cybertech Systems and Software Limited
 
      1.            The board of directors of M/s. Cybertech Systems and Software Limited (target company) proposed a buyback of 66,17,836 of its equity shares of Rs.10/- each at a fixed price of Rs.12/- through tender offer method which was subsequently approved by the shareholders of the target company. 
 
      2.            Pursuant to the aforesaid buyback, the shareholding of Mr. Viswanath Tadimety, Mr. Seetaramchandra Tadimety Rao, Ms. Jyoti Tadimety, Ms. Amogha Tadimety, Ms. Sukhada Tadimety, Ms. Shanta Radhakrishna Shanbhag and Mr. Steven Jeske (acquirers/promoter) is increasing from 23.59% to 31.46%.
 
      3.            In view of aforesaid incidental increase of more than 5% in the shareholding of the acquirers/promoters, an application dated October 9, 2009 was filed under Regulation 4(2) read with Regulation 3(1)(l) of Takeover Regulations for getting exemption from the applicability of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations.
 
      4.            Takeover Panel has recommended exemption to the acquirers from the applicability of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations.
 
      5.            As the shares of the target company are frequently traded and market price is more than the buy back offer price, SEBI is of the view that the shareholders may not be interested in tendering their shares in the buy back offer as they have the option to offload their shares in the open market. 
 
      6.            In the meanwhile, SEBI received a copy of the letter dated March 5, 2010 from the target company, informing Bombay Stock Exchange Limited that its board of directors have decided to withdraw the aforesaid buy back proposal therefore the aforesaid application for exemption became infructuous.
 
      7.            In view of above, Dr. K.M. Abraham, Whole Time Member, SEBI, vide order dated March 11, 2010 has disposed of the aforesaid application dated October 9, 2009.
