Categorization and Rationalization of Mutual Fund Schemes 

  
In order to enable an investor of mutual funds to take an informed decision while investing in a 

scheme, it is felt necessary to clearly distinguish different schemes launched by a Mutual Fund 

in  terms  of  asset  allocation,  investment  strategy  etc.  A  need  has  also  been  felt  to  bring 

uniformity in the characteristics of similar type of schemes launched by different Mutual Funds 

so that an investor finds it easier to compare similar funds. 

 

In  order  to  bring  in  uniformity  and  to  standardize  the  scheme  categories  as  well  as 

characteristics  of  each  category,  SEBI,  has  issued  a  circular  on  October  6,  2017  laying  down 

the categories of schemes, its characteristics and uniform description for each category. 

 
The full text of the circular is available on the website: www.sebi.gov.in
