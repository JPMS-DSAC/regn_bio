In pursuance of Justice Wadhwa Committee Report, SEBI has appointed Shri Vijay Ranjan as an Administrator for implementation of recommendations of Justice D. P. Wadhwa Committee Report on reallocation in the matter of IPO irregularities.  Shri Ranjan retired as Chief Commissioner of Income Tax and was associated with SEBI as an Executive Director in the past.
 
In the matter of IPO irregularities, SEBI had initiated proceedings against certain key operators and financiers involved, to penalize them and disgorge the ill-gotten gains these entities had made. SEBI has been successful in disgorging a part of the gains that such entities have made. It intends to continue its efforts to disgorge further sums in future on completing the legal/consent proceedings currently in progress.
