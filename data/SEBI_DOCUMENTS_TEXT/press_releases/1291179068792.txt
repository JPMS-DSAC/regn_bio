PRESS RELEASE 

 

Allocation of debt investment limits 

The  Government  of  India  has  reviewed  the  External  Commercial  Borrowing 
policy  and  has  increased  the  cumulative  debt  investment  limits  from  US  $3.2 
billion to US $5 billion and US $1.5 billion to US $3 billion for FII investments in 
Government Securities and Corporate Debt, respectively. 

The  enhanced  limits  have  been  allocated  to  the  registered  entities  on  a  ‘first 
come first served’ basis in terms of our Circular dated January 31, 2008, subject 
to a ceiling of US $200 million per registered entity. The list of the allottees and 
the allocated limits are given in the Annexure. 

After including the investments by FIIs in debt mutual funds in corporate debt, the 
earlier permissible limit of US $1.5 billion was overutilised and presently stands 
at US $1.527.billion. Therefore, US $1.473 billion out of the enhanced corporate 
debt limit has been allotted.  

In  terms  of  the  aforementioned  circular,  in  case  the  allocated  limits  are  not 
utilized by the allotted entities within 15 days, the same shall be withdrawn and 
allotted to the entities in the waitlist. The waitlisted entities are also indicated.
