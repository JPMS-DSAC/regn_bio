     3.         The Depositories shall not give effect to any transfer of shares of the companies listed as per Table  above,  lying in the beneficial owner accounts of clients mentioned in table 
 
The order has been passed by Shri G.Anantharaman, Whole Time Member, SEBI in the following context: 
 
Galaxy has played a major role in generating artificial volumes and rise in the prices of large number of penny stocks. The burgeoning volumes created through the artifice of a web of off market/market transfers and trading between a common set of inter-connected clients, some of whom have also been funded by allowing them to maintain a large debit balances, and the tell-tale strands of inter-locking deals intermediated by the broker speak volumes about the penny stock manipulation in the most brazen way, thereby vitiating the market. Generation of this large volume, through artificial demand and supply has also helped in ramping up prices of companies which otherwise had lackluster performance which did not justify the spurt in share prices. The promoters of these companies offloaded their shareholding at higher prices, a fact which has also been brought out in the order of SEBI in the cases of Mega Corporation and Karuna Cables. It was also seen that promoters /directors were closely associated with some of the companies in which Galaxy, its directors and other inter-connected clients traded.  Most of the inter-connected clients were also appeared in the recent orders of SEBI. 
 
The order set details which highlight the most unedifying role of Galaxy in creating false market in the shares of penny stocks and inveigling investors to trade in these stocks. 
 
In doing so, Galaxy has prima-facie violated the following:-
 
a.                  Regulation 4 (2) (a) and (d) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003.
b.                  Regulation 18B, A (2), (3), (4), and (5), B (6) of Code of conduct prescribed as per Regulation 7of SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992.
c.                  SEBI Circular No.SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-15/2004 dated March 19, 2004 read with SEBI/MRD/SE/SU/Cir-16/04 dated March 31, 2004.
d.                  SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir- 33/2003/27/08 dated                           August 27, 2003.
e.                  SEBI Circular SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-49/2001 dated October 22, 2001.
f.                    SEBI Circular SEBI/MIRSD/DPS-1/Cir-31/2004 dated August 26, 2004.
