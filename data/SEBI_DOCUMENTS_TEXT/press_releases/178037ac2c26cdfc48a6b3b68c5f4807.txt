PRESS RELEASE
PR-127/2006
 
Order in the matter of IPOs
 
Shri G.Anantharaman, Whole Time Member, SEBI vide order dated April 27, 2006 has issued ex-parte ad interim order in the matter of Initial Public Offerings.
 
In the recent past while examining off-market transactions in the IPOs of Yes Bank Ltd. (‘YBL’) and Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited (‘IDFC’), it came to the notice of SEBI that certain entities had cornered IPO shares reserved for retail applicants by making applications in the retail category through the medium of thousands of beneficiary accounts in the name of fictitious/benami entities with each of the application being of small value so as to be eligible for allotment under retail category. After the allotment, these fictitious/ benami allottees transferred these shares to their principals who in turn transferred the shares to their financiers. Most of these shares were sold immediately on listing.
 
SEBI conducted investigations in respect of all the IPOs during the period from January 2003 to December 2005. The findings of investigations so far, prima facie, reveal violations of serious nature by the key operators, their financiers, concerned DPs and the depositories including violation of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and Depositories Act, 1996 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. SEBI has issued directions against the concerned entities.
