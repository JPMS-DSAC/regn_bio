Shri Prashant Saran, Whole Time Member, SEBI, has passed an order on September 12, 2014 in the matter of M/s Maitreya Plotters and Structures Private Limited (MPSPL). The order confirms the directions issued vide the SEBI interim order dated August 30, 2013 against Maitreya Plotters and Structures Private Limited and its directors, Mrs. Varsha Madhusudan Satpalkar and Mr. Janardan Arvind Parulekar, till the SEBI examination into the business affairs of the Company is concluded. The order also directed MPSPL and its said directors to co-operate with SEBI in the examination and furnish all documents and records as sought for by SEBI.

Accordingly, SEBI had passed an ex-parte interim order against the MPSPL and its directors Mrs. Varsha Madhusudan Satpalkar and Mr. Janardan Arvind Parulekar on August 30, 2013.
