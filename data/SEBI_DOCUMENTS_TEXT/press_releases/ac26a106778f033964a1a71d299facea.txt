DIVISION OF ISSUES & LISTING
Of late, some instances of misuse of preferential allotment route by promoters to enrich themselves at the cost of other shareholders, have come to the notice of SEBI. Apparently, promoters are taking advantage of bull run by offloading shares at ruling market prices (which are much higher) and going in for a preferential allotment at minimum price as per the formula given in SEBI (DIP) guidelines (which are lower than current market prices). As such, promoters are profiteering from the bull run and are also in a position to maintain their stake through preferential allotments made to themselves. To address the above concerns, SEBI decided to review the Preferential Allotment Guidelines on an urgent basis to incorporate proper checks. 
In this regard, SEBI convened a meeting of Primary Market Advisory Committee on 01.12.2003. The Committee, after deliberating on the issue, has given its recommendations 
The same have been put for public comments on SEBI’s website www.sebi.gov.in under the heading "REVIEW OF SEBI (DIP) GUIDELINES 2000 –PROPOSALS – SERIES VI" in the sub-section "Reports for Public Comments" in section "Reports/Documents" for a period of 7 days i.e. from 12/12/2003 to 18/12/2003. 
Comments/suggestions on the same may be sent to Ms Neelam Bhardwaj, Deputy General Manager, Division of issues and listing, SEBI or to Ms Usha Rangarajan, SEBI or emailed to neelamb@sebi.gov.in / usher@sebi.gov.in or faxed to 91-22-22045633 on or before December 18, 2003.
