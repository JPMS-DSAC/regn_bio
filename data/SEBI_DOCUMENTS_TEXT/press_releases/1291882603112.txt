Appeals before the Securities Appellate Tribunal - A perspective 

 
The  Enforcement  Department,  in  an  internal  research  effort,  has  tabulated  the 
result of appeals preferred before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) from 
the years 2000 to the year 2006. This research imparts a proper perspective with 
respect to SEBI orders which are challenged before SAT.  
 
The appeals have been tabulated into three categories a) where SEBI’s orders 
have been upheld fully b) where SEBI’s orders have been upheld on merits but 
the Hon’ble Tribunal has reduced the penalty and c) where SEBI’s orders were 
overturned. 
  
As reduction of penalty is considered as upholding the rationale and merits of the 
case, the same are considered as upheld in favour of SEBI, though the quantum 
of penalty is reduced. It can be seen from the chart that over the past 7 years, 
cases where SEBI’s orders are upheld is over 80%. In the year 2006 the rate is 
nearly 90%. These figures do not include cases where the aggrieved party chose 
not  to  file  an  appeal  before  the  Hon’ble  tribunal.  As  a large  number  of  SEBI 
cases are not appealed, the rate presented in the chart would be under-stated 
since the party potentially aggrieved itself has not filed an appeal. 
 
The chart is given below:
