eXtensible Business Reporting Language(XBRL) is the result of the quest for a solution in the area of business Reporting along with the capabilities of XML for electronically reporting of information. XBRL has emerged as a popular and effective alternative for reporting and analysis.  In December 2008, the Indian XBRL Jurisdiction (XBRL India) was constituted by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, as a formal forum for encouraging the adoption of XBRL in India. It is expected that the said workshop and the conference would provide a wonderful opportunity to all concerned to gain from the experience of foreign counterparts and to know the road map for implementation of XBRL in India.
