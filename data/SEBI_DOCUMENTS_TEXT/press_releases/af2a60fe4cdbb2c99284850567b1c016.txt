Attention of SEBI has been drawn to news items appearing in a section of press wherein certain comments have been made about the pace of investigations completed during the year 2011-12.
From the news items, it is noted that the data of entire years in the past has been compared with a part of the year 2011-12 and distorted inferences have been drawn. The correct position for the last three years is as under:-
Year                       Cases taken up for investigation         Cases completed
2009-10                                  71                                                 74
2010-11                                104                                                  82
2011-12                                154                                                  74                                                        
As may also be seen, SEBI has initiated more number of investigations during the year 2011-12.
Further, the half yearly break-up of investigation cases completed during the last two years is as under:
Year                       Cases completed (Apr-Sept)      Cases completed (Oct-Mar)
2010-11                            14                                               68
2011-12                               4                                               70
