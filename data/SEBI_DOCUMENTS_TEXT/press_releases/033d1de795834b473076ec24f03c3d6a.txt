SEBI has issued SEBI (ESOS & ESPS) Guidelines, 1999 to enable listed companies to reward their employees through stock option schemes and stock purchase schemes. Based on the requests/ suggestions/ recommendations received from various market participants, it is proposed to replace the extant guidelines with a set of regulations to ensure better enforceability, provide for a regulatory framework for all kinds of employee benefit schemes involving securities of the company, address the concerns raised with regard to composition of employee welfare trusts, disclosures, etc. and to enable secondary market transactions with adequate safeguards. The recommendations based on which regulations are to be framed are placed as Annexure to the discussion paper.
