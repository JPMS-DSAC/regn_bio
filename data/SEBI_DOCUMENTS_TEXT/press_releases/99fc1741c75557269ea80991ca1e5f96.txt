PRESS RELEASE
PR No.147/2007

 
SEBI permits listed companies to send abridged annual report to shareholders
 
SEBI permits listed companies to send a statement containing the salient features of the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Account and Auditors’ Report to each shareholder instead of the present requirement of sending a copy of the complete and full Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss account and Director’s Report. However, on a written request from a shareholder, the company shall send the complete and full Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Account and Auditors’ Report to the said shareholder.
 
In this connection, SEBI has directed all stock exchanges to amend the relevant provisions in Clause 32 of the Equity Listing Agreement.
The said direction is with a view to contain rising cost of compliance and the increasing availability of information about listed companies in public domain such as the website of the company, of the stock exchanges and of the common filing platform jointly maintained by BSE and NSE.
 
The other provisions of Clause 32 of the Equity Listing Agreement pertaining to turnover and income etc. from new activities, cash flow statement to be given along with the Profit and Loss account, shall remain unchanged.
 
The amendments shall come into force with immediate effect.
 
The full text of the circular is available on the website: www.sebi.gov.in
