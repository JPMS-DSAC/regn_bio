 PR No.184/2010
SEBI Board Meeting
The Board met on August 04, 2010 in Mumbai and took the following decisions:
Shareholding pattern of listed entities
Currently, the shareholding pattern of companies is contained in initial public offer document and upon listing, companies file shareholding pattern with stock exchanges every quarter. The Board decided to mandate that the companies shall file shareholding pattern as per Clause 35 one day prior to the date of listing, which shall be uploaded on the website of exchanges before commencement of trading.
The Board also decided that in order to ensure updated public dissemination of shareholding pattern, whenever the change exceeds +/- 2% of the paid up share capital of the company post a corporate event, the companies shall file revised shareholding pattern with the stock exchanges within 10 days from the date of such change in the capital structure.
The Board further decided that in the quarterly shareholding pattern, the disclosure of shares held by custodians, against which depository receipts have been issued, shall  be classified as 'promoter/promoter group' and 'non-promoter'.
