Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has from time to time put in place various risk containment measures to address the risks involved in the cash and derivatives market. But as the market is always in a dynamic state, the risk management system cannot remain static and has to constantly address the changing risk profile of the market. SEBI has prepared a discussion paper covering various alternative schools of thoughts on steps that can be taken to further fine tune the risk management system. The same has been placed in public domain on the SEBI website for eliciting views/comments/suggestions from various stakeholders. The paper specifically covers the following:
 

Incentivising Internet Based Trading models posing minimal risk
Mitigation of risk to client collateral
T+1 settlement as a measure to reduce overall risk in the system

 
Comments on the discussion paper may be forwarded to Deputy General Manager, Market Regulation Department – Division of Risk Management and New Products, SEBI Bhavan, Plot C4-A, G Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai – 400051 or sent by e-mail to drmnp-feedback@sebi.gov.in  on or before May 20, 2013.
