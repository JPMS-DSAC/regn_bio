listing of equity share capital of companies incorporated in India on foreign
exchanges and vice versaCompanies
incorporated in India can today list their debt securities on international
exchanges (Masala Bonds) but their equity share capital can be listed abroad
only through the ADR / GDR route. Similarly, companies incorporated outside
India can access the Indian capital markets only through the IDR route. Thus,
presently, direct listing of equity share capital of companies incorporated in
India is not permitted on foreign exchanges and vice versa. Considering
the evolution and internationalization of the Capital Markets, it would be
worthwhile to consider facilitating companies incorporated in India to directly
list their equity share capital abroad and vice versa. In this regard, it has
been decided to constitute an Expert Committee to look into this aspect in
detail. 
The
broad Terms of Reference of
the Committee would be to –Examine in detail the economic case for permitting direct
listing of Indian companies overseas and vice versa;Examine various legal, operational and regulatory
constraints in facilitating companies incorporated in India to directly list
their equity share capital abroad and vice versa; and Make recommendations for a suitable framework in
which to facilitate such direct listing. The
composition of the expert committee is as under:  Sl.
