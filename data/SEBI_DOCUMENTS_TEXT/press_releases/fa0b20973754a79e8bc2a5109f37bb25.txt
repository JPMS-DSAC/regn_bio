Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its silver jubilee year, is organizing its First International Research Conference during January 27-28, 2014 in Mumbai. The theme of the Conference is “HFT, Algo Trading and Co-location”.  SEBI has invited academicians/market practitioners/regulators, having experience in the field, from countries such as USA, Spain, Australia, Canada, Japan, India etc.
 
The rise of High frequency trading (HFT) has provoked concerns with regard to its impact on market quality, financial stability, information asymmetry and regulatory framework. There is a divide in pool of thoughts over positive impact of HFT (increased market liquidity, market depth and decreasing bid-ask spread) and associated risks (high message traffic, technology failure, extreme events, rogue algorithms). Because of its relative novelty and the uncertainty related to many of the trading strategies being used today, the debate over high frequency trading is of contemporary relevance. As both old and new emerging markets continue to become highly digitized, algorithmic trading strategies will constantly advance.
 
During the one and a half days of the conference, the participants would discuss issues related to impact of HFT on Market Quality, Financial Stability, Information asymmetry and retail investors, HFT in developing countries, regulatory mechanism and technology as an enabler to re-level the field. The detailed programme schedule of SEBI's First International Research Conference is placed on SEBI website.
