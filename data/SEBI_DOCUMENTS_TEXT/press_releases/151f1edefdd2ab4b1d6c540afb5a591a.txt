Online forms for Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) facility
 
SEBI has been soliciting feedback from market about ASBA facility on an ongoing basis. Non-availability / limited availability of ASBA forms with Self Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs) has often been cited as one of the reasons for investors not being able to effectively use ASBA facility.
 
In order to make ASBA form easily available to investors, SEBI has, in consultation with Stock Exchanges, made it possible for investors to download and print ASBA application form from the website of BSE or NSE. Each ASBA form, so downloaded, shall have a unique application number which is important from control and processing point of view. Therefore application made using photocopy of the downloaded form shall not be accepted.
 
The circular giving details of this facility, issued to all intermediaries is available on www.sebi.gov.in
