PR No.:  
41/2013


SEBI has issued a circular dated April 17, 2013 stating that, pursuant to the provisions of Section 15C of SEBI Act, 1992, all listed companies are called upon to redress the grievances of investors and inform them within 30 days of the receipt of the complaints.  
 
SEBI has, vide this circular, also directed that the companies which are yet to obtain SCORES user ID and password are required to send their details as per the annexure to the circular to SEBI and scores@sebi.gov.in and obtain the SCORES user ID and password. In case of failure to obtain the SCORES user ID and password within 30 days of issue of this circular, the same would not only be deemed as non redressal of investor grievances but also indicate wilful avoidance of the same.
 
It has been directed further, that the failure by the companies to file Action Taken Reports under SCORES within 30 days of date of receipt of the grievance may also attract the provisions of Sec 15A(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992.
 
The circular shall come into force with immediate effect.
 
The full text of the circular is available on the website: www.sebi.gov.in
