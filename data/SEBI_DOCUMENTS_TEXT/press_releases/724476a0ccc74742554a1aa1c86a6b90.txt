PRESS RELEASE
December 17, 2003 PR No.311/2003
CORPORATION FINANCE DEPARTMENT
DIVISION OF ISSUES & LISTING
SEBI, in its constant endeavour to ensure that shareholders are provided with adequate and comprehensive information, enabling them to take an informed decision, has been continuously reviewing the disclosure standards both initial and continuous, by listed companies. 
Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956 specifies the parameters of the disclosures which should be given to the shareholders / creditors, for approving a scheme of arrangement. It has been noted that the companies undergoing restructuring under Sections 391 & 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 have not been providing sufficient information in the notice/ explanatory statement calling for shareholders’ meeting for approving the same. It is therefore felt that certain minimum disclosures need to be mandated in notices for such schemes. SEBI has proposed a minimum set of disclosures within the broad parameters specified under Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956, which would be enforced through the provisions of listing agreement. 
The proposed set of disclosures as envisaged by SEBI has been put on SEBI’s website (www.sebi.gov.in) under the heading Proposed disclosures for schemes under Sections 391-394 of the Companies Act, 1956" in the sub-section "Reports for Public Comments" in section "Reports/Documents". The same will be available for a period of 21 days for seeking public comments from 17/12/2003 to 07/01/2004. 
Comments suggesting any additions/deletions/modifications in the proposed set of disclosures may be sent to Ms. Neelam Bhardwaj, DGM, Corporation Finance Department, Division of Issues & Listing, SEBI or emailed to neelamb@sebi.gov.in / pradeepr@sebi.gov.in or faxed to 91-22-22045633 on or before January 2, 2004.
