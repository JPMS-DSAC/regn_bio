Common platform for electronic filing and dissemination of information about listed companies
In order to enhance transparency and efficiency of the securities market, SEBI had advised the two major stock exchanges, Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd. (BSE) and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE), to explore the possibility of setting up a common electronic platform which should aim at    (i) providing a single window filing to listed companies irrespective of multiple listing, (ii) eliminating paper filing with the Stock Exchanges  (iii)covering all listed companies (including companies listed in Stock Exchanges other than BSE and NSE) and (iv) being a one stop shop for sourcing corporate information of listed companies by investors.
Accordingly on January 01, 2007, BSE and NSE jointly launched the common platform at www.corpfiling.co.in which is jointly owned, managed and maintained by the two exchanges. In the first phase since its launch, the platform has been disseminating filings made by companies listed on these exchanges. In the second phase which will be effective from April 02, 2007, the platform will enable electronic filing by companies listed in BSE and NSE.
Full details about the filing platform and the phased manner of implementing the same would be announced by BSE and NSE in a joint press release to be issued by them.
