SUBJECT: REPORT OF THE GROUP ON DEMAT CHARGES
ISSUED BY : MARKET REGULATION DEPARTMENT - DIVISION OF POLICY 

 


SEBI has been receiving several representations from investors regarding the high cost of operating in a demat environment. There is also a perception in certain quarters that small investors are being overcharged and that the charges are beyond the capacity of certain class of investors. In order the examine these issues in the light of various research reports, press articles and representations made to SEBI, SEBI had set up an internal group. 

 


The report of the group has placed on the SEBI’s website (www.sebi.gov.in) for public comments. 

 
The comments, if any, on this report may please be forwarded to Shri V.S. Sundaresan, Deputy General Manager, SEBI or may be emailed to Ms. Sangeeta Uchil at sangeetau@sebi.gov.in on or before February 20, 2004.
