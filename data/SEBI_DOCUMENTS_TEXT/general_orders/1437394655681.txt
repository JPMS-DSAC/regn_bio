General Order No.1 of 2015 

SEBI  (Prohibition  on  Raising  Further  Capital  From  Public  and  Transfer  of 
Securities of Suspended Companies) Order, 2015. 
 
Under section 11A read with section 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India Act 1992. 
___________________________________________________________________ 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

1.  In terms of section 21 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 read with 
section 11A of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Act  ("SEBI Act "), all 
listed  companies  are  mandated  to  comply  with  listing  conditions  prescribed  under 
the equity listing agreement. Section 11A of the SEBI Act empowers SEBI to prohibit 
any company from issuing prospectus, etc. soliciting money from public for issue of 
securities  and  to  specify  requirements,    for  transfer  of  securities  and  matters 
incidental thereto. 
 

2.  Disclosures by the listed companies, as per the equity listing agreement, apart from 
empowering  investors  to  have  requisite  information  so  as  to  make  investment 
decision,  has  significant  bearing  on  price  discovery,  prevention  of 
fraud/ 
manipulation and has an overall impact on market integrity, etc.  It has been noticed 
that  several  listed  companies  continuously  fail  to  comply  with  listing  conditions 
stipulated  under  the  equity  listing  agreement  and  consequently  trading  in  their 
shares is suspended by the concerned recognised stock exchange. While the non-
promoter  shareholders  of  such  companies  remain  in  disadvantageous  position  on 
account of information asymmetry, their promoters/directors, who are responsible for 
such defaults, can use the undisclosed information about the company and dispose 
of  their  shareholding  in  the  company  leaving  the  gullible  investors  in  lurch.  Thus, 
such  non-compliance  jeopardise  the  interests  of  investors  in  such  companies  and 
adversely impact the market integrity.  
 

3.  In  order  to  ensure  effective  enforcement  of  listing  conditions  and  improve 
compliance  environment  among  the  listed  companies  and  taking  into  account  the 
interests of investors in securities and the securities market, it is felt necessary to 
strengthen the regulatory mechanism in the above regard. Accordingly, in exercise 
of powers conferred under sections 11 and 11A of the SEBI Act, in order to protect 
the interest of investors, it is hereby ordered that-  

a)  a  suspended  company,  its  holding  and/or  subsidiary,  its  promoters  and 

directors shall not, issue prospectus, any offer document, or advertisement

soliciting  money  from  the  public  for  the  issue  of  securities,  directly  or 
indirectly;  till  the  suspension  is  revoked  by  the  concerned  recognised  stock 
exchange or securities of such company are delisted in accordance with the 
applicable delisting requirements, whichever is earlier: 

Provided that SEBI may, in the interest of trade and securities market, relax 
the strict enforcement of this restriction on recommendation of the concerned 
stock  exchange  in  case  of  companies,  other  than  aforementioned,  wherein 
such promoters are also promoters/directors; 

b)  the suspended company and the depositories shall not effect transfer, by way 
of sale, pledge, etc., of shares of a suspended company held by promoters 
/promoter group and directors till  three months after the date of revocation of 
suspension by the concerned recognised stock exchange or till securities of 
such  company  are  delisted  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  delisting 
requirements,  whichever 
is  earlier.  The  concerned  recognised  stock 
exchange  and  depositories  shall  co-ordinate  with  each  other  for  ensuring 
compliance of this requirement.  Such promoter/director may file objection, if 
any,  before  the  concerned  recognised  stock  exchange  who  may,  on 
satisfactory reasons shown by such promoter/director, remove this restriction 
in accordance with its applicable rule, regulations and bye-laws.  

4.  For  the  aforesaid  purposes,  "suspended  company"  means  a  listed  company  in 
whose shares trading is suspended from trading by the recognised stock exchange 
on account of non compliance with listing requirements.  

 

5.  This Order shall come into force with immediate effect.
