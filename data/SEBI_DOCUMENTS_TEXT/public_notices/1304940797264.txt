PUBLIC NOTICE TO THE INVESTORS OF 

SAHARA INDIA REAL ESTATE CORPORATION LIMITED AND  
SAHARA HOUSING INVESTMENT CORPORATION LIMITED 

 
SEBI  had  passed  an  ad  interim  restraint  order  dated  November  24,  2010  against 
Sahara  India  Real  Estate  Corporation  Limited  (SIRECL),  Sahara  Housing  Investment 
Corporation Limited (SHICL) and the persons named as promoters and directors in the 
respective  red-herring  prospectus  (RHP)  with  respect  to  issuance  of  Optionally  Fully 
Convertible Debentures (OFCDs).  
 
SIRECL had challenged SEBI’s order in a writ petition filed before Lucknow bench of 
the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court. By its interim order dated December 13, 2010, the 
Hon’ble High Court inter alia stayed the operation of the SEBI order with liberty to SEBI 
to proceed with the inquiry but restraining SEBI from taking final decision. In   a special 
leave  petition  filed  by  SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  India  by  its  order  dated 
January  4,  2011  inter-alia  observed  that  SEBI  would  be  entitled  to  call  for  any 
information which it deems fit including the names of the investors who have invested in 
OFCDs   in the course of the inquiry undertaken by it. 
 
On April 5,2011, SEBI filed an application  before the  Hon’ble  High Court for vacation 
of the interim order dated December 13, 2010 and dismissal of the writ petition on the 
ground  that  the  said  interim  order  is  not  complied  with  till  date  and  the  requisite 
information as asked for by SEBI has not been provided.  
 
The investors are hereby informed that on April 07, 2011, the Hon’ble High Court inter-
alia observed that the information furnished by the petitioners (to SEBI) in the process 
of inquiry cannot be said to be any information in the eyes of law, within the directives 
issued by the Court and that they do not find any ground to continue with the interim 

order.  Hence,  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  vacated  its  interim  order  dated  December  13, 
2010 for the own conduct of the petitioners (Copy of the order).
