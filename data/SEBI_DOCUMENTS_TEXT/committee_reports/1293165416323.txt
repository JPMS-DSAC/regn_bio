 Introduction:

CONFIDENTIAL

As the volume of securities trading in the global marketplace has increased in the
recent years, the need for shortening the settlement and clearance cycle as a cost
saving and risk management discipline has become critical to the orderly conduct
of  business.  As  a  result  many  entities  around  the  world  are  adopting  shorter
settlement  cycles.  In  fact,  in  the  United  States  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission is likely to mandate T+1 settlement by June 2004. Following the US
markets,  it  is  expected  that  most  of  the  European  markets  too  would  move
towards T + 1 thus heralding a new era of extremely short settlement cycles.

In India too the volumes in the domestic markets have increased substantially over
the years .  The cross border trades or more popularly known as FII trades have
also  increased  over  a  period  of  time.  April  1,  2002  was  a  landmark  day  in  the
Indian capital market history as we joined  the league of developed markets in the
world  by  introduction  of  the  T  +  3  settlement  cycle  from  the  earlier  weekly
settlement cycles. However, this implied that the increased volume of trades would
now have to be settled in a shorter span of time.

A  shorter  settlement  cycle  puts  pressure  on  the  entire  delivery  channel  post
execution. Failed trades increase cost of transactions making the markets overall
expensive and risky to invest. This may lead to a fall in the allocations made to our
markets by overseas investors. For a developing capital scarce country like India,
we need to attract as much investment as possible. For this, we need to mandate
better  settlement  systems  in  our  markets  and  thus  move  towards  more
automation.

The current trade-processing environment is characterised by manual procedures,
multiple  service  providers,  incompatible  databases,  lack  of  standardisation,
excessive costs and high rate of trade failures.  There is an urgent need to create
adaptable and flexible communication infrastructures to ensure that information is
shared between partners and there is a smooth transition from trade initiation to
settlement.

CONFIDENTIAL

Straight  Through  Processing  (STP)  aims  to  achieve  exactly  this.  With  STP,
firms  must  automate  processes  within 
to
communicate  with  multiple 
trading  partners  using  multiple  communication
standards with ease and flexibility.

themselves  and 

then  be  able 

The Securities Industry Association has defined STP as.
"The  processing  of  a  trade,  whose  data  is  compliant  with  internal  and
external  requirements,  through  systems  from  post-execution  through
settlement without manual intervention".
Simply  put  it  means  seamless  integration  of  trades  from  initiation  to  settlement
without  manual  intervention.  STP  aims  at  maximum  automation  so  as  to  reduce
human errors, increase speed of operation and reduce failed trades.

Eliminating  manual  trade  entry  reduces  the  probability  of  trade  errors  while
automating  message  creation  and  transmission  and  is  an  important  step  in
achieving STP.

Failure  to  achieve  STP  can  have  negative  consequences  like  high  trading  costs
due  to  trade  failures  and  inefficiencies,  increased  levels  of  risk  and  exposure  to
trade parties, reduced customer satisfaction and volume sensitivity.

In  order  to  fully  achieve  STP,  the  Indian  securities  needs  to  look  at  the  entire
trading process as a single integrated process with trade advancing through these
steps seamlessly, efficiently and cost effectively. STP will affect every step in the
trade life cycle from initiation to post settlement.

The benefits of STP are:
1.  Reduced risk, fewer trade fails.
2.  Improved operational efficiency in handling larger volumes.
3.  Facilitates movement towards shorter settlement cycles.
4.  Enables increased cross border trading (FII trades).
5.  Greater transparency with clear audit trail.
6.  Real time information to regulators foster better market surveillance.
7.  Increases competitive advantage of our markets.

Current execution and settlement systems:

Before we go to examine the feasibility of STP in the Indian market and its impact,
let us first understand the current settlement systems, how an order is processed
and the various processes initiated by various entities related to the trade process.
Settlement processes need streamlining if STP is to work in our markets.

Lifecycle of a cross border trade deal

In the present system, the fund manager places an order with the broker, who in
turn input them into the screen based trading system of the stock exchanges. After
the deal is confirmed, the stock exchange gives the data to the broker who prints
contract  notes  from  his  database  for  each  client.  Thus  electronic  form  of  data  is
converted 
into  physical  form.  He  also  sends  an  ETC  (Electronic  Trade
Confirmation) message to the client who may accept or reject the deal based on

CONFIDENTIAL

his  internal  tolerances.  The  contract  notes  are  also  faxed  to  the  fund  managers
who input these into their system for valuation and accounting. At this time, paper
form of data is again converted into electronic form at the fund managers level. A
copy  of  the  contract  note  is  also  sent  to  the  local  custodian  for  his  record  who
again enters the entire contract note into his system, again resulting in re-entry of
the same data. The lifecycle of a cross border trade deal is depicted in Annexure
1.

The custodian at its end would match this contract note with the client instructions
that they receive (generally through SWIFT network) and the matched trades are
taken for settlement.

As  can  be  seen  from  the  entire  cycle  above,  there  is  multiple  data  entry;  at  the
brokers end, clients end and custodians end. The exchange also has this data in
its  system.  It  is  this  part  of  manual  intervention  that  is  susceptible  to  errors  and
may lead to trade fails.  India incidentally ranks very low on settlement efficiencies
and a small study on the same is tabled below:

Sources: Global Custodian & JPMorgan TradeS.T.A.R.R.

Thus  to  avoid  trade  fails,  which  is  one  of  the  biggest  costs  of  trading,  it  is
imperative that any kind of communication issue is sorted out.

Committee views:

The committee has been set up to make recommendations regarding feasibility of
introduction of STP in the Indian market. In the first meeting itself, the committee
decided  to  form  a  sub-group  under  the  leadership  of  Mr.  Raghavan  Puthran,
Director NSEIL and make recommendations regarding the standards that need to
be adopted for making STP successful. The sub-group comprising of the following
members had several rounds of discussions -

?  Citibank NA
?  Standard Chartered Grindlays Bank
?  National Securities Depository Ltd
?  Central Depository Services I Ltd
?  Bombay Stock Exchange
?  National Stock Exchange of India Ltd

They have submitted a draft of the recommended messaging standards which is
attached alongwith.

purpose.  It  was  noted  that  RBI  is  already  in  the  process  of  devising  messaging
standards for funds flow, and all market participants may adopt and integrate with
the messaging standards that is found suitable for their operations.

1.2 Securities Information Flow:

Considering  the  current  scenario  of  T+3  settlements  and  the  need  for  T+1
confirmations, the following three activities have been identified for the purpose of
embarking  on  straight  through  processing  (STP)  initiative,  and  felt  the  need  to
adopt international messaging standards as a first step towards achieving STP,

? 
trade reporting by trading members to custodians
? 
trade confirmation by custodians to stock exchanges
?  settlement instructions from the AMC to custodians

2. Messaging Standards:

It  was  felt  necessary  to  protect  existing  investments  in  infrastructure  and
considering the various legacy systems that each of the market participant
may follow, it was felt that adopting global messaging standards will be a
first step in the right direction towards achieving STP.

international  messaging  standards  viz. 

The  various 
ISO  15022,
FINXML,FIX,  FPML,  OFX  etc.  were  mentioned  and  it  was  felt  that  ISO
15022  initiative  be  adopted  as  the  messaging  standard.  XML  as  an
emerging  technology  was  discussed  and  it  was  felt  that  ISO  15022  XML
standards may be adopted as and when they are published.

Messaging  standards  for  the  above-mentioned  transaction  flows  were
drafted and are appended to this report.

The  availability  of  global  solutions  for  STP,  transaction  flow  manager  etc.
were discussed and it was felt that advocating the use of any of these is not
necessary  and  will  be  best  left  to  the  needs  of  each  of  the  market
participants.

2.  Network Infrastructure:

Steps Forward

?  Based on a review of the above, the sub-group was of the opinion that there
will be significant benefits by adopting STP in the above-mentioned transaction
flows.  Draft  message  formats  have  been  recommended,  based  on  global
messaging  standards.  However,  going  forward,  the  group  would  have  to
finalise  this  recommendation,  as  well  as  review  and  identify  a  suitable
communications  infrastructure,  addressing  the  varied  needs  of  all  market
participants, as well as ensuring a cost-effective, secure setup.

?  During the discussions, it was also felt that a need exists for carrying out such
an activity for the derivatives market and it was recommended that a detailed
study of the process flow for the derivatives market also be done.

?  The group was of the view that SEBI should discuss the issue alongwith  fund
managers  and  brokers  separately  so  that  the  views  of  a  critical  part  of  the
whole  trade  process  may  also  be  covered.  Committee  members  were  of  the
opinion that since it the fund manager who is a business/revenue provider as
well  the  originator  of  the  trade,  automation  at  their  level  is  most  critical  in
achieving  a  reasonable  level  of  STP.  Accordingly,  a  meeting  has  been
scheduled on 10th June 2002 with brokers as well as fund managers.

?  Subsequent to the above meeting, the committee would meet again and then
decide  the  time  frame  within  which  the  recommended  standards  would  be
made public for their comments and further course of action is decided therein.
All  committee  members  were  of  the  opinion  that  it  would  take  atleast  six
months from the date of establishing messaging standards for implementation
of STP.

? 

It was also proposed that a pilot project about STP may be undertaken with a
few clients of Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank to find out the operational
bottlenecks that may arise later.

Inter-connectivity between market participants’  networks  was  felt  as  an  essential
requirement for facilitating STP. Given the large number of intermediaries that will
be  involved  in  such  a  multi-lateral  communication  setup,  direct  WAN  to  WAN
connectivity between participants will not be a cost-effective and feasible option.
Given the existence of an RBI sponsored infrastructure (INFINET) one option that
was  reviewed  by  the  group  is  to  request  RBI  to  permit  the  use  of  INFINET  to
support  the  Capital  Markets  STP  initiative,  by  providing  a  secure  and  robust
communications network between participants.

In  the  event  that  INFINET  is  not  a  viable  option,  the  group  also  took  note  of  a
relatively new communication infrastructure, viz. VPN, virtual private network. This
uses  the  public  Internet  network  for  providing  a  secure  connectivity/inter-
connectivity  infrastructure  without  comprising  on  security  issues.  Wherever
possible  and  required  (e.g.  communication  between  trading  members  and
custodians), the use of digital signatures is recommended.

Introduction

This document contains the templates to be used for messaging between entities
in  the  capital  market.    The  Subgroup  has  mapped  the  messaging  requirements
with the standards published by ISO15022. These were found to generally meet
the  Indian  market  requirement.  It  may  become  necessary  to  refine  the  formats
from  time  to  time  based  on  the  actual  usage.  Further  there  may  be  a  need  to
add/delete message types to the existing list depending on the changing market
practices.

The templates defined cater to the following legs in the transaction chain
?  Settlement Instruction from Fund House to Custodian (Equity / Debt)
?  Contract Note from Broker to Custodian (Equity / Debt)
?  Order File from Exchange to Custodian
?  Confirmation File from Custodian to Exchange

NOTE
The following adjustments need to be noted

The message format recommended for confirmation to the clearinghouse (IFN580)
is an acceptable format on SWIFT only for communication between clearers and
Euroclear (or CEDEL). While this does not preclude its usage, if these messages
were  to  be  transmitted  on  SWIFT  network,  a  separate  application  to  SWIFT
requesting usage will probably be necessary.

The Contract Note messaging (IFN 515) assumes that brokers will use OTR option
for  clearinghouse  trades  on  the  NSE.  If  this  were  not  adopted,  the  process  will
result in tedious multiple messages, which must be avoided. Therefore it must be
made mandatory that clearinghouse trades on the NSE are conducted through the
OTR segment.

Addressing
For purpose of addressing, the following rules will

be followed

?  Each message will be preceded by a header and succeeded by a trailer.
?  The header will contain information regarding

1.  The Message Type
2.  The Sender Address
3.  The Recipient Address

?  Each of the above will be encompassed in curly braces
?  The trailer will consist of a hyphen followed by a right curly braces " -} "
