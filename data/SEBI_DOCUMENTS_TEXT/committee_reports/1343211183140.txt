Public Issues by General Insurance Companies 

 

1.  Background: 

The  report  of  the  sub-group  on  “Public  Issues  by  Insurance  Companies” 
submitted to SCODA was discussed in the meeting of SCODA held on March 
15, 2010.  Following were the members of the Sub-group:- 

a)  Dr. Subramanian, Head-IBD, Enam Securities Ltd. 
b)  Ms. Dipti Neelakantan, MD & Group COO, JM Financial Consultants 
c)  Shri Prithvi Haldea, CMD, Prime Database 
d)  Shri R K Sharma, Deputy Director, IRDA 
e)  Shri Shravan Jalan, Director, Ernst & Young 
f)  Shri Sunil Kadam, General Manager, SEBI 

 
SCODA has accepted the recommendations of the sub-group for life insurance 
companies however, the sub-group was advised to identify additional disclosure 
requirement  for  General  Insurance  Companies.  The  report  of  the  sub-group 
with the suggestions given by SCODA was placed before the SEBI Board in its 
meeting  held  on  October  25,  2010  and  the  same  was  approved.  Copy  of  the 
report approved by the SEBI Board is enclosed as Annexure I. 
 
The recommendation of the sub-group on the additional disclosure of General 
Insurance  Companies  was  placed  before  the  SCODA  in  its  meeting  held  on 
January 20, 2012.  
 
The  recommendation  of  the  sub-group  was  accepted  by  the  SCODA  with  the 
following changes:- 
a.  A  separate  disclosure  for  re-insurance  risk  should  also  be  incorporated  in 

the report 
 

b.  Instead  of  specifying  the  additional  disclosure  applicable  to  the  general 
insurance  companies,  the  sub-group  may  submit  its  supplementary  report 
giving  the  all  the  disclosures  requirement  for  the  general  insurance 
companies. 
 

2.  Recommendations of Sub-group 

2.1. Disclosures by General Insurance Companies: 

2.1.1.  Industry- specific Risk Factors for Insurance Companies: 

The  insurance  industry  is  different  from  other  industries  and  has  risks 
which are unique to it. In order to get an understanding of risks specific to 
the  insurance  industry,  offer  documents  of  certain  insurance  companies 
which  came  out  with  issue  of  capital  in  other  jurisdictions  were  studied. 
Based on the risk factors disclosed in such offer documents, following are 
the minimum broad industry specific risk areas that needs to be disclosed: 

Page | 3 
 

i.  Claims  arising  out  of  catastrophic  losses  (natural  and  man-made), 
which  could  materially  and  adversely  impact  the  profitability  or  cash 
flow of the insurance companies.  
 

ii.  Differences  in  future  actual  claims  resulting  from  the  assumptions 
used  in  pricing  and  establishing  reserves  for  insurance  and  annuity 
products which may  materially affect earnings.  
 

iii.  Risk with reference to concentration by region/type of policies of the 

iv. 

v. 

vi. 

insurance company. 
 
The assumptions based on which the Economic Capital is calculated 
and  disclosed  may  vary  significantly  from  time  to  time  /  among 
industry players.  
 
Inability  to  attract  and  retain  productive  agents  in  a  growing 
competitive business environment.  
 
Inability to obtain reinsurance on a timely basis or at all, which results 
in    bearing    increased  risks  or  reduce  the  level  of  our  underwriting 
commitments.  
 

vii.  Default by one or more of our reinsurers which could materially affect 

the financial condition and results of operations.  
 

viii.  Regulatory restrictions on investments by  insurance companies  

 

ix.  Exposure  to  recovery  related  risks  including  for  foreclosure  of  the 

mortgages 
 

x.  Risk of regulated tariff 

xi. 

xii. 

 
Increase in the claim liability of motor third party due to the judgments 
of courts  
 
Inability    to  accurately  predict  benefits,  claims  and  other  costs  or  to 
manage  such  costs  through  loss  limitation  methods,  which  could 
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  operations  and  financial 
condition 

The  sub-group  recommends  that  the  aforementioned  list  may  act  as 
guidance  for  companies  while  disclosing  the  risk  factors  in  the  offer 
documents.  The  sub-group  also  compiled  detailed  risk  factors  for 
insurance companies which are placed at Annexure I.  

The sub-group recommends that: 

Page | 4 
 

a.  The detailed risk factors as identified by sub-group may be placed 
on  the  website  of  IRDA  which  may  act  as  guidance  to  insurance 
companies coming out with IPO. 

b.  SEBI  may  prescribe  the  disclosure  of  aforementioned  list  of  risk 
factors  in  the  offer  documents  of  insurance  companies  through 
circular or standard observations. 

2.1.2.  Disclosure on Overview of  the Insurance Industry: 

The SEBI (ICDR) Regulation does not prescribe the format or the contents 
of industry overview which need to be disclosed in the offer documents for 
any industry. However, considering the fact that no insurance company in 
India  has  come  out  with  an  issue  so  far,  it  is  felt  necessary  that  the 
investors  get  a  broad  overview  of  the  insurance  industry.  In  view  of  this, 
broad  parameters  under  which  the  disclosure  on  insurance  industry 
overview may be made have been listed and placed in Annexure II.  
The  sub-group  recommends  that  this  listmay  be  placed  in  the website  of 
IRDA,  which  may  act  as  guidance  for  insurance  companies  coming  out 
with issues.  

2.1.3.  Disclosure of Financial Information: 

 

It  is  observed  that  the  components  of  financial  statements  of  insurance 
companies are significantly different from other companies. An insurance 
company  prepares  two  types  of  income  accounts  i.e.  policy  holder’s 
account  (Revenue  account)  and  shareholder’s  account  (profit  and  loss 
account).  IRDA  has  prescribed  the  formats  in  which  the  financials  of  the 
insurance  companies  need  to  be  submitted  to  them  on  a  periodic  basis. 
On the other hand, provisions regarding disclosure of financial information 
in  SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations  are  general  and  are  applicable  to  all 
companies. The subgroup noted that banking companies follow format of 
financial  statements  prescribed  under  Banking  Regulation  Act,  1949  and 
similarly insurance companies may follow formats specified by IRDA.  
Sub-group  recommended  that  the  financial  disclosure  for  insurance 
companies may be as per the format specified by IRDA.   

 
2.1.4.  Specific Disclosures which are followed in other Jurisdictions: 

The  sub-group  carried  out  an  analysis  of  the  specific  disclosures  which 
are followed in other jurisdictions. A detailed comparative chart along with 
the  comments  of  the  IRDA  on  each  disclosure  item  in  case  of    General 
insurance companies is  attached as Annexure III.  It is observed that the 
extant disclosure norms prescribed by IRDA are by and large at par with 
the international practice in vogue in various jurisdictions. 
 
The sub-group recommends that following disclosures shall be included in 
the offer documents of General insurance companies 

i.  Gross premium- along with Geographic segmentation

ii.  Cross selling 

iii.  Distribution network 

iv.  Claims outstanding with age-wise and type-wise break-up

iii.  Obligatory and  
iv.  Others 

 

c.  Reinsurance balances outstanding- age-wise 

vi.  Maximum probable Loss Ratio 

vii. 

Incurred  but  not  reported  IBNR)  /Incurred  but  not  enough  reported 
(IBNER) 

The  sub-group  recommends  that  SEBI/  IRDA  may  mandate  the  disclosure  of 
aforementioned  list  of  disclosure  items  in  the  offer  documents  of  insurance 
companies through circular or standard observations 

The  sub-group  recommends  that  report  of  an  independent  actuary  on  the 
Economic  Capital  of  the  insurance  company  should  be  made  a  part  of  the 
offer  document.  The  contents  and  format  of  the  reports  and  criteria  for 
actuaries  who  are  authorized  to  prepare  such  report  may  be  prescribed  by 
IRDA.  

The  sub-group  recommends 
the  disclosure  of 
aforementioned  list  of  disclosure  items  in  the  offer  documents  of  insurance 
companies through circular or standard observations. 

that  SEBI  may  mandate 

2.1.5.  Glossary of terms used in the Insurance Industry:  

In order to familiarize the investors with terms used in insurance industry 
and  to  standardize  the  definition  and  understanding  of  such  terms,  the 
sub-group  felt  that  a  “Glossary  of  the  terms  used  in  Insurance  industry” 

Page | 6 
 

may  be  prepared.  IRDA  provided  a  “Glossary  of  the  terms  used  in 
Insurance  industry”  which  is  placed  in  Annexure  IV.  This  glossary  of 
terms  may  act  as  guidance  for  insurance  companies  coming  out  with 
issues.  
 
The  sub  group  recommends  that  the  glossary  may  be  placed  on  the 
website of IRDA. 
 

2.1.6.  Continuous Disclosure Requirements for  Insurance Companies: 

In  the  report  submitted  to  SCODA,  sub-group  had  suggested  a  separate 
format  for  continuous  financial  disclosure  to  be  made  by  insurance 
companies  pursuant  to  listing  on  stock  exchanges.  The  sub-group 
recommended  that  the  said  formats  may  be  incorporated  in  clause  41  of 
the  listing  agreement,  which  shall  be  used  by  insurance  companies  for 
publishing  and  filing  financial  information  with  stock  exchanges  on  a 
periodic basis. 

After  deliberating  on  the  same  SCODA  suggested  the  sub-group  to  re-
work on the formats  specified in Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement and 
retain  only  critical  portions,  as  the  same  needs  to  be  published  in  the 
newspapers.  Further,  SCODA  suggested  that  the  sub-group  should 
classify those disclosures which need to be filed with the exchanges  and 
those which need to be published.  

Sub-group  deliberated  the  matter  and  felt  that  finalization  of  continuous 
disclosures  requirements  would  be  more  appropriate  once  the  insurance 
companies  file  the  offer  document  with  SEBI  as  it  would  help  to  identify 
the  critical  items  for  disclosure  purpose  based  on  the  materiality  of  the 
information provided in the offer document. In view of above the subgroup 
suggested that the formats for continuous disclosures to be made by the 
insurance  companies  may  be  prescribed  once  the  insurance  companies 
file their offer documents with SEBI for public issues. 

Other issues raised by IRDA: 

The  following  issues  raised  by  IRDA  have  been  dealt  with  in  the  Report  of  the 
SCODA in respect of Life Insurance Companies:- 

  Advertisements regarding public issues  

  Objects of issue  

 

Issuance of partly-paid shares  

  Definition of Promoters  

  Key Management Personnel 

  Disclosure with regard to uniform financial denomination

Other recommendations of Subgroup 

Grievance Redressal Mechanism 

The  insurance  business  is  entirely  customer  oriented  therefore,  the  success  of 
the business is heavily depends on the customer satisfaction. In view of this the 
sub-group  felt  that  every  General  insurer  shall  make  a  brief  description  of  the 
Grievance  Redressal  Mechanism  under  the  Business  Description  of  the  Insurer 
in  the  offer  document.  The  brief  description  of  the  Grievance  Redressal 
Mechanism may cover the  

a)  Turn Around Time for the complaints 

b)  Steps taken to minimize the complaints 

c)  Trend analysis of the complaints 

d)  Numbers  of  cases  in  which  ombudsmen  awarded  decision  against  the 

insurers and its year wise break-up. 

e)  Segregation of the complaints (to the extent possible) based on the mode 
of receipt viz written complaints, over telephone, referred by the Authority 
or any other mode. 

In  addition,  disclosure  of  summary  of  the  complaints  received  during  the  last 
three years and its redressal may also be mandated in the offer document. The 
format for such disclosure may be as per Annexure V

ANNEXURE  I:  INDUSTRY  SPECIFIC  RISK  FACTORS  FOR  INSURANCE  SECTOR 
(GENERAL INSURANCE) 

General 

No insurance company is yet listed in the Indian capital market. Insurance sector 
has  a  unique  operation  and  it  presents  various  types  of  unique  risks.  Investors 
should read the section on “Insurance Industry” to acquaint themselves with the 
key  features  of  this  sector.  In  addition,  investors  should  consider  the  risks 
associated  with  the  industry  in  which  the  Company  operates  as  well  as  those 
relating specifically to it. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Changes in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our profitability. The 
profitability of some of the products and investment returns of insurance companies are 
highly  sensitive  to  interest  rate  fluctuations,  and  changes  in  interest  rates  could 
adversely affect our investment returns and results of operations. A rise in interest rates 
would  adversely  affect  our  shareholders’  equity  in  the  immediate  fiscal  year  due  to  a 
decrease  in  the  fair  value  of  our  fixed  income  investments.  Conversely,  a  decline  in 
interest rates could result in reduced investment returns on our newly added assets and 
have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  profitability.  During  periods  of  declining  interest  rates, 
our average investment yield will decline as our maturing investments, as well as bonds 
that are redeemed or prepaid to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment, 
are replaced with new investments carrying lower  yields,  which  would adversely affect 
our profitability  

Reason : it is not a risk for general insurers since the tenure of general insurance 
policies will generally be one year.  

Liquidity Risk 

Differences in future actual claims results from the assumptions used in pricing 
and establishing reserves for our insurance and annuity products may materially 
and adversely affect our earnings. Our earnings depend significantly upon the extent 
to  which  our  actual  claims  results  are  consistent  with  the  assumptions  used  in  setting 
the prices for our products and establishing the liabilities in our financial statements for 
our obligations for future policy benefits and claims. Our assumptions include those for 
investment returns, expenses, as well as macro-economic factors such as inflation. To 
the  extent  that  trends  in  actual  claims  results  are  less  favorable  than  our  underlying 
assumptions  used  in  establishing  these  liabilities,  and  these  trends  are  expected  to 
continue in the future, we could be required to increase our liabilities. Any such increase 
could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and, if significant, our financial 
condition. Any material impairment in our solvency level could change our customers' or 
our business associates' perception of our financial health, which in turn could adversely 
affect our sales, earnings and operations.

Investments Risk 

We  may  incur  significant  losses  on  our  investments,  which  may  cause  our 
investment income to decrease, and could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  primarily  invest  in  fixed  income 
products  such  as  term  deposits,  government  bonds,  subordinated  bonds  issued  by 
financial institutions, corporate bonds and equity. Our investment returns, and thus our 
profitability,  may  be  adversely  affected  from  time  to  time  by  conditions  affecting  our 
specific  investments  and,  more  generally,  by  market  fluctuations  as  well  as  general 
economic,  market  and  political  conditions.  In  particular,  our  ability  to  make  a  profit  on 
our  insurance  products  depends  in  part  on  the  returns  on  investments  supporting  our 
obligations  under  these  products,  and  the  value  of  specific  investments  may  fluctuate 
substantially. Future movements in market interest rates, unfavorable conditions in the 
Indian  capital  market  or  other  factors  may  cause  our  investment  income  to  decrease 
significantly,  and  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  condition  and 
results of operations. 

Catastrophic Losses Risk 

Catastrophic  losses  could  materially  reduce  our  profitability  or  cash  flow.  Our 
insurance  operations  expose  us  to  claims  arising  out  of  catastrophes.  Earthquakes, 
typhoons,  floods,  wind,  fires,  explosions,  industrial  accidents,  epidemics,  terrorist 
attacks, and other events may cause catastrophes, and the occurrence and severity of 
catastrophes  are  inherently  unpredictable.  It  is  possible  that  both  the  frequency  and 
severity  of  natural  disasters  may  increase  in  the  future.    We  establish  reserves  only 
after an assessment of potential losses relating to catastrophes that have taken place. 
However,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  such  reserves  will  be  sufficient  to  pay  for  all 
related  claims.  Although  we  carry  some  reinsurance  to  reduce  our  catastrophe  loss 
exposures,  due  to  limitations  in  the  underwriting  capacity  and  terms  and  conditions  of 
the  reinsurance  market  as  well  as  difficulties  in  assessing  our  exposures  to 
catastrophes,  this  reinsurance  may  not  be  sufficient  to  protect  us  adequately  against 
losses. As a result, one or more catastrophic events could materially reduce our profits 
and cash flows and harm our financial condition. 

Reinsurance Risk 

If  we  are  not  able  to  obtain  reinsurance  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all,  we  may  be 
required  to  bear  increased  risks  or  reduce  the  level  of  our  underwriting 
commitments. Our ability to obtain reinsurance on a timely basis and at a reasonable 
cost  is  subject  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  prevailing  market  conditions  that  are 
beyond  our  control.  The  availability  and  cost  of  reinsurance  may  affect  the  volume  of 
our business as well as our profitability. In particular, we may be unable to maintain our 
current  reinsurance  coverage  or  to  obtain  other  reinsurance  coverage  in  adequate 
amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or to 
obtain new reinsurance coverage, either our net risk exposure would increase or, if we 
are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures, our overall underwriting capacity 
and the amount of risk we are able to underwrite would decrease. To the extent we are 
not able to obtain reinsurance on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost, or at all, our 

Page | 10 
 

business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  would  be  materially  and 
adversely affected. 

A  default by one or more of our reinsurers could materially and adversely affect 
our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Like  other  major  insurance 
companies  in  the  world,  we  transfer  some  of  the  risk  we  assume under  the  insurance 
policies  we  underwrite  to  reinsurance  companies  in  exchange  for  a  portion  of  the 
premiums  we  receive  in  connection  with  the  underwriting  of  these  policies.  Although 
reinsurance  makes  the  reinsurer  liable  to  us  for  the  risk  transferred,  it  does  not 
discharge our liability to our policyholders. As a result, we are exposed to credit risk with 
respect to reinsurers in all lines of our insurance business. In particular, a default by one 
or more of our reinsurers under our existing reinsurance arrangements would increase 
our  financial  losses  arising  out  of  a  risk  we  have  insured,  which  would  reduce  our 
profitability and may adversely affect our liquidity position. In the event of a catastrophic 
loss that affects a significant number of Indian insurers, the reinsurers may not b able to 
pay us on a timely basis, or at all.  

Economic Capital  

The  Economic  Capital    information  we  present  in  this  prospectus  is  based  on 
several  assumptions  and  may  vary  significantly  as  those  assumptions  are 
changed.  In  order  to  provide  investors  with  an  additional  tool  to  understand  our 
economic  value  and  business  results,  we  have  disclosed  information  regarding  our 
embedded  value,  as  discussed  in  the  section  entitled,  "Embedded  Value".  These 
measures are based on a discounted cash flow  valuation determined using commonly 
applied actuarial methodologies. Standards with respect to the calculation of embedded 
value are still evolving, however, and there is no single adopted standard for the form, 
determination  or  presentation  of  the  embedded  value  of  an  insurance  company. 
Moreover, because of the technical complexity involved in embedded value calculations 
and  the  fact  that  embedded  value  estimates  vary  materially  as  key  assumptions  are 
changed, you should read the discussion under the section entitled "Embedded Value". 
You should use special care when interpreting embedded value results and should not 
place undue reliance on them. 

Regulatory Risks 

Regulations may restrict our ability to operate.  The insurance industry is subject to 
extensive regulation by IRDA. IRDA has broad administrative powers to regulate many 
aspects  of  the  insurance  business,  which  include  premium  rates,  marketing  practices, 
advertising,  policy  forms  and  capital  adequacy.  IRDA  is  concerned  primarily  with  the 
protection  of  policyholders  rather  than  shareholders.  Insurance  laws  and  regulations 
impose  restrictions  on  the  amount  and  type  of  investments,  prescribe  solvency 
standards  that  must  be  met and maintained  and  require  the  maintenance  of  reserves. 
Premium rate regulation is common across all of our lines of business and may make it 
difficult for us to increase premiums to adequately reflect the cost of providing insurance 
coverage  to  our  policyholders.  In  our  underwriting,  we  rely  heavily  upon  information 
gathered from third parties such as credit report agencies and other data aggregators. 

Page | 11 
 

The  use  of  this  information  is  also  highly  regulated  and  any  changes  to  the  current 
regulatory structure could materially affect how we underwrite and price premiums. 

Our business is highly regulated and we may be materially and adversely affected 
by  future  regulatory  changes.    Our  businesses  are  regulated  primarily  by  IRDA  and 
we  are  subject  to  laws  regulating  all  aspects  of  our  insurance  business.  Compliance 
with  applicable  laws,  rules  and  regulations  may  restrict  our  business  activities. 
Furthermore,  these  laws,  rules  and  regulations  may  change  from  time  to  time  and  we 
cannot assure you that future legislative or regulatory changes, including deregulation, 
would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results 
of operations. We cannot predict at this time the effect of potential regulatory changes 
on our business and profitability. Moreover, failure to comply with any of the numerous 
laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, suspension or, 
in  extreme  cases,  business  license  revocation,  which  could  materially  and  adversely 
affect us. In particular, future laws, rules and regulations, or the interpretation of existing 
or  future  laws,  rules  and  regulations,  may  have  a  material  adverse  affect  on  our 
business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The  Indian  insurance  regulatory  regime  is  undergoing  significant  change  as  it  moves 
toward  a  more  transparent  regulatory  process.  Some  of  these  changes  may  result  in 
additional costs or restrictions on our activities. In particular, some of the changes may 
require us to take additional steps to comply with new rules and regulations on a timely 
basis. We  cannot  assure  you  that  we  will  be  able  to  achieve  full  compliance  with  any 
such  new  rules  and  regulations  within  any  prescribed  timeframe,  and  any  such 
compliance may result in our incurring increased compliance and other costs. Moreover, 
because  the  terms  of  our  products  are  subject  to  regulations,  changes  in  regulations 
may affect our profitability on the policies and contracts we issue.  

Regulatory investigations and the resulting sanctions or penalties may adversely 
affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. We 
may also be subject to regulatory actions from time to time. A substantial legal liability or 
a  significant  regulatory  action  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  or  cause  us 
reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects. We are subject to 
periodic examinations by IRDA, which may impose sanctions, fines and other penalties 
on  us.    If  IRDA,  in  connection  with  their  future  audits  or  examinations,  requires  us  to 
take corrective measures or impose administrative penalties on us or if as a result we 
become  the  target  of  negative  publicity,  our  corporate  image  and  reputation  and  the 
credibility of our management may be materially and adversely affected. 

Implementation  of  International  Financial  Reporting  System  (IFRS)  Insurance  Sector 
will converge to IFRS once the revised standard on Insurance Contracts will be in 
place.    New  accounting  pronouncements  may  significantly  affect  our  financial 
statements  for  the  current  and  future  years,  and  may  materially  and  adversely 
affect our reported net profits and shareholders’ equity, among other things. 

 

 

Page | 12 
 

Solvency Risks 

Our ability to comply with minimum solvency requirements stipulated by IRDA is 
affected  by  a  number  of  factors,  and  our  compliance  may  force  us  to  raise 
additional capital, which could be dilutive to you, or could reduce our growth. We 
are  required  by  IRDA  regulations  to  maintain  our  solvency  at  a  level  in  excess  of 
minimum  solvency  levels.  Our  minimum  solvency  is  affected  primarily  by  the  policy 
reserves  we  are  required  to  maintain  which,  in  turn,  are  affected  by  the  volume  of 
insurance policies we sell and by regulations on the determination of statutory reserves. 
Our solvency is also affected by a number of other factors, including the profit margin of 
our  products,  returns  on  our  investments,  underwriting  and  acquisition  costs,  and 
policyholder and shareholder dividends. If we continue to grow rapidly in the future, or if 
the  required  solvency  level  is  increased  in the future,  we  may  need  to  raise  additional 
capital to meet our solvency requirement, which would be dilutive to you. If we are not 
able to raise additional capital, we may be forced to reduce the growth of our business. 

Legal Risk 

We may suffer losses from unfavorable outcomes from litigation and other legal 
proceedings.  Legal  actions  are  inherent  in  our  businesses  and  operations.  We  are 
subject  to  litigation  and  other  legal  proceedings  as  part  of  the  claims  process,  the 
outcomes of which are uncertain. We maintain reserves for these legal proceedings as 
part of our reserves. We also maintain separate reserves for legal proceedings that are 
not  related  to  the  claims  process.  In  the  event  of  an  unfavorable  outcome  in  one  or 
more legal matters, our ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts we have currently 
reserved for  and such additional amounts may be material to our results of operations 
and financial condition.  

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected 
and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may 
adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  by  either  extending 
coverage  beyond  our  underwriting  intent  or  by  increasing  the  number  and  size  of 
claims.  In  some  instances,  these  changes  may  not  become  apparent  until  some  time 
after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. 

Competition Risk 

Competition in the Indian insurance industry is increasing and our business and 
prospects will be harmed if we are not able to compete effectively as well as have 
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations by, 
among other things: reducing our market share in our principal lines of business; 
decreasing our margins and spreads; reducing the growth of our customer base; 
increasing our policy acquisition costs; increasing our operating expenses, such 
as  sales  and  marketing  expenses;  and  increased  turnover  of  management  and 
sales  personnel.  Some  of  our  competitors  may  have  advantages  over  us  in  one  or 
more areas, such as financial strength, management capabilities, resources, operating 
experience, market share, distribution channels and capabilities in pricing, underwriting 
and  claims  settlement.  In  addition,  we  face  potential  competition  from  commercial 

Page | 13 
 

banks, some of which invest in, or form alliances with, existing insurance companies to 
offer insurance products and services that compete against those offered by us. These 
commercial banks may also establish subsidiaries of their own to engage in insurance 
business  directly.  Such  potential  competitors  may  further  increase  the  competitive 
pressures we experience.  

Competition  from  foreign-invested  insurance  companies  is  likely  to  increase  in 
the  future,  as  restrictions  on  their  operations  in  India  are  relaxed.  Moreover, 
foreign-invested  insurance  companies  may  have  access  to  greater  financial, 
technological or other resources than we do.  

We  are  likely  to  face  increasing  competition  from  companies  offering  products 
that compete with our own. In addition to competition from insurance  companies, we 
face  competition  from  other  companies  that  may  offer  products  that  compete  with  our 
own,  including  real  estate  companies,  mutual  fund  companies  and  other  financial 
services providers.  

Market Growth Risk 

The  rate  of  growth  of  the  Indian  insurance  market  may  not  be  as  high  or  as 
sustainable as we anticipate.  

The rate of growth of the Indian insurance market may not be as high or as sustainable 
as we anticipate. This may be the case even though we expect the insurance market in 
India to expand and the penetration rate to rise with the growth of the Indian economy 
and household wealth, continued social welfare reform, demographic changes and the 
opening of the Indian insurance market to foreign participants. The impact on the Indian 
insurance industry of certain trends and events, such as the pace of economic growth in 
India  and  the  ongoing  reform  of  the  social  welfare  system  is  unpredictable  and 
consequently, the growth and development of the Indian insurance market is subject to 
a number of uncertainties that are beyond our control. 

An economic slowdown in the country, such as the one experienced following the 
recent  global  financial  crisis,  may  reduce  the  demand  for  our  products  and 
services and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial 
condition  and  profitability.  In  an  economic  downturn  characterized  by  higher 
unemployment,  lower  family  income,  lower  corporate  earnings,  lower  business 
investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our insurance products and 
services  could  be  adversely  affected.  In  addition,  we  may  experience  an  elevated 
incidence  of  claims  and  lapses  or  surrenders  of  policies.  Our  policyholders  may  also 
choose  to  defer  paying  insurance  premiums  or  stop  paying  insurance  premiums 
altogether.If  the  Indian  economy  continues  to  experience  a  slower  growth  or  a 
significant  downturn,  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  would  be 
materially and adversely affected.

Agents’ Risk 

All of our insurance agents are required to obtain a qualification certificate from 
IRDA;  any  changes  in  the  regulatory  policies  with  regard  to  the  agents  may 
materially and adversely affect our business. Moreover, our growth is dependent 
on  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  productive  agents.  A  substantial  portion  of  our 
business  is  conducted  through  agents.  Competition  for  agents  from  insurance 
companies  and  other business  institutions may force us  to  increase  the  compensation 
of  our  agents  and  sales  representatives,  which  would  increase  operating  costs  and 
reduce our profitability.  

If  we  are  unable  to  develop  other  distribution  channels  for  our  products,  our 
growth may be materially and adversely affected. Banks and post offices are rapidly 
emerging as some of the fastest growing distribution channels in India. We do not have 
exclusive  arrangements  with  any  of  the  banks  and  post  offices  through  which  we  sell 
insurance and thus our sales may be materially and adversely affected if one or more 
banks or post offices choose to favor our competitors' products over our own.  

Agent  misconduct  is  difficult  to  detect  and  deter  and  could  harm  our  reputation 
or lead to regulatory sanctions or litigation costs. Agent misconduct could result 
in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions, litigation or serious reputational 
or  financial  harm.  Misconduct  could  include  engaging  in  misrepresentation  or 
fraudulent  activities  when  marketing  or  selling  insurance  policies  or  annuity 
contracts to customers; hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, resulting 
in  unknown  and  unmanaged  risks  or  losses;  or  otherwise  not  complying  with 
laws  or  our  control  policies  or  procedures.  We  cannot  always  deter  agent 
misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not 
be effective in all cases. We cannot assure you that agent misconduct will not lead to a 
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Other Risks 

–  We depend on select actuarial personnel and could be materially and adversely 

affected by the loss of their services. 
 

–  Prospective investors should acquaint themselves with the Financial Statements, 

drawn specifically for the insurance companies. 
 

–  Contingent  liabilities  could adversely  affect  the financial  condition and  results of 

– 

operations of the insurance company.  
 
Investment  in  the  relatives/associates  of  the  Promoters/  Directors  of  the 
Insurance Company can be detrimental to the interests of our company. 
 

–  Risk  with  reference  to  concentration  by  region/type  of  policies  of  the  Insurance 

Company  
 
Insurance Companies are subject to restrictions on payments of dividends

The  insurance  industry  is  cyclical,  which  may  impact  our  results.  The  insurance 
industry  is  cyclical.  Although  no  two  cycles  are  the  same,  insurance  industry  cycles 
have  typically  lasted  for  periods  ranging  from  two  to  six  years.  The  segments  of  the 
insurance  markets  in  which  we  operate  tend  not  to  be  correlated  to  each  other,  with 
each  segment  having  its  own  cyclicality.  Periods  of  intense  price  competition  due  to 
excessive  underwriting  capacity,  periods  when  shortages  of  underwriting  capacity 
permit  more  favorable  rate  levels,  consequent  fluctuations  in  underwriting  results  and 
the occurrence of other losses characterize the conditions in these markets. Historically, 
insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and 
sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of 
the  insurer,  including  competition,  frequency  of  occurrence  or  severity  of  catastrophic 
events,  levels  of  capacity,  general  economic  conditions  and  other  factors.  This  may 
cause a decline in revenue at times in the cycle if we choose not to reduce our product 
prices  in  order  to  maintain  our  market  position,  because  of  the  adverse  effect  on 
profitability of such a price reduction. We can be expected therefore to experience the 
effects of such cyclicality and changes in customer expectations of appropriate premium 
levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events or other factors affecting 
the insurance industry that generally could have a material adverse effect on our results 
of operations and financial condition. 

The  insurance  and  related  businesses  in  which  we  operate  may  be  subject  to 
periodic  negative  publicity,  which  may  negatively  impact  our  financial  results. 
The  nature  of  the  market  for  the  insurance  and  related  products  and  services  we 
provide  is  that  we  interface  with  and  distribute  our  products  and  services  ultimately  to 
individual  consumers.  There  may  be  a  perception  that  these  purchasers  may  be 
unsophisticated  and  in  need  of  consumer  protection.  Accordingly,  from  time  to  time, 
consumer  advocate  groups  or  the  media  may  focus  attention  on  our  products  and 
services,  thereby  subjecting  our  industries  to  periodic  negative  publicity. We  may  also 
be negatively impacted if another company in one of our industries engages in practices 
resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may result in 
increased  regulation  and  legislative  scrutiny  of  industry  practices  as  well  as  increased 
litigation,  which  may  further  increase our  costs  of doing  business and adversely  affect 
our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, requiring us 
to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we 
operate. 

The  impact  of  investigations  of  possible  anti-competitive  practices  by  the 
company  cannot  be  predicted  and  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our 
results of operations, financial condition and financial strength ratings. 

We  may  be  exposed  to  environmental  liability  from  our  commercial  mortgage 
loan and real estate investments.  As a commercial mortgage lender, we customarily 
conduct  environmental  assessments  prior  to  making  commercial  mortgage  loans 
secured  by  real  estate  and  before  taking  title  through  foreclosure  to  real  estate 
collateralizing  delinquent  commercial  mortgage  loans  held  by  us.  Based  on  our 

Page | 16 
 

environmental  assessments,  we  believe  that  any  compliance  costs  associated  with 
environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of affected properties would not 
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition. 
However,  we  cannot  provide  assurance  that  material  compliance  costs  will  not  be 
incurred by us. 

The  effects  of  emerging  claims  and  coverage  issues  on  our  business  are 
uncertain. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, 
unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These 
issues  may  adversely  affect  our  business  by  either  extending  coverage  beyond  our 
underwriting  intent  or  by  increasing  the  number  or  size  of  claims.  In  some  instances, 
these  changes  may  not  become  apparent  until  some  time  after  we  have  issued 
insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full 
extent of liability under our insurance and reinsurance contracts may not be known for 
many  years  after  a  contract  is  issued.  Recent  example  of  emerging  claims  and 
coverage issues include: 

 

larger  settlements  and  jury  awards  in  cases  involving  professionals  and 
corporate directors and officers covered by professional liability and directors and 
officers liability insurance and 
 

  a  growing  trend  of  plaintiffs  targeting  property  and  casualty  insurers  in  class 
action  litigation  related  to  claims  handling,  insurance  sales  practices  and  other 
practices related to the conduct of our business. 

We  may  be  unable  to  accurately  predict  benefits,  claims  and  other  costs  or  to 
manage  such  costs  through  our  loss  limitation  methods,  which  could  have  a 
material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Our 
profitability  depends  in  large  part  on  accurately  predicting  benefits,  claims  and  other 
costs, including medical and dental costs, and predictions regarding the frequency and 
magnitude  of  claims  on  our  disability  and  property  coverage.  It  also  depends  on  our 
ability  to  manage  future  benefit  and  other  costs  through  product  design,  underwriting 
criteria,  utilization  review  or  claims  management  and,  in  health  and  dental  insurance, 
negotiation  of  favorable  provider  contracts.  Utilization  review  is  a  review  process 
designed  to  control  and  limit  medical  expenses,  which  includes,  among  other  things, 
requiring  certification  for  admission  to  a  health  care  facility  and  cost-effective  ways  of 
handling  patients  with  catastrophic  illnesses.  Claims  management  entails  the  use  of  a 
variety  of  means  to  mitigate  the  extent  of  losses  incurred  by  insureds  and  the 
corresponding benefit cost, which includes efforts to improve the quality of medical care 
provided  to  insureds  and  to  assist  them  with  vocational  services.  The  aging  of  the 
population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology 
continue  to  contribute  to  rising  health  care  costs.  Our  ability  to  predict  and  manage 
costs and claims, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition 
may be adversely affected by: 

(cid:173)  changes in health and dental care practices; 

 
inflation; 

(cid:173) 

Page | 17 
 

 

(cid:173)  new technologies; 

(cid:173) 

 
the cost of prescription drugs; 
 

(cid:173)  clusters of high cost cases; 

 

(cid:173)  changes in the regulatory environment; 

 

(cid:173)  economic factors; 

(cid:173) 

 
the occurrence of catastrophes; and 
 

(cid:173)  numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and dental care and the 

frequency and severity of claims in all our business segments. 

The  judicial  and  regulatory  environments,  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  kinds  of 
work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also 
materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more 
of  these  factors  or  other  factors,  claims  could  substantially  exceed  our  expectations, 
which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and  financial 
condition. 

As  industry  practices  and  legal,  judicial,  social  and  other  environmental  conditions 
change,  unexpected  and  unintended  issues  relating  to  claims  and  coverage  may 
emerge.  These  issues  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations  and 
financial  condition  by  either  extending  coverage  beyond  our  underwriting  intent  or  by 
increasing  the  number  or  size  of  claims  or  both.  We  may  be  limited  in  our  ability  to 
respond  to  such  changes,  by  insurance  regulations,  existing  contract  terms,  contract 
filing requirements, market conditions or other factors.

Under  the  annual  basis  of  accounting,  the  provision  for  unearned 
premiums  is  recognized  to  cover  the  proportion  of  retained  premiums 
written in a year which relate to the period of risk from the first date in 
the following financial year to the subsequent date of expiry of policies. 
Unearned premiums can be calculated on a time apportionment basis, 
principally  on  either  a  daily  or  monthly  pro  rata  basis.  The  1/365th 
method and 1/24th method are the main time apportionment methods 
to  calculate  unearned  premiums  under  the  1/365th  method,  the

policies  at  the  end  of the  financial  period  the  1/24th  method  is  based 
on  the  general  assumptions  that  the  premiums  are  spread  uniformly 
over  the  month  and  the  average  date    of  issue  of  all  policies  is  the 
middle of that month.
