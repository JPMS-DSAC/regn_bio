ISO 15022 STANDARD FOR INDIAN MARKET

MESSAGE FORMATs WITH EXAMPLES

This document contains the templates to be used for messaging between entities in the capital market.  The Subgroup has mapped the messaging requirements
with the standards published by ISO15022. These were found to generally meet the Indian market requirement. It may become necessary to refine the formats
from time to time based on the actual usage. Further there may be a need to add/delete message types to the existing list depending on the changing market

The templates defined cater to the following legs in the transaction chain
Settlement Instruction from Fund House to Custodian (Equity / Debt)
Confirmations from Custodian to Fund House on ‘Match / Un-match / Fail’  Status
Contract Note from Broker to Custodian (Equity / Debt)
Confirmation on ‘Match’  status from Custodian to Broker

Note specific to this message for ‘Settlement Parties Details’: The party with whom trade is to be settled should
always be given against ‘DEAG’. The contracting broker is always to be given as ‘SELL’.  The Counter-party custodian
will be indicated as ‘DECU’ and counter-party(actual seller) will be indicated as ‘DEI1’.  In case the trade is to
be  settled  with  contracting  broker,  contracting  broker’s  BIC  code  will  be  mentioned  against  ‘SELL’  as  well  as
‘DEAG’.  ‘DEAG’ is mandatory sub-sequence.

As  per  ISO  15022  standards,  If  “DEI1”  is  specified,  then  “DECU”  has  to  be  present.    Similarly,  if  “DECU”  is
specified, “SELL” has to be present.

Client  needs  to  give  party  details  accordingly.  E.g.,  Where  counter-party  custodian  details  are  not  present,  but
client wishes to give counter-party details, counter-party details should be mentioned for “DECU” also (apart from

Note specific to this message for ‘Settlement Parties Details’: The party with whom trade is to be settled should
always be given against ‘DEAG’. The contracting broker is always to be given as ‘SELL’.  The Counter-party custodian
will be indicated as ‘DECU’ and counter-party (actual seller) will be indicated as ‘DEI1’.  In case the trade is to
be  settled  with  contracting  broker,  contracting  broker’s  BIC  code  will  be  mentioned  against  ‘SELL’  as  well  as
‘DEAG’.  ‘DEAG’ is mandatory sub-sequence.

As  per  ISO  15022  standards,  If  “DEI1”  is  specified,  then  “DECU”  has  to  be  present.    Similarly,  if  “DECU”  is
specified, “SELL” has to be present.

Client  needs  to  give  party  details  accordingly.  E.g., Where  counter-party  custodian  details  are  not  present,  but
client wishes to give counter-party details, counter-party details should be mentioned for “DECU” also (apart from

Note specific to this message for ‘Settlement Parties Details’: The party with whom trade is to be settled should
always be given against ‘REAG’. The contracting broker is always to be given as ‘BUYR’.  The Counter-party custodian
will be indicated as ‘RECU’ and counter-party (actual seller) will be indicated as ‘REI1’.  In case the trade is to

be  settled  with  contracting  broker,  contracting  broker’s  BIC  code  will  be  mentioned  against  ‘BUYR’  as  well  as
‘REAG’.  ‘REAG’ is mandatory sub-sequence.

As  per  ISO  15022  standards,  If  “REI1”  is  specified,  then  “RECU”  has  to  be  present.    Similarly,  if  “RECU”  is
specified, “BUYR” has to be present.

Client  needs  to  give  party  details  accordingly.  E.g., Where  counter-party  custodian  details  are  not  present,  but
client wishes to give counter-party details, counter-party details should be mentioned for “RECU” also (apart from

Note specific to this message for ‘Settlement Parties Details’: The party with whom trade is to be settled should
always be given against ‘REAG’. The contracting broker is always to be given as ‘BUYR’.  The Counter-party custodian
will be indicated as ‘RECU’ and counter-party (actual seller) will be indicated as ‘REI1’.  In case the trade is to
be  settled  with  contracting  broker,  contracting  broker’s  BIC  code  will  be  mentioned  against  ‘BUYR’  as  well  as
‘REAG’.  ‘REAG’ is mandatory sub-sequence.

As  per  ISO  15022  standards,  If  “REI1”  is  specified,  then  “RECU”  has  to  be  present.    Similarly,  if  “RECU”  is
specified, “BUYR” has to be present.

Client  needs  to  give  party  details  accordingly.  E.g., Where  counter-party  custodian  details  are  not  present,  but
client wishes to give counter-party details, counter-party details should be mentioned for “RECU” also (apart from
