Background 

 

1.1  Brief Overview of the Debt Market in India 

Debt market comprises the primary as well as the secondary market for 
debt instruments - both sovereign and corporate. A well functioning debt 
market  is  critical  for  inter-temporal  resource  allocation  and  is  therefore 
significant for all economic agents. 

 

The  development  of  financial  markets  started  in  the  early  1990’s.  Since 
then,  a  series  of  reforms  -  both  structural  as  well  as  institutional  –  have 
been initiated with a view to having market determined interest rates. The 
other  objectives  of  these  reforms  have  been  to  improve  transparency, 
efficiency and accessibility of the debt market.  
 
The  Government  started  the  reforms  by  borrowing  from  the  market  at 
rates determined through auctions. Previously, this was being carried out 
at  pre-announced  rates.  Other  reforms  include  introduction  of  new 
instruments  such  as  -    zero  coupon  bonds,  floating  rate  bonds,  capital 
index  bonds;  establishment  of  specialized  institutions  such  as  Discount 
and Finance House of India (DFHI) and Securities Trading Corporation of 
India  (STCI),  setting  up  of  the  Negotiated  Dealing  System  (NDS),  
implementation  of  the  Patil  Committee  recommendations  for  corporate 
bonds, etc.  
 
While  these  reforms  have  resulted  in  increased  trading  volumes  in  the 
debt market (total turnover in Government of India (GoI) dated securities 
increased from Rs. 1,770,980 crore in 2006-07 to Rs. 2,957,070 crore in 
2007-08), yet the trading volume has remained low in comparison to the

developed markets. There is a strong need to further deepen and widen 
the market by offering a wide range of products. 
 

 

1.2   Need for Interest Rate Futures 

Interest  rate  risk  affects  not  only  the  financial  sector,  but  also  the 
corporate and household sectors. As observed in the Report on Interest 
Rate Futures, banks, insurance companies, primary dealers and provident 
funds  bear  a  major  portion  of  the  interest  rate  risk  on  account  of  their 
exposure to government securities. As such these entities need a credible 
institutional hedging mechanism1. Today, with a large stock of household 
financial savings on the assets side and an increasing quantum of housing 
loans  on  the  liabilities  side,  interest  rate  risk  is  becoming  increasingly 
important  for  the  household  sector  as  well.  Moreover,  because  of  the 
Fisher effect2, interest rate products are the primary instruments available 
to  hedge  inflation  risk  which  is  typically  the  single  most  important 
macroeconomic  risk  faced  by  the  household  sector3.  In  this  context, 
therefore, it is important that the financial system provides the household 
sector  greater  access  to  interest  rate  risk  management  tools  through 
Exchange-Traded interest rate derivatives.  

 
1.3  Benefits of Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Derivatives 

Interest  rate  futures,  a  derivative  instrument  with  linear  pay-offs,  provide 
benefits typical to any Exchange-Traded product, such as:  
a.  Standardization  –  Through  standardization,  the  Exchanges  offer 
the  utility  and 

market  participants  a  mechanism 
effectiveness of different positions and strategies.  

for  gauging

2  “Fisher effect” implies that ceteris paribus, increase in expected inflation rate leads to an 

increase in the nominal interest rate.

b.  Transparency  –  Transparency,  efficiency  and  accessibility 

is 
accentuated through online real time dissemination of prices available 
for all to see and daily mark-to-market discipline. 

c.  Counter-party  Risk  –  The  credit  guarantee  of  the  clearing  house 
eliminates counter party risk thereby increasing the capital efficiency of 
the market participants. 
 

1.4  Constitution of the Group 

With  the  expected  benefits  of  Exchange-Traded  interest  rate  futures,  it 
was  decided  in  a  joint  meeting  of  RBI  and  SEBI  on  February  28,  2008, 
that  an  RBI-SEBI  Standing  Technical  Committee  on  Exchange-Traded 
Currency  and  Interest  Rate  Derivatives  would  be  constituted.  The 
Committee  submitted  its  Report  on  Exchange-Traded  Currency  Futures 
on May 29, 2008. 
 
The  Committee  is  constituted  with  the  following  officials  from  RBI  and 
SEBI:

Terms of Reference 
The Committee was given the following terms of reference: 

 

i. 

ii. 

To  coordinate  the  regulatory  roles  of  RBI  and  SEBI  in  regard  to 
trading of Currency and Interest Rate Futures on the Exchanges.  
To suggest the eligibility norms for existing and new Exchanges for 
Currency and Interest Rate Futures trading. 

iii.  To suggest eligibility criteria for the members of such exchanges. 
iv.  To  review  product  design,  margin  requirements  and  other  risk 

mitigation measures on an ongoing basis 

v.  To  suggest  surveillance  mechanism  and  dissemination  of  market 

information 

vi.  To consider microstructure issues, in the overall interest of financial 

stability. 

 
With  a  view  to  operationalising  the  Interest  Rate  Futures  products,  the 
Committee  deliberated  upon  the  recommendations  of  the  Technical 
Advisory Committee Report on Interest Rate Futures (August 2008). The 
Report  had  primarily  focused  on  introduction  of  a  physically  settled 
Interest Rate Futures contract on 10 year GoI coupon bearing security. It 
had  also  recommended  retention  of  the  contract  based  on  91-day 
Treasury  Bills  (introduced  in  2003)  with  some  modification  in  the 
settlement price and consideration of a contract based on some suitable 
index of money market rates. The High Level Coordination Committee for 

Page 7 of 28 

 

 

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 

Financial  Markets  (HLCCFM)  has  decided  that  (1)  futures  based  on  the 
91-day Treasury Bills may be considered later as deemed appropriate and 
(2)  futures  based  on  the  overnight  rate  may  not  be  introduced. 
Accordingly,  the  operational  norms  for  the  10-year  Notional  Coupon-
bearing GoI Security Futures are being issued to the market through this 
Report for early implementation.

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 
2.8  Daily Settlement Price 

 

The  Daily  Settlement  Price  would  be  the  closing  price  of  the  10-year 
Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures contract on the trading day. 
(Closing  price  =  Weighted  Average  price  of  the  futures  for  last  half  an 
hour). In the absence of last half an hour trading the theoretical price, to 
be  determined  by  the  exchanges,  would  be  considered  as  Daily 
Settlement  Price.  The  exchanges  will  be  required  to  disclose  the 
model/methodology used for arriving at the theoretical price. 
 

2.9  Settlement Mechanism 

the  electronic  book  entry  system  of 

The  contract  would  be  settled  by  physical  delivery  of  deliverable  grade 
securities  using 
the  existing 
Depositories (NSDL and CDSL) and Public Debt Office (PDO) of the RBI. 
The delivery of the deliverable grade securities shall take place from the 
first  business  day  of  the  delivery  month  till  the  last  business  day  of  the 
delivery  month.  The  owner  of  a  short  position  in  an  expiring  futures 
contract shall hold the right to decide when to initiate delivery. However, 
the  short  position  holder  shall  have  to  give  intimation,  to  the  Clearing 
Corporation,  of  his  intention  to  deliver  two  business  days  prior  to  the 
actual delivery date.   

 
2.10     Deliverable Grade Securities  

GoI securities maturing at least 7.5 years but not more than 15 years from 
the first day of the delivery month with a minimum total outstanding stock 
of Rs 10,000 crore.  
 

2.11  Conversion Factor  

The  Conversion  Factor  for  deliverable  grade  security  would  be  equal  to 
the price of the deliverable security (per rupee of the principal), on the first 
day  (calendar  day)  of  the  delivery  month,  to  yield  7%  with  semiannual 
compounding.  

Page 10 of 28 

 

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 

 

For deliveries into 10-Year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures, 
the deliverable security’s  remaining term to maturity shall be calculated in 
complete  three-month  quarters,  always  rounded  down  to  the  nearest 
quarter.  If,  after  rounding,  the  deliverable  security  lasts  for  an  exact 
number of 6-month periods, the first coupon shall be assumed to be paid 
after 6 months. If, after rounding, the deliverable security does not last for 
an exact number of 6-month periods (i.e. there are an extra 3 months), the 
first  coupon  would  be  assumed  to  be  paid  after  3  months  and  accrued 
interest would be subtracted.  

 
2.12 

Invoice Price 
Invoice  Price  of  the  respective  deliverable  grade  security  would  be  the 
futures settlement price times a conversion factor plus accrued interest.  
 

2.13  Last Trading Day 

Seventh  business  day  preceding  the  last  business  day  of  the  delivery 
month.   
 

2.14  Last Delivery Day 

2.15 

Last business day of the delivery month. 
 
Initial Margin 
Initial  Margin  requirement  shall  be  based  on  a  worst  case  loss  of  a 
portfolio of an individual client across various scenarios of price changes. 
The various scenarios of price changes  would be so computed so as to 
cover a more than 99% VaR over a one day horizon. In order to achieve 
this, the price scan range may initially be fixed at 3.5 standard deviation4.  
The initial margin so computed would be subject to a minimum of 2.33% of 
the  value  of  the  futures  contract  on  the  first  day  of  trading  in  10-year 

                                                 
4 One tailed standard normal variate corresponding to 99 % confidence interval is 2.33.  However, 
simulation on the historical data showed that 99 % of data could be covered only with 3.5 times 
standard.deviation.

Notional  Coupon-bearing  GoI  security  futures  and  1.6%  of  the    value  of 
the futures contract thereafter. The  initial  margin  shall be deducted from 
the liquid net worth of the clearing member on an online, real time basis.  
 

2.16  Extreme Loss Margin 

Extreme loss margin of 0.3% of the value of the gross open positions of 
the futures contract shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing 
member on an on line, real time basis. 

 
2.17  Calendar Spread Margin 

Interest  rate  futures  position  at  one  maturity  hedged  by  an  offsetting 
position at a different maturity would be treated as a calendar spread.  The 
calendar  spread  margin  shall  be  at  a  value  of  Rs.2000/-  per  month  of 
spread. The benefit for a calendar spread would continue till expiry of the 
near month contract.  
 

2.18  Model for Determining Standard Deviation 

The Committee examined the results of empirical tests carried out using 
different risk management models in the Value at Risk (VaR) framework in 
the  10-year  GoI  security  yields.  Data  for  the  period  January  3,  2000  to 
September  16,  2008  was  analyzed.  GARCH  (1,1)-normal  and  GARCH 
(1,1)-GED (Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional  Heteroskedasticity) 
at 3 and 3.5 sigma levels were not found to perform well at 1% risk level, 
as  the  actual  number  of  violations  were  found  to  be  statistically  much 
higher than the expected number of violations. The EWMA (Exponentially 
weighted  moving  average)  model  used  by  J.P.Morgan’s  Risk  Metrics 
methodology was found to work well at 3 and 3.5 sigma levels at 5% risk 
level and not at 1% risk level.  
 
Given  the  computational  ease  of  the  EWMA  model  and  given  the 
familiarity of the Exchanges with this particular model (it is currently being 

Page 12 of 28 

 

 

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 

used  in  the  equity  derivatives  market),  the  Committee,  after  considering 
the various aspects of the different models, decided that EWMA method 
would be used to obtain the volatility estimate every day fixing the price 
scan range at 3.5 standard deviation. During the first time-period on the 
first  day  of  trading  in  10-year  Notional  Coupon-bearing  GoI  security 
futures, the sigma would be equal to 0.8 %.  
 

2.19  Formula for Determining Standard Deviation 

The EWMA method would be used to obtain the volatility estimate every 
day. The estimate at the end of time period t (σyt) is arrived at using the 
volatility estimate at the end of the previous time period i.e. as at the end 
of  t-1 time period (σyt-1), and the return (ryt) observed in the futures market 
during the time period t. The formula would be as under:  
 
(σyt)2 = λ (σyt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (ryt)2 

 
Where 
 
λ(lambda)  is  a  parameter  which  determines  how  rapidly  volatility 
estimates changes. The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.  

i.  σyt  (sigma)  is  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of 
yield of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time 
t. 
 The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Yt/Yt-1) where 
Yt  is  the    yield    of  10-year  Notional  Coupon-bearing  GoI  security 
futures at time t.  

ii. 

For computing the margin, two methodologies can be considered.  

Page 13 of 28 

 

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 

Methodology A.The  plus/minus  3.5  sigma  limits5  for  a  99%  VAR 
based  on  logarithmic  returns  on  yield  of  10-year  Notional  Coupon-
bearing  GoI  security  futures  would  have  to  be  converted  into    price 
volatility through the following  formula : 

 

σpt=D*σyt* Yt 

 
where 
σpt is the standard deviation of percentage change in price at time t; 
 
D is Modified Duration6; 
 
Y7
at time t; and  
 
σyt (sigma) is the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of yield 
of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time t. 

t is the yield of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures 

The  percentage  margin  on  long  position  would  be  equal  to  100 
(D*3.5σyt*  Yt)  and  the  percentage  margin  on  short  position  would  be 
equal  to  100  (D*(-3.5σyt)*  Yt).    The  Modified  Duration  for  10-Year 
Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures shall be 10.  

                                                 
5  The  one-tailed  standard  normal  variate  corresponding  to  99%  confidence  interval  is  2.33. 
However, since 3.5 standard deviations cover 99 % of the historical data, σ  has been taken as 
3.5 in all computations. .

8 Annualized yield volatility is obtained by multiplying the standard deviation of daily logarithmic return 
by square root of the number of trading days, usually taken as 252.

Alternatively, the exchanges can adopt uniform margins for both short 
and long positions, equivalent to the higher of the two values derived 
above. 

An illustration of the two methodologies discussed above is enclosed 
at Annex A.   

iii.    The  volatility  estimation  and  margin  fixation  methodology  should  be 
clearly made known to all market participants so that they can compute 
the margin for any given closing level of the interest rate futures price. 
Further, the trading software itself should provide this information on a

Risk Management Measures 

 

3.1 

Introduction 
In exchange traded derivative contracts, the Clearing Corporation acts as 
a central    counterparty to all trades and performs full novation. The risk to 
the  Clearing  Corporation  can  only  be  taken  care  of  through  a  stringent 
margining  framework.  Also,  since  derivatives  are  leveraged  instruments, 
margins also act as a cost and discourage excessive speculation. A robust 
risk  management  system  should  therefore,  not  only  impose  margins  on 
the  members  of  the  Clearing  Corporation  but  also  enforce  collection  of 
margins from the clients. 

 
3.2       Portfolio Based Margining  

The  Standard  Portfolio  Analysis  of  Risk  (SPAN)  methodology  shall  be 
adopted to take an integrated view of the risk involved in the portfolio of 
each individual client comprising his positions in futures contracts across 
different  maturities.  The  client-wise  margins  would  be  grossed  across 
various  clients  at  the  Trading  /  Clearing  Member  level.  The  proprietary 
positions of the Trading / Clearing Member would be treated as that of a 
client. 

 
3.3  Real-Time Computation 

The computation of worst scenario loss would have two components. The 
first  is  the  valuation  of  the  portfolio  under  the  various  scenarios  of  price 
changes.  At  the  second  stage,  these  scenario  contract  values  would  be 
applied to the actual portfolio positions to compute the portfolio values and 
the  initial  margin.  The  exchanges  shall  update  the  scenario  contract 
values at least 6 times in the day, which may be carried out by taking the 
closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and the prices at 

Page 18 of 28 

 

 

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 

11:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m., 3.30 p.m. and at the end of the trading 
session. The latest available scenario contract values would be applied to 
member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 

 
3.4 

Liquid Networth 
The initial margin and the extreme loss margin shall be deducted from the 
liquid  assets  of  the  clearing  member.  The  clearing  member’s  liquid  net 
worth  after  adjusting  for  the  initial  margin  and  extreme  loss  margin 
requirements  must  be  at  least  Rs.  50  Lakhs  at  all  points  in  time.  The 
minimum liquid networth shall be treated as a capital cushion for days of 
unforeseen market volatility.  

 
 3.5      Liquid Assets 

The  liquid  assets  for  trading  in  Interest  Rate  Futures  would  have  to  be 
provided  separately  and  maintained  with  the  Clearing  Corporation. 
However,  the  permissible  liquid  assets,  the  applicable  haircuts  and 
minimum  cash  equivalent  norms  would  be  mutatis  mutandis  applicable 
from the equity/currency derivatives segment. 

 
3.6       Mark-to-Market (MTM) Settlement 

The  MTM  gains  and  losses  shall  be  settled  in  cash  before  the  start  of 
trading on T+1 day. If MTM obligations are not collected before start of the 
next day’s trading, the Clearing Corporation shall collect correspondingly 
higher initial margin to cover the potential for losses over the time elapsed 
in the collection of margins.  

The daily closing price of interest rate futures contract for mark to market 
settlement  would  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  last  half  an  hour 
weighted average price of the futures contract. In the absence of trading in 
the  last  half  an  hour  the  theoretical  price  would  be  taken.  The  eligible 
exchanges  shall  define  the  methodology  for  calculating  the  ‘theoretical 

Page 19 of 28 

 

 

Report of the RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Exchange-Traded Interest Rate Futures 
 
 

price’ at the time of making an application for approval of the interest rate 
futures contract to SEBI. The methodology for calculating the ‘theoretical 
price’ would also be disclosed to the market.  

3.7  Margin Collection and Enforcement 

The  client  margins  (initial  margin,  extreme  loss  margin,  calendar  spread 
margin and mark to market settlements) have to be compulsorily collected 
and  reported  to  the  Exchange  by  the  members.  The  Exchange  shall 
impose  stringent  penalty  on  members  who  do  not  collect  margins  from 
their  clients.  The  Exchange  shall  also  conduct  regular  inspections  to 
ensure margin collection from clients. 

 
3.8  Safeguarding Client’s Money 

The Clearing Corporation should segregate the margins deposited by the 
Clearing  Members  for  trades  on  their  own  account  from  the  margins 
deposited  with  it  on  client  account.  The  margins  deposited  on  client 
account  shall  not  be  utilized  for  fulfilling  the  dues  which  a  Clearing 
Member  may  owe  the  Clearing  Corporation  in  respect  of  trades  on  the 
member’s own account. The client’s money is to be held in trust for client 
purpose only. The following process is to be adopted for segregating the 
client’s money vis-à-vis the clearing member’s money: 
 
i 

At  the  time  of  opening  a  position,  the  member  should  indicate 
whether it is a client or proprietary position.  

ii  Margins across the various clients of a member should be collected 

on a gross basis and should not be netted off. 

iii  When  a  position  is  closed,  the  member  should  indicate  whether  it 

iv 

was a client or his own position which is being closed. 
In  the  case  of  default,  the  margins  paid  on  the  proprietary  position 
would only be used by the Clearing Corporation for realizing its dues 
from the member.

3.9      Periodic Risk Evaluation Report 

 

The Clearing Corporation of the Exchange shall on an ongoing basis and 
atleast  once  in  every  six  months,  conduct  back  testing  of  the  margins 
collected vis-à-vis the actual price changes. A copy of the study shall be 
submitted  to  SEBI  along  with  suggestions  on  changes  to  the  risk 
containment measures, if any.

Miscellaneous Issues 

 
5.1      Banks Participation in Interest Rate Futures 

It is stated in the RBI Report on Interest Rate Futures that “…the current 
approval for banks’ participation in IRF for hedging risk in their underlying 
investment  portfolio  of  government  securities  classified  under 
the 
Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT) categories should be 
extended to the interest rate risk inherent in their entire balance sheet – 
including both on, and off, balance sheet items – synchronously with the 
re-introduction of the IRF.” 

 
5.2      Extending the Tenor of Short Sales  

In the RBI Report on Interest Rate Futures, it has been recommended that 
the time limit on short selling be extended so that term / tenor / maturity of 
the short sale is co-terminus with that of the futures contract and a system 
of transparent and rule-based pecuniary penalty for SGL bouncing be put 
in place, in lieu of the regulatory penalty currently in force.

Annex A - Illustration of margin computation  

 

 

•  Product:  10-Year  Notional  Coupon-bearing  Government  of  India  (GoI) 
Security Futures 
 
•  Given a time series (January 3, 2000 to September 16, 2008) of yields of a 
10-year Constant Maturity Security. Say, the last yield in the time series, Yt was 
8.20%. The volatility can be calculated using EWMA method: 
 

(σyt)2 = λ (σyt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (ryt)2           ………………………………………..(1) 

 
where: 

(cid:131)  λ (lambda) is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility 
estimates changes. The value of λ is fixed at 0.94 
(cid:131)  σyt (sigma) is the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of yield 
of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security, the "return" is defined as 
the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Yt/Yt-1) 

•  Using  formula  (1)  on  the  time  series,  the  σYt  (daily)  is  0.008,  and  σYt 
(annualized) comes to 0.1269.  
 
Methodology A: 

σpt = D*σyt* Yt 

 

Where: 

•  σpt is the standard deviation of percentage change in price at time t 
•  D is the modified duration; 
•  Yt   is yield of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time 

t; and  

•  σyt (sigma) is the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of yield of 

10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time t.

The  percentage  margin  on  long  would  be    (D*  3.5  *  σyt  *  Yt)  i.e.  2.29and  the 
percentage margin on short position would be equal to 100 (D* (-3.5*σyt) * Yt) i.e. 
(-)  2.29.
