Preface

1.  SEBI has been receiving several representations from investors regarding the
high cost of operating in a demat environment. There is also a perception in
certain  quarters  that  small  investors  are  being  overcharged  and  that  the
charges  are  beyond  the  capacity  of  certain  class  of  investors.  In  order  to
examine these  issues  in  the  light  of  various  research  reports,  press articles
and representations made to SEBI, SEBI had set up an internal group.

2.  The report of the group is placed below for public comments.

3.  The  comments,  if any,  on this  report may  please  be forwarded  to  Shri  V.S.
Sundaresan,  Deputy  General  Manager,  SEBI  or  may  be  emailed  to  Ms.
Sangeeta Uchil at sangeetau@sebi.gov.in  on or before February 20, 2004.

Background and Terms of Reference

Ever since Depositories changed the method of charging depository participants
on transactions, from the earlier method of ad valorem to flat fee structure (FFS),
there  has  been  a  perception  in  certain  quarters  that  small  investors  are
overcharged.  Further, it has been felt that the charges are beyond the bearable
capacity  sometimes for  certain  class  of  investors  and  thus  it  was  reported  that
small investors have been driven away from the Indian equity market. In the light
of various research reports, press articles and representations made to SEBI, it
has been decided to examine the issue.

I. Issues Identified for the Study

The  group 
recommendations

identified 

the 

following  major 

issues 

for  discussion  and

a)  Whether small investor is over  charged  on  account  of  shift  in  method  of
charging?  Is  the  present  method  and  procedure  of  charges  justified?  Is
there any better alternative?

b)  What were the charges under paper based share certificate environment?

Who bore the burden and who benefited?

c)  How  demat  charges  were  levied  and  collected  in  the  early  stages  of

d)  Need for shifting to the present system (FFS).
e)  Explore  who  benefited  (savings)  on  account  of  changes  in  post-trade

demat?

activities.

f)  How to reduce the burden on small investor? and
g)  Any other matter.

II. Pre-demat era (under paper based share certificate environment)

The investors can be broadly classified into two groups on the basis of process of
acquiring equity shares, viz. investors who get allotment of shares in the primary
market and investors who purchase shares from the recognised stock exchanges
(secondary market).  Some of the risks involved in dealing with physical shares
through  public  issue  allotment  and  secondary  market  transactions  can  be
identified as follows:

-  Share  certificates  are  sometimes  lost  in  transit.  In  that  scenario,  the
investors have to give an indemnity bond  to  Company,  which  involves  a
cost  to  the  investor,  besides  depriving  him  of  the  opportunity  to  sell  the
shares at the opportune time.

-  Time  taken  to  receive  the  shares  is  also  quite  long  compared  to  the

present dematerialised environment.

Page 5 of 18

-  Secondary  market  operations  were  fraught  with  bad  paper  due  to
signature differences, forged and fake certificates, stolen certificates and
delayed transfer resulting in low confidence in the market place.

In public issues, Companies were / are incurring several costs in distributing the
share certificates to the investors.  They are as follows:

-  Printing  of  share  certificates  (@  about  Rs  1.00  per  certificate),  RTA
handling charges (@ about Rs 5.50 per folio), actual cost of dispatching
by registered post and other expenses.

In case of investors purchasing the shares from the secondary market, there are
certain costs incurred by the companies.  After the shares are transferred into the
investor’s name, the expenses on corporate benefits distribution will be same for
all shareholders owning the shares in physical form.  These issues are discussed
in the following paras.

III.  Structure  and  Collection  method  of  charges  under  paper  based  share
safe-keeping and transfer mechanism.

Under  this  method  companies  used  to  incur  all  expenses  pertinent  to  share
transfer  in  the  name  of  the  buyer.    These  could  be  classified  into  two  broad
categories on the basis their nature:

(a) Variable expenses

Share Transfer

(i) 
(ii)  Maintenance of folio records.
(iii)  Custody of physical shares, etc.,
(iv)  Dividend and other corporate actions

           (b) Event Specific Expenses

(i) 
(ii) 

Issue of duplicate certificates
Adhoc reports, etc.

Individual  investor/Institutional  investor  was  required  to  pay  0.5  percent  of
purchase  value  of  share  as  stamp  duty  under  physical  environment  which  has
been totally removed under demat conditions.  Further, issues pertaining to bad
paper like,  signature  difference, fake  or forged  certificate, etc. besides  delay  in
transfer, are  eliminated and  thus  investor  is  a  direct  beneficiary.  The  price  risk
faced  by  the  investor  has  also  been  eliminated.    As  per  some  unofficial
estimates, the cost related to  the  bad paper  was  to  the  extent  of  about  20  per
cent of the market value of shares. Currently this figure is estimated to be almost
nil.

IV. Post-trade activities

The post trade activities of the stock exchanges are handled by their respective
Clearing  house/corporation. 
the  Clearing
house/corporation incurred several expenses on various heads as follows:

the  physical  environment, 

In 

 

-  Physical space required to collect share certificates
-  Sorting them with respect to receiving member.
-  Safekeeping  of 
house/corporation.
Insurance costs.

share 

certificates  delivered  at 

the  Clearing

- 
-  Huge human costs incurred for executing pay-in and pay-out activities.
-  Transportation  costs  incurred  in  movement  of  physical  share  certificates

from one metro to other metro for pay-in and pay-out.

On the basis of informal discussion, it can be stated that there is drastic reduction
in cost of pay-in and pay-out facility. A part of it might have been passed on to
brokers/ dealers of the stock exchanges.  Further, as it has been observed in the
study  of  M.T.  Raju  (2000),  the brokerage fell  significantly  during  this  period  for
high  networth  investors.    For  small  investor,  the  fall  in  the  brokerage  is  not
proportional even though there is a decline in the brokerage.

V. Early period of demat

The regulator, SEBI, had played a significant role in nurturing the promotion and
growth  of  dematerialization  for  the  benefit  of  all  investors  and  for  the  cause  of
developing efficient securities market in India.

During the initial period, the depositories used to collect transaction charges as
well as custodial charges on ‘ad valorem’ basis.   This is directly related to the
value of securities bought or sold and held in custody.  Higher values attracted
higher  fees  and  vice-versa.    There  was  a  feeling  under  this  system  that  the
payment by the high networth investors and institutions was disproportionate to
services received by them.  In the demat environment, to a large extent, services
rendered  are  invariant  to  value  of  transaction.    In  many  other  markets,  the
charges are levied on the basis of number of transactions which is also known as
flat  fee  structure.    In  India,  depositories  subsequently  switched  over  to  flat  fee
structure of charges on transactions. .

However,  notwithstanding  this,  in  India  the  share  ownership  pattern  is  quite
different  from  what  it  is,  in  the  developed  markets,  as  well  as  in  some  of  the
emerging  markets.    Considering  the  role  of  small  investors  in  Indian  capital
market, we need to have a cost effective system which will address many of the
issues concerning small investors.  The dematerialization success story could be
partly attributed to individual investor for his full support to the regulatory direction

Page 7 of 18

of compulsory trading in demat environment for selected stocks in phases.  As it
was mentioned in the study of M.T. Raju and Prabhakar Patil (2001), Indian stock
markets  had  taken  significantly  less  time  to  complete  the  herculean  task  of
dematerialization as compared to some of the developed markets like USA, UK,
etc.

Depository Participants
Depository participants (DPs) impose various charges on the institutional as well
as on individual clients under various heads for providing services. The services
available in dematerialised environment  that  are  extended to  the  clients  are  as
follows:

•  Dematerialisation
•  Rematerialisation
•  Custodial services
•  Debit or Credit facility
•  Hypothecation
•  Speed-e along with smart card
•  Corporate benefits like bonus, stock split, dividend payment, etc.

This is an illustrative list of services available. The system of charging a fee for
the services extended to an investor is in two-layers. The Depository charges the
DPs  and  DPs  in  turn  collect  fee/charges  from  the  investor.  Each  DP  uses
different norms to classify charges depending on the extent of services rendered.
NSDL  has  a  provision  for  collecting  a  one-time  fee  of  0.05  percent  of  market
capitalization of the company, as custody fees for life. For these companies, no
custody charge is supposed to be charged from the investors for life.  The list of
55  companies  that  had  paid  this  one  time  fee  is  enclosed  in  Annexure  I.
However, it is not clear whether DPs are passing this benefit to investors or not
for these 55 companies.

VI. Charges under the present method FFS

The depositories started charging DPs on FFS basis since May, 2002 and DPs in
turn started charging on FFS basis to investors.  This system is tilted in favour of
high networth and institutional investors who trade in large quantities.  The long
term small investor who trade less frequently feel the unwanted burden of heavy
outgo on account of FFS.

Custody  charges  are  levied  on  the  basis  of  ISIN  numbers,  irrespective  of  the
value of shares in custody.  As a result, there is a piquant situation, wherein on
one side, the value of shares may be getting eroded while on the other hand the
investors are required to pay custody charges that some times exceed the value
of shares held in custody.  This has been a very sour point.  As the value of the

Page 8 of 18

holding is small, the charges paid as percentage of value of their holding works
out to be very high.

The  DPs  are  generally  required  to  pay  the  following  as  one  time  charges  to
NSDL, under the following heads:

•  Non-refundable entry fee  -  Rs 25,000
•  Minimum fee per year  - Rs 1,50,000, irrespective of business volume
• 

Interest free refundable fee of Rs 10,00,000

Further,  the  DP  will  be  incurring  fixed  and  variable  costs  on  account  of
establishment,  staff,  computers, WAN  connectivity,  stationary,  postal  or  courier
expenses  and  telephone.    These  costs  will  vary  according  to  the  size  of
operations, place of operations etc.

The companies have an opportunity to make one time payment of custody fee of
0.05 percent or five basis points on the market value of the shares computed on
previous  26  weeks  average  of  market  price  of  the  equity.    In  these  cases
investors  are  not  required  to  pay  any  custodial  charges.    This  seems  to  be  a
viable  alternate/solution  since  the  custodial  charges  will  then  be  ‘nil’  for  the
investors, for ever.

VII. Analysis and Discussion

Table  1  A  shows  some  of  the  basic  costs  involved  in  physical  and  demat
environment for different sizes of share folios.  The costs taken into consideration
are from a leading RTA and the size is hypothetical for computational purposes.
It  is  clearly  evident  from  the  table  that  as  the  number  of  folios  increases,  the
benefits,  in  the form  of  reduction  in  Company’s  costs,  also  increase.  Thus,  the
size and costs are inversely related and benefits positively related. Therefore, a
company  having  a  large  shareholder  base  derives  maximum  benefit  out  of  the
depository environment.

NSDL  accepts  one-time  payment  of  5  basis  points  (0.05  percent)  from  a
company on its market capitalization and thereafter completely exempts custody
charges  to  its  DPs  on  securities  of  such  companies.  Based  on  an  hypothetical
size  of  market  capitalization  of  Rs  10  crore  to  Rs  500  crore,  the  one-time
custodial cost for the company will range in Rs 50,000 to Rs 25 lakh.  A look at
the table 1B clearly shows that after paying one time existing custodial charges,
the  companies  would  still  make  a  lot  of  savings  on  annual  basis  whereas  the
amount paid to depository is a onetime one. On the basis of proposed 10 basis
points payment also companies make substantial savings.

Table 2 shows a broad picture of charges levied by DPs and this information is
downloaded from NSDL website.  For the present study, the costs shown in the
table pertain  to  highest  charged by  a  DP  and  may  not  necessarily  be  by  each

Page 10 of 18

DP.    The  account  opening  fee  ranges  from  nil  to  Rs  500  and  the  actual  cost
incurred  by  DPs  for  opening  account  are  on  the  account  of  stamp  paper,
stationary, human labour, office space and computer time.  Some of the DPs are
not charging any fee on this account for active traders or institutional investors.
Thus, it shows a skewed pattern of charges.

Summary Observations on DP Charges are as under:

•  Dematerialisation charges of NSDL are nil however, the DPs charge goes

as high as Rs 23 per certificate plus courier charges of Rs 30..

•  The remat charges of DPs is ten times more than the depositories’ charge.
•  The account maintenance fee of Rs 1200 per annum charged by DPs is

not charged by Depository at all.

•  Custodial  charges  are  three  times  of  the  amount  charged  by  the

depository.

•  Buy or Sell transaction instruction for demat shares is costing a minimum

of Rs 20 per transaction which was not there in physical environment.

Due  to  the  benefit  derived  out  of  increased  volumes  to  the  market,
NSDL  revised  the  fee  structure  w.e.f.  01/01/04  for  debit  instruction

VIII. Recommendations

On  the  basis  of  data  collected,  analyzed  and  discussions  held,  the  group  has
made the following recommendations:

Transaction Charges
a)  This small investor1 should be charged on the basis of ad valerom only.

Custody Charges
b)  Since companies have derived largest part of the benefits accrued on account
of dematerialization, it is proposed that the companies may be advised to pay
one time fee to the depository concerned at the rate of 0.1 per cent of market
cap of that particular company on the existing lines or on the basis of number
of post issue shares. In case of new companies it may be worked out on the
basis of the post-issue paid up capital or he number of post issue shares, as
mentioned  in  the  prospectus.    The  same  may  be  implemented  in  a  phased
and time bound manner.2

c)  Further, charges like account maintenance and demat charges should not be

levied on small investors at all, by DPs.

Account Closure Charges

d)  As long as the investor is under demat environment and desires to shift his
account from one DP to another DP (owing to some perceived advantages)
the  investor  may  be  permitted  to  close  his  account  with  the  existing
depository  participant  without  any  transaction  charges  or  other  incidental
charges, as are being levied currently3. The account closure charges may be
collected if he / she / it is going out of the demat environment.

                                                
1 An investor who buys or sells securities worth Rs. 50,000 or less on any business day. The other
alternative of defining small investor could be based on the maximum number of transactions carried out in
a financial year e.g. 60 transactions in a year.
2 In order to implement this recommendation of levying fees from the companies, SEBI may have to amend
listing agreement of he stock exchanges and other relevant legal provisions.
3 The rationale is that the investor is still in the demat environment.

Page 13 of 18

e)  Alternately,  Depositories  may  consider  giving  one  time  exemption  from

account closing fee for switch over from one entity to other.

Standardisation and Uniformity

f)  DPs charge under various heads and there is no uniformity across the DPs.
Some  times,  it  appears  there  are  excessive  charges  on  certain  heads.
Therefore, there is a need to rationalize this structure as much as possible.

IX. Assumptions

Like any other study in Financial Economics, this study and its recommendations
are  also  based  on  certain  assumptions.    The  following  are  some  of  the
assumptions:

1)  Securities market as a whole  has benefited by the dematerialization;
2)  The small investors have been charged highly;
3)  Companies, as a constituent, derived maximum pecuniary benefit;
4)  Companies are expected to pay one time charges;
5)  Folio-size and cost calculating;
6)  Folio-size and market capitalization do not always have direct relationship.
