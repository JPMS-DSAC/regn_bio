Disclosure to Public by Intermediaries (DIPIN) 

 
 
Disclosure  by  Market  Intermediaries  is  one  of  the  corner  stones  for  ensuring 
transparency and fair play in securities market and for empowering investors to take 
informed  decisions  regarding  their  dealings  with  such  intermediaries. 
  Such 
disclosures should include most of the relevant details about the back-ground, history, 
business  practices  and  overall  conduct  of  the  intermediaries  so  that  all  the 
stakeholders  in  the  securities  market  including  investors,    SROs and Regulators etc. 
have access to the real time source information for taking decisions. 
 
Keeping  the  above  objectives  in  view,  SEBI  proposes  the  creation  of  a  Central 
Electronic Database entitled â€œDisclosure to Public by Intermediaries (DIPIN) . It is 
proposed to cover the  information about all the intermediaries registered with SEBI 
in the database. The database can be accessed on-line by all users and will be updated 
at frequent intervals so that the information is available on almost real time basis.  
 
As a first step in this direction, a concept paper outlining disclosures by stock brokers 
has  been  prepared  and  placed  below  for  public  comments,  which  may  be sent  to 
SEBI,  Division  of  Policy  and  Supervision-1, Market Intermediaries Regulation 
and Supervision Department, Exchange Plaza, G Block, 4th Floor, Bandra Kurla 
Complex, Bandra (E), Mumbai 400 051 or emailed to ashishk@sebi.gov.in or faxed 
to 91-22-26598514/18 within 14 days.
