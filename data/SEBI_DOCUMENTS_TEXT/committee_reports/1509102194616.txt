PREFACE 

The completion of this Committee’s report in a short span of four months has been possible 
because  of  the  active  participation  and  wholehearted  support  of  all  members  of  the 
Committee.  I  take  the  opportunity  to  thank  my  fellow  Committee  members  for  their 
valuable time and contributions as well as for the free and frank discussions over the past 
few  months.  I  am  also  grateful  to  the  SEBI  Chairman,  Mr.  Ajay  Tyagi  for  entrusting  the 
Committee with this responsibility. 

I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  colleagues  and  families  of  every  Committee  member  for 
extending  their  support  without  which  this  Committee  would  not  have  been  able  to 
complete the arduous task in such a short period.  

India is a strong emerging force on the global map.  Its growth is enabled by progress and 
development across sectors by public and private enterprises, and is built on the foundation 
laid  down  by  the  government  and  regulators  that  encourages  transparency  in  business 
dealings, accountability and good governance. 

As  India  aspires  to  its  rightful  position  as  a  global  leader,  the  focus  will  be  on  Corporate 
India  and  on  Indian  markets.  Corporate  India  has  a  key  role  in  nation  building  and 
corporate governance is an integral part of the broader governance of the country. 

Today,  leading  corporates  in  India,  who  are  often  seen  as  role  models  by  budding 
entrepreneurs, emerging SMEs and the broader community at large, are also looked up to 
for their corporate governance practices. However, if one investigates further, weaknesses 
become  visible.  This  is  where  the  contention  between  letter  and  spirit  comes  to  light.  By 
and  large  most  leading  corporates  in  India  follow  rules  and  regulations,  and  if  their 
governance practices are put to test, they will likely stand scrutiny of the law. However, if 
one delves deeper,  one could find that while the letter of the law may have been complied 
with, the spirit of regulations has  not necessarily been embraced wholeheartedly. 

In India, there are broadly two styles of running a company – the “Raja” (Monarch) model 
and  the  “Custodian”  (Trusteeship)  model:  In  the “Raja”  model,  promoter  interest  i.e.  self-
interest precedes interests of “Praja” i.e. other stakeholders. Given the sizeable number of 
promoter-led  companies  that  are  present  in  the  Indian  market,  the  challenges  India  Inc. 
faces are inherently unique. There are instances of promoters carrying out actions that are 
favourable  to  them  but  detrimental  to  the  interests  of  minority  shareholders.  This  has 
affected confidence in India Inc. 

The “Custodian” model works on “Gandhian Principles”, and is relevant for both promoter-
managed as well as professionally managed entities. Under this model, promoters, boards 
and  management  wear  the  hat  of  “trustees”  and  act  in  the  interest  of  all  stakeholders  – 
shareholders,  investors,  employees,  customers  et  al,  keeping  stakeholder  interests  before 
self-interest. Corporate India needs to move in this direction.

This  report  is  a  sincere  attempt  to  support  and  enable  sustainable  growth  of  enterprise, 
while safeguarding interests of various stakeholders. It is an endeavor to facilitate the true 
spirit  of governance.  Under the leadership of a vigilant  market regulator  - SEBI, and with 
the  persistent  efforts  of  key  stakeholders,  corporate  governance  standards  in  India  will 
continue  to  improve.  A  stronger  corporate  governance  code  will  enhance  the  overall 
confidence in Indian markets and in India.

Terms of the reference of the Committee

Member 
Special 
Invitee 

With the aim of improving standards of Corporate Governance of listed companies in India, the 
Committee was requested to make recommendations to SEBI on the following issues: 

1.  Ensuring  independence  in  spirit  of  Independent  Directors  and  their  active  participation  in 

functioning of the company; 

2. 

Improving safeguards and disclosures pertaining to Related Party Transactions;  

3. 

Issues in accounting and auditing practices by listed companies; 

4. 

Improving effectiveness of Board Evaluation practices; 

5.  Addressing issues faced by investors on voting and participation in general meetings;  

6.  Disclosure and transparency related issues, if any; 

7.  Any other matter, as the Committee deems fit pertaining to corporate governance in India. 

The  Committee  was  requested  to  provide  its  recommendations  in  the  context  of  equity  listed 
companies. 

 
Approach 

The  Committee  had  twelve  meetings over  a  period of  four  months  with the  first  meeting  held on 
June 14, 2017 and the last on September 29, 2017. The Committee deliberated each of the terms of 
reference  in  detail.  The  Committee,  wherever  required,  formed  sub-groups  for  analysis  of  specific 
issues. 

This  Report  sets  out  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  along  with  the  rationale  and  the 
expected timeline for implementation of such recommendations.  

The  Committee’s  approach  to  the  recommendations  has  been  driven  by  the  primary  objective  of 
enhancing corporate governance for listed entities. In this regard, the Committee believes that there 
are  certain  recommendations  which  may  require  implementation  by  authorities/  regulators  in 
addition to SEBI. Therefore, the Committee has suggested that SEBI take up such recommendations 
with the relevant authorities/ regulators.  

The Committee has received a letter from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) dated October 
3,  2017  with  comments  on  the  recommendations.  The  same  is  enclosed  in  Annexure  1.  The 
Committee  has also received a letter from the Ministry of Finance  (“MoF”) dated October 3, 2017 
with certain observations/comments on the recommendations. The same is enclosed in Annexure 2. 
These  letters  have  been  shared  with  SEBI  and  the  Committee  recommends  that  SEBI  consult  with

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

the  MCA  and  the  MoF,  as  relevant,  in  the  context  of  implementing  the  recommendations  in  this 
Report. 

The Report suggests certain amendments to the existing provisions (which are reflected in red and 
underline/strikethrough)  and  certain  new  provisions  (which  are  reflected  in  red)  that  may  be 
required to implement the recommendations.  For the ease of reference of the reader, the Report 
also  summarises  the  current  regulatory  framework  along  with  detailed  provisions  included  in 
Annexure 3.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

INTRODUCTION 
 
India  accounts  for  nearly  3  per  cent  of  world  GDP  and  2.5  percent  of  global  stock  market 
capitalization. With over 5,000 listed companies and more than 50 companies in the global Fortune 
2000, India represents a vibrant mix of small and large companies that access capital from domestic 
and international investors to fund their growth. Many of these companies are amongst the largest 
employers.  Moreover,  a  large  number  of  small  investors  in  India  rely  on  corporate  India’s  good 
performance so that the returns they obtain on their investments can ensure their financial security. 
Beyond  doubt,  corporate  India  represents  a  key  engine  that  powers  nation  building;  and  nation 
building requires sound principles of governance, whether it is a country or a company. As corporate 
India’s health is critical for India’s future, sound corporate governance needs to be the key enabler 
to manifest this reality. 

Corporate  governance deals with the  ways in which suppliers of capital to corporations, especially 
faceless, powerless small investors, can assure themselves of getting fair treatment as stakeholders. 
A  promoter,  or  a  professional  manager,  raises  funds  from  equity  investors  either  to  put  them  to 
productive  use  or  to  cash  out  his/her  holdings  in  the  firm.  The  investors  need  the  manager's/ 
promoter’s  specialized  human  capital  to  generate  returns  on  their  funds.  But  how  can  small 
suppliers of capital ensure that, once they invest their funds, owners and/or professional managers 
will invest their money responsibly and return some of the profits generated from such investments? 
Corporate governance deals with the mechanisms to address this key question. 

Does Corporate Governance Really Matter?  

Research  provides  robust  evidence  that  companies  that  exhibit  sound  corporate  governance 
generate  significantly  greater  returns  when  compared  to  companies  that  exhibit  poor  corporate 
governance.3 In fact, well governed companies across the world command a premium of anywhere 
between 10 to 40 percent more than their not so well governed counterparts. Research focusing on 
the governance mechanisms that ensure such value creation highlights the role of: (i) composition of 
boards,  especially  their  independence  in  law  and  in  spirit  from  the  company’s  management;  (ii) 
expertise  of  the  directors  on  the  boards;  (iii)  the  composition  and  independence  of  key  board 
committees  such  as  the  audit  committee  and  the  nomination  and  remuneration  committee;  (iv) 
independence of the companies’  auditors and the quality of audit of its financial statements; (v) the 
quality  of  disclosures  by  the  company;  and  (vi)  careful  balancing  of  the  interests  of  controlling 
shareholders vis-à-vis minority shareholders.  Numerous studies indicate that the payoff from good 
corporate governance manifests both in the operating results of publicly listed companies, as well as 
the market capitalization of such companies. In fact, good firm-level governance often makes up for 
weaknesses in a country’s corporate laws or the enforcement of such laws.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

Why Review Corporate Governance Now? The Case for Change 

Over  the  past  decade,  policymakers  in  India  have  been  acutely  conscious  of  the  importance  of 
corporate governance – several committees, including those under the chairmanship of Mr. Kumar 
Mangalam  Birla,  Mr.  Narayana  Murthy  and  Mr.  Naresh  Chandra,  have  made  valuable 
recommendations which have been largely adopted. Yet, governance practices even in some of the 
most  reputed  publicly  listed  Indian  companies  have  come  under  question  on  a  number  of 
dimensions.  These  include  evaluation of company  boards,  board  diversity,  reliability of  disclosures 
(especially  those  relating  to  financial  statements),  role  of  independent  directors,  protection  of 
minority shareholder interests, managerial compensation and related party transactions. 

Some  global  trends,  also  evident  in  India,  drive  the  demand  for  a  higher  quality  of  corporate 
governance, for instance: 

a)  Increasing  pace  of  change  in  market  conditions,  viz.  demographic,  technological  and  market 
change,  which  require  companies  and  their  boards  to  be  agile  and  quickly  adapt  to  the  changing 
business environment. 

b) Obsessive focus on short-term performance often at the cost of long-term performance: Rather 
than  pursuing  long-term  strategies,  many  public  companies  and  boards  dedicate  significant 
resources to meeting quarterly earnings guidance and communicating their performance relative to 
this  guidance.    In  a  survey  conducted  by  McKinsey  and  CPPIB  in  2014,  nearly  half  of  the  C-suite 
respondents  stated  that  the  reason  for  their  organizations’  overemphasis  on  short-term  financial 
results and under emphasis on long-term value creation was the company’s board. 

c)  Several  corporate  governance  failures  across  the  world  and  an  increasingly  complex  regulatory 
environment have sharpened the focus on good governance. 

d)  An  increasing  number  of  passive  institutional  owners  with  small  positions  in  a  wide  range  of 
companies – raising the expectations towards, and opportunities for, larger shareholders to be active 
and  involved  as  owners  to  ensure  and  support  the  value  creation  in  their  individual  portfolio 
companies. What has led to this sharp rise in activism? According to Stephen Murray, president and 
CEO  of  CCMP  Capital  Advisors,  a  major  private-equity  firm,  “The  whole  activist  industry  exists 
because public boards are often seen as inadequately equipped to meet shareholder interests.”  

e) 4Increasing evidence that private equity (“PE”) owned companies outperform publicly listed ones.  
Directors  who  have  served  on  the  boards  of  both  public  and  private  companies  add  that  the 
behavior of the board is a key element driving superior operational performance. Compared to their 
public-owned  company  counterparts,  directors  in  PE-owned  companies  are  believed  to  spend  far 
more  time  on  strategy  and  risk  management,  have  deeper  functional  and  industry  expertise  and 
engage more actively in talent management. Clearly, public boards cannot (and should not) seek to 
replicate all elements of the PE model. Nevertheless, can public boards be structured so that their 
members can put more time into managing strategy, risk, talent and performance?

f) Significant market discount being placed on Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs): Given their multiple 
objectives,  we  continue  to  witness  significant  value  erosion  in  several  PSEs.  Most  public  sector 
banks, for example, trade at a significant discount to book value, and at a considerable discount to 
their counterparts in the private sector. 

Given  these  trends,  not  surprisingly,  there’s  been  a  renewed  focus  on  improved  corporate 
governance: better structures, more rigorous checks and balances, and greater independence of all 
key  gate-keepers  including  boards  and  auditors.  Arguably,  governance  suffers  most  when  boards 
spend  too  much  time  looking  in  the  rearview  mirror  and  not  enough  scanning  the  road  ahead. 
Directors have difficulty in prioritizing their time between quarterly reports, audit reviews, budgets 
and compliance  on the one  hand  and matters crucial to the future prosperity and direction of the 
business on the other.  

This has to change.  

Principles of the Change Agenda 

The  Committee’s  approach  has  been  to  focus  on  addressing  immediate  challenges  and  gaps  in 
governance while at the same time, anchoring its discussions firmly in the long term. The Committee 
believes that such a focus on the long term is necessary to enable our companies shape a strong and 
resilient governance apparatus for the foreseeable future. Irrespective of the timeframe, at its core, 
the  Committee  believes  that  well-governed  companies  need  to  fulfil  two  major  roles:  the  first  to 
focus  on  long-term  value  creation  and  the  second  to  protect  shareholders  interests  by  applying 
proper care, skills and diligence to business decisions. 

In  relation  to  the  governance  processes  that  would  help  achieve  these  outcomes,  the  Committee 
was guided by the following conceptual underpinnings:  

First, high-quality information represents the basic input for governance because it reduces the twin 
problems  of  reliability  and  asymmetric  information,  which  refer  to  the  fact  that  professional 
managers, board members and auditors possess significantly greater information than the average 
investor in these companies. These may get exacerbated by the possibility that good news may be 
revealed  aggressively  while  bad  news  may  be  allowed  to  percolate  slowly  or  remain  undisclosed. 
Therefore, high-quality information is the primary ingredient  for enabling shareholders  to  exercise 
their  voting  rights  in  general  meetings  of  the  company  and  express  their  views  on  such  key 
corporate decisions. Even directors and auditors have to rely on high-quality information about the 
operations of the company to duly discharge their fiduciary duties. Thus high-quality information is 
the key pillar of corporate governance. 

Second, good corporate governance primarily helps overcome potential agency problems which can 
occur  if  managers  who  are  agents  of  all  shareholders  (particularly  the  faceless,  powerless  ones) 
pursue their personal interests to the possible detriment of investors’ interests.  

Last,  but  not  the  least,  regulatory  monitoring  and  optimal  use  of  the  proverbial  carrot  and  stick 
represents a key element of corporate governance.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

With these guiding principles, the Committee deliberated on the following: 

A.  Shaping  governance  for  long-term  value  creation:  Given  long-term  trends,  it  is  clear  that  the 
board  of  the  future  will  need  to  operate  with  an  owner’s  mindset  and  guard  its  authority  and 
independence zealously. Operating with an “owner’s” mindset would imply: 

i) Optimizing the composition of the board to ensure that it has the right mix of domain, functional 
and  ‘future  ready’  expertise,  e.g.,  digital/analytics  in  addition  to  appropriate  ethos,  given  the 
strategic context of the company. High demographic diversity among board members has a positive 
effect on financial performance and the quality of strategic decision-making. 

ii) Ensuring adequate time is spent by individual board members with clear guidelines. Periodicity of 
meetings will also have to increase.   

iii) Cultivating the spirit of independence on the board and ensuring its unfettered practice through 
truly independent high quality non-executive directors, a chairman independent of the CEO, regular 
challenges  and  discussions  with  management  and  through  key  committees.  Truly  independent 
boards  are  vital  to  effective  governance.  As  former  UK  Financial  Reporting  Council  Chairman,  Sir 
Christopher Hogg has noted,  “Good boards  are pretty uncomfortable places and that’s where they 
should be.” 

iv) Enabling the boards to independently develop and discuss strategic perspectives on the company. 
Ensuring  that  substantial  time  is  spent  on  strategy,  performance,  talent,  risk  management, 
succession planning and social responsibility. 

v)  Constructively  engaging  and  communicating  with  long-term  institutional  shareholders  and 
engaging with them on matters of strategic importance including long-term value creation.  

vi) Ensuring consistent and sufficiently frequent evaluation of the board’s and the individual board 
member’s performance. 

vii) Reviewing board member compensation to enhance commitment and obtain the right talent. 

B. Shaping governance to protect shareholder interests: Securing the interests of all shareholders is 
a  fiduciary  duty  of  the  board.  Today  in  India,  there  are  a  number  of  ways  in  which  shareholder 
interests get compromised. Safeguarding shareholder interest would imply: 

i)  Strengthening  the  core  safeguarding  committees  of  the  board,  audit,  risk  and  technology 
(including cyber security) – enhancing their scope and periodicity. 

ii) Enhancing monitoring of group entities and subsidiaries to ensure shareholders get a holistic and 
transparent view of performance. 

iii)  A  majority  of  Indian  listed  entities  continue  to  be  promoter–driven  entities  with  significant 
shareholding being held by the promoter/promoter group. Therefore, protection of the interests of 
minority shareholders, especially those of the retail shareholders assumes even more importance. In 
this  context,  clarifying  conditions  for  sharing  of  information  and  creating  checks  and  balances  on 
related  party  transactions  are  crucial  for  good  governance.  It  is  also  important  to  ensure  that 

 
 

 
7 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

compensation practices, especially with respect to promoter-directors, do not exacerbate potential 
agency problems.  

iv) Enhancing disclosure norms significantly in order to provide greater transparency to investors and 
thereby reduce possible asymmetric information, including in areas such as credit rating, securities 
holdings, and performance.  Financial and performance  disclosures  alone  tend to yield little  insight 
into  the  company’s  value  drivers  or  future  potential.  These  disclosures  rarely  connect  recent 
performance to long-term strategy and progress on value creation. Companies that articulate a long-
term strategy effectively tend to attract investors who are more willing to look beyond short-term 
under-performance. 

v) Recognizing that stakeholders rely significantly on auditors, strengthening the audit function will 
provide them greater comfort.  

vi) Evaluating structural solutions for PSEs. 

vii) Strengthening the enforcement mechanism by leveraging data, technology and creating greater 
enforcement capacity within SEBI. This has the potential to have a multiplier effect on governance of 
listed entities. 

C. Building regulatory capacity for enhancing governance of listed entities: Corporate governance 
deals not only with the de jure but also the de facto aspects of the law. In this context, SEBI’s role as 
a  regulator  of  capital  markets  assumes  particular  importance  given  that  it  requires  diligent 
detection,  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  punitive  action.  The  efficacy  of  the  Committee 
recommendations, therefore, depend critically upon SEBI’s detection and enforcement capabilities. 
By drawing on the experiences of regulators in other countries, this Committee recommends specific 
steps to build capacity at SEBI. 

These principles provided the Committee a framework to engage in a more extensive debate around 
the relative importance of each of the principles and its applicability to the various issues. They also 
acted  as  a  guardrail  to  ensure  we  were  leaving  no  significant  issues  uncovered  in  our  quest  for 
preparing  our  boards  for  the  future.  All  subsequent detailed  chapters  in  the  report  are consistent 
with these principles. 

Approach to Implementation: Evolution not Revolution 

It  was  tempting  to  seek  an  accelerated 

The Committee was faced with a number of choices while defining timelines for implementation of 
its  recommendations. 
implementation  of  all 
recommendations  –  however,  the  Committee  picked  a  balanced  and  measured  approach as  it  felt 
that preparedness is important and change must be smooth. Otherwise, there was the risk of poor 
execution  with  damaging  second  order  consequences.  As  such,  we  have  arrived  at  a  phased 
timetable for most initiatives to be executed between 2018 and 2020. It was agreed that a phased 
transition  could  allow  companies  time  to  adjust  to  new  governance  demands.  For  example,  on 
disclosure of long-term strategy, the Committee has provided guidance, as opposed to mandating a 
timeframe. 

There  are  also  a  few  implementation  challenges;  for  one,  the  availability of  qualified  independent 
directors. While we have tried to address some of the obvious deterrents, like compensation, much

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

needs  to  be  done  to  enhance  the  supply  of  this  scarce  pool.  Similarly,  some  of  these 
recommendations  will  not  only  involve  multiple  stakeholders  but  also  get  into  unchartered 
territories; perhaps even be contentious. 

Hence,  our  approach  is  evolutionary.  We  propose  that  these  be  implemented  in  a  sequenced  but 
disciplined way over the next three years.  

The Committee comprises of persons from diverse backgrounds including representatives from the 
corporate  sector,  the  government,  industry  bodies,  professional  bodies,  lawyers,  academicians, 
consulting  and  accounting  firms,  stock  exchanges  and  proxy  advisors.  We  have  had  extensive 
discussions and our recommendations have been carefully finalized keeping in mind the objective of 
enhancing corporate governance while facilitating ease of doing business.  

We  believe  that  we  have  a  unique  opportunity  to  create  a  world  class  corporate  governance 
environment in India that will enable India to fulfil its destiny.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER I: COMPOSITION AND ROLE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 
The  basic  principle  underlying  the  governance  of  a  corporate  entity  is  that  the  superintendence, 
control  and  direction  of  its  business  and  affairs  lie  with  its  board  of  directors,  with  the  executive 
management being delegated powers for smooth and efficient operational functioning. Accordingly, 
the  board  of  directors  as  a  whole  is  responsible  to  all  stakeholders  for  meeting  the  requisite 
standards of corporate governance. The responsibilities of the board of directors are accentuated in 
a listed entity given the wider ambit of stakeholder interests. 

The  Committee  observed  that  while  aspects  relating  to  the  composition  and  role  of  the  board  of 
directors  of  listed  entities  have  been  subjected  to  gradual  reform,  a  holistic  re-assessment  is 
required to further strengthen the same. 

Accordingly,  this  review  by  the  Committee  and  the  attendant  recommendations  seek  to  address 
aspects  relating  inter-alia  to  the  size  of  the  board  and  its  diversity,  separation  of  the  roles  of 
chairperson  and  executive  management,  attendance  of  directors  at  board  meetings,  ongoing 
updation of knowledge of directors and disclosure of their skills/expertise. 

1.  Minimum Number of Directors on a Board  

Current regulatory provisions: 

At present, the  Companies Act, 2013  read with rules issued thereunder (hereinafter referred to as 
the  “Companies  Act”)  requires  a  minimum  of  three  directors  on  the  board  of  a  public  limited 
company.  There  is  no  similar  requirement  in  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the “SEBI LODR Regulations”). (Click for 
Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  board  of  directors  plays  an  important  role  in  a  company’s  governance  and  performance.  It  is 
therefore essential that a company has a sufficient number of directors on its board to ensure that it 
is able to carry out its functions effectively. In view of the additional functions and obligations of the 
board of a listed entity, relative to unlisted entities, it is crucial that a sufficient number of directors 
with diverse backgrounds and skill sets are available on the boards of listed entities to fulfill these 
functions and obligations.  

Therefore, the Committee recommends that for any listed entity, a minimum of six directors should 
be required on the board of directors.

2.  Gender Diversity on the Board  

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act and the rules prescribed thereunder require at least one woman director on the 
board of  directors of  every listed  entity.  The  SEBI LODR  Regulations also currently  require at  least 
one woman director on the board of a listed entity. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Diversity, including gender diversity, is often seen to have a positive impact on the decision making 
processes  of  corporate  boards.  The  Companies  Act  and  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  took  a  progressive 
step in requiring at least one woman director to be on the board of directors of listed entities. This 
was done as under-representation of women on boards was a significant concern in India. Although 
India lags behind global markets in women participation on corporate boards, the broad reaction of 
corporate India on having to include at least one woman on every board has been largely positive. 
Women  representation  on  the  boards of  NIFTY  500  companies, which was  at  5%  as on March  31, 
2012, increased to 13% as on March 31, 2017.  

To  further  improve  gender  diversity  on  corporate  boards,  the  Committee  recommends  that  every 
listed entity have at least one independent woman director on its board of directors.  

 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. October 1, 2018):  

Current provision in SEBI LODR Regulations  

Reg 17. Board of Directors  
(1) The composition of board of directors of the listed 
entity shall be as follows:  
(a)  board  of  directors  shall  have  an  optimum 
combination of executive and non-executive directors 
with  at  least  one  woman  director  and  not  less  than 
fifty percent  of the board of  directors  shall comprise 
of non-executive directors; 
 

3.  Attendance of Directors  

Current regulatory provisions:

Proposed  amended  provision 
Regulations 
Reg 17. Board of Directors  
(1) The composition of board of directors of the listed 
entity shall be as follows:  
(a)  board  of  directors  shall  have  an  optimum 
combination of executive and non-executive directors 
with at least one woman  as  an independent director 
and  not  less  than  fifty  percent  of  the  board  of 
directors shall comprise of  non-executive directors; 
 

Currently,  the  Companies  Act  provides  for  the  automatic  vacation  of  the  office  of  director  if  a 
director is absent from all meetings of the board of directors held during a 12-month period. There is 
no  requirement  for  minimum  attendance  of  directors  in  meetings of  the  board  of  directors  under 
the SEBI LODR Regulations. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Board members have the responsibility to protect the interests of various stakeholders. Hence, it is 
desirable  that  directors  attend  all  scheduled  meetings  to  carry  out  their  fiduciary  duties 
appropriately. However, it is understandable that sometimes, they may not be able to do attend due 
to certain exigencies.  

The Committee is of the view that it is important for all directors to attend a minimum number of 
meetings  in  order  to  enhance  their  contribution  of  skill,  time  and  value  towards  serving  the  long-
term interests of all stakeholders. It is therefore recommended that if a director does not attend at 

 
 

 
14 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

least half of the total number of board meetings over two financial years on a rolling basis, his/her 
continuance on the board should be ratified by the shareholders at the next annual general meeting.

not attend at least half of the total number of  board 
meetings  held  over  the  Relevant  Period,  his/her 
continuance  on  the  board  shall  be  subject  to 
ratification  by  the  shareholders  at  the  next  annual 
general  meeting  (notwithstanding  the  nature  of 
directorship). 
Explanation:  For  the  purposes  of  this  provision,  the 
term  “Relevant  Period”  shall  mean  a  period  of  two 
consecutive 
financial  years  on  a  rolling  basis, 
commencing  from  the  financial  year  immediately 
succeeding  the  date  of  appointment.  For  existing 
directors, the “Relevant Period” shall commence from 
April 1, 2018. 

4.  Disclosure of Expertise/Skills of Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act and SEBI LODR Regulations require the disclosure of a brief profile of a director 
on his/her appointment, including expertise in specific functional areas. However, there is no specific 
requirement  under  the  Companies  Act  or  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  for  listed  entities  to  disclose  the 
required and available expertise of the board on a regular basis. (Click for Detailed Provisions)  

Recommendation and rationale: 

In  today’s  dynamic  and  complex  world,  diverse  skill-sets  of  the  board  of  directors  have  become  a 
necessity. The importance of diversity on a board cannot be overstated. A group of individuals with 
varied skill-sets  and experience  is critical for  providing  comprehensive  guidance and direction to a 
company. 

The  Committee  acknowledged  that while  a  board  of directors  may  seek external  expert  advice  on 
various  matters,  given  the  collective  responsibility  and  the  need  for  the  board  to  make  informed 
business  judgement,  a  balanced  wholesome  board  with  complementary  skill-sets  amongst  the 
directors is imperative.  Typically,  these  skill-sets  would comprise  technical/academic skills, general 
management,  global  business,  technology,  manufacturing/operations,  risk  management,  etc. 
Recognizing this, board members should collectively have a wide set of skill-sets appropriate for the 
relevant business.  

Currently,  there  is  no  requirement  for  the  disclosure  of  the  expertise  matrix  of  the  board  on  a 
regular  basis  and  therefore  shareholders are unable to  adequately  analyze  whether  a board has  a 
sufficient mix of diverse expertise/skill-sets.  

It is therefore recommended that the board of directors of every listed entity should be required to 
list  the  competencies/expertise  that  it  believes  its  directors  should  possess.  It  should  also  be 

 
 

 
15 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

required  to  disclose  the  list  of  competencies/expertise  that  its  board  members  actually  possess. 
Some illustrative parameters that may be considered in this context are listed in Annexure 4. 

Further, it is recommended that initially, a listed entity should be required to disclose competencies 
of its board members against every identified competency/expertise without disclosing names in the 
annual  report  for  financial  year  ending  March  31,  2019.  However,  detailed  disclosures  of 
competencies of every board member, along with their names, should be required w.e.f. March 31, 
2020 (i.e. for annual report for the financial year ending March 31, 2020).

5.  Approval for Non-executive Directors on Attaining a Certain Age 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  provides  that  a  person  may  be  appointed/continue  as  Managing  Director 
(hereinafter referred to as “MD”), whole-time director or manager on attaining the age of 70 years 
by passing a special resolution. However, no such provision exists for non-executive directors. (Click 
for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee recognizes that while age itself may not be a determinant of efficiency or capability 
of a person or the basis for disqualification of a director, a higher level of shareholder endorsement 
may  be  required  for  directors  to  continue  in  their  position  beyond  a  certain  age.  The  Committee 
further noted that  non-executive  roles  on  a  board also  require  significant  commitment of time.  In 
this  regard,  the  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  checks  and  balances  should  be  considered  in 
connection with the age of Non-executive Directors (hereinafter referred to as “NEDs”) similar to the 
provisions of the Companies Act for executive directors. 

 
 

 
16 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

Therefore,  the  Committee  recommends  that a provision requiring  a  special resolution on  a  similar 
basis  should  be  inserted  for  listed  entities  for  the  appointment/continuation  of  NEDs on  attaining 
the  age of 75 years  for the  relevant term.  All shareholders  should be  permitted  to vote on such  a 
resolution.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. October 1, 2019):  

Current provision in SEBI LODR Regulations  

No specific provision.

(1A)  No  listed  entity  shall  appoint  a  person  or 
continue  the  directorship  of  any  person  as  a  non-
executive  director  who  has  attained  the  age  of 
seventy five years unless a special resolution is passed 
to  that  effect, 
in  which  case  the  explanatory 
statement  annexed  to  the  notice  for  such  motion 
shall  indicate  the  justification  for  appointing  such  a 
person.  

6.  Minimum Number of Board Meetings 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, both the Companies Act and the SEBI LODR Regulations require at least four meetings of 
the  board  every  year  with  a  maximum  gap  of  one  hundred  and  twenty  days  between  any  two 
meetings. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  believes  that  the  four  meetings  of  the  board  tend  to  focus  primarily  on  financial 
results  and  other matters  relating  to  regular  compliance.  Hence,  boards  may  be  required  to meet 
more  frequently  to  focus  on  other  critical  aspects  of  a  listed  entity  such  as  its  management  and 
corporate  governance.  Accordingly,  it  is  recommended  that  the  minimum  number  of  meetings  of 
board of directors be increased to five every year. 

Additionally, the Committee is of the view that aspects like strategy, succession planning, budgets, 
risk  management,  ESG  (environment,  sustainability  and  governance)  and  board  evaluation  are 
critical  to  the  medium-term  and  long-term  future  of  a  listed  entity  –  and  in  order  to  ensure  that 
there is adequate attention paid thereto, the Committee recommends that, at least once a year, the 
above-referred aspects should be specifically discussed by the board.

management,  ESG  (environment,  sustainability  and 
governance) and succession planning.

7.  Updation of Knowledge of the Board Members  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, the Companies Act contains general provisions pertaining to the induction of independent 
directors.  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  require  familiarization  of  the  independent  directors  relating  to 
certain  specified  matters  and  that  the  board  of  directors  periodically  reviews  compliance  reports 
pertaining to all laws applicable to the listed entity as well as steps taken to rectify instances of non-
compliances. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  is  cognizant  of  the  ever-evolving  and  changing  regulatory  environment.  The 
Committee  also  acknowledges  that  ignorance  of  the  law  is  no  excuse,  and  that  the  board’s 
supervisory role holds it ultimately accountable for unlawful actions of the company. Accordingly, in 
order  for  the  directors  to  exercise  their  judgement  and  discharge  their  duties  with  sufficient 
knowledge, the directors need to be kept abreast of changes in laws, regulations, relevant judicial or 
regulatory orders, and compliance requirements.  

Therefore, in order to fill this information gap, it is recommended that at least once every year, the 
board of directors should be updated on regulatory and compliance changes. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):

regulations and compliance requirements.  

8.  NED Engagement with the Management  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  the  Companies  Act  and  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  do  not  have  any  provisions  requiring 
mandatory engagement of the NEDs with the management.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  believes  that  interaction  between  the  NEDs  and  the  management  is  critical  for  a 
better  understanding  by  NEDs  of  the  company’s  business  and  of  the  managerial  capacity  and 
capability of the company.  

Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that  at  least  once  every  year,  an  interaction  should  be  required 
between the NEDs and senior management.

9.  Quorum for Board Meetings 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, the Companies Act requires a quorum of one-third of the total strength of the  board of 
directors or two directors, whichever is higher, for every board meeting. SEBI LODR Regulations do 
not prescribe any quorum for meetings of board of directors. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  is  of  the  opinion  that  in  view  of  the  increased  obligations  of  the  boards  of  listed 
entities, a higher quorum may be required vis-à-vis other companies. The Committee also believes 
that in the interest of all stakeholders, especially minority shareholders, the presence of at least one 
independent director is required for every board meeting.  

Therefore, it is recommended that the quorum for every board meeting of the listed entity should 
be  a  minimum  of  three  directors  or  one-third  of  the  total  strength  of  the  board  of  directors, 
whichever is higher, including at least one independent director.

10. Separation  of  the  Roles  of  Non-executive  Chairperson  and  Managing 

Director/CEO 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  the  Companies  Act  states  that  an  individual  shall  not  be  appointed/reappointed  as  the 
chairperson  of  a  company  as  well  as  its  MD/CEO  at  the  same  time  unless  the  articles  of  such 
company  provide  otherwise  or  the  company  does  not  undertake  multiple  businesses.  SEBI  LODR 
Regulations do not mandate a separation of the posts of chairperson and chief executive officer of 
the listed entity but state that it is a discretionary requirement for a listed entity. (Click for Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Corporate  democracy  is  built  into  the  interconnected  arrangement  amongst  the  board,  the 
shareholders and the management, where the board supervises the management and reports to the 

 
 

 
19 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

shareholders. The issue of whether to separate the roles of the chairperson and the CEO/MD, while 
not a recent phenomenon, is a growing concern in corporate governance worldwide.  

The  separation  of  powers  of  the  chairperson  (i.e.  the  leader  of  the  board)  and  CEO/MD  (i.e.  the 
leader of the management) is seen to provide a better and more balanced governance structure by 
enabling better and more effective supervision of the management, by virtue of:  

a)  providing a structural advantage for the board to act independently; 

b) 

reducing excessive concentration of authority in a single individual; 

c) 

clarifying the respective roles of the chairperson and the CEO/MD;  

d)  ensuring that board tasks are not neglected by a combined chairperson-CEO/MD due to lack of 

time; 

e) 

increasing the possibility that the chairperson and CEO/MD posts will be assumed by individuals 
possessing the skills and experience appropriate for those positions; 

f) 

creating a board environment that is more egalitarian and conducive to debate. 

Several corporate governance codes for best practices recommend this, a few jurisdictions require it, 
and  many  companies  are  actively debating  whether to undertake  it.  The Committee noted that in 
some jurisdictions, such as the U.K. and Australia, this debate has tilted in favour of separating the 
two  posts.   In  other  countries,  such  as  France  and  the  U.S.,  the  issue  continues  to  be  vigorously 
debated. Countries with a two-tier board structure, such as Germany and the Netherlands, separate 
the top board and top management roles. 

In this regard, the Committee also noted the rationale of the United Kingdom’s Cadbury Committee 
in the Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance (1992) that “given 
the  importance  and  the  particular  nature  of  the  chairmen’s  role,  it  should  in  principle  be  separate 
from  that  of  the  chief  executive.  If  the  two  roles  are  combined  in  one  person,  it  represents  a 
considerable concentration of power”. 

After deliberation, the Committee believes that the time is right in India to introduce a separation of 
the roles of the Chairperson and the CEO/MD for listed entities. The Committee observed that such 
separation, at least at the stage of introduction of the construct, may be more relevant where public 
shareholders  constitute  a  large  portion  of  the  shareholding  of  a  company.  In  this  regard,  the 
Committee considered various thresholds and concluded at least 40% of public shareholding would 
be  an  appropriate  threshold.  Further,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  this  would  require  a  significant 
transition  from  the  existing  requirements,  the  Committee  believes  that  listed  entities  should  be 
given sufficient time to undertake such a transition. 

Therefore, it is recommended that: 

 

 

Listed  entities  with  more  than  40%  public  shareholding  should  separate  the  roles  of 
Chairperson and MD/CEO with effect from April 1, 2020.  
After 2020, SEBI may examine extending the requirement to all listed entities with effect from 
April 1, 2022.

more at the beginning of a financial year shall ensure 
that the Chairperson of the board of such listed entity 
shall  be  a  non  executive  director,  on  and  from  that 
financial year; 
 
Provided  that  once  a  listed  entity  is  subject  to  the 
above  provision,  any  subsequent  reduction  in  public 
shareholding  below  forty  percent  will  not  make  the 
provision inapplicable. 
 
After 2020, if deemed fit by SEBI, the aforesaid sub-
Regulation (1A) may be modified as under: 
(1A)  With  effect  from  April  1,  2022,  the  Chairperson 
of  the  board  of  each  of  the  listed  entities  shall  be  a 
non executive director. 

11. Matrix Reporting Structure 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act states that the board of directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all 
such  powers,  and  to  undertake  all  such  activities  as  the  company  is  authorised  to  exercise  and 
undertake.  Additionally,  the  board  of  directors  of  a  company  as  a  whole  is  responsible  for  all 
decision-making  in  relation  to  the  company,  with  the  ability  to  delegate  certain  powers  to 
committees/individuals,  and  is  required  to  provide  a  detailed  report  (popularly  referred  to  as  the 
Director’s Report) that sets forth details in relation to the company’s business, financial performance 
and certain other aspects. The SEBI LODR Regulations also set forth detailed responsibilities for the 
board of directors of a listed entity.  (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee acknowledges that many companies (including  global conglomerates) follow matrix 
reporting  structures  to  meet  their  internal  functional  reporting  requirements,  whereby  reporting 
happens  along  functional  lines  to  relevant  heads  who  operate  at  a  group  level  (including  in  other 
jurisdictions).  Given  that  the  Companies  Act  and  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  require  the  board  of 
directors  of  a  listed  entity  to  exercise  authority  and  assume  responsibility  for the  overall  business 
and  affairs  of  that  entity,  the  Committee  believes  that  informal  matrix  reporting  structures  may 
dilute the powers and the role of the board of a listed entity. 

Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a confirmation be provided by the board of  a listed 
entity as a part of the corporate governance report that it has been responsible for the business and 
overall affairs of the listed entity in the relevant financial year and that the reporting structures of 
the listed entity, formal and informal, are consistent with the above.

that  the  reporting  structures  of  the  listed  entity, 
formal and informal, are consistent with the above.  

12. Maximum Number of Directorships 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  the  Companies  Act provides that the maximum number of public companies in which a 
person  can  be  appointed  as  a  director  shall  not  exceed  ten.  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  state  that  a 
person  shall  not  serve  as  an  independent  director  in  more  than  seven  listed  entities  and  if  the 
director  is  a  whole  time  director  in  one  listed  entity,  then  he/she  can’t  serve  as  an  independent 
director in more than three listed entities. (Click for Detailed Provisions)  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee believes that multiple directorships beyond a reasonable limit may lead to a director 
not being able to allocate sufficient time to a particular company, thus hindering their ability to play 
an effective role. In light of the increasing responsibilities of corporate boards and thereby increased 
requirement  of  time  from  directors,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  maximum  number  of 
directorships  in  listed  entities  should  be  reduced  to  seven  (irrespective  of  whether  the  person  is 
appointed  as  an  independent  director  or  not).  However,  in  the  interest  of  providing  adequate 
transition time, the Committee recommends that the maximum number of listed entity directorships 
held by a person be brought down to eight by April 1, 2019 and to seven by April 1, 2020.

13. Disclosures on Board Evaluation  

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  and  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  contain  broad  provisions  on  board  evaluation  i.e. 
evaluation  of  the  performance  of:  (i)  the  board  as  a  whole,  (ii)  individual  directors  (including 
independent  directors  and  Chairperson)  and  (iii)  various  committees  of  the  board.  The  provisions 
also specify responsibilities of various persons/committees for  the  conduct of such evaluation and 
the disclosure requirements that are a part of the listed entity's corporate governance obligations. A 
guidance note on board evaluation has also been issued by SEBI vide circular dated January 5, 2017. 
(Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee is of the view that the concept of board evaluation is at a nascent stage in India and 
prescribing  detailed  requirements  in  this  area  may  not  be  desirable  at  this  stage.  The  Committee 
also takes note of the Guidance Note dated January 5, 2017 issued by SEBI on board evaluation and 
is of the opinion that the Note is comprehensive and covers all major aspects of board evaluation. 

However,  based  on  the  study  of  a  few  actual  board  evaluation  disclosures  made  by  global 
companies,  the  Committee  recommends  that  in  order  to  strengthen  disclosures  on  board 
evaluation,  a  guidance  should  be  issued  specifying,  in  particular,  the  following  disclosures  to  be 
made as a part of the disclosures on board evaluation: 

a)  Observations of board evaluation carried out for the year   

b)  Previous year’s observations and actions taken   

c)  Proposed actions based on current year observations 

In  due  course,  depending on  the  experience,  SEBI  could  consider  making  them  mandatory,  if  it so 
deems fit. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

Since the aforesaid recommendations are in the nature of guidance, no specific amendments may be 
required to the SEBI LODR Regulations. However, a guidance note in the nature of a circular should 
be issued by SEBI, in this regard stating as under: 

“All listed entities may consider the following as a part of their disclosures on board evaluation: 

a)  Observations of board evaluation carried out for the year   
b)  Previous year’s observations and actions taken   
c)  Proposed actions based on current year observations.”

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER II: THE INSTITUTION OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS 
 
The institution of Independent Directors (hereinafter referred to as ‘IDs’) forms the backbone of the 
corporate governance framework worldwide and in India. IDs are expected to bring objectivity into 
the  functioning  of  the  board  and  improve  its  effectiveness.  IDs  are  required  to  safeguard  the 
interests  of  all  stakeholders,  particularly  minority  shareholders,  balance  the  conflicting  interest  of 
the stakeholders and bring an objective view to the evaluation of the performance of the board and 
management.  

Given  the  importance  of  this  role,  the  institution  of  independent  directors  must  be  continually 
supported and strengthened. In this regard, the Committee believes that there needs to be greater 
focus  in  areas  of  eligibility,  monitoring,  awareness  of  role  and  functions,  domain  knowledge, 
provision  of  resources  to  play  an  effective  role,  adequacy  of  compensation  vis-à-vis  their 
responsibilities, addressing the fear of disproportionate liability, etc. An attempt has been made in 
this report to provide recommendations in this regard.  

1.  Minimum Number of Independent Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

At  present,  the  Companies  Act  requires  every  listed  company  to  have  at  least  one-third  of  total 
number of directors as IDs. SEBI LODR Regulations impose stricter obligations that require at least 
half  of  the  total  directors  of  the  board  of  a  listed  entity  to  be  IDs  if  the  Chairperson  is 
executive/related  to  the  promoter,  and  in  other  cases,  at  least  one-third  IDs.  (Click  for  Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

With the institution of the ID being the backbone of the governance of a company, it is imperative 
that  there  are  sufficient  IDs  on  a  board  to  ensure  safeguarding  of  interest  of  all  stakeholders, 
especially minority shareholders. To improve governance, it is recommended that every listed entity, 
irrespective of whether the Chairperson is executive or non-executive, may be required to have at 
least  half  its  total  number  of  directors  as  IDs.  However,  given  that  this  may  require  significant 
changes  to  the  composition  of  the  boards,  the  Committee  felt  that  appropriate  transition  time 
should be provided for effecting such change. In this regard, the Committee recommends that this 
be applicable to top 500 listed companies by market capitalization by April 1, 2019 and to the rest of 
listed companies by April 1, 2020.

at  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  financial 
year;  and  (ii)  with  effect  from  April  1,  2020,  for  all 
listed entities.  

2.  Eligibility Criteria for Independent Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Section 149(6) of the Companies Act and Regulation 16(1)(b) of the SEBI LODR Regulations set out 
certain objective criteria for determination of independence of a director. Under Section 149(7) of 
the Companies Act, every ID is required to provide a declaration that he/ she meets the legal criteria 
of  independence,  at  the  first  meeting  of  the  relevant  board  in  which  he  or  she  participates  as  a 
director and thereafter at the first meeting of the board in every financial year or whenever there is 
any change in the circumstances which may affect his status as an independent director.  

Further, at the time of appointment of an ID, the board needs to certify that in the opinion of the 
board, the ID proposed to be appointed fulfils the conditions specified in the Companies Act and the 
rules made thereunder and that the proposed director is independent of the management. (Click for 
Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and Rationale: 

Given the critical role of IDs within a good governance framework, and one of the most important 
elements being “independence”, the Committee felt that the evaluation of “independence” of an ID 
should  entail  both  objective  and  subjective  assessments  and  such  assessments  should  be  both 
continuing and genuine.  

In this regard, the Committee noted that there were some instances of persons who are relatives of 
promoters  being  appointed  as  IDs.  It  was  therefore  concluded  that  the  net  of  exclusions  be 
appropriately expanded to avoid the appointment of family associates as independent directors. The 
Committee  also  studied  different  options  on  measuring  or  ensuring  the  “spirit  of  independence” 
that  underlies  the  institution  of  IDs.  Given  the  nebulous  nature  of  the  determination  of 
“independence”, it was  felt  that a self-assessment of  “independence” be required  of every ID, the 
veracity of which would need to be confirmed by the board. 

 
 

 
25 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

Another  trend  that  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Committee  and  found  to  be  undesirable 
from a good governance standpoint, is “board interlocks” which may run a structural vulnerability of 
quid-pro-quo.  

In this context, the Committee recommends the revision of eligibility criteria for a director to be an 
“independent director” to also include the following:  

(i)  Specifically exclude persons who constitute the ‘promoter group’ of a listed entity;  

(ii)  Requirement  of  an  undertaking  from  the  ID  that  such  a  director  is  not  aware  of  any 
circumstance or situation, which exists or may be reasonably anticipated, that could impair or 
impact  his/her ability to discharge  his/her duties  with objective  independent  judgements and 
without any external influence. 

(iii)  The board of the listed entity taking on record the above undertaking after due assessment of 

the veracity of such undertaking. 

(iv)  Exclude  “board  inter-locks”  arising  due  to  common  non-independent  directors  on  boards  of 
listed entities (i.e.  a non-independent director of a company on the board of which any non-
independent director of the listed entity is an independent director, cannot be an independent 
director on the board of the listed entity). For instance, If Mr. A is an executive director on Co. A 
(being a listed entity) and is also an independent director on Co. B, then no non-independent 
director of Co. B can be an independent director on the board of Co. A. 

Further,  the  Committee  observed  that  there  needs  to  be  continuous  assessment  of  the 
independence  criteria.  Regulatory  requirements  for  testing  the  independence  of  directors  are 
currently  based  on  factual  information  or  checklists.  However,  true  independence  is  a  function  of 
behavior,  and  an  objectiveness  being  brought  to  board  deliberations  and  overall  decision  making. 
Some  markets  follow  a  practice  of  the  board  certifying  to  the  independence  of  its  directors:  the 
Committee believes this practice must be brought to India as well. It is therefore recommended that 
the  board  of  directors  as  a  part  of  the  board  evaluation  process  may  be  required  to  certify  every 
year  that  each  of  its  IDs  fulfils  the  conditions  specified  in  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  and  is 
independent of the management.

3.  Minimum Compensation to Independent Directors  

Current regulatory provisions: 

While  the  Companies  Act  prescribes  a  ceiling  on  the  compensation  that  can  be  paid  to  directors, 
there is no requirement for minimum compensation to be paid, except that the sitting fee paid to 
IDs cannot be lower than that of other directors.  SEBI LODR Regulations also do not prescribe any 
minimum compensation to be paid to IDs. (Click for Detailed Provisions)

Recommendation and rationale: 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

The  Committee  acknowledges  that  good  governance  is  the  cornerstone  of  value  creation  and 
sustainable  growth  of  listed  entities,  and  that  independent  directors  have  a  pivotal  role  to  play  in 
such good governance. The Committee believes that, (a) a risk-reward balance in the compensation 
payable  to  IDs,  would  make  it  attractive  for competent  people  to  accept  appointment  as  IDs,  and 
that (b) the compensation paid should be commensurate to the value that the IDs deliver.  

Therefore, in order to attract competent IDs on the boards of the listed entities, it is recommended 
that a listed entity may be required to pay certain minimum compensation to IDs as under: 

1.  The minimum total remuneration for an ID per year shall be Rs. 5 lakhs for top 500 companies 
by  market  capitalisation  (subject  to  approvals  as  required  under  Companies  Act).  In  case  of 
inadequacy of profits, the minimum requirement of Rs. 5 lakhs shall not apply. 

2.  The minimum sitting fees to be paid to IDs for every board meeting shall be: 

a.  Rs. 50,000 for top 100 companies by market capitalisation; 

b.  Rs. 25,000 for next 400 companies by market capitalisation.  

3.  The minimum sitting fees to be paid to IDs for every audit committee meeting shall be: 

a.  Rs. 40,000 for top 100 companies by market capitalisation; 

b.  Rs. 20,000 for next  400 companies by market capitalisation.  

4.  The minimum sitting fees to be paid to IDs for every other board committee meeting (only for 

those committees which are mandatory under SEBI LODR Regulations) shall be: 

a.  Rs. 20,000 for top 100 companies by market capitalisation; 

b.  Rs. 10,000 for next 400 companies by market capitalisation.  

While  the  Committee  acknowledges  the  importance  of  all  board  committees,  it  is  felt  that  the 
workload and obligations on the Audit Committee are significantly higher and therefore merit higher 
sitting fees.

4.  Disclosures on Resignation of Independent Directors  

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  provides  that  a  director  who  resigns  before  the  expiry  of  his  term  shall  give 
detailed reasons to the registrar of companies. There is no specific provision on this aspect in SEBI 
LODR Regulations. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Companies  Act  already  provides  for  the  disclosure  of  detailed  reasons  to  the  registrar  of 
companies  in  case  of  resignation  of  a  director  prior  to  the  expiry  of  his/her  term.  However,  this 
disclosure can be made anytime within 30 days of the resignation and therefore is not current. There 
is no corresponding provision in the SEBI LODR Regulations which requires (immediate) disclosure to 
the stock exchanges in case of resignation of a director.  

The  Committee  noted  that  IDs  are  in  a  unique  position,  not  being  a  part  of  the  executive 
management  but  having  overall  insight  into  the  functioning  of  the  listed  entity  –  and  that  their 
resignation (prior to expiry of their term) may be occasioned by reasons that need wider disclosure 
(including material negative developments or governance concerns). Also, as the resignation of IDs 
can be construed as a worrisome sign for external stakeholders, in order to provide greater clarity 
and  reassurance  to  the  stakeholder  community,  it  is  considered  a  good  practice  for  companies  to 
provide  full  disclosure  on  the  reasons  for  an  ID’s  resignation.  In  this  context,  the  Committee  also 
encourages directors to be  forthright  in providing reasons for their resignation: resigning directors 

 
 

 
29 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

must  consider  this  to  be  the  last  act  of  discharging  their  fiduciary  responsibility  towards  the 
company’s stakeholders.   

The Committee recommends that listed entities should be required to disclose detailed reasons for 
resignation  of  IDs  (as  provided  by  such  IDs)  along  with  the  notification  of  their  resignation  to  the 
stock exchanges, as well as subsequently as part of the corporate governance report. As part of such 
disclosure, the  listed entity should include a confirmation as received from the director that there 
are  no  other  material  reasons  other  than  those  set  out  therein.  The  Committee  believes  this  will 
enhance transparency and strengthen the institution of IDs.

shall also be made by the listed entity.  

Proposed modifications to SEBI circular:

7.1A. Detailed reasons for the resignation of independent directors as given by the said director; 
Provided that the director shall be required to confirm that there are no other material reasons other than 
those provided, the disclosure of which shall also be made by the listed entity.  

5.  Directors and Officers Insurance for Independent Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  provides  that  the  letter  of  appointment  of  IDs  shall  specify  the  provision  for 
Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance, if any. However, it is not mandatory under the Companies 
Act  for  a  company  to  undertake  such  D&O  insurance.  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  have  no  specific 
provision on the matter. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

IDs have significant responsibilities and liabilities in their capacity as board members and even more 
so in their capacity as an IDs. It is often observed that such liabilities act as a deterrent for several 
good quality IDs from joining corporate boards.  

It  is  therefore  recommended  that  it  may  initially  be  mandatory  for Top 500  companies  by  market 
capitalization to undertake D&O insurance for its IDs, with effect from October 1, 2018, which may 

 
 

 
30

be subsequently extended to all listed entities. However, it may be left to the board of directors of 
the listed entity to determine the quantum and type of risks covered under such insurance.

and  Officers  insurance  (‘D  and  O  insurance’)  for  all 
their independent directors of such quantum and for 
such  risks  as  may  be  determined  by  its  board  of 
directors with effect from October 1, 2018.  
 
Based on future impact assessment as deemed fit by 
SEBI,  the  aforesaid  sub-Regulation  (8)  may  be 
modified as under: 
(8)  All  listed  entities  shall  undertake  Directors  and 
Officers  insurance  (‘D  and  O  insurance’)  for  all  their 
independent directors of such quantum and for such 
risks as may be determined by its board of directors.  

6.  Induction and Training of Independent Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act provides general clauses pertaining to training, induction, etc. of directors. SEBI 
LODR  Regulations  require  familiarization of  the  IDs  relating  to  certain  specified  matters.  However, 
specific provisions on induction training and periodicity of continuous updation are lacking. (Click for 
Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The IDs will, in most cases, bring a diverse set of skills and experiences to the board deliberations – 
some  of  these  may  not  be  strictly  associated  with  the  company’s  main  operation  /  business  or 
product. To ensure that these skills can be harnessed in the context of the company’s business, it is 
important to ensure that these IDs understand the company’s operations in reasonable granularity. 
While accepting that IDs will not, and need not, know the business as well as executive directors, the 
Committee recommends the following:   

 
 

A formal induction should be mandatory for every new ID appointed to the board; and 
Formal  training,  whether  external/internal,  especially  with  respect  to  governance  aspects, 
should  be  required  for  every  ID  once  every  five  years,  the  onus  of  which  shall  be  on  the 
director.

(7A)  Each  independent  director  shall  ensure  that 
he/she  undergoes  formal  training  once  every  five 
years  on 
their  roles  and  responsibilities  with 
particular emphasis on governance aspects, and shall 
certify compliance with the same to the listed entities 
every year: 
Provided  that  all  independent  directors  currently  on 
boards of listed entities shall ensure compliance with 
this  provision  within  a  period  of  two  years  from  the 
date of its notification. 

7.  Alternate Directors for Independent Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act permits alternate directors for all directors including IDs (for a director during his 
absence for a period of not less than three months from India). It also states that no person shall be 
appointed as an alternate director for an ID unless he is qualified to be appointed as an ID under the 
provisions of  this  Act.  There  is  no specific  provision pertaining  to  alternate  directors  in  SEBI LODR 
Regulations. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

IDs  are  elected  to  the  board  for  their  skills,  experience,  acumen,  network  and  objectivity.  These 
qualities  are  unique  to  the  relevant  appointee  and  are  not  replaceable  with  an  alternate. 
Additionally,  the  concept  of  alternate  directors  itself  (i.e.  a  director  being  appointed  in  case  of 
absence  of  the  appointee  director  for  a  particular  duration  from  a  particular  place)  was  probably 
more  relevant  when  the  physical  presence  of  directors  was  required  to  constitute  attendance  at 
board  meetings  –  currently,  the  Companies  Act  recognizes  the  right  of  directors  to  attend  board 
meetings  via  video  conference  and  other  audio  visual  means  (which  enables  directors  to  attend 
meetings  from  any  location).  For  the  above  reasons,  the  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  the 
appointment of an alternate director for IDs should not be permitted.

8.  Lead 

Independent  Director 

in  Companies  with  Non-independent 

Chairperson  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no requirement of a Lead ID in Companies Act/SEBI LODR Regulations.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee acknowledges that while IDs have equal fiduciary responsibility as other directors on 
the board, their role is more defined and distinct and needs better coordination amongst the IDs to 
improve  effectiveness.  In  this,  it  was  felt  that  the  appointment  of  a  Lead  ID  may  facilitate  better 
engagement  of,  and  by,  the  IDs.  Globally,  there  are  several  countries  which  adopt  the  concept  of 
lead  IDs  in  their  jurisdictions.  The  Lead  ID  is  expected  to  assist  in  coordinating  the  activities  and 
decisions of the other non-executive and/or independent directors to chair the meetings of the IDs.  

The position of Lead ID becomes especially crucial where the chairperson is non-independent.  

The Committee recommends the following: 

1.  All listed entities where the Chairperson is not independent to designate an ID as the Lead ID; 

2.  The Lead ID should be a member of NRC; 

3.  The Lead ID shall:  

a) 

lead  exclusive  meetings  of  the  IDs  and  provide  feedback  to  the  Chairperson/board  of 
directors after such meetings; 

b)  Serve as liaison between the chairperson of the board and the IDs;  

c)  Preside  over  meetings  of  the  board  at  which  the  chairperson  or  vice-chairperson  is  not 

present, including executive sessions of the IDs;  

d)  Have the authority to call meetings of the IDs; and  

e) 

If  requested  by  significant  shareholders,  ensure  that  he/she  is  available  for  consultation 
and direct communication.

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act and the SEBI LODR Regulations require at least one meeting of the IDs in a year 
without the presence of other directors.  (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  observed  that  given  the  inherent  information  asymmetry  between  IDs  and 
executive/promoter  directors,  exclusive  meetings  of  IDs  encourage  free  flowing  discussions  and 
facilitate higher preparedness for effective participation of the IDs. Further, such meetings assume 
greater importance in view of the proposed introduction of the concept of Lead ID. Therefore, the 
Committee  recommends that such meetings may be held more  than once  at the  discretion of the 
IDs.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendments are required to SEBI LODR Regulations.  

10. Casual Vacancy of Office of Independent Director  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, the Companies Act states that if the office of any director appointed by the company in a 
general  meeting  is  vacated  before  his  term  of  office  expires  in  the  normal  course,  the  resulting 

 
 

 
34 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

casual vacancy may, in default of and subject to any regulations in the articles of the company, be 
filled for the residual term by the board of directors at a meeting of the board.  

SEBI LODR Regulations provide for filling the vacancy of IDs only in case of resignation and removal 
and provides that in case of such resignation/removal, such vacancy shall be filled but not later than 
the  immediate  next  meeting  of  the  board  of  directors  or  three  months  from  the  date  of  such 
vacancy, whichever is later. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

IDs represent the interests of all stakeholders, especially minority shareholders. At the first instance, 
the IDs are appointed by the shareholders. In the same spirit, the Committee recommends that any 
appointment to fill a casual vacancy of office of any ID should also be approved by the shareholders 
at the next general meeting.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER III: BOARD COMMITTEES  
 
Given  the  broad  range  of  responsibilities  of  the  board,  the  constitution  of  committees  enables 
effective  governance  through  small-group  discussions,  focus  and  diligence  on  various  aspects.  The 
key  is  to  ensure  an  appropriate  balance  between  the  role  delegated  to  a  board  committee  while 
maintaining  the  overall  supervisory  role  of  the  Board,  with  key  matters  requiring  prior 
recommendation  of  the  relevant  committee  and  final  approval  of  the  Board.   The  law  already 
provides for several mandatory board committees with distinct roles and responsibilities, including 
the  audit  committee,  stakeholder  relationship  committee,  nomination  and  remuneration 
committee,  corporate  social  responsibility  committee,  and  for  some  companies,  even  a  risk 
management committee.  

like  balanced  representation 

The  Committee  recognizes  that  the  effective  functioning  of  board  committees  is  crucial  for  the 
Board  to  successfully  discharge  its  duties.  Therefore,  the  Committee’s  recommendations  address 
fundamentals 
in  board  committees,  mandating  more  focused 
discussion  by  setting  a  minimum  number  of  meetings  and  a  quorum  for  each  such  committee. 
Further,  keeping  in  mind  the  changing  operating  environment,  and  expanding  scope  of  roles  and 
responsibilities of the Board, the Committee also recommends an increase in the number and nature 
of board committees.  

1.  Minimum Number of Committee Meetings 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, SEBI LODR Regulations require at least four meetings of the Audit Committee every year. 
The SEBI LODR Regulations does not require a minimum number of meetings for other committees. 
(Click for Detailed Provisions)  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  four  Audit  Committee  meetings  in  the  year  are  generally  tied  in  with  the  quarterly  financial 
results  where most  of the discussions revolve around financial and other regulatory &  compliance 
matters.  

Therefore,  to  allow  audit  committees  the  time  and  opportunity  to  address  matters  beyond  the 
quarterly reporting, it is recommended that the minimum number of Audit Committee meetings be 
increased to five every year. This is also consistent with the recommendation to increase the number 
of board meetings from four to five.  

In addition, the Committee recommends all other mandatory board committees necessarily meet at 
least once in a year.

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act and the SEBI LODR Regulations provide the specific role and terms of reference

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee is of the opinion that the audit committee should also review the utilization of funds 
of the listed entity infused into unlisted subsidiaries including foreign subsidiaries. In order to ensure 
such  an  obligation  is  not  onerous  on  the  audit  committee,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the 
audit committee should be required to scrutinize the end utilization of funds where the total amount 
of loans/advances/investment from the holding company to the subsidiary exceeds Rs. 100 crore or 
10% of the asset size of the subsidiary, whichever is lower.

3.  Composition of Nomination and Remuneration Committee  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Under the Companies Act, the Audit Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
(hereinafter referred to as “NRC”) are required to have at least half of their members as IDs. On the 
other hand, under SEBI LODR Regulations, while the Audit Committee is required to have 2/3rd of its 
members  as  IDs,  the  NRC  is  required  to  have  only  half  of  its  members  as  IDs.  (Click  for  Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  the  role  and  importance  of  NRC  is  increasing  by  the  day  and 
ensuring  independence  of  the  NRC  is  becoming  crucial  for  effective  governance  of  the  entity. 
Therefore,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  requirement  of  having  at  least  two  thirds  of  its 
members  as  IDs  may  be  required  for  NRC  as  well,  in  line  with  the  requirement  for  the  audit 
committee.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2019):

(1)  The  board  of  directors  shall  constitute  the

independent directors.

4.  Role of Nomination and Remuneration Committee  

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act and SEBI LODR Regulations provide for detailed provisions on roles and functions 
of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC). (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Currently,  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  state  that  the  role  of  the  NRC  includes  identifying  persons  who 
may  be  appointed  in  senior  management  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  laid  down,  and 
recommending to the board of directors their appointment and removal.  

It  is  recommended  that  a  clarification  be  provided  that  persons  in  senior  management  should 
include  all  members  of  management  one  level  below  the  chief  executive  officer/managing 
director/whole time director/manager (including CEO/manager, in case CEO/manager is not part of 
the board) and shall specifically include the company secretary and the chief financial officer. 

Further,  it  was  noted  by  the  Committee  that  in  the  absence  of  specific  provisions  in  SEBI  LODR 
Regulations,  compensation  paid  to  certain  KMPs  were  not  being  recommended  by  NRC  in  some 
companies. Therefore, it was decided that it may be clearly specified in SEBI LODR Regulations that 
all payments made to senior management, in whatever form, shall be recommended by the NRC to 
the  board  of  the  listed  entity.  The  Committee  recommends  that  this  process  be  followed  for  any

5.  Composition and Role of Stakeholders Relationship Committee  

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act and SEBI LODR Regulations provide for detailed provisions on composition and 
role of the Stakeholders Relationship Committee (hereinafter referred to as “SRC”) and specify that 
the role of the SRC shall be inter alia to consider and resolve the grievances of the security holders of 
a  listed  entity  including  complaints  related  to  the  transfer  of  shares,  non-receipt  of  annual  report 
and non-receipt of declared dividends. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  rapidly  growing  influence  of  activists  in  global  capital  markets  is  fundamentally  transforming 
how public-company boards interact with investors. This transformation extends to the role of the 
board in investor relations,  cognizance of the  importance  of outside voices, and more  transparent 
relationships  between  directors  and  company  managers.  Today,  as  a  direct  consequence  of 
shareholder  activism,  boards  and  executives  frequently  review  lists  of  the  largest  shareholders  in 
order of percentage of holdings. They then decide on a consultation strategy. Mary Jo White, the ex-
chair  of  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  has  even  publicly  stated  that  shareholder 
relations  are  now  a  board  duty:  “The  board  of  directors  is—or  ought  to  be—a  central  player  in 
shareholder engagement.”

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

Larry  Fink,  CEO  of  BlackRock  wrote  an  April  2015  letter  to  all  S&P 500  CEOs,  urging  them  to  have 
“consistent  and  sustained  engagement”  with  their  shareholders.  And  the  Vanguard  Group  has 
encouraged boards of its investee companies to promote communication with shareholders through 
a “shareholder liaison committee” or other structures. 

Recent events in India have brought into sharp focus the role of active investors and major security 
holders not just in questioning the quality of governance of boards, but also demanding greater and 
continual engagement in the areas of strategy and significant decisions made by companies.  

While the SRC exists in India, currently, the Companies Act and SEBI LODR Regulations specify that 
the role of the SRC shall be to consider and resolve the grievances of the security holders of a listed 
entity,  including  complaints  related  to  transfer  of  shares,  non-receipt  of  annual  report  and  non-
receipt of declared dividends. The Committee is of the view that the role of the SRC is limited and 
recommends a significant increase in its scope and responsibilities to include actively engaging and 
communicating  with  the  major  shareholders  of  the  company/Group  it  represents,  including 
obtaining proactive input on strategy. 

In arriving at its conclusions, the Committee considered several factors, including that most directors 
assume that dealing with investors is the role of management and revamping the composition of the 
existing SRC to add strategic and investor skills. In its  deliberations, the  Committee  felt  that these 
challenges  could  be  mitigated  through  a  purposeful  reshaping  of  the  SRC  by  inducting  new  skills, 
(including adding an ID).  

In addition to the existing role of resolving the grievances of the security holders of the listed entity 
including  complaints  related  to  transfer/transmission  of  shares,  non-receipt  of  annual  report  and 
non-receipt of declared dividends, it is recommended that the role of the SRC be widened to include 
the following: 

(1)  Resolving  security  holder  grievances  relating  to  issue  of  new/duplicate  certificates,  general 

meetings etc. 

(2)  Proactively communicating and engaging  with security  holders including  with the  institutional 
shareholders at least once a year along with members of the Committee/Board/KMPs, as may 
be required and identifying actionable points for implementation.  

(3)  Reviewing measures taken for effective exercise of voting rights by shareholders.  

(4)  Reviewing adherence to the service standards adopted by the listed entity in respect of various 

services being rendered by the Registrar & Share Transfer Agent.  

(5)  Reviewing various measures and initiatives taken by the listed entity for reducing the quantum 
receipt  of  dividend  warrants/annual 

of  unclaimed  dividends  and  ensuring 
reports/statutory notices by the security shareholders of the company. 

timely 

Further, the Committee recommends that there be at least three directors as members of the SRC, 
with at least one being an ID. Further, the Committee recommends that the Chairperson of the SRC 
be present in the annual general meeting to answer queries of the security holders.

6.  Quorum for Committee Meetings 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  there  is  no  quorum  requirement  for  meetings  of  the  committees  of  the  board  in  the 
Companies  Act.  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  specifies  quorum  requirement  for  meetings  of  the  Audit 
committee but not for other committees. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

IDs bring an unbiased perspective to the proceedings of committee/board meetings, which improves 
the quality of governance and decision making. In order to protect the interest of all stakeholders, 
especially minority  shareholders,  it  is  recommended  that  for  meetings  of  each  such  committee  of 
the board, the composition of which statutorily requires at least one ID, the presence of at least one 
ID may be made mandatory for attaining quorum for such meetings (apart from the audit committee 
where the quorum requirement remains unchanged).

whichever  is  greater,  with  at  least  one  independent 
director. 

7.  Applicability and Role of Risk Management Committee 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, SEBI LODR Regulations require the constitution of a risk management committee by the 
top 100 listed entities. There is no specific provision in the Companies Act on this aspect. The role of 
the  risk  management  committee  is  not  specified  in  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations.  (Click  for  Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Given  the  dynamic  business  environment, an  active  risk  management  committee  is  imperative  for 
identification, mitigation and resolution of risks. These risks that are being managed operationally on 
a daily basis call for a more formal structure, especially for the next set of high-growth companies. 
Hence, it is recommended to extend the requirement of a Risk Management Committee to the top 
500 listed entities by market capitalization as against current applicability to top 100 listed entities. 
In addition, the Committee recommends that, in view of the increasing relevance of cyber security 
and related risks, the role of risk management committee specifically cover this aspect.

8.  Membership and Chairpersonship Limit 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  in  determining  the  maximum  number  of  committees  of  which  a  director  can  be  a 
member/Chairperson, SEBI LODR Regulations considers only the Audit Committee and Stakeholders 
Relationship Committee. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee recognizes the important role that is being played and would continue to be played 
by  the  NRC,  which  is  integral  to  the  entity’s  governance  processes.  Therefore,  in  addition  to 
recommending a higher number of IDs as part of constitution of the NRC (as recommended above), 
it is also recommended that in determining the maximum number of committees of which a director 
can  be  a  member/Chairperson,  NRC  should  also  be  included  and  thereby  treated  at  par  with  the 
Audit Committee and Stakeholders Relationship Committee.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER IV: ENHANCED MONITORING OF GROUP ENTITIES  
 
As companies grow  in scale  and operations go global, businesses become more  complex. Business 
and structural compulsions (both legal and financial) often necessitate the creation of holding and 
operating  entities.  The  Committee  notes  that  several  listed  entities  in  India  operate  through  a 
network  of  entities  –  where  some  companies  have  over  200  subsidiaries,  step-down  subsidiaries, 
associates, and joint ventures. While investors hold direct equity only in the listed holding company, 
they have valued the entire business structure at the time of investment. Therefore, it is important 
for  boards  to  ensure  that  good  governance  trickles  down  to  the  entire  structure.  Accordingly,  to 
provide  for  better  transparency  on  the  governance  levels  of  downstream  investee  entities  of  the 
listed entity and to improve the monitoring of the listed entity at a consolidated level, the following 
recommendations have been made by the Committee. 

1.  Obligation on the Board of the Listed Entity with Respect to Subsidiaries 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act does not provide for the board of the listed entity to oversee the affairs of its 
subsidiaries. SEBI LODR Regulations, however, impose specific obligations on the board of the listed 
entity with respect to its subsidiaries such as: at least one ID must be a director in unlisted material 
Indian subsidiaries; audit committee to review financial statements of unlisted subsidiaries; minutes 
of  the  board  of  directors  of  an  unlisted  subsidiary  to  be  placed  before  a  meeting  of  the  board  of 
directors of the listed entity; etc. SEBI LODR Regulations also provide the threshold for determining 
“material  subsidiary”  as  a  subsidiary  whose  income  or  networth  exceeds  20%  of  the  consolidated 
income or networth of the listed entity. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Many  Indian  companies  operate  through  global  and  Indian  subsidiaries  in  view  of  business  needs. 
These  subsidiaries  are  an  integral/material  part  of  the  listed  entity.  In  many  instances,  the  global 
subsidiaries are as large as the Indian listed entity. Hence, these global subsidiaries should be at par 
with  Indian  subsidiaries  in  the  context  of  governance.  The  Committee  also  observed  that  an 
appropriate level of review and oversight is required of the board of the listed entity over its unlisted 
subsidiaries for protection of interests of public shareholders.  

Further, the Committee noted from the presentation made by ICSI that based on an analysis of the 
top  100  listed  companies  at  BSE,  under  the  existing  threshold  for  determining  “material 
subsidiaries”, less than 3% of the  total subsidiaries  get classified as such.  Therefore, the  threshold 
may be modified to 10% to enhance monitoring and hence governance of material subsidiaries. 

In the interest of better monitoring at a consolidated level, the following is recommended:  

Currently, SEBI LODR Regulations require that at least one ID on the board of directors of the 
listed  entity  shall  be  a  director  on  the  board  of  directors  of  an  unlisted  material  subsidiary, 
incorporated  in  India.  The  same  may  be  extended  to  unlisted  foreign  material  subsidiaries  as 
well.  

Currently, LODR Regulations state that the management of the unlisted subsidiary be required 
periodically to bring to the notice of the board of directors of the listed entity, a statement of all 
significant  transactions  and  arrangements  entered  into  by  the  unlisted  subsidiary.  However, 
under the explanation for the term “significant transaction or arrangement”, the term “unlisted 
material  subsidiary”  has  been  used.  The  Committee  is  of  the  opinion  that  significant

transactions which could be higher than the prescribed limits of even those companies which 
are not material subsidiaries should come under the purview of the board of the listed entity. 
Therefore,  it  was  recommended  that  the  word  “material”  shall  be  dropped  from  the 
explanation to Regulation 24(4) of SEBI LODR Regulations. 

The definition of the term “material subsidiary” should be revised to mean a subsidiary whose 
income  or  net worth  exceeds  10%  (from  the  current  20%)  of the  consolidated income  or  net 
worth  respectively,  of  the  listed  entity  and  its  subsidiaries  in  the  immediately  preceding 
accounting  year, other than for  requirement of appointment of  independent directors  on the 
boards of material subsidiaries (where the threshold of 20% continues).

2.  Group Governance Unit/Committee and Policy 

Current regulatory provisions: 

There are currently no provisions under the Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations with respect to 
group governance unit/governance committee or a group governance policy. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

In order to improve monitoring of group entities, it is recommended that where a listed entity has a 
large number of unlisted subsidiaries: 

1)  The listed entity may monitor their governance through a dedicated group governance unit or 

Governance Committee comprising the members of the board of the listed entity.  

2)  A strong and effective group governance policy may be established by the entity.  

3)  However,  the  decision  of  setting  up  of  such  a  unit/committee  and  having  such  a  group 

governance policy may be left to the board of the listed entity.  

Accordingly, it is recommended that guidance to this effect may be provided by SEBI.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendments may be required to SEBI LODR Regulations.  

However,  guidance  may  be  issued  by  SEBI  stating  the  following  where  a  listed  entity  has  multiple 
unlisted subsidiaries: 

 

 

 

The  entity  may  monitor  their  governance  through  a  dedicated  group  governance  unit  or 
Governance Committee comprising the members of its board of directors.  

A strong and effective group governance policy may be established by the entity. 

The  decision  of  setting  up  of  such  a  unit/committee  or  having  such  a  policy  shall  lie  with  the 
board of directors of the listed entity. 

3.  Secretarial Audit  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  the  Companies  Act  requires  a  secretarial  audit  for  listed  companies  and  unlisted 
companies  above  a  certain  threshold.  However,  there  is  no  specific  provision  for  secretarial  audit 
under SEBI LODR Regulations. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Secretarial functions are critical to efficient board functioning. Therefore, it is recommended that: 

Secretarial  audit  may  be  made  compulsory  for  all  listed  entities  under  the  SEBI  LODR 
Regulations in line with the provisions of Companies Act. 

Secretarial audit may also be extended to all material unlisted Indian subsidiaries. This is in line 
with the theme of strengthening group oversight and improving compliance at a group level.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER V: PROMOTERS/CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED 
PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
 
A majority of Indian listed entities continue to be promoter driven, with significant shareholding held 
by  promoter/promoter  group.  Therefore,  protection  of  the  interests  of  minority  shareholders, 
especially those of retail shareholders assumes even greater importance. In this context, checks and 
balances  on  interactions  and  relationships  between  listed  entities  and  the  promoters/significant 
shareholders is crucial for good governance.   

The Committee therefore deliberated at length on aspects such as information rights of promoters, 
significant  non-promoter  shareholders,  approval  of  related  party  transactions  and  arrived  at  the 
following recommendations: 

1.  Sharing  of  Information  with  Controlling  Promoters/Shareholders  with 

Nominee Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  2015 
(hereinafter referred to as “SEBI PIT Regulations”) provide that any communication or procurement 
of unpublished price sensitive information (hereinafter referred to as “UPSI”) is prohibited except in 
furtherance of legitimate purpose, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. The SEBI 
LODR  Regulations  provide  for  equitable  treatment  of  all  shareholders.  Under  the  SEBI  PIT 
Regulations  and  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations,  there  is  no  specific  provision  enabling  information 
sharing by the listed entity with specific shareholders. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and Rationale: 

Equal access to information and information symmetry is the cornerstone of efficient functioning of 
any securities market. This, in fact, is the genesis and foundation of the market conduct laws in India 
and specifically the laws curbing communication of UPSI and insider trading. The law does, however, 
facilitate asymmetric access to UPSI for legitimate purposes, performance of duties and discharge of 
legal obligations. These are subjective standards requiring event-based determination.  

The Committee members recognize that the business reality in India is that a majority of the listed 
Indian entities are controlled by a single promoter (or a set of persons acting in concert) where the 
lines  of  control,  influence  and  information  flow  do  not  necessarily  follow  the  formal  and  distinct 
corporate structure. This is true for Indian groups as well as MNCs. Information flow occurs through 
informal  channels,  matrix  structures  and  through  nominees.  Generally,  these  may  be  for  genuine 
business  reasons,  such  as  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions,  mergers,  divestments, 
financing, etc., which often require the support of the promoter to be successful. The significance of 
the role played by promoters is recognized in the legal construct as well, where extant regulations 
impose greater responsibility on promoters as compared to other shareholders in relation to certain 
strategic  matters  such  as  funding.  Further,  in  addition  to  promoters,  there  are  shareholders  with 
such strategic or financial association with the company (such as private equity investors) that they 
are  considered  significant  by  the  company  and  consequently,  allowed  to  exercise  their 
representation and information rights through nominee directors on the board of such company. 

While it is recognized that the status of a promoter is akin to a perpetual insider requiring access to 
information on a regular basis and the role of the nominee director is to protect the interests of the 
nominating  shareholder  (subject  to  the  former’s  fiduciary  duty),  the  information  flow  to  such 

 
 

 
49 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

promoters and significant shareholders occurs in the “shadows” in the absence of a green channel 
legitimizing  such  information  flow.  Given  the  absence  of  a  formal  green  channel  on  information 
access  and  an  explicit  framework  recognizing  a  legitimate  right  to  information  of  promoters  and 
significant  shareholders,  all  communication  of  UPSI  to  promoters  and  significant  shareholders 
(including  those  for  legitimate  purposes  and  on  a  need-to-know  basis)  are  open  to  regulatory 
scrutiny on a post facto basis.  

Therefore,  the  Committee  members  felt  that  the  ground  realities  are  at  substantial  variance  from 
the  legal  framework  and  this  regulatory  white  space  has  so  far  possibly  been  filled  in  by  virtue of 
legal interpretation (of terms such as “legitimate purpose”, “need to know”, etc.), market practice 
and  pragmatism.  Whilst  derivative  economic  interest  may  suffice  for  some  entities  to  constitute 
legitimate  purpose,  other  companies  may  need  clarity  on  each  issue.  This  entails  event-based 
determination  based  on  subjective  standards  which  not  only 
legal 
interpretations of “legitimate purpose” but also brings uncertainty in the business environment and 
adversely impacts the ease of doing business.  This has also led to creation of a grey zone which is 
examined only when something goes wrong. 

leads  to  ambiguous 

After  due  consideration  and  detailed  deliberation,  the  Committee  members  proposed  that  the 
regulatory framework should be amended to provide an enabling transparent framework regulating 
the  information  rights  of  certain  promoters  (including  promoters  of  the  promoter)  and  significant 
shareholders to reduce subjectivity and provide clarity for ease of business, along with appropriate 
and  adequate  checks  and  balances  to  prevent  any  abuse  and  unlawful  exchange  of  UPSI  i.e.  to 
ensure information moves from one known safe container to another. The Committee recommends 
that  this  framework  be  optional  at  this  stage.  In  addition,  this  framework  will  not  impact  the 
applicability of the SEBI PIT Regulations other than as specified.  

Detailed recommendations of the Committee in relation to amendments to the current regulations 
are set out below.

2.  Re-classification  of  Promoters/Classification  of  Entities  as  Professionally 

Managed  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Presently,  the  Companies  Act  is  silent  on  reclassification  of  promoters,  while  the  SEBI  LODR 
Regulations permit reclassification of promoters in limited circumstances.  

SEBI LODR Regulations cover mainly four aspects on the subject: (i) requirement of approval of stock 
exchanges, (ii) reclassification when a promoter is replaced by a new promoter, (iii) reclassification 
where  a  company  ceases  to  have  any  promoters  (i.e.  becomes  professionally  managed)  and  (iv) 
general conditions. The specific categories of reclassification as specified in points (ii) and (iii) require 
the  approval  of  shareholders.  In  addition,  in  cases  where  the  entity  becomes  professionally 
managed,  the  aggregate  shareholding  of  a  person  or  group  along  with  persons  acting  in  concert 
(hereinafter referred to as “PACs”) should not exceed 1%. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale:  

The Committee is of the opinion that where there is no identifiable promoter/promoter group, the 
1%  threshold  to  be  able  to  classify  the  entity  as  professionally  managed  is  too  low  and  merits  an 
increase to 10% for the following reasons: 

 

 

from the listed entity’s perspective, if a promoter (being sole promoter) along with its promoter 
group/PAC  in  aggregate  holds  less  than  10%,  it  is  unlikely  to  be  able  to  exercise  de-facto 
control; and 

from the promoter’s perspective, even after ceasing to be in control, a ‘promoter’ may want to 
continue as a financial investor with a shareholding of more than 1%, and in such cases, should 
not be required to reduce his/her shareholding to 1% or lower.  

In addition, the SEBI LODR Regulations also do not deal with a situation where there are multiple and 
distinct parties classified as promoters, and one of them wishes to be reclassified. The Committee is 
of  the  opinion  that  there  ought  to  be  a mechanism to enable  such  reclassification,  to ensure that 
persons who may  have  been  promoters  but  are  no  longer  in  day-to-day  control  and management 
and have a low shareholding, should have an “opt-out” from being classified as “promoters”.  The 
Committee  is  also  of  the  view  that  any  reclassification  would  have  to  be  done  in  a  fair  and 
transparent manner, keeping in mind the interests of public shareholders.  

The Committee accordingly recommends the following:  
  Where  there  are  multiple  promoters/promoter  groups  and  a  specific  promoter/promoter 

group wishes to undergo re-classification 

In case the following conditions are met: 

(i)  promoters,  promoter  group  and  PACs  cumulatively  hold  10%  or  more  of  the  aggregate

3.  Disclosure of Related Party Transactions  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  the  Companies  Act  contains  provisions  on  disclosure  of  related  party  transactions 
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “RPTs”)  in  the  board’s  report,  approval  of  the  shareholders  in  certain 
cases, etc. Similar approval and disclosure requirements are also required in SEBI LODR Regulations. 
(Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

In order to strengthen transparency on related party transactions, the following is recommended: 

(a)  Half yearly disclosure of RPTs on a consolidated basis, in the disclosure format required for RPT 
in  the  annual  accounts  as  per  the  accounting  standards,  on  the  website  of  the  listed  entity 
within  30  days  of  publication  of  the  half yearly  financial  results.  Copy  of the  same  to  also  be 
submitted to the stock exchanges.  

(b)  Strict penalties may be imposed by SEBI for failing to make requisite disclosures of RPTs. 

In addition, the Committee observed that that certain promoters/promoter group entities were not 
getting categorised as related parties under SEBI LODR Regulations on account of not strictly falling 
under  the  definition  of  “related  parties”  under  the  relevant  accounting  standards  and  thereby 
transactions  with  such  persons  were  not  getting  categorised  as  RPTs  under  the  SEBI  LODR 
Regulations. The Committee recommends that all promoters/promoter group entities that hold 20% 
or above in a listed company to be considered “related parties” for the purposes of the SEBI LODR 
Regulations.  In  addition,  the  Committee  recommends  that  disclosures  of  transactions  with 
promoters/promoter group entities holding 10% or more shareholding be made annually and on a 
half yearly basis (even if not classified as related parties).  

The  Committee  noted  that  penalties  included  in  SEBI  Circular  No.  CIR/CFD/CMD/12/2015  dated 
November  30,  2015  for  breach  of  Regulation  33,  will  be  applicable  to  the  recommended 
amendments.

Provided  further  that  this  definition  shall  not  be

4.  Approval of Related Party Transactions 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  provides  that  a  shareholder  cannot  vote  to  approve  a  contract  or  transaction 
which may be entered into by a company if such a shareholder is a related party to that transaction. 
However,  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  have  a  blanket  restriction  on  related  parties  voting  on  any 
resolution pertaining to a material related party transaction. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

 

 
 

 
58 

 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

The  Committee  deliberated  upon  the  gap  in  the  legal  framework  wherein  the  Companies  Act 
allowed related parties to vote on (albeit not in favour of) a related party transaction while the SEBI 
LODR  Regulations  require  such  parties  to  abstain  from  voting.  The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that 
similar to the Companies Act, the SEBI LODR Regulations may be amended to allow related parties to 
cast a negative vote, as such voting cannot be considered to be in conflict of interest.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (with immediate effect):  

Current provision in SEBI LODR Regulations

(4)  All  material  related  party  transactions  shall

related party to the particular transaction or not. 
 
(7)  For  the  purpose  of  this  regulation,  all  entities 
falling  under  the  definition  of  related  parties  shall 
abstain  from  voting  irrespective  of  whether  the 
entity is a party to the particular transaction or not.

party to the particular transaction or not. 

5.  Royalty and Brand Payments to Related Parties  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  there  are  no  specific  provisions  in  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  pertaining  to  payments 
made pertaining to brand and royalty to related parties.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

A  number  of  companies  make  payment  towards  royalty/brand  usage.  While  royalty  payments  are 
recognized as there is value in brand strength and product technology, which drive sales or margins,  
shareholders  must  comprehend  the  terms  and  conditions  of  such  payouts.  Therefore,  the 
Committee  encourages  all  companies  to  make  better  disclosures  on  the  value  a  company  derives 
from a brand or technology  for which it has agreed to pay  royalty, brand, or technical fees to the 
parent  company/promoters.  Where  royalty  payout  levels  are  high  and  exceed  5%  of  consolidated 
revenues, the Committee believes the terms of conditions of such royalty must require shareholder 
approval. 

The Committee therefore recommends that payments made by listed entities with respect to brands 
usage/royalty amounting to more than 5% of consolidated turnover of the listed entity may require 
prior approval from the shareholders on a “majority of minority” basis. This sub-limit of 5% will be 
considered within the overall 10% limit to determine material related party transactions.

6.  Remuneration to Executive Promoter Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

While  the  Companies  Act  prescribes  a  ceiling  on  the  compensation  that  can  be  paid  to  directors, 
there are no specific provisions in the SEBI LODR Regulations on maximum remuneration payable to 
executive promoter directors. (Click for Detailed Provisions)  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  noted  various  cases  of  disproportionate  payments  made  to  executive  promoter 
directors as compared to other executive  directors. It  is felt that this issue should be  subjected to 
greater  shareholder  scrutiny.  The  Committee  recommends  that  shareholder  approval  by  special 
resolution should be required if the total remuneration paid: 

a) 

to a single executive promoter-director exceeds Rs. 5 crore or 2.5% of the net profit, whichever 
is higher; or 

b) 

to all executive promoter-directors exceeds 5% of the net profits. 

It  is  clarified  that  net  profits  should  be  calculated  under  Section  198  of  the  Companies  Act.  The 
Committee  also  recommends  that  SEBI  could  review  the  status  in  future  based  on  experience 
gained.

the  shareholders  by  special  resolution  in  general 
meeting, if:  
(i)  the  annual  remuneration  payable  to  such 
executive director exceeds rupees 5 crore or 2.5 per 
cent of the net profits of the listed entity, whichever 
is higher; or  
(ii)  where  there is more than one such director, the 
aggregate  annual  remuneration  to  such  directors 
exceeds  5  per  cent  of  the  net  profits  of  the  listed 
entity: 
 
Provided  that,  the  approval  of  the  shareholders 
under  this  provision  shall  be  valid  only  till  expiry  of 
term of such director. 
 
Explanation:  For  the  purposes  of  this  clause,  net 
profits  shall  be  calculated  as  per  section  198  of  the 
Companies Act, 2013. 

7.  Remuneration of Non-executive Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

In case of non-executive directors, the Companies Act requires the approval of shareholders for any 
remuneration payable to such directors exceeding 1% of the net profits in case there is a managing 
director or whole time director or manager and 3% in other cases. As per SEBI LODR Regulations, the 
board is required to recommend all fees and compensation  to be  paid to non-executive  directors. 
(Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  deliberated  upon  managerial  remuneration  based  on  the  data  available  and 
observed  that  certain  non-executive  directors  (generally  promoter  directors)  were  receiving 
disproportionate  remuneration  from  the  total  pool  available  vis-à-vis  all  other  non-executive 
directors.  

Based  on  its  deliberations,  the  Committee  recommends  that  in  case  the  remuneration  of  a  single 
non-executive director exceeds 50% of the pool being distributed to the non-executive directors as a 
whole, shareholder  approval  should  be  required. However, it  is  clarified that  the  promoter  should 
also be allowed to vote.

8.  Materiality Policy 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  require  listed  entities  to  formulate  a  policy  on  materiality  of 
related  party  transactions  and  on  dealing  with  related  party  transactions.  (Click  for  Detailed 
Provisions)  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  considered  that  while  some  companies  have  formulated  their  materiality  policy, 
they have not spelt out any threshold limits for determining materiality and therefore, enforcement 
in such cases  becomes  difficult. It was therefore  decided that clear threshold limits, as  considered 
appropriate by the board of directors may be required to be disclosed in the materiality policy. The 
Committee also recommends that such materiality policy should be reviewed and updated at least 
once every three years.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER VI: DISCLOSURES AND TRANSPARENCY 
 
Disclosure and transparency underpin good governance and the efficient functioning of the markets. 
A corporate governance framework should ensure that timely and accurate disclosure is made on all 
material matters regarding the corporation, including the financial situation, business performance, 
strategic shifts, ownership, and governance of the company.  

Regulations in India, have driven a large part of the disclosure and transparency construct, especially 
for  listed  entities.  While  companies,  in  general,  comply  with  the  regulatory  minimum,  the 
Committee encourages boards and managements to view disclosure and transparency as a means to 
build  trust  with  stakeholders  and  to  proactively  disclose  material  information  that  may  impact 
decision-making variables.  

Accordingly, the Committee makes the following recommendations: 

1.  Submission of Annual Reports 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, under the Companies Act read with Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, for listed entities, 
the financial statements may be sent inter-alia by electronic mode to such members (holding demat 
securities) whose email ids are registered with the depository for communication purposes, and by 
dispatch of physical copies in all other cases.  

However, under SEBI LODR Regulations, soft copies of the full annual report are required to be sent 
to all those shareholder(s) who have registered their email address(es) for the purpose, hard copies 
of  statement  containing  the  salient  features  of  all  the  documents,  as  prescribed  in  Section  136 of 
Companies  Act  or  rules  made  thereunder  to  those  shareholder(s) who  have  not  so  registered and 
hard copies of full annual reports to those shareholders, who request for the same. Further, under 
SEBI LODR Regulations, the annual report is required to be submitted to the stock exchange within 
21 working days of it being approved and adopted in the AGM. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

In  the  interest  of  environmental  responsibility  and  in  view  of  increased  digital  access,  it  is 
recommended  that only  a  soft  copy of  the  annual  report  should  be  given  to all  shareholders  who 
have  registered  their  email  addresses  either  with  the  company  or  with  the  depository,  unless  the 
shareholder  specifically  asks  for  a  physical  copy.  Only  in  case  the  shareholder  has  not  provided 
his/her e-mail address, should he/she be sent a hard copy.  

The  Committee  also  felt  that  there  is  a  need  to  consider  making  mobile  numbers  and  email 
addresses compulsory for demat accounts. The Committee is also of the view that SEBI may consider 
taking up with the depositories the linking of all demat accounts with Aadhar, wherein depositories 
may  be  permitted  to  pick  up  information  like  bank  account  details, telephone  numbers  and  email 
addresses from the Aadhar database.  

Further, the Committee is of the opinion that requiring disclosure of annual report to the exchanges 
within 21 working days after the AGM results in delayed disclosures to the shareholders. Therefore, 
it  is  recommended  that  the  annual  report  may  be  disclosed  by  the  listed  entity  to  the  stock 
exchanges and on the website in the following manner: 

 

Copy  of  the  annual  report  sent  to  the  shareholders  along  with  the  notice  of  the  AGM  to  be 
disclosed not later than the day as dispatched to the shareholders.

In the event shareholders approve any amendments to any portion of the annual report, then 
the revised copy (with details of and explanation for the changes so approved) is to be sent no 
later than 48 hours after the AGM.

2.  Disclosures Pertaining to Holders of Depository Receipts 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision in the Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations on requiring 
disclosures of holders of Depository Receipts (ADRs/GDRs) issued by listed entities. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  believes  that  transparency  in  understanding  a  company’s  holding  structure  and 
voting rights requires disclosure of the holders of the depository receipts and not just the name of 
the overseas depository that has issued the depository receipts. The Committee recognizes that the 
member  of  the  listed  entity  for  the  purpose  of  depository  receipts  issuance  is  the  overseas 
depository.  However,  the  Committee  notes  that  the  information  of  holders  of  the  depository 
receipts is available with the overseas depository. Therefore, the Committee recommends that: 

Indian listed entity should obtain details of holders of any global depository receipts (as defined 
under the Companies Act, which includes American Depository Receipts) issued by such entity 
from the overseas depository at least on a monthly basis.  

Based  on  the  information  shared  by  the  overseas  depository,  the  listed  entity  shall  disclose 
details of such holders of global depository receipts who hold more than 1% shareholding of the 

 
64 

 

 

 
 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

entity to the stock exchange as a part of the disclosure on shareholding pattern on a quarterly 
basis.  

This would enable transparency in shareholding and consequently in voting by such shareholders.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):  

Current provision in SEBI LODR Regulations  

No specific provision.

(1B) The listed entities shall obtain the information on 
holders  of  global  depository  receipts  issued  by  the 
entity,  if  any,  from  the  overseas  depository  at  least 
once every month.  

3.  Disclosures Pertaining to Credit Rating 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  there  is  no  specific  provision  in  the  Companies  Act  with  respect  to  disclosure  of  credit 
ratings. SEBI LODR Regulations require the disclosure of revisions in credit ratings. (Click for Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Currently,  listed  entities  are  required  to  disclose  the  changes  in  credit  rating  for  different 
instruments from time to time to the stock exchanges as and when changes happen.  

The Committee is of the opinion that an updated list of all credit ratings obtained by the listed entity 
be made available at one place, which would be very helpful for investors and other stakeholders.  

It  is  therefore  recommended  that  the  listed  entity  may  be  required  to  disclose  all  credit  ratings 
obtained by the entity for all its outstanding instruments annually to stock exchanges and also on its 
website which shall be updated on a regular basis as and when there is any change. In addition, SEBI 
may consider requiring the credit rating agencies and the stock exchanges to set up a mechanism by 
which the ratings may be sent directly from the credit rating agencies to the stock exchanges.

proposal of the listed entity involving mobilization of 
funds, whether in India or abroad. 

4.  Searchable Formats of Disclosures  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision in Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations with respect to 
‘searchability’ of the disclosures.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

While  several  disclosures  (both  event  based  and  periodic)  have  been  mandated  under  applicable 
law,  certain  concerns  were  raised  on  the  manner  of  presentation  thereof  by  listed  entities. 
Specifically,  information  shared  is  often  not  in  “searchable”  formats  (i.e.  if  an  investor  wishes  to 
search for a particular word or a phrase in the voluminous disclosures, he/she is unable to do so due 
to the formats of the documents, especially scanned documents), substantially constraining the ease 
of review.  

Accordingly, it is recommended that all the disclosures made by the listed entity on its website and 
submitted to the stock exchanges should be in a searchable format that allows users to find relevant 
information easily.  Specifically, the  Committee  recommends that all disclosures made  to the  stock 
exchanges by listed entities should be in XBRL format. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):

5.  Harmonization of Disclosures  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision in the Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations with respect 
to harmonized/standardized dissemination of disclosures made by the listed entities across websites 
of stock exchanges.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  felt  that  in  the  absence  of  such  a  mandated,  harmonized  dissemination  of 
disclosures, there could be a risk of disclosure arbitrage. In addition, multiple disclosure formats in 
different  exchanges  as  well  as  to  the  MCA  place  an  unnecessary  compliance  burden  on  the  listed 
entities without any consequent benefit.  

Therefore, it is recommended that: 

 

 

 

 

The  stock  exchanges  shall  collectively  harmonise  the  formats  of  the  disclosures  made  by  the 
listed entities on their respective websites no later than April 1, 2018. 

The stock exchanges shall move to disclosures by listed entities on exchange platforms in XBRL 
format in latest available taxonomy no later than April 1, 2018.  

Further, a common filing platform may be devised on which a listed entity may submit all filings, 
which  could  then  be  disseminated  to  all  exchanges  simultaneously.  The  exchanges  shall 
introduce such a platform in consultation with SEBI by April 1, 2018.  

The disclosures filed with the exchanges may, as far as possible, be harmonized with the filings 
made to MCA.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendments may be required to SEBI LODR Regulations. However, SEBI may consider issuance of 
a circular to the stock exchanges in this regard.  

6.  Disclosures Pertaining to Analyst/Institutional Investor Meets 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  require  the  disclosure  of  schedules  for  analyst  or  institutional 
investor meetings and presentations made by the listed entity to analysts or institutional investors 
on its website and to the stock exchange. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  was  of  the  view  that  the  disclosure  of  schedules  of  analyst/institutional  investor 
meetings does not serve any practical purpose, and there have been instances of its misuse. Hence, 
the  Committee  recommended  that  the  disclosure  of  schedules  of  analyst/institutional  investor 
meetings may not be required. To clarify, the information to be shared at such meetings has to be 
strictly in compliance with the SEBI PIT Regulations.

Appropriate modifications may also be made to SEBI circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD/4/2015 dated Sep 9,

7.  Disclosures of Key Changes in Financial Indicators 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision in the Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations requiring an 
entity with listed equity shares to report key changes in certain indicators and explanations for the 
same, other than general disclosures in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of 
the annual report. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

While the periodic disclosure of financial information and disclosure of material events/information 
is mandated for listed entities, the Committee considered that in addition to the same, disclosures of 
significant changes in key financial indicators along with reasons thereof would enable the investors 
to further comprehend the company’s business and financial performance. 

Accordingly, it is recommended that all listed entities may be required to disclose in the section on 
MD&A  in  the  Annual  report,  certain  key  financial  ratios  (or  sector-specific  equivalent  ratios),  as 
applicable,  wherever  there  is  a  change  of  25%  or  more  in  a  particular  financial  year,  along  with 
detailed explanations thereof, including:  

1.  Debtors Turnover 

2. 

Inventory Turnover

In addition, the Committee recommends that the listed entity shall disclose any change in Return on 
Net Worth along with a detailed explanation thereof irrespective of the percentage of change in the 
financial year under the same section.

or  more  as  compared  to  the  immediately  previous

or sector-specific equivalent ratios, as applicable. 
 
(j) Details of any change in Return on Net Worth  as 
compared  to  the  immediately  previous  financial 
year along with a detailed explanation thereof.  

8.  Utilisation  of  Proceeds  of  Preferential  Issue  and  Qualified  Institutional 

Placement 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009  (hereinafter 
referred to as “SEBI ICDR Regulations”) require periodic disclosures on utilization of issue proceeds in 
case  of  public  issues.  However,  these  disclosures  are  not  required  for  funds  raised  by  way  of 
preferential allotments and QIPs. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  felt  that  for  better  transparency,  appropriate  disclosures  may  be  required  on 
utilisation of proceeds of preferential issues and QIPs till the time such proceeds are utilised.

9.  Disclosures in Valuation Reports in Schemes of Arrangement  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision in the Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations pertaining to 
disclosures of the basis of the valuation arrived at in valuation reports or requirement of disclosure 
of  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  relevant  entities  which  are  part  of,  or  subject  to,  the  schemes  of 
arrangement.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  noted  that  it  has  been  observed  that  there  are  divergent  market  practices  of 
disclosures made in valuation reports and the schemes of arrangement involving listed entities. This 
may lead shareholders not having sufficient information to make an informed decision.  

Therefore, in the interest of full disclosures to the investors, it is recommended that: 

 

 

SEBI may consider issuing guidelines for overall improvement in standards of information in the 
valuation reports that are included as part of schemes of arrangement disclosures.  

Specific  disclosures  on  assets,  liabilities  and  turnover  of  the  entities  involved  should  be 
disclosed in the valuation reports on schemes of arrangement. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations: 

No amendments may be required to SEBI LODR Regulations. However, SEBI may consider amending 
its circular dated March 10, 2017 on Schemes of Arrangement by listed entities in this regard.  

10. Disclosures Pertaining to Directors  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  provide  that  at  the  time  of  the  appointment  of  a  director,  the 
names  of  listed  entities  in  which the  proposed  director  holds  directorship  and  membership of  the 
committees are to be disclosed to the shareholders. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  felt  that  for  better  transparency,  it  is  recommended  that  disclosures  on  details of 
directorships  of  a  director  as  included  in  the  Corporate  Governance  section  of  the  Annual  Report 
may additionally include details of directorships (e.g. Independent/executive) in other listed entities.

11. Disclosures Pertaining to Disqualification of Directors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  there  is  no  provision  under  the  Companies  Act  or  the  SEBI  LODR  that  requires  a 
confirmation  on  a  regular  basis  of  the  directors of  the  company  not  having  been  barred  to  act  as 
such by any regulatory authorities. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  felt  that  investors  are  often  unaware  whether  the  directors  of  the  company  have 
been debarred from acting as directors of a company.  Therefore, the Committee recommended that 
disclosures on this basis be made in the annual report as certified by a practising company secretary.

12. Disclosures on Website 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, as per Regulation 46 of the SEBI LODR Regulations, a listed entity is required to maintain a 
functional website containing the basic information about itself. (Click for Detailed provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee recommended that companies shall maintain a separate section for investors on its 
website and provide all the information mandated under Regulation 46 of SEBI LODR Regulations in 
a separate section, to ensure ease of availability and access of pertinent information in one place to 
investors and regulators alike.

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  proviso  to  Section  136(1)  of  the  Companies  Act  requires  every  company  having  a 
subsidiary to place  separate  audited accounts  in respect of each of its subsidiary on its website, if 
any.  Further,  as  per  Regulation  46  of  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations,  a  listed  entity  is  required  to 
maintain  a  functional  website  containing  the  certain  specified  information.  (Click  for  Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

In  the  spirit  of  transparency  and  ease  of  reference  for  public  shareholders  of  listed  entities,  the 
Committee recommends that a listed entity be required to have audited financial statements for the 
relevant financial year of each of its subsidiaries available on its website at least 21 days before the

year. 

14. Disclosures on Long-term and Medium-term Strategy  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision on disclosure of medium-term and long-term strategy under 
the Companies Act, 2013 or SEBI LODR Regulations.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  recommends  that  in  order  to  provide  for  disclosures  pertaining  to  strategy of  the 
entity,  especially  the  medium-term  and 
line  with  the  Committee’s 
recommendation  that  boards  devote  more time  on strategy),  a guidance may be  issued  by SEBI to 
listed  entities  to  disclose  their  medium  and  long-term  strategy  in  their  annual  reports  under  the 

long-term  strategy  (in 

 
 

 
72 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

MD&A section. In addition, entities should articulate a clear set of long-term metrics specific to the 
company's  long  term  strategy  to  allow  for  appropriate  measurement  of  progress.  However,  each 
entity  may  define  its  own  time  frame  with  respect  to  medium  and  long-term  since  it  would  vary 
across entities/sectors. Some examples of strategy and metrics in this regard that may be considered 
are included in Annexure 5.  

Further, SEBI may review the status in future based on experience gained.

directors.  

15. Prior Intimation of Board Meeting to Discuss Bonus Issue 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, SEBI LODR Regulations require prior intimation to the stock exchange about the meeting 
of  the  board  of  directors  in  which  a  proposal  for  the  declaration  of  certain  items  including  bonus 
shares is going to be discussed. However, where the declaration of bonus by the listed entity is not 
on the agenda of the meeting of board of directors, prior intimation is not required to be given to

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  felt  that  in  view  of  the  price  sensitive  nature  of  bonus  issues,  advance  notice  for 
consideration of bonus issue by the board should be required to be submitted to stock exchanges. 
Accordingly, it is recommended that the proviso to Regulation 29 in the SEBI LODR Regulations may 
be dropped.

16. Views of Committees Not Accepted by the Board of Directors  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Several provisions of the Companies Act and the SEBI LODR Regulations require the committees of 
the  board  (including  the  audit  committee  and  the  nomination  and  remuneration  committee)  to 
consider  and  recommend  certain  matters  to  the  board  of  directors.  However,  except  for  Section 
177(8) of the Companies Act (in relation to the Audit Committee), there is no provision for disclosure 
to shareholders if the recommendations of the relevant committee are not accepted by the board. 
(Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  committees  constituted  by  the  board  usually  provide  their  recommendations  to  the  board  of 
directors  in  relation  to  relevant  matters  falling  within  their  terms  of  reference,  after  due 
consideration.  The  final  decision,  except  in  certain  instances,  (on  whether  to  accept  the 
recommendation or not) lies with the board of directors. However, the Committee is of a view that if 
the board of directors chooses not to accept the recommendations of the statutory committees of 
the board, the same should be disclosed to shareholders on an annual basis.  

It  is  clarified  that  the  above  disclosure  requirement  pertains  to  matters  which  require  a 
recommendation of the committee for the approval of the board (or submission by the committee 
for  approval  of  the  board),  and  will  not  affect  matters  that  require  prior  approval  of  the  relevant 
committee (for e.g., approval of related party transactions by the audit committee).

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

 

 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee noted the lack of uniformity in disclosures with respect to the commodity risks and 
hedging  activities by  listed  companies.  In  order  to  benefit  the  shareholders and  to  bring  further 
clarity in disclosures to be made in the annual reports by the listed companies, the Committee is of 
the view that the listed companies should disclose their risk management activities during the year, 
including their commodity hedging positions in a more transparent, detailed and uniform manner for 
easy understanding and appreciation by the shareholders.  

The Committee  believes  that  for the consistent  implementation of  the  requirements of SEBI LODR 
Regulations  regarding  disclosure  of  commodity  risks  and  other  hedging  activities  across  listed 
companies, a detailed reporting format along with the periodicity of the disclosures may be outlined 
by  SEBI  which  would  depict  the commodity  risks  they  face,  how  these  are  managed  and  also  the 
policy for hedging commodity risk, etc. followed by the  company for the  purpose  of disclosures  in 
the annual report. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendment to the SEBI LODR Regulations required. SEBI should consider issuing a circular in this 
regard.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER VII: ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT RELATED ISSUES 
 
Financial  statements  are  the  primary  document  that  stakeholders  (including  investors,  lenders, 
customers, and suppliers) rely upon. These statements are intended and expected to depict the true 
nature  of  the  business,  and  foretell  its  longevity.  The  Committee  acknowledges  that  a  good  audit 
and appropriate levels of disclosure are pre-requisites for reliable financial statements. After careful 
consideration,  the  Committee  makes  the  following  recommendations  with  a  view  to  improving 
disclosures and enhancing the quality of financial statements and audit. 

1.  Audit Qualifications 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, under the Companies Act, or SEBI LODR Regulations, there is no restriction on an auditor 
qualifying the accounts of a company. However, both the Companies Act and SEBI LODR Regulations 
and  circulars  issued  thereunder  require  detailed  disclosures  in  this  regard.  Specifically,  the  SEBI 
LODR Regulations require quantification of the audit qualification by the auditor and if not possible, 
the management shall make an estimate which is to be reviewed by the auditor. (Click for Detailed 
Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  noted  that  several  jurisdictions  across  the  world  proscribe  a  listed  company  from 
filing  a  set  of  financial  results/statements  on  which  the  auditor  has  issued  a  qualified  opinion.  In 
these  jurisdictions,  financial  statements  with  audit  reports  that  express  a  qualified  or  “except  for” 
opinion due to a departure from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or state that the 
auditor  is  disclaiming  an  opinion  on  the  financial  statements  for  any  reason,  or  state  that  the 
financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole  are  not  presented  fairly  in  conformity  with  GAAP,  are  not 
considered  sufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  listing  regulations.  These  jurisdictions 
consider that  financial statements  not  in  conformity with  GAAP  are  presumed to  be  inaccurate  or 
misleading, notwithstanding explanatory disclosures in footnotes or in the auditor’s report. Detailed 
deliberations were held as to whether it is the right time to consider moving in the direction of not 
permitting filing of financial results with audit qualifications in India as well. 

After due deliberation, the Committee concurred that it may be early to entirely proscribe the filing 
of financial results with audit qualifications in India. Therefore, the Committee recommends that a 
move may be made to strengthen disclosures by requiring quantification of audit qualifications to be 
mandatory, with the  exception being  only  for matters  like  going concern or sub-judice matters.  In 
such an instance, the management  will be  required to provide reasons, which will be  reviewed by 
the auditors and reported accordingly.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):  

Current provision in SEBI LODR Regulations

2.  Independent External Opinion by Auditors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, there is no specific provision in the Companies Act or the SEBI LODR Regulations enabling 
an auditor to obtain an independent external opinion in relation to the audit/limited review at the 
cost of the listed entity.  

 
 

 
77 

 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

It is felt that in cases where the auditor does not concur with the opinion of an expert (e.g. lawyers, 
valuers,  actuaries  etc.)  appointed  by  the  listed  entity,  the  auditors  should  have  a  right  to  obtain 
independent external opinions as deemed fit, at the cost of the listed entity. This would boost the 
independence of the auditors. 

Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  should  be  amended,  providing  a  clear 
right to an auditor to independently obtain external opinions from experts.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):

services  have  been  availed  by  the  management,  the 
auditors shall have the right  to independently obtain 
external  opinions  from  experts  appointed  by  the 
auditors themselves and any expenditure incurred for 
such purpose shall be borne by the listed entity.  

3.  Group Audits 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  there  is  no  specific  provision  with  respect  to  group  audits  under  the  Companies  Act  or 
SEBI LODR Regulations.  

However,  provisions  for  group  audits  are  covered  under  the  Standards  on  Auditing  issued  by  ICAI 
which permit the holding company auditor to place reliance on the audit performed by the auditor 
of the subsidiaries and provide an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on 
the audit report provided by the other auditors.  

The  principal  auditor  may,  depending  upon  circumstances,  decide  that  supplemental  tests  of  the 
records  or  the  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiary  companies  are  necessary.  When  considered 
necessary,  the  principal  auditor  may  require the  other  auditor  to  answer  a  detailed  questionnaire 
regarding matters on which the principal auditor requires information for discharging his duties.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  noted  that  several  international  jurisdictions  that  have  adopted  the  International 
Standards  on  Auditing  (ISA)  are  governed  by  the  requirements  of  ISA  600  which  do  not  permit  a 
division of responsibility between auditors of the holding company and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in 
such  cases,  the  auditor  of  the  holding  company  is  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and 
performance of the group audit engagement.   

The  Committee  noted  that  auditing  standards  in  India  (SA  600)  differ  from  the  International 
Standards  on  Auditing  by  allowing  the  holding  company  auditor  to  place  reliance  on  the  audit 
performed  by  the  auditor  of  the  subsidiaries  and  provide  an  audit  opinion  on  the  consolidated 
financial  statements  based  on  the  audit  report  provided  by  the  other  auditor.  While  certain 
provisions  as  specified  above  permit  auditors  of  the  holding  company  to  decide  supplemental 
tests/require the other auditor to answer a detailed questionnaire, such an auditor is not completely 

 
 

 
78 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  group  audit  engagement  as  in 
other  jurisdictions.  It  was  also  noted  that  this  was  the  only  provision  in  which  Indian  auditing 
standards differed from their international counterpart.  

It was therefore deliberated as to whether there is a need to introduce such a requirement in India 
in line with international standards, which will require the auditor of the holding company to take 
full responsibility for the audit opinion in the consolidated financial statements in respect of Indian 
subsidiaries and not permit a division of responsibility between the auditor of the holding company 
and the other auditor in the consolidated auditors’ report. 

Various concerns which may arise upon the introduction of such a requirement were noted by the 
Committee. For instance, if such a requirement is introduced, inevitably, the same auditor would be 
engaged for all subsidiaries as well in most of the cases and therefore, may lead to concentration.  In 
addition, there may not be alignment in the rotation periods of auditors of the holding company and 
its  subsidiaries  due  to  the  respective  periods  of  appointment  or  regulatory  requirements  (e.g.  RBI 
requires auditors to be rotated every  four years with a cooling off period of six years whereas the 
Companies  Act  requires  rotation  every  five  years).  However,  the  Committee  believes  that  a  move 
needs to be made to align Indian auditing standards with global best practices. 

Therefore,  as  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  but  keeping  in  mind  the  concerns  that  may  arise,  it  is 
recommended that for listed entities in India, the auditor of the holding company should be made 
responsible for the audit opinion of all material unlisted subsidiaries.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No  amendment  may  be  required  to  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations.  However,  SEBI  may  consider 
recommending to the ICAI to introduce amendments to the relevant accounting/auditing standards 
to implement the above. 

4.  Quarterly Financial Disclosures 

Current regulatory provisions: 

While  the  Companies  Act  does  not  require  a  company  to  submit  quarterly  financial  results,  SEBI 
LODR  Regulations  have  detailed  provisions  for  the  submission  of  quarterly  financial  results  by  a 
listed entity to the stock exchanges. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

In order to strengthen periodic financial disclosures, the following recommendations are made: 

(i)  Consolidated  financial  results:  Currently,  the  Companies  Act  and  SEBI  LODR  Regulations 
mandate the submission of consolidated financial statements by a listed entity every financial 
year. However, SEBI LODR Regulations do not mandate that a listed entity submit consolidated 
financial results on a quarterly basis. In the interest of greater transparency at the group level, it 
is  recommended  that  that  disclosure  of  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  made 
mandatory for all listed entities on a quarterly basis. It is also clarified that standalone results 
shall continue to be required to be published. The Committee also believes that in due course, 
SEBI  may,  based  on  experience  gained,  consider  requiring  only  consolidated  accounts  to  be 
published. 

(ii)  Cash flow statement: It is recommended that publishing a cash flow statement on a half-yearly 

basis should be made mandatory for all listed entities for the following reasons:  

 
 

 
79 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

1. 

It  will  provide  timely  information  necessary  to  evaluate  the  operational,  financial  or 
investment  decisions  of  the  company.  Such  information  may  not  be  available  in  the 
quarterly financial results.  

2.  Cash  flow  statements  can  give  investors  meaningful  information  regarding  business 
development  directions  and  information  on  the  seasonality  of  some  activities,  collection 
efficiency, quality of revenue or asset liquidation efforts, etc. which may not be available in 
the quarterly financial results.  

3.  Overall, half-yearly cash flow statements will enhance levels of transparency by providing 
quality  and  prompt  financial  and  accounting  information  as  well  as  contribute  to  the 
efficient management of the company and assessment of value driver potential.  

(iii)  Audit/limited  review  of  quarterly  financial  results:    The  Committee  believes  that  the 
audit/limited review of the listed entity does not often take into account a substantial portion 
of the group business  since  the  accounts  of the  underlying subsidiaries  often do not  undergo 
limited review/audit. It is therefore recommended that for all listed entities, for every quarter, 
financial  information  of  the  group,  accounting  for  at  least  80%  of  each  of  the  consolidated 
revenue, assets and profits, respectively, should have undergone limited review/audit. 

(iv)  Last quarter financial results: Currently, SEBI LODR Regulations state that the listed entity shall 
submit the audited financial results in respect of the last quarter along with the results for the 
entire financial year, with a note  stating that the figures of  the  last  quarter are  the balancing 
figures between audited figures in respect of the full financial year and the published year-to-
date figures up to the third quarter of the current financial year. The Committee believes that 
any material adjustments made in the results of the last quarter which pertain to earlier periods 
should be disclosed by the listed entity as a note in the financial results.

note,  the  aggregate  effect  of  material

5.  Internal Financial Controls 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act requires the auditor to report on Internal Financial Controls 
(hereinafter referred to as “IFCs”) and Section 129(4) of the Companies Act states that the provisions 
of the Companies Act applicable to the preparation, adoption and audit of the financial statements 
of  a  holding  company  shall,  mutatis  mutandis,  apply  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements. 
However,  ICAI,  vide  its  guidance,  has  restricted  the  reporting  requirements  for  an  auditor  of  the 
consolidated  financial  statements,  to  the  IFC  at  the  Indian  subsidiaries  only.  The  Companies 
(Amendment)  Bill,  2017  proposes  to  substitute  the  words  “internal  financial  control  system”  with 
the words “internal financial controls with reference to financial statements”. Further, while the SEBI 
LODR Regulations have general provisions on IFC, there is no specific provision on the coverage of 
the same. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

As  per  the  Companies  Act,  India  has  adopted  IFC  reporting  requirements  for  certain  companies. 
Therefore,  while  reporting  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  auditors  of  companies  in 

 
 

 
82 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

India are required to report on the IFCs for Indian companies only and their foreign subsidiaries are 
exempt unlike in other markets, where the requirement applies to the entire group.  

The  Committee  recommends  that  IFC  reporting  requirements  be  made  applicable  to  the  entire 
operations of the group and not just to the Indian operations. However, the Committee recognizes 
that  companies  may  require  adequate  transition  time  and  in  this  regard,  recommends  that  IFC 
reporting  requirements  for  entire  operations  initially  be  only  applicable  to  listed  entities  with 
networth of Rs. 1000 crore and above. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations: 

No amendments required to SEBI LODR Regulations. The Committee suggests that SEBI take up the 
above recommendation with ICAI.  

6.  Disclosure of Reasons of Resignation of Auditors 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  read  with  Companies  (Audit  and  Auditors)  Rules,  2014  requires  that  upon  the 
resignation  of  auditors,  reasons  for  such  resignation  shall  be  filed  with  the  company  and  the 
Registrar. While under SEBI LODR Regulations, a change in auditor is a deemed material event and 
disclosure is required to be made to the exchanges, there  is no  specific provision  for disclosure of 
detailed reasons for such change. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Auditors are critical gatekeepers of corporate governance standards. Their role in ensuring that the 
financial statements of the entity provide a true and fair view of the affairs of the entity makes them 
critical to the corporate governance agenda. The resignation of an auditor before the expiry of the 
term may be a cause for concern. For the sake of greater transparency, the Committee believes that 
it is important for companies to disclose the reasons for the resignation of its audit firm. Moreover, 
audit firms too must be encouraged to truthfully disclose the reasons for their resignation as audit 
firms must see this disclosure as part of their fiduciary responsibility towards the shareholders.  

Proposed modifications to SEBI circular (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):  
Clause 7 of Annexure I of SEBI circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD/4/2015 dated September 9, 2015 may be amended 
by insertion of a new clause as under: 
7.5. Detailed reasons for resignation of auditor as given by the said auditor.  

7.  Disclosures on Audit and Non-audit Services Rendered by the Auditor 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  Companies  Act  permits  auditors  to  perform only  those  non-audit  services  as  approved  by  the 
board/audit committee and specifically prohibits certain services that can be provided. Under SEBI 
LODR  Regulations,  the  audit  committee  approves  payment  to  statutory  auditors  for  any  other 
services  rendered  by  the  statutory  auditors.  However,  there  is  no  requirement  in  either  the 
Companies  Act  or  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  on  disclosure  of  non-audit  services  rendered  by  the 
auditor to the entire network/group. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

In  the  interest  of  improving  transparency,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  total  fee  paid  to 
auditor and all entities on the network firms/network entity of which the auditor is a part shall be 

 
 

 
83 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

disclosed by the listed entity in its annual report on a consolidated basis (i.e. paid by the listed entity 
and its subsidiaries).   

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):

and  its  subsidiaries  (i.e.  on  a  consolidated  basis)  to 
the  statutory  auditor  and  all  entities  in  the  network 
firm/network entity of which the auditor is a part.  

8.  Audit Quality Indicators 

Current regulatory provisions: 

There is no specific provision in the Companies Act or SEBI LODR Regulations with respect to audit 
quality indicators. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  quality  of  audit/auditors  can  be  judged  through  various  indicators  such  as  workforce  metrics, 
skill-development and training of audit team, quality metrics such as audit restatements, trends in 
audit  metrics  such  as  billable  hours  and  audit  fines,  legal  actions  and  fines  against  the  firm, 
independence metrics such as client and group concentration, use of technology, etc. 

The Committee noted that many of the aforesaid indicators are already a part of ICAI’s peer review 
system.  

The Committee believes that making such indicators public will enable transparency and comparison 
of the audit quality of different auditors.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

There  is  no  specific  amendment  required  to  SEBI  LODR  Regulations.  The  Committee  suggests  that 
SEBI take up the above recommendation with ICAI. 

9.  Disclosures of Credentials and Audit Fee of Auditors  

Current regulatory provisions: 

Section 142 of the Companies Act provides for the remuneration of auditors. Section 102(1) of the 
Companies Act requires certain disclosures to be made in the notice convening the meeting for each 
item of “special business” to be transacted at the general meeting. The appointment of auditors at 
an annual general meeting is not considered to be a “special business” and hence does not require 
any statement to shareholders with requisite disclosures.  

 
 

 
84 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

While the SEBI LODR Regulations do not prescribe any specific disclosures in relation to appointment 
of  auditors,  Regulation  4(1)(b)  of  the  SEBI  LODR  Regulations  imposes  an  obligation  on  the  listed 
entity to ensure that the audit is conducted by an independent, competent and qualified auditor.   

(Click for Detailed Provisions)  

Recommendation and rationale: 

In order to ensure that the shareholders are able to take informed decisions on the appointment of 
auditors of listed entities, the Committee is of the view that the notice being sent to shareholders 
should contain certain minimum disclosures in relation to the credentials and terms of appointment 
of the auditors who are proposed to be appointed/re-appointed.  

Further, the Committee is of the view that the audit fee that is charged by some of the firms is not 
on  parity  with  benchmarks  such  as  percentage  of  total  assets,  etc.  Therefore,  the  Committee 
recommends  that in order to improve  transparency, the proposed  audit fees must  be  disclosed in 
the notice and if there is any material change in the fees paid to a new auditor as compared to the 
current audit fee, the rationale for the same must be provided.  

Hence,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  explanatory  statement  in  relation  to  the  item  on 
appointment/re-appointment of auditor(s) in the relevant notice calling an annual general meeting, 
should  include  the  following  disclosures  (in  addition  to  any  other  disclosures  that  the  board  of 
directors may deem fit):  

(a)  Basis of recommendation for appointment including the details in relation to and credentials of 

the auditor(s) proposed to be appointed; and 

(b)  Proposed fees payable to the auditor(s) along with terms of appointment and in case of a new 
auditor, any material change in the fee payable to such auditor from that paid to the outgoing 
auditor and the rationale for such change. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2018):

10. IND-AS Adoption 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The  MCA  and  SEBI  have  specified  timelines  for  listed  entities  (including  listed  banks,  NBFCs  and 
insurance companies) to adopt IND-AS. While listed entities (other than banks, NBFCs and insurance 
companies)  are  currently  required  to  comply  with  the  provisions of  IND-AS  in preparation  of  their 
financial statements and audit,:  

(i)  Banks  are  required  to  prepare  IND-AS  based  financial  statements  for  accounting  periods 

beginning from April 1, 2018;  

(ii)  Certain  NBFCs  (depending on  net  worth  and whether  listed/unlisted)  are  required  to  prepare 
IND-AS based financial statements for accounting periods beginning from April 1, 2018 or April 
1, 2019, as the case may be; and  

(iii)  Insurance companies are required to prepare IND-AS based financial statements for accounting 

periods beginning from April 1, 2020. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  listed  banks,  NBFCs  and  insurance  companies  are  important 
financial intermediaries, critical to the sanctity of India’s financial markets and its growth. Given the 
principle-based  rules  of  IND-AS  and  resultant  disclosures  in  financial  statements,  the  Committee 
recommends  full  implementation  of  IND-AS as currently scheduled without extension, for all listed 
entities including banks, NBFCs and insurance companies. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendments are required to the SEBI LODR Regulations. . The Committee suggests that SEBI take 
up the above recommendation with the relevant authorities/ regulators, as necessary. 

11. Strengthening Monitoring, Oversight and Enforcement by SEBI 

A. Review of Audit Qualifications 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Earlier, SEBI LODR  Regulations had detailed provisions on  the  review of audit qualifications  by the 
Qualified Audit report Review Committee (QARC) and further reference of the same to the Financial 
Reporting Review Board (FRRB) of ICAI. However, after consultation with SEBI Advisory Committees, 
ICAI,  Stock  Exchanges  and  Industry  Bodies,  it  was  decided  by  SEBI  to  discontinue  with  QARC 
mechanism and in place of the same, require disclosures on the impact of audit qualifications.  

Recommendation and rationale: 

The Committee is of the view that any audit qualification needs detailed scrutiny and therefore, the 
QARC  mechanism  may  be  revived  or  any  other  similar  mechanism  may  be  devised  wherein  audit 
qualifications are examined in greater detail. It is also recommended that the process to be followed 
by such committee should be time bound.   

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

Suitable amendments may be made as determined by SEBI.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

B. Powers of SEBI with Respect to  Auditors and Other Statutory Third Party Fiduciaries for 
Listed Entities 

Current regulatory provisions: 

1.  The  statutory  audit  process  forms  the  bedrock  of  reliance  by  external  stakeholders 
(shareholders, lenders and regulatory authorities, among others) on the financial performance 
of  a  listed  entity,  making  statutory  auditors  the  principal  gatekeepers,  enhancing  corporate 
governance.  ICAI, as the  professional services regulator, regulates the  profession of chartered 
accountants  and  has  a  mechanism  in  place  for  disciplinary  proceedings  against  them.  The 
Companies Act also sets forth detailed provisions for responsibilities and liabilities of auditors, 
which are administered by the MCA.  

2.  Section 11 of SEBI Act provides that subject to  the  provisions  of  the SEBI Act,  it  shall  be  the  
duty    of    SEBI    to    protect    the  interests    of    investors    in    securities    and    to    promote    the  
development  of,  and  to  regulate  the securities market, through such measures as it thinks fit. 
However, under the SEBI Act or Regulations framed thereunder, there is no specific provision 
which provides specific penal powers in relation to auditors.  

3. 

In  Price  Waterhouse  and  Co.  a  partnership  firm  registered  with  the  Institute  of  Chartered 
Accountants of India and Ms. Sharmila Karve, Partner, Price Waterhouse and Co. vs. Securities 
and Exchange Board of India and Whole Time Member Mr. M.S. Sahoo, Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (2011(2) BomCR173), the Bombay High Court has extensively considered SEBI’s 
jurisdiction  on  statutory  auditors  (keeping  in  mind  the  provisions  of  the  ICAI  Act),  where  the 
issue  of  show  cause  notice  by  SEBI  to  auditors  (the  individuals  as  well  as  the  firm)  was 
challenged – relevant extracts from the said decision are set forth below:   

(a)  After  considering  the  provisions  of  Section  11(1)  and  other  applicable  provisions  of  the 

SEBI Act, held the following: 

17….“A reading of the said provisions discloses the scope and width of the powers vested 
with  the  SEBI  to  be  exercised  in  the  interest  of  investors  and  for regulating  the securities 
market.  The  SEBI  in  its  capacity  as  a  Market  Regulator  can  take  any  of  the  measures 
mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 11 towards the said end. The said measures are only 
illustrative  and  not  exhaustive  and  in  a  given  case  the  SEBI  considering  the  duty  it  is 
enjoined  with  may  take  such  measures  as  it  deems  appropriate.  In  our  view,  the  words 
employed  in  the  aforesaid  provisions  are  of  wide  amplitude  and  would  therefore  take 
within its sweep a Chartered Accountant if his activities are detrimental to the interest of 
the investors or the securities market.” 

(b) 

(c) 

 “35…In a given case, if there is  prima facie evidence in connection with the conduct of a 
Chartered Accountant such as fabricating the books of accounts, etc., the SEBI can certainly 
give appropriate direction not to utilize the services of such a Chartered Accountant in the 
matter of audit of a listed Company.” (emphasis supplied) 

 “39…Section 11(1) of the SEBI Act empowers SEBI to inquire into as well as to initiate the 
proceedings like the one in question. As pointed out earlier, the proceedings started against 
the petitioners on the basis of some statements made by one Ramalinga Raju on the basis 
of  e-mail  to  which  a  reference  is  made  in  the  show  cause  notices.  Whether  any  of  the 
petitioners  with  an  intention  and  knowledge  tried  to  fabricate  and  fudge  the  books  of 
accounts is a matter of investigation and inquiry by the SEBI. Ultimately if any evidence in 
this behalf is brought on record before the SEBI during the inquiry, appropriate steps can be 
taken in this behalf as provided for by the SEBI Act. We must at this stage take note of the 
argument of Mr. Seervai that so far as his clients are concerned, they were not in any way 

 
 

 
87 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

connected with the audit of the Company in any manner. Simply because they are Partners 
of  Price  Waterhouse  Network,  no  notice  could  have  been  issued  against  his  clients. 
However, so far as this submission is concerned, these petitioners can very well point out 
these  facts  before  the  concerned  Member  of  SEBI.  SEBI  being  a  quasi-judicial  authority, 
while adjudicating the matter, will look into this aspect and will consider as to whether any 
particular firm of Chartered Accountants has any role to play or for that reason any of the 
petitioners had played any role in any manner they may bring the matter to the notice of 
the SEBI. In a given case, if ultimately it is found that there was only some omission without 
any  mens  rea  or  connivance  with  anyone  in  any  manner,  naturally  on  the  basis  of  such 
evidence the SEBI cannot give any further directions. If there is available evidence, SEBI can 
proceed further in the matter of giving direction against a particular Chartered Accountant 
as envisaged by Sections 11 and 12 of the SEBI Act and Regulations  in this behalf. On the 
basis of detailed evidence on record, this aspect is required to be considered by SEBI. The 
question of jurisdictional fact depends upon the facts which may be available at the time of 
evidence before the SEBI. SEBI will have to answer the question as to whether on the basis 
of evidence on record, it has any power to give directions as provided under the SEBI Act. 
This aspect will depend upon the evidence which may be available at the time of inquiry. All 
these  aspects  are  therefore  left  to  the  consideration  of  SEBI  at  the  time  of  passing  final 
order in the inquiry.” (emphasis supplied). 

Recommendation and rationale: 

Given  SEBI’s  mandate  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  the  securities  market  and  regulating 
listed  entities,  the  Committee  recommends  that  SEBI  should  have  clear  powers  to  act  against 
auditors and other third party fiduciaries with statutory duties under securities law (as defined under 
SEBI  LODR  Regulations),  subject  to  appropriate  safeguards.  This  power  ought  to  extend  to  act 
against  the  impugned  individual(s),  as  well  as  against  the  firm  in  question  with  respect  to  their 
functions  concerning  listed  entities.  This  power  should  be  provided  in  case  of  gross  negligence  as 
well, and not just in case of fraud/connivance. This recommendation may be implemented after due 
consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the relevant professional services regulators/ 
institutions.   
 
Dissenting View: The ICAI has expressed its dissent on the above recommendation as the regulation 
of  chartered  accountants  is  covered  under  the  Chartered  Accountants  Act,  1949  and  to  avoid 
jurisdictional conflict and other issues. 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendment may be required to SEBI LODR Regulations.  

12. Strengthening the Role of ICAI 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The ICAI Act regulates the conduct of Chartered Accountants in India and provides a mechanism for 
taking  disciplinary  action  against  members  who  are  in  violation  of  obligations  cast  on  such 
professionals.  Further,  ICAI  Act  permits  ICAI  to  punish  such  a  member  or  levy  a  penalty  on  the 
member  not  exceeding  Rs.  5  lakh.  It  does  not  permit  ICAI  to  punish or  impose  penalties  on  firms. 
While  the  Companies  Act  also  has  provisions  for  enhanced  monetary  penalties  on  auditors,  the 
enforcement  of  the  same  is  through  the  MCA  and  not  the  ICAI,  which  is  the  professional  services 
regulator.  

 
 

 
88 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

 

 

 

Recommendation and Rationale: 

The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  reliable  financial  statements  are  at  the  core  of  corporate 
governance  and  therefore  the  fiduciary  role  of  the  auditor  is  crucial.  Hence  there  needs  to  be 
sufficient deterrence to ensure this objective in the interest of corporate governance. In this context, 
the  current  maximum  amount  for  penalty  under  the  ICAI  Act  of  Rs.  5  lakh  is  too  low  to  act  as  a 
deterrent. Additionally, a need is identified for ICAI to be able to punish or impose penalties on audit 
firms, in addition to individual members.  

Therefore,  in  the  interest  of  enhancing  governance  of  listed  entities,  the  Committee  recommends 
that ICAI may be given powers to increase the scope of punishment as well as the penalty amount as 
follows: 

  On the member - penalty of up to Rs. 1 crore; 

  On  the  audit  firm-  punishment  or  impose  penalties  of  up  to  Rs.  5  crore  in  case  of  repeated 

violations (that is, where the number of violations exceed three). 

In  addition,  in  relation  to  the  enforcement/disciplinary  process  of  the  ICAI,  the  Committee 
recommends: 

 

increased disclosure by ICAI of actions taken against members to increase transparency and act 
as a deterrent 

  a  separate  team/cell  for  enforcement  pertaining  to  listed  entities  in  order  to  reduce  the 

turnaround time for disciplinary proceedings 

 

to have a team that analyses reports of proxy advisors on audit related matters of listed entities 
and take appropriate action, if any, against its members. 

ICAI view:  This  recommendation  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  Committee 
and ICAI has already taken up most of the aforesaid matters at appropriate levels. 
 
Committee  view:  The  Committee  stands  by  its  recommendation  as  it  believes  that  the  above  is 
critical for enhancing corporate governance of listed Indian entities.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendments required to the SEBI LODR Regulations.  

The  Committee  suggests  that  SEBI  take  up  the  above  recommendation  with  the  appropriate 
authorities/ regulators. 

13. Strengthening the Independent Functioning of QRB 

Current regulatory provisions: 

There  is  no  specific  provision  on  Quality  Review  Board  (“QRB”)  under  the  Companies  Act  or  SEBI 
LODR Regulations. 

 

 

 
 

 
89 

 

Recommendation and Rationale: 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

Most  major  economies  in  the  world  have  implemented  systems  of  independent  oversight  for  the 
auditors  of  listed  companies  that  provide  confidence  to  shareholders  and  stakeholders.   The 
International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR) is an international body established in 
2006 that comprises independent  audit regulators from 52 jurisdictions representing Africa, North 
America, South America, Asia, Oceania, and Europe.  IFIAR’s mission is to serve the public interest 
and  enhance  investor  protection  by  improving  audit  quality  globally.  In  India,  the  Quality  Review 
Board  (QRB)  is  mandated  to  conduct  such  reviews  and  has  now  started  carrying  out  reviews  of 
audits  performed  by  various  auditors.   Therefore,  strengthening  the  role  of  QRB  assumes 
significance. 

In view of the above, the Committee recommends that: 

  QRB  should  be  further  strengthened  to  meet  the  independence  criteria  laid  down  by  the 
International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR) and should become a member of 
IFIAR at the earliest. In this regard,  QRB may  also be provided requisite financial resources as 
well as staffed with adequate full time personnel to be able to effectively carry out its mandate. 
Steps  should  also  be  taken  for  further  operational  independence  of  QRB  such  as  providing 
infrastructural support by the government, etc.  

 

Reasons  for  disagreement  between  the  ICAI  and  the  QRB  should  be  recorded  in  writing  and 
communicated to QRB for improving transparency in functioning.  

ICAI view: This recommendation is outside the scope of the terms of reference of the Committee. 
Further, QRB has already applied for IFIAR membership and the dialogue is on with the IFIAR with 
respect to the above.  
 
Committee  view:  The  Committee  stands  by  its  recommendation  as  it  believes  that  the  above  is 
critical for enhancing corporate governance of listed Indian entities.  
 

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations:  

No amendments required to the SEBI LODR Regulations. The Committee suggests that SEBI take up 
the above recommendation with the appropriate authorities/ regulators.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER  VIII:  INVESTOR  PARTICIPATION  IN  MEETINGS  OF  LISTED 
ENTITIES  
 
It is understood that increased and better participation by constituents enhances good governance. 
Accordingly, the Committee recognises that easing investor participation, including through the use 
of  technology,  is  imperative.  While  e-voting  has  enabled  shareholders  to  have  a  greater  say  in 
shareholder  resolutions  (over  70%  of  the  voting  power  is  being  exercised  in  most  companies), 
participation in general meetings continues to be limited. The Committee believes that responding 
to questions from shareholders promotes accountability of boards and management. Accordingly, it 
is important to facilitate and ease participation by removing the boundaries of physical meetings and 
adopting the use of technology.   

The Committee also acknowledges the stewardship role that must be played by asset managers who 
in  turn  hold  fiduciary  responsibilities  towards  their  own  investors.  It  is  only  with  the  discharge  of 
duties  on  both  sides  that  the  governance  agenda  will  be  served.  In  this  context,  the  following 
recommendations have been made by the Committee. 

1.  Timeline for Annual General Meetings of Listed Entities 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently,  under  the  Companies  Act,  listed  entities  in  India  are  required  to  hold  Annual  General 
Meetings within six months from the end of the financial year. There is no specific provision in SEBI 
LODR Regulations on this matter. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

It was observed that in many countries such as South Korea, Thailand, Italy, Singapore, Japan, etc., 
timelines  for  holding  AGM  were  shorter  than  the  timeline  of  six  months  provided  in  India.  The 
Committee felt that in line with the global practices, and to avoid a bunching up of AGMs (especially 
in  August/September)  which  results  in  lower  shareholder  participation,  there  is  a  need  to  reduce 
timelines for holding of AGMs by listed entities, albeit in a phased manner. 

Therefore, it is recommended that:  

 

Initially,  the  top  100  listed  entities  by  market  capitalization  (as  at  the  end  of  the  previous 
financial year) may be required to hold AGMs by August 31, 2018, i.e. within five months from 
the  end  of  the  next  financial  year.  The  same  may  be  extended  to  other  entities  in  a  phased 
manner based on the experience gained.  

  Over  time,  the  target  may  be  to  reduce  the  timeline  to  four  months  from  the  end  of  the 

financial year.

meetings  within  a  period  of  five  months  from  the 
date  of  closing  of  the  financial  year  with  effect  from 
the financial year beginning April 1, 2018.  

2.  E-voting and Webcast of Proceedings of the Meeting 

Current regulatory provisions: 

Currently, under the Companies Act read with Companies (Management and Administration) Rules, 
2014, it is mandatory for a listed entity to provide e-voting facility to shareholders and such e-voting 
is  permitted  upto  5  p.m.  one  day  prior  to  the  general  meeting.  Further,  webcast  of  the  meeting 
proceedings  is  not  mandatory.  Similarly,  under  SEBI  LODR  Regulations,  remote  e-voting  facility  is 
mandatory  in  respect  of  all  shareholder  resolutions  and  voting  results  are  to  be  submitted  within 
forty eight hours of conclusion of the general meeting. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

As stated above, currently, e-voting is permitted upto 5 p.m. one day prior to the general meeting 
and webcast of the meeting proceedings is not mandatory. Given that the e-voting timeline expires 
before the  meeting is held,  shareholders not  attending the  meetings in person are unable to take 
into account discussions at the meeting in order to make informed decisions. 

For the investors to take into account the discussions during the general meeting and hence, vote 
with complete information, it is recommended that: 

(i) 

Live one-way webcasts of all shareholder meetings may be introduced for top 100 listed entities 
on  a  trial  basis.  Based  on  the  feedback  and  the  experience,  the  same  may  subsequently  be 
extended to other listed entities.; and 

(ii)  E-voting should be kept open till midnight (i.e. 11:59 p.m.) on the day of the general meeting. 
The  current  requirement  of  not  permitting  modification  of  votes  cast  through  e-voting  may 
continue.

No specific provision (on webcast).

The  Committee  suggests  that  SEBI  take  up  the  above  recommendation  with  the  Ministry  of 
Corporate Affairs for amendment of the Companies (Management and Administration) Rules, 2014 
to allow the facility for remote e-voting to remain open till end of the day (i.e. 11:59 p.m.) on the 
date of the general meeting.

3.  Stewardship Code 

Current regulatory provisions: 

There  is no specific  provision for a ‘stewardship  code’  under SEBI LODR Regulations. However, for 
specific institutional investors such as mutual funds, etc., certain stewardship principles such as on 
voting,  conflict  of  interest,  etc.  have  been  adopted  under  the  specific  SEBI  regulations  as  may  be 
applicable. IRDAI in March 2017 issued a stewardship code for insurance companies in India.  

Recommendations and rationale: 

The  Committee  observed  that  in  view  of  the  increasing  importance  of  institutional  investors  in 
capital markets across the world, they are expected to shoulder greater responsibility towards their 
clients/beneficiaries  by  enhancing  their  monitoring  of  and  engagement  with  their  investee 
companies. Such activities are commonly referred to as ‘Stewardship Responsibilities’ of institutional 
investors. Such increased engagement is also seen as an important step towards improved corporate 
governance of the investee companies. The fulfillment of stewardship responsibilities by institutional 
investors also protects the interests of the retail investors in such companies.  

Several  countries  such  as  United  Kingdom,  Japan,  Malaysia,  etc.  have  prescribed  detailed 
Stewardship Codes to be followed by institutional investors in their jurisdictions on a voluntary basis. 
These  Codes  include  certain  principles  applicable  to  institutional  investors  which  require  that 
investors  have clear and comprehensive policies on: 

a)  Discharge of their stewardship responsibilities  

b)  Management of conflicts of interest in fulfilling stewardship responsibilities 

c)  Monitoring of investee companies 

d) 

Intervention in investee companies  

e)  Collaboration with other institutional investors 

f)  Voting and disclosure of voting activity 

g)  Periodical reporting on their stewardship activities 

Several other countries have also adopted one or more of the principles in different  forms in their 
own jurisdiction. The Committee noted that one of the first steps in this regard was taken by SEBI 
which  prescribed  detailed  requirements  for  disclosures  with  respect  to  voting  policies  and  actual 
voting on different resolutions of investee companies by mutual funds in India.  

The  Committee  was  informed  that  based  on  SEBI’s  representation  in  the  matter,  the  Financial 
Stability  and  Development  Council  (FSDC)  directed  the  formation  of  a  Committee  under  the 
Chairpersonship  of  SEBI  with  representatives  from  the  Insurance  Regulatory  and  Development 
Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) to 
consider various aspects of introduction of a stewardship code in India. It was also informed that the 
said Committee has submitted its recommendations to FSDC and is pending FSDC approval. It was 
also  noted  that  after  the  formation  of  the  aforesaid  Committee,  IRDA  had  also  issued  a  detailed 
stewardship code for insurance companies. 

The  Committee  has  taken  note  of  the  efforts  made  by  FSDC  and  the  regulators  towards  a 
stewardship code, and recommends that a common stewardship code be introduced in India for the 
entire  financial  sector  on  the  lines  of  best  practices  globally  based  on  the  seven  principles  of 
stewardship  as  outlined  above.  The  Committee  also  recommends  that  since  SEBI  is  the  capital 

 
 

 
93 

 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

market  regulator  and  the  Code  applies  to  investments  in  the  capital  market,  the  common 
Stewardship  Code  may  be  introduced  by  SEBI  for  investments  by  institutional  investors  in  Indian 
capital markets.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations: 

Amendments to SEBI Regulations, if any, may be in accordance with the framework devised by SEBI 
to implement the Stewardship Code in India.   

4.  Treasury Stock 

Current regulatory provisions: 

The Companies Act specifically prohibits the creation of treasury stock (i.e. shares in its own name or 
in  the  name  of  any  trust  either  on  its  behalf  or  on  behalf  any  of  its  subsidiary  or  associate 
companies).  However,  there  is  no  requirement  for  cancelling/extinguishing  treasury  stock  which 
existed prior to notification of provisions of the Act. Further, under SEBI LODR Regulations, there is 
no specific provision on treasury stock. (Click for Detailed Provisions) 

Recommendation and rationale: 

As stated above, there is no requirement to cancel/extinguish treasury stock which existed prior to 
notification  of  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act.  To  avoid  misuse  arising  from  exercise  of  voting 
rights in respect of shares held by employee benefit/employee welfare trusts, SEBI had withdrawn 
voting  rights  of  the  trustees  on  such  shares  under  the  SEBI  (Share  Based  Employee  Benefits) 
Regulations, 2014 – however, SEBI has permitted a three year sunset period in this regard. To meet 
the  same  objective  as  set  forth  above  and  to  balance  voting  rights  of  all  shareholders,  the 
Committee recommends that a sunset clause may be imposed requiring all existing treasury stock in 
listed entities to not carry voting rights after three years.  

Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations (w.e.f. April 1, 2021):

No specific provision.

In case a listed entity holds its own shares in its name 
or in the name of any trust either on its behalf or on 
behalf  of  any  of  its  subsidiaries  or  associates  (i.e. 
treasury  stock),  no  voting  rights  attached  to  such 
shares  shall  be  exercisable  with  effect  from  April  1, 
2021.  

5.  Resolutions sent to Shareholders without Board’s Recommendation 

Current regulatory provisions: 

While  in  certain  cases  the  board’s  recommendation  is  required  for  consideration  by  shareholders 
(for  e.g.  declaration  of  dividend),  there  is  no  general  rule  (either  in  the  Companies  Act  or  in  SEBI 
LODR  Regulations)  that  every  resolution  placed  before  the  shareholders  should  have  been 
recommended by the board of directors.   

 

 
 

 
94 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

 

 

Recommendation and rationale: 

It 
is  not  necessary  for  every  resolution  placed  before  shareholders  to  have  received  a 
recommendation  from  the  board  of  directors.  The  Committee  recognises  that  there  may  be 
(exceptional)  circumstances  where  the  resolution  being  sent  to  shareholders  would  not  have 
received such a recommendation. However, in such circumstances, some additional safeguards and 
disclosures  may be made in the  general meeting notice  to enable the shareholders to come  to an 
informed decision while considering the same.  

In this regard, the Committee recommends the following:  

(i) 

In the usual course, the resolution placed before the shareholders should be recommended by 
the  board  of  directors.  Placing  a  resolution  before  the    shareholders  without  a  board 
recommendation should be used sparingly and on rare occasions;  

(ii)  However, in exceptional circumstances, a listed entity may issue a notice of a general meeting, 
which  may  include  one  or  more  resolutions  for  consideration  by  shareholders  without  such 
resolution  having  been  recommended  by  the  board.  In  such  cases,  an  explanatory  statement 
for such a resolution must disclose the board’s deliberated views to the shareholders.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER IX: GOVERNANCE ASPECTS OF PUBLIC SECTOR ENTERPRISES 
 
Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) play a prominent role in the economic development of our country, 
and  their  importance  can  not  only  be  gauged  from  their  size  but  also  their  leadership  position  in 
sensitive  and  strategic  sectors  of  the  economy.  Further,  the  role  of  PSEs  in  generation  of 
employment  opportunities,  welfare  initiatives,  balanced  regional  development,  undertaking  long-
term  capital  intensive  projects  and  other  initiatives  for  the  general  public  welfare  is  well 
acknowledged.  Some  of  them  are  also  listed,  allowing  them  access  to  public  markets  for  funds. 
These  have  a  broader  range  of  stakeholders.  The  Committee  discussed  various  issues  to  enhance 
governance  concerning  PSEs  and  consequently  improve  shareholder  value.  This  may  also  set  the 
stage for more PSEs to list. 

The  Committee  acknowledged  that  PSEs  also  face  unique  challenges  that  make  their  governance 
more  complex  than  in  the  private  sector,  given  that  (i)  most  PSEs  pursue  multiple  and  diverse 
objectives in line with their broader social welfare objectives (unlike private enterprises which may 
focus on value maximization for their shareholders); (ii) PSEs may also have certain structural issues 
arising due to conflicts of interest that are inherent in cases where the same entity is both the owner 
and  regulator;  (iii)  protracted  decision  making  in  PSEs  owing  to  accountability  at  multiple  levels. 
Nonetheless, there is a need for moving to enhanced governance standards. 

The  Committee  debated  several  mechanisms  in  addressing  these  challenges  and  was  of  the  view 
that  all  listed  entities,  government  or  private,  should  be  treated  at  par  on  governance  standards. 
Therefore, all listed PSEs should be compliant with the SEBI LODR Regulations. In case there is any 
inconsistency  between  the  relevant  legislation,  if  any,  under  which  the  respective  PSE  has  been 
established and the SEBI LODR Regulations, appropriate harmonization of the legislation to bring the 
same in line with the requirement of SEBI LODR Regulations should be undertaken.  

During the course of detailed deliberations, the Committee reviewed international examples on PSE 
governance and ownership structures (as set out in Annexure 6) and had broad consultations with 
different stakeholders to understand the issues in the Indian context. The Committee came to the 
conclusion  that  while  this  issue  would  require  more  consideration  and  detailed  analysis,  the 
following key guiding principles must be kept in mind for such assessment on this subject: 

1.  Establish  a  transparent  mandate  for  PSEs  and  disclose  its  objectives  and  obligations:  The 
government, as owner, must set clear objectives and mandates for the PSEs, and, where there 
are  non-commercial  objectives,  these  should  be  clearly  articulated,  quantified  and 
transparently  disclosed  to  the  shareholders  on  a  regular  basis  so  that  investors  can  take 
informed investment decisions.  

2.  Ensure independence of the PSEs from the administrative ministry: The government should aim 
at  ensuring  independence  of  the  PSEs  from  the  administrative  ministry  to  ensure  speedy 
decision making, functional and operational autonomy in pursuit of their stated objectives, for 
better commercial goals and to attract talent in a competitive market place. 

3.  Consolidate  the  Government  stake  in  listed  PSEs  under  holding  entity  structure(s):  As  a 
sustainable  and  optimal  solution  for  minimizing  conflicts  arising  from  the  ownership  and 
regulatory dichotomy in PSEs, the government should consider consolidating its ownership and 
monitoring  of  PSEs  into  independent  holding  entity  structure(s)  by  April  1,  2020.  An 
independent  board  with  diversified  skill  set  of  the  holding  entity(s)  would  also  facilitate 
operationalizing  a  consistent  and  high  quality  process  on  significant  issues  such  as  strategy, 
performance monitoring, mergers and acquisitions, and recruitment of best talent. 

 
 

 
96 

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

 

 

Recommendations: 

The  Committee  recommends  that  the  listed  PSEs  fully  comply  with  the  provisions  of  SEBI  LODR 
Regulations  and  the  same  be  suitably  enforced.  Additionally,  the  government  should  assess  and 
examine  the  broader  issues  referenced  above  inter  alia  concerning  ownership  structure  for  the 
government  stake,  removal of conflicts and creating a more  autonomous environment for PSEs to 
function in the  best interest  of all stakeholders. The  Committee  believes  that this will significantly 
enhance value of the national assets. This should be done in a time-bound manner.

CHAPTER X: LENIENCY MECHANISM  
 
Current regulatory provisions: 

Section  24B  of  the  SEBI  Act  and  Section  23O  of  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956 
(“SCRA”) provide powers to the Central Government (based on recommendations by SEBI) to grant 
immunity both from prosecution and imposition of penalty under the SEBI Act and the SCRA for the 
alleged violation, subject to certain conditions. (Click for Detailed Provisions)  

In addition, while SEBI currently has a consent mechanism for certain categories of violations, there 
are no specific provisions in the regulatory framework that empower SEBI to grant leniency (by way 
of  reduction  in/waiver  of  penalty  or  immunity  from  prosecution)  as  well  as  to  protect  a  whistle-
blower who is allegedly in violation of relevant securities laws. 

Recommendation and rationale: 

A leniency programme creates structural incentives for persons connected with the commission of 
an infringement to come forward and disclose such violations and assist the regulatory authorities 
by  receiving  lenient  treatment  and  protection  against  victimization.  Currently,  the  Competition 
Commission of India has powers to grant leniency to cartel members in case they disclose true, full 
and  vital  information.  The  Committee  felt  that  a  leniency  programme  would  improve  effective 
detection  of violations  and  enhance  ease of  investigation  and  enforcement,  while  also  acting  as  a 
deterrent that could result in an increase in the overall compliance of securities regulations.  

The  Committee  felt  that  SEBI  may  be  empowered  to  grant  leniency  and  offer  protection  against 
victimisation  to whistle-blowers  in certain instances determined on a case by case  basis. Any such 
power would have to be accompanied by the rules and regulations in relation to the conditions to be 
satisfied for getting benefits under the leniency programme and protection against victimization, the 
procedure for the grant of lesser penalty or reduction in liability, the quantum of penalties that are 
waived  when  lenient  treatment  is  meted  out  and  protection  of  the  whistle-blower.  In  a  nutshell, 
availing of leniency provisions is a win-win situation for SEBI as well as the whistle-blower. 

The Committee suggests that SEBI take up the above recommendation with the Ministry of Finance. 
In this regard, the drafts of proposed amendments to the SEBI Act and the SCRA are below: 

Current provision in SEBI Act and SCRA

prescribed.

Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 

CHAPTER XI: CAPACITY BUILDING IN SEBI FOR ENHANCING CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE IN LISTED ENTITIES 
 
Corporate governance deals not only with the de jure but also the de facto aspects of the law. In this 
context,  SEBI’s  role  as  a  regulator  of  capital  markets  assumes  particular  importance  given  that  it 
requires diligent detection, monitoring and enforcement action. Thus, the efficacy of the Committee 
recommendations  depends  critically  upon  SEBI’s  detection  and  enforcement  capabilities.  This 
chapter  focuses  on various  steps  that  the  Committee  recommends  to  enhance  capacity of  SEBI  in 
line with global best practices. Broadly, the Committee therefore recommends that SEBI should:  

A.  enhance the number and skill-sets of its human resources;  

B.  exploit the power of data science and technology; and  

C. 

strategically work with other agencies, especially for monitoring and enforcement.   

A.   Bridge the Human Resources Gap 

Staff Strength: Based on the Annual Report (CY 2016) of the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), the SEC has almost one employee for each listed company. However, based on SEBI’s Annual 
Report  (FY  2017),  it  appears  that  SEBI  has  one  employee  for  six  listed  companies.  In  key  divisions 
such  as  Corporate  Finance,  which  is  inter  alia  responsible  for  ascertaining  the  quality  of  financial 
statements of  listed  entities,  SEC  has more  than  15 times  as many  employees as  SEBI  (477 versus 
31). Key indicative comparative data in this regard is set out below:

Therefore,  staff  strength  at  SEBI  needs  to  be  increased  to  strengthen  its  monitoring  and 
enforcement  functions.  SEBI  may  also  at  an  appropriate  stage  consider  the  need  to  outsource 
certain functions with relevant safeguards. 

Staff  Skill  and  Expertise:  Successful  enforcement  actions  by  SEBI  can  have  the  twin  effect  of 
penalising the guilty, on the one hand, and creating a significant deterrent effect on the other hand. 
However, for such deterrent effects to be felt in India, SEBI must equip itself so that it can adroitly 
gather  evidence  with  the  objective  of  “investigate  to  litigate.”  SEBI  needs  to  develop  teams 
comprising  data  scientists,  accountants,  lawyers  specialised  in  corporate  law,  software  engineers

and academicians.  The members need to have depth of knowledge within their respective areas as 
also  possess  broad  expertise  across  functional  areas.  In  addition,  SEBI  should  build  its  market 
intelligence through regular review of market research and reports of proxy advisors. 

Revolving  Door  Policy:  Successful  leveraging  of  investments  in  technology,  data  science  and  risk 
prediction requires high quality professionals. SEBI therefore needs to follow regulators across the 
world  in  utilising  specialist  hires.  It  may  even  consider  creating  a  revolving  door  policy  between 
employees at SEBI and in the private sector, allowing SEBI to hire laterals.  

B.   Use of Data Science and Risk Prediction 

Form  a  data  science  department  within  SEBI:  The  Committee  recommends  that  a  separate 
department be set up to focus on review of the financial statements and filings to detect reporting, 
disclosure  and  audit  failures.  The  principal  goal  of  the  department  will  be  to  create  a  robust  data 
processing  framework  which  can  form  the  basis  of  further  investigation,  detection  of  violations 
involving  misleading  financial  statements  and  disclosures.  The  department  will  also  focus  on 
identifying  and  exploring  areas  susceptible  to  fraudulent  reporting,  including  ongoing  review  of 
information and use of data analytics.  

A sub-unit for assessing accounting quality: The Committee recommends that SEBI set up a sub-unit 
for  reviewing  quality  of  audit  (including  forensic  audit)  to  investigate  any  potential  red  flags  in  a 
timely manner. This sub-unit should make extensive use of modern technological tools including text 
analytics and artificial intelligence.  Further, this sub-unit should also be responsible for conducting 
review of audited accounts and filings by listed entities, with at least a certain percentage of listed 
entities  being  covered  every  year.  This  percentage  should  increase  to  cover  more  entities  over  a 
period of time. 

C.  Greater collaboration between SEBI and Other Agencies 

The  Committee  recognises  that  SEBI  has  worked  on  investigations  in  coordination  with  other 
regulatory  agencies,  and  believes  that  there  is  substantial  scope  to  develop  cross-regulator 
coordination  to  ensure  effective  enforcement.  In  addition  to  domain-specific  regulators  like  tax 
authorities, SEBI can work extensively with MCA and leverage  stock exchanges to ensure  effective 
investigations,  not  only  by  mining  information  and  expertise  available  with  a  cross-section  of 
regulators but also piecing together discrete pieces of information/evidence (which individually may 
not be sufficient) to build a strong case for enforcement. Gradually, cross-regulatory platforms may 
be built and harmonised with the use of sophisticated technology tools to ensure that an effective 
monitoring mechanism is established.  

SEBI may consider examining the above recommendations in greater detail.

This will unduly impinge upon the freedom of 
the management of the company to decide its 
non-executive directors 
There is no need to increase the minimum 
number of Board meetings. There is a provision 
under proviso to section 173 whereby the Central 
Government may change the requirement of 
minimum number of Board meetings for a 
certain class of companies. Necessary changes if 
required can be brought under the Companies 
Act, 2013 through issue of a notification.

This would directly conflict with the provisions

Ideally, all requirements for IDs should be 
covered under the Act provisions (including the 
Schedule) rather than under two statutes. 

There is no need to fix the lower limit of 
compensation to be received by the IDs 
There is a clarity required as to what would be 
the consequence of saying that there was no 
material reason for resignation, when there was 
actually a material reason. This can be in the 
form of a guidance since the matter is already 
covered in the Act.

It is not clear as to how it would be ensured that 
the auditor will appoint an independent expert. In 
fact there may be inherent incentive for the 
auditor not to do so. 

  

It needs to be ensured that such independent 
expert is independent of the management as well 
of the auditor/audit firm.

There is a need to align this requirement with the 
Companies  Act,  2013  as  prosecutions  are 
launched  against  defaulting  companies  based  on 
these timelines. 
Recommendation was given: E-voting cannot go 
beyond  the  closure  of  AGM.  The  proposed 
amendment  in  any  case  would  violate  rule 
20(4)(vi)  of  the  Companies  (Management  & 
Administration) Rules, 2014. 

This provision has been dropped at this stage by 
the Committee.

Suggestions may be given so that a sunset 
provision may be introduced in the Companies 
Act, 2013 or the Rules thereunder so as to cover 
all classes of companies or to provide further 
clarity, as required. 
This  provision  may  not  be  required  as  the 
contours  of  “exceptional  circumstances”  has  not 
been provided clearly. Such changes, if required 
should be applicable to all companies and should
