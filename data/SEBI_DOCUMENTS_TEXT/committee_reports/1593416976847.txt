SOCIAL STOCK EXCHANGE 

 

 

1 

Chairman’s Note 

The Hon’ble Finance Minister’s bold vision of a Social Stock Exchange could not have come at a 
more  opportune  time  for  India.  In  a  country  whose  policymakers have always striven to create 
economic  prosperity  for  all,  the  seeds  of  a  form  of  capital  that  would  prioritize  social  returns 
over  financial  returns  have  always  been  present  in  the  policymaker’s  conception  of  Indian 
business  and  enterprise.  It  is  no  wonder then that India is the only country in the world to have 
mandated  a Corporate Social Responsibility role for its private enterprises, and that it is also one 
of  the  world’s  fastest growing impact investing  destinations. Yet, much more can and should be 
done.  India’s  economic  imperative  is  to  feed,  clothe,  educate and empower more than a billion 
people,  in  ways  that  conserve and grow its natural, cultural and social heritages. It cannot expect 
to  accomplish  this  lofty  objective  on  the  strength  of  conventional  commercial  capital  alone.  If 
that were possible, India would not be home to over 3 million non-profit organizations who are 
working  tirelessly  to  close  the  capabilities  gap for hundreds of millions of Ind ians. These NPOs 
must  receive  adequate  financial  assistance  to  continue  and  multiply  their  stalwart  efforts.  They 
represent the core of the Hon’ble Finance Minister’s vision for a new form of enterprise in India, 
one in which the entrepreneur  is an agent of positive social impact more than  anything  else.   
  
The  SEBI  SSE  Working  Group  is  proud  to  publish  this  report  that gives form and content to 
the  Hon’ble  Finance  Minister’s  vision.  In  the  report,  the  Working  Group  has  laid  out  the 
modalities  for  creating  a Social Stock Exchange that will serve as a platform for fundraising and 
also incorporate a set of procedures by which social impact will be measured and reported. One 
of  the  biggest  challenges  faced  by  NPOs  is  visibility  to  investors  and  donors.  By  pairing 
innovative  instruments  by  which  NPOs  could  associate  with the SSE (among them direct listing 
via  a  new  class  of  securities),  with  a  reporting  standard  that  offers  investors  and  donors  a 
standardized  framework  for  measuring  social 
impact,  the  Social  Stock  Exchange  will 
revolutionize  the  state  of  play  in  the  social  sector.  That  is  not  all. An entire ecosystem of actors 
will organically grow and evolve as a result of the report’s recommendations being implemented. 
In  time,  this  ecosystem  centered  on  the  SSE  will  chart  a  course  of  social  and  economic 
development unlike  anything  that India has previously witnessed.

1  Introduction  

The  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  and  the  Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) 
have provided a set of common aspirational targets for governments to build a more sustainable, 
safe  and  prosperous  world.  In  tandem,  the  corporate  sector  has  begun  to  adopt  a  variety  of 
measures  to  ensure  that  their  activities  are  not  causing  harm  to  society  or  the  environment. 
Investing  has also shifted towards an Environmental  Social Governance (ESG) framework. 
 
The  Hon’ble  Finance  Minister  as  part  of  the  Budget  Speech  for FY 2019-20 had announced as 
follows: 
 
“It  is  time  to  take  our  capital  markets  closer  to  the  masses  and  meet  various  social welfare objectives related to 
inclusive  growth  and  financial  inclusion.  I  propose  to  initiate  steps  towards  creating  an  electronic  fund  raising 
platform- a social stock exchange-under the regulatory ambit of Securities and Exchange Board of India for listing 
social  enterprises  and  voluntary  organizations  working  for  the realization of a social welfare objective  so that they 
can raise capital as equity, debt or as units like a mutual fund.” 
 
1.1  Constitution  of  the Working Group 

Accordingly,  SEBI  constituted  a  working  group  on  ‘Social  Stock  Exchanges’  (SSE)  under  the 
Chairmanship of Shri Ishaat Hussain on September 19, 2019. The other members of the working 
group are as follows: 
 

i.  Shri TV Mohandas  Pai, Chairman  of Manipal Global Education;  Ex-Director (Infosys) 
ii.  Ms. Roopa Kudva, MD, Omidyar Network India   
iii.  Shri Amit Chandra, Chairman,  Bain Capital (Private Equity firm); noted philanthropist   
iv.  Dr. Saurabh Garg, Principal Secretary to Government of Odisha 
v.  Dr.  Shamika  Ravi,  Director  of  Research,  Brookings  India;  Member,  PM’s  Economic  Advisory 

Council 

vi.  Shri Vineet  Rai,  - Founder and MD, Aavishkaar Venture Management  Services Private Limited 
vii.  Representative  from Ministry of Corporate Affairs* 
viii. Dr. Ashima Jain ( Representative  from Department of Economic  Affairs)

xiii. Ms. Ruchi Chojer (CGM- Securities and Exchange Board of India) 
xiv. Shri Jeevan Sonparote (CGM- Securities and Exchange Board of India); Convener 

 

* No formal representative was nominated by Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The second 
meeting  of  the  working group was attended by Shri  Uday Khomane from the office of 
ROC, Mumbai.

norms for participation,  disclosures,  listing,  trading, oversight etc. 

 
1.3  Process followed 

The  working  group  had  its  first  meeting  on  October  01,  2019  and  decided  to  follow  a 
consultative  approach.  The  working  group  decided  to  carry  out  broader  consultations  with 
various stakeholders  and subject matter experts including  with the following: 

a.  Voluntary  Organizations 

b.  Social Enterprises 

c.  Existing  ecosystem  players  such  as  internet  based  platforms  helping raise funds 

for Voluntary  organizations/  social causes  etc. 

d.  Philanthropic  Organisations  (family owned/ institutions) 

Accordingly,  the  working  group  in  its  subsequent  meetings  held  on  October  25,  2019  and 
November  25,  2019  met  with  various  stakeholders.  Opportunities  were  provided  to  make 
presentations/  suggestions  on  subjects  relevant  to  the  stakeholder.  The  working  group  greatly 
benefitted from the deliberations  with the stakeholders. 
 
A  drafting  team  of  the  working  group  was  also  formed  comprising  of  Chairman-  Shri  Ishaat 
Hussain,  Ms.  Roopa  Kudva,  Shri  Amit  Chandra,  Shri  Vineet  Rai,  Shri  Amarjeet  Singh, and Shri 
Jeevan  Sonparote,  officers  of  SEBI  and  DVARA  Trust/  DVARA  Research.  The  team  met on 
December 18th , 2019, January 14th, 2020 and February 11, 2020.  
 
The working group again met on March 13, 2020 and May 11, 2020 to finalise  the report. 
 
1.4  Executive Summary 

Our recommendations are based on some key principles.   
 
First, 
in  the  spirit  of  the  Hon’ble  FM’s  words,  we  have  provided  a  holistic  set  of 
recommendations  –    supporting  the  flow  of  funds  and  enabling  fundraising  structures.  Our 
recommendations  aim  to  not  only  expand  the  range  of  available  instruments  and  pools  of 
available  capital,  but  also  establish  robust  standards of social impact and financial reporting, and 
create  the  right  enabling  environment  for  this  sector  by  nurturing  sector-level  infrastructure 
institutions  such  as  information  repositories  and  social  auditors.  We  believe  this  ecosystem 
approach  is  crucial  if  we  are  to  scale  up  funding  for  such  enterprises  working  to  serve  social 
welfare objectives in our country. 
 
Second,  our approach is based on the principle of additionality, i.e., enhancing and increasing the 
range  of  instruments  and  structures  available,  and  not  replacing  or  diluting anything that already 
exists.  All existing  mechanisms  continue  to be available as before. 
 
Third, given the diversity of interpretations  that the term has, we have not sought to define a for-
profit  social  enterprise.  We  believe  that  a  self-declaration  approach,  whereby  enterprises choose 
whether  they  want  to  be  categorised  as  a  social  enterprise,  and  consequently  commit  to 
additional  reporting  on  social impact, is the best one, because the enterprises themselves are best 

 

7 

placed  to  take  a    call  based  on  the  costs  or  benefits  to  them  of  being  classified  as  a  social 
enterprise.   
 
Fourth,  designing  the  Social  Stock  Exchange  (SSE)  also  requires  a  recognition  that  for-profit 
social  enterprises  (henceforth  to  be  referred  to  as  FPEs)  are  different  from  non-profit  social 
enterprises  (henceforth  to  be  referred  to  as  NPOs)  –  they  operate  in  different  ways  and  have 
different  financing  needs.  The  working  group  has, therefore, suggested different approaches for 
each  under  the  aegis  of the SSE. Yet, our recommendations also propose unifying elements and 
common  approaches  for  the  two  under  the  SSE  umbrella.  These  constitute  the  common 
minimum  reporting  standard  for  all  enterprises.  The  standard  incorporates  reporting  of  social 
impact, governance and financials. Over time, the minimum standard is envisioned to evolve and 
become  more  rigorous  and  more  sophisticated.  A  pathway  for that evolutionary process is laid 
out in the report.  
 
Finally, recognising that the vast majority of  NPOs in India are very small, the principle of equity 
has  been  an  important  consideration.  The  pooling  mechanisms  under  the  Social  Venture  Fund 
(SVF)  structure  will enable the smaller  NPOs to also benefit from the SSE. In addition, the SSE 
will  also  provide  capacity  building  support  to  these  smaller  organisations  to  enhance  their 
capabilities  to meet the reporting norms laid out in the report.  
 
Our recommendations are also motivated by a very urgent concern about the economic damage 
inflicted  by  Covid19,  especially  upon  the  poorest  Indian  households  and  large  swathes  of  the 
informal sector. India will need a significant amount of patient capital to repair and rebuild tho se 
livelihoods,  which  are the bedrock of her economy. Conventional capital that prioritizes financial 
returns  will  not  be  able  to  carry  such  a  burden  all  by  itself.  Social  capital, on the other hand, is 
more  suited  for  this  role.  It  is  not  only  patient  but  its  goal  is  precisely  to  support  and  fortify 
social  structures  that  are  in  danger  of  collapsing  because  of  Covid19.  The  SSE  is envisioned as 
one  of  the  possible  solutions  to  this  pressing  problem.  It  will  aim  at  unlocking  large  pools  of 
social  capital,  and  encourage  blended  finance  structures  so  that  conventional  capital  can  partner 
with social capital to address the urgent challenges  of Covid19.    
 
The  SSE  can  be housed within the existing stock exchange such as the Bombay Stock Exchange 
(BSE)  and/or  National  Stock  Exchange  (NSE).  This  will  help  the  SSE  leverage  the  existing 
infrastructure  and  client  relationships  of  the  exchanges  to  onboard  investors,  dono rs,  and social 
enterprises  (for-profit and non-profit). The SSE will have two primary roles:   
 
(a)  To effectively  deploy the fundraising  instruments  and structures  available under the 

regulatory guidelines  towards social enterprises:   
  For FPEs:  Equity and Social Venture  Funds (SVFs) 
  For NPOs: zero coupon zero principal  bonds, SVFs,  Mutual Funds (MFs), various pay-

for-success structures,  other securities  and units  that may evolve 

  For Section 8 Companies: Equity and Debt 
 

(b)  To foster overall sector development by creating  a capacity building unit which will be 

responsible  for:  
  Encouraging the setting  up of a Self-Regulatory  Organization  (SRO) that  will bring 

together existing  Information Repositories  (IRs),  in the immediate term for extending 
requisite  support to SSE (as explained in Chapter 3)  
Implementing  the reporting standard for all social enterprises  that benefit  from the SSE 

 

 

8 

  Operating the “capacity building fund” for enhancing  reporting capabilities  by NPOs 

(particularly  the  smaller NPOs). Creating awareness  and driving adoption of this  fund 
among NPOs, philanthropists,  and donors.  

  Actively  raising awareness  and promoting the fundraising  instruments/  structures 

available on the  SSE among social enterprises  and non-profit organisations   

 
Both these roles are equally  important to ensure  that the SSE makes a meaningful  impact.  
 
In  order  to  benefit  from  the  SSE,  i.e.,  avail  of  the  fundraising  instruments  and  structures 
described under (a) above, an NPO must commit to reporting in accordance with the minimum 
standard.  In  addition,  an  NPO  may  choose  to  register  with  an  IR  in  order  to  further  signal 
credibility  and legitimacy to investors/  funders. 
 
We see this report as the first important phase of a long journey  – while these recommendations 
should  help  the  sector  make  strides  forward,  more  will  need to be done in subsequent years as 
the market for such  funding continues  to mature.   
 
The  working  group  has benefited from consultations with key stakeholders:  non-profits (varying 
in  size,  causes,  and  geography  of  operation),  donors  and  philanthropic  foundations  and , on the 
for-profit  side,  social enterprises and impact investors. In addition, two surveys were carried out 
–  a  survey  of  retail  donors  (546)  and  a  survey  of  non-profits  (215).  The  working  group  also 
referred to a survey of 17 impact investors and 20 social enterprises run by Asha Impact, UNDP, 
KPMG, and the Impact Investors  Council (IIC). Their inputs  have been valuable. 
 
We  first  describe  our  recommendations  for  NPOs  and  then  our  recommendations  for  FPEs. 
The reader is referred to Chapter 6 for a complementary  recommendation with more details. 
 
1.4.1  Summary of recommendations  for NPOs 

Our  recommendations  for  the  non-profit  sector  are  aimed  at  driving sector-level development. 
These  recommendations,  if  implemented  as  a  package,  can  result  in  a  vibrant  and  supportive 
ecosystem,  enabling the non-profit sector to realise  its full potential  for creating social impact.   
 
A. Activate and mainstream  social capital to NPOs as zero coupon zero principal bonds 
to be directly listed on the SSE 
  
There  is  a  great  opportunity  to  unlock  funds  from  donors,  philanthropic foundations and CSR 
spenders,  in  the  form  of  zero  coupon  zero  principal  bonds.  These  bonds  will  be  listed  on the 
SSE.  They  will  carry  a  tenure  equal  to  the  duration  of  the  project  that  is  being  funded,  and  at 
tenure,  they  will  be  written  off  the  investee’s  books.  The  zero  coupon  zero  principal  bond  is 
particularly  well  suited  to  investors  who  are  looking  to  create  social  impact but do not wish to 
have  their  funds  returned  to  them.  However,  such  bonds  are  not  without  risk,  as  there  is  no 
guarantee  that  the  social  impact  that  an  NPO  is  promising  will  in  fact  be  created. Accordingly, 
investors will be keen to channel funds only to credible and legitimate NPOs, which the SSE will 
ensure by requiring beneficiary NPOs to report on social impact in a standardized format.NPOs 
can  also  signal  their  credibility  and  legitimacy  to  investors/  funders by choosing to register with 
IRs,  although  such  registration  may  not  be  mandated.  Furthermore,  investors  in  zero  coupon 
zero  principal  bonds  may  also  be  awarded  a  tax  benefit  to  incentivize  their participation in this 
instrument.   
 
The feasibility  of introduction  of such bonds, their  exact modalities,  entry norms, regulatory 
framework, etc may be worked out by the stock exchanges  and SEBI. 

 

9 

 
There  are  no  regulatory hurdles in listing shares or debt instruments of Section 8 companies and 
therefore    these  could  be  possible  avenues  for  direct  listing  by  select  NPOs.  However,  so  far 
these  avenues  have  not  been  utilized  by  Section  8  companies  apparently  due  to  their  inherent 
inability to provide financial return on investments.  SEBI will work out an appropriate regulatory 
framework  for  allowing  NPOs  (Trusts/  Societies)  to  raise  funds  through  issuance  of  zero 
coupon zero principal bonds which can also be utilized  by Section  8 companies.  
 
SEBI  will  continue  to  explore  other  instruments that shall be feasible for direct listing by NPOs 
and  create  enabling  regulatory  framework  incorporating  the  listing/eligibility  conditions  for 
NPOs along with reporting/disclosure  norms, compliance requirements/  penalty provisions. 
 
B. Activate and mainstream  already available  funding structures, i.e., SVFs and MFs 
 
SVF:  Under  the  current  SEBI  Alternative  Investment  Fund  (AIF)  guidelines,  one  sub-type  is 
SVFs, which have so far only been used for for-profit investments. However,  as per Regulations 
2(1)(v),  2(1)(u),  and  16(4)  of  SEBI’s  AIF  guidelines,  SVFs  can  also  function as  grants-in, grants-
out  vehicles  for  charitable  purposes.  This  has  not  been  commonly  understood,  with  the  result 
that no SVF is currently  being used for non-profit activity1.   
 
Further,  SVFs  can  be  more  than  just  grants-in,  grants-out  vehicles.  They  can  also  be  used  for 
Impact Bonds, especially where pooling of funders  and engagement of multiple NPOs  becomes 
necessary2.  A  separate recommendation (see  F below) addresses this possibility. In addition, CSR 
funds and foreign funds should be permitted to be deployed towards SVFs.   
 
MF:  This  will  operate  as  a  standard  MF,  with  the  exception  that  the  returns  generated  are 
channelled towards the financing of  NPOs. The returns will be considered as donations made by 
the  investors  to  NPOs.  Existing  asset  management  companies  can  play  this  role.  There  are 
already  a  few  examples  of  those  operating  currently,  such  as  Cancer  Fund  of  HDFC MF. The 
objective would be to mainstream these  structures  by raising  awareness3. 
 
The  SSE  should  actively create widespread awareness of the proposed new instrument, the  zero 
coupon  zero  principal  bonds,  and  also  promote  increased  use  of  the  already  available  funding 
structures  like  SVFs  and  MFs  for  NPOs,  thereby  enabling  access  to  additional  pools  of  capital 
for NPOs.  
 
C.  Implement  common  minimum  standards  for  reporting  on  social  impact  (please  see 
table in Annexure 2) 
 
Common minimum standards  for reporting on social impact  have been suggested for FPEs and 
NPOs. Impact is measured from the perspective of the beneficiary. This would help create some 
uniformity in impact reporting, which can support decision-making  for donors. 
 
D.  Implement  common  minimum standards for reporting on governance and financials: 
(please see table in Annexure 2)

The  suggested  framework  includes  general  information,  governance,  funding,  and  legal  and 
statutory  filings/reports. 
 
Currently, there are no appropriate financial reporting standards for  NPOs (except those that are 
Section  8  companies).  We  recommend  that  the  IRs  create  appropriate  standards  in  partnership 
with  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (ICAI)  so  that  NPOs  can  then  adhere  to 
these  standards.  SSEs  may  assist  and  coordinate  this  process.  These  new  standards  should  be 
developed  before  the  end  of  2020.  Any  NPO  that  lists  with  an  SSE  should  conform  to  these 
standards.  
 
E.  Develop new institutions that provide sector-level infrastructure   
 
The  SSE  should  also  play  a  key  role  in  ecosystem  building,  by  promoting  and  encouraging 
institutions  such  as the following: 
 

 

IRs, which are necessary because of the dire lack of robust information on  NPOs, unlike 
in  the  for-profit  sector.  IRs    would  work  on  enumeration  of  NPOs, their activities and 
areas  of  operation  as  well  as  for  standardization  and  verification  IRs  can  play  an 
important  role  in  building  confidence  in  NPOs  by  providing  credible  and  standardized 
information  about  them. They can also act as a “feeder” to the SSE by helping players on 
the  SSE  access  additional  opportunities  to  fund  high-quality  NPOs.  The  SSE  should 
encourage the setting up of a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) that will bring together 
existing  IRs  such  as  GuideStar,  DARPAN,  and  Credibility  Alliance,  for  meeting  the 
above ends. 
 

  Social  auditors,  which  will  perform  independent  verification  of  impact  reporting.  While 
in  the  immediate  term,  NPOs  need  only  self-report,  through  the  intermediate  term 
onwards,  social  auditors  can  take  over  this  function.  It  is  noted  that  social  auditors  will 
also have the capability  to evaluate  impact in a standardized way.  

 
We  expect  that  market forces will lead to the creation of a set of social auditors.  Based on how 
these  new  institutions  develop,  over  time  the  government  can  take  a  view  on  whether  a  more 
formal regulatory mechanism  for these  institutions  is required.  
 
F.  Enable new funding mechanisms: pay-for-success (social impact bonds; development 
impact bonds) 
 
Model 1: SVF, Pay-For-Success,  Risk  Investors 
Social/development  impact  bonds  (SIBs/DIBs),  which  can  be  brought  under  the  SVF, 
particularly  when  multiple  investors  and  multiple  NPOs  are  involved  in  a  single  project.  DIBs 
are  a  recent  financial  innovation  that  allow  private  investors  to  finance  social  services  provided 
by  NPOs.  The  investors  are  repaid  with  an  additional  return  by  outcome  funders  if  providers 
achieve  expected  social  outcomes,  but  lose  their  investment  if  providers  fail  to  meet  those 
outcomes. The DIBs can also be listed on the SSE.  
 
Model 2: Other, Pay-For-Success,  Lending Partners 
In the case of the social/development impact bond above, the lending partner bears some risk if 
the  promised  social  impact  is  not  created.  The  intermediary’s  role  is  to  choose  implementation 
agencies  (NPOs)  in  a  way  that  will  minimize  this  risk,  and  also  to  bear  some  risk  itself  by 
providing  first-loss  guarantees.  A  variation  of  this  structure  has  CSR  donors  playing the role of 
outcome funders. The intermediary here is a wealth manager.

G. Provide capacity building  support for reporting requirements 
 
To  support  NPOs  in  enhancing  reporting  capabilities, the SSE should set up a capacity-building 
fund that can bear some of the costs of increased reporting requirements. The fund will prioritise 
support  to  the  smaller  NPOs.  Contributions  to  the  fund  can  be  made  CSR-eligible.  For 
philanthropic  donors,  these  contributions  should  benefit  from  the  same  regulations/fiscal 
benefits  available under 80G, etc.   
 
H. Provide fiscal benefits (to NPOs and donors) 
 
The government may consider the  following recommendations  in respect of donors and NPOs: 
 
Donors 

  Retain  Section 80G in new tax structure. 
  Allow philanthropic donors to claim 100% tax exemption for their donations under 80G 
to  all  NPOs  that benefit from the SSE. Currently, donations to private  NPOs with 80G 
certification  can  get  only  50%  tax  deduction,  whereas  donations  to  government  entities 
are eligible for 100%. 

  Allow  all  investments  in  securities/  instruments  of  NPOs  listed  on  SSE  to  be  tax 

deductible.  

  Allow  corporates  to  deduct  CSR  expenditure  from  their  taxable  income.  Currently, 
companies  are  explicitly  barred  from  deducting  CSR  expenditure  from  their  taxable 
income4.  However,  when  companies  spend  on  certain  sectors  like  rural  development, 
skill  development,  agricultural  extension  projects  and  the  like,  such  expenditure  may 
qualify for tax exemption under the relevant provisions of the IT Act, 1961 5. This creates 
an  artificial  distinction  between  types  of  CSR  expenditure,  with  some  qualifying  for  tax 
exemption while others  do not.  

  Remove  the  10%  cap  on  income  eligible  for deduction under 80G, for donations to  all 
NPOs  that  benefit  from  the  SSE.  In  conversations  with  stakeholders,  this  restriction 
came up as a significant  barrier towards greater philanthropic  giving.   

  Allow first time retail investors (who are investing in the SSE for the first time) to avail a 
100%  tax  exemption  on  their  investments  in the SSE MF structure, subject to an overall 
limit of INR 1 Lakh. There is a precedent for this through the 80CCG section of the IT 
Act. 
 

NPOs 

  Enable fast-tracking of getting certifications for 12A, 12AA and 80G for all NPOs doing 

social and financial  reporting, as per the guidelines  outlined in chapter 3. 
Note:  In  time,  the  minimum  reporting  standard,  as  it  becomes  more  rigorous  and 
sophisticated,  should entirely  replace the 12A, 12AA, 80G certifications  process. 

  Re-evaluate  the  current  budget  proposal  to  make  renewal  of  registration  under  80G 
periodic.  Any eligibility assessment for 80G  may be conducted at the time of registration 
itself.  Given  that  the  annual  loss  of revenue on account of 80G is only INR 2516 crore, 
the  loss  of  revenue  on account of fake donations would be far lesser 6. This would likely

be  much  lesser  than  the  administrative cost incurred due to the periodic re-evaluation of 
80G. 
Increase  the  limits  under  the  IT  Act  on  charitable  institutions  raising  funds  from 
commercial or semi-commercial activities to 50% from the current 20%. This would help 
NPOs become more sustainable.   

 
I. Fine-tune regulations to unlock more funds 
 
The government may consider the following recommendations in respect of CSR and FCRA: 
 
CSR (for full list,  please see the main report)7: 

  Allow funding to NPOs on SSE to count towards CSR commitments of companies.   
  The  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs  (MCA)  may  authorize  the  trading  of  CSR  spends 
between  companies  with  excess CSR-spends and those with deficit CSR-spends, and the 
SSE can provide a platform for this  purpose.  

  To  enable  the  pay-for-success  funding  structure  that  uses  CSR  grants  for  outcome 
funding  purposes,  the  following  changes  may be made in section 135 of the Companies 
Act, dealing with CSR: 

o  Allow  CSR  capital  to be parked into an escrow account for a period of 3 years. 
At  the  end  of  the  3-year  time  period,  the  capital  in  the  CSR  escrow  account 
should be liquidated and spent as per the Companies Act schedule VII within the 
subsequent  financial  year. 

o  Allow  accelerator  grant  to  the  NPO  up  to  10%  of  the  program  cost  (in  case 
outcomes  are  exceeded)  to  be  counted  as CSR expenditure. Such a grant would 
fund non-programmatic expenditure such  as research,  capacity building, etc. 

o  The board and management of the corporate providing CSR funds should not be 

related to the  NPO to avoid conflict  of interest. 

 
Foreign Contribution (Regulation)  Act (FCRA) 

  Clarify  rule  4  of  the  FCR  Rules,  2011,  to  enable  foreign  entities  to invest in SVFs listed 
on  the  SSE,  as  the  donors  will  not  be  taking  decisions/have  any  discretion  on 
deployment  of  their  funds  to  specific  NPOs8.  These  decisions  will  be  taken  by  SEBI-
regulated  Indian  fund  managers  and  will  therefore  be  easier  for  the  government  to 
monitor  as  they  will  have  to  conform  to  the  Information  Memorandum  to  be  made 
public.  

 
Alternative  Investment  Fund (AIF)  regulations   
 

  Lowering of existing  minimum thresholds  for SVFs could be suitably examined by SEBI. 

 
1.4.2  Summary of recommendations  for FPEs  

FPEs will use the SSE to raise equity capital. They will, therefore, list on the SSE, which will be a 
segment  of  an  existing  high-turnover  stock  exchange  such  as  the  BSE  and/or NSE. The equity 

                                              
7 The main report also discusses in detail how our CSR recommendations may be viewed in light of the recently 
released Draft CSR Policy Amendment Rules 2020 (http://feedapp.mca.gov.in/csr/) 
8 R. 4 of the FCRR, 2011 prohibits ‘any activity or investment that has an element of risk of appreciation or depreciation of the 
original investment, linked to market forces, including investment in mutual funds or in shares’. This requires a clarification, as it 
may prevent foreign entities from participating in SVFs.

instruments will be tradeable. Listing criteria will apply for  FPEs, just as they apply for for-profit 
conventional  enterprises  who  list  on  the  main  board  of  the  BSE  or  NSE.  However,  there  is  a 
critical  difference  between  for-profit  social  enterprises  (FPEs)  and  for-profit  conventional 
enterprises  –  the  former  will  also  be  performing  social  impact  reporting  according  to  the 
minimum  reporting  standard  outlined  in  the  report.    In  other  words,  FPEs  will  have  to 
demonstrate that they are in the  business of “creating positive social impact”. This will enable them to 
access  a kind of capital that conventional  for-profit enterprises  do not have access to. 
 
Further,  association  of  FPEs with SSE must not be based only on self-reporting. To ensure that 
only  bonafide  FPEs  are  able  to  associate  with  SSE,  SEBI,  in  consultation  with  the  existing 
specialist  entities,  should  work  out  a  mechanism  for  assessing  credentials  of  the  social  impact 
dimensions  self-declared by the FPEs.    
 
FPEs  will also be able to raise funds using funding structures such as SVFs. In order to kickstart 
activity  on  the  SSE  for  FPEs,  we  recommend  tax  incentives  to  investors  (such  as  exemptions 
from  the  Security  Transactions  Tax  and  Long  Term  Capital  Gains  Tax)  and  tax  relief to FPEs 
(for  5  years).  Futher,  the  reference  to  “muted  returns”  in  the  current  SVF  guidelines  needs  to  be 
revisited as the term is misleading  and a deterrent for investment.   
 
1.4.3  SSE for Covid19 

The  SSE  is  uniquely  poised  to  become  an  important  component  of  India’s  policy  response  to 
Covid19.  As  just  one  example,  the  recommendations  to revitalize SVFs by expanding the pools 
of  source  capital  and 
innovating  new  structures  will  substantially  multiply  the  funding 
opportunities  for  the social sector. A Covid19 Aid Fund can be set up to  activate solutions such 
as:  
 
(a)  Pay-for-success  bonds  with philanthropic foundations, CSR spenders and impact investors as 
outcome  funders  and  domestic  banks,  Non  Banking  Financial  Corporations  (NBFCs)  and 
impact investors  as lenders 
 
(b)  Structured  pooled 
philanthropic  foundations, CSR contributions,  and impact investors  as junior lenders 
 
Such  solutions  can  fund  the  NPO-provided  relief  needed  by  migrant  workers,  and  offer  loan 
guarantees  to  NBFC-Microfinance  Institutions  (NBFC-MFIs)  so  that  these  instritutions  may  be 
able to extend  debt moratoriums to their downstream borrowers.  
 
1.4.4  Advancing the frontier of social finance 

loans  with  domestic  banks  and  NBFCs  as  senior  lenders,  and 

Other  jurisdisctions like Brazil, South Africa, Canada, UK and Singapore also have SSEs, but the 
SSE we envision  for India is a significant  step forward from these other models because it:   
 
(a)  Provides  a  comprehensive  solution  for  both  FPEs  and  NPOs, instead of catering to one of 
these  categories in isolation   
 
(b) Goes beyond pure matchmaking/discovery to: 

Institutionalization  of  a common standard for reporting 

 
  Open up avenues  for direct listing  and streamlining  funding mechanisms  for NPOs 
 

Innovation   of new funding instruments  and funding structures  and  

 

14 

  The encouragement  and  development of an ecosystem to support the growth of social 

finance

2  The Imperative And The Opportunity 

2.1  The rationale for a Social Stock Exchange (SSE) 

The  rationale  for  an  SSE  is  multipronged.  Most  importantly,  the  public  provision  of  essential 
services  can  be  further  improved,  and  private  sector  and non-profit sector  provision can play a 
significant  role  in  closing  the gap.  The SSE is meant to serve these private  and non-profit sector 
providers  by  channeling  greater  capital  to  them.  To  take just three examples  – education, health 
and  agriculture  –  the  potential  of  high-quality  private  and  non-profit  sector  led  provision 
becomes obvious.  
 
The  Human  Development  Index,  which  brings  together  the  three  dimensions  of  education, 
health  and 
income  to  produce  a  comprehensive  measure  of  a  country’s  development 
achievements,  ranks  India  129  among  189  countries  for  the  year 20199. It is clear that India can 
benefit  greatly  from  more  funding  to  the  social  sector,  which  cares  explicitly  about  creating 
sizeable  and  measurable  impact.  This  will  support  the  government  in  achieving  its  sector 
development outcomes.   
 
2.2  Private funding for the social sector 

The  universe  of  enterprises  that  create  social  impact  is  vast  and  consists  of  a  variety  of  legal 
forms.  These  can  broadly  be  categorized  into  for-profit  enterprises  or  FPEs  (which  include 
companies  registered  under  the  Companies  Act,  sole  proprietorships,  partnership  firms,  HUFs 
and  limited  liability  partnerships)  and  NPOs(which  include  Section  8  companies,  trusts  and 
societies).  The  key  difference  between  these  two  categories is that they source different kinds of 
capital.  Specifically,  FPEs can raise equity  while NPOs cannot10.  
 
According  to  a  2019  Bain  &  Company  report,  philanthropic  funding  from  individuals  is  the 
“brightest  spot”  among  private  funding  for  the social sector. While overall private funding for the 
social  sector  grew  by  15%  p.a.  from  INR  40,000  crore  in  2014  to  INR  70,000  crore  in 2018, 
philanthropic  funding  saw  the  highest  growth at 21% p.a. and constituted about 63% of private 
funding  in  2018  (the  remainder  27%  was  almost  equally  split  between  foreign  sources  and 
Corporate Social Responsibility  (CSR) funding by domestic corporations)11.   
 
According  to  a  2019  OECD  report,  much of the philanthropic funding in India focuses on the 
sectors  of  health,  education,  water  supply  and  sanitation12.  In  all  these  areas,  the  report  claims, 
there  are  clear  opportunities  for  collaborative  efforts  between  multiple  sources  of  funding 
(domestic  philanthropy,  international  philanthropy,  domestic  CSR,  public  funding,  and  Official 
Development  Assistance)  to  achieve  impact  at  scale  and  especially  in  states  and  among 
populations that are not currently  being served.  
 
Whereas  the  philanthropic  landscape  in  India  has  been  mapped  and  studied  in  some  detail,  the 
same  kind  of exercise is more difficult to perform for  non-profit organizations (NPOs). Part of

10 Equity is a residual claim for the owner, i.e., it is a claim on profits. This means that the owners of an FPE can 
reasonably expect some financial gain. NPOs do not generate profits and therefore cannot issue equity. A caveat 
here is that Section 8 companies are allowed to organize on a share basis, and therefore can issue equity. However, 
the shares do not represent a residual claim on the Section 8 company’s profits, as the law prevents dividends from 
being paid out to shareholders.

the  reason is their sheer number. According to a 2012  government estimate, India has at least 31 
lakh  NPOs13,  more  than  double  the  number  of  schools  and  250  times  the  number  of 
government hospitals,  amounting to about one NPO for every 400 Indians14.   
 
Part of the reason is also the variety of activities that NPOs are engaged in, making it difficult to 
capture  their  work  within  a  common  framework  of  assessment.  GiveIndia,  a  platform  that 
certifies  and  connects  NPOs  to  funders,  reports  eight  different  causes  served  by  the  NPOs  it 
works  with:  children,  differently  abled,  education,  elderly,  livelihoods,  health,  women  and  the 
environment15.  Measuring  social  impact  cannot  be  easily  standardized  across these very different 
arenas of activity.   
 
The  difficulties  of  measuring  outcomes  have,  in  practice,  been  overcome  to  some  extent  by 
funding  platforms such as GiveIndia and GuideStar. These platforms have created processes for 
certifying  and  registering  NPOs,  and  this  has  led,  in  turn,  to  the  innovation  of  new  kinds  of 
financial  instruments  designed  to  incentivize  social  change  and  economic  development.  The 
domain of impact investing  represents  this  space of innovation.   
 
As  of  2018,  50%  of  the  impact  investors  in  India  had  invested an average of US $20 million16. 
75%  of  impact  investments  were  in  pure  equity  instruments,  17% in pure debt instruments, and 
the remainder in equity,  debt and blended instruments17.   
 
The  primary  sector  destinations  have  been  financial  inclusion,  education,  agriculture  and  health. 
Impact  investing  enthusiasts  are  especially  bolstered  by  the  returns  that  these  investments  have 
garnered,  with  more  than  67%  of  investors  surveyed  by  the  Brookings  Foundation  reporting 
returns  higher  than  “market”  (meaning  the  BSE  Sensex,  where  the  return  is  assumed  to  be 
12.5%),  and  42%  stating  that  their  returns  were  higher  than  20%,  albeit  mainly  from  the 
microfinance  sector18. 
 
2.3  Much more remains to be done 

Despite the tremendous growth of private sector  and non-profit sector  participation in the social 
sector,  India  still faces a significant challenge in meeting the  2030 deadline for the UN-mandated 
Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).  The  2019  Bain  &  Company  report  on  philanthropy 
states that India alone accounts for more than 20% of the world performance gap in 10 of the 17 
SDGs  and  more  than  10%  of  the  gap  in another 6. This translates into a funding gap of about 
INR 4.2 lakh crore annually  for meeting only 5 of the 17 SGDs by 2030.  
 
The  enormous  funding  and  performance  gaps  are  only  symptoms,  however.  These  gaps  are 
ultimately rooted in deeper realities of the Indian social sector that require careful thought as well 
as action.   
 
Most  importantly,  the  effectiveness  of  NPOs  is  contingent  on  adequate  funding.  Funding  itself 
is,  however,  contingent  on  the demonstration of impact or outcomes. Unfortunately, there is no 
good vocabulary for talking about social impact and no single workhorse framework for impact

assessment.  This  again  is  due  to  the  very  heterogeneous  activities  and  goals  that  N POs  are 
engaged  in  and  pursue.  While  there  is  a  conspicuous  absence  of  any  universally  applicable 
framework  for  social  impact  measurement,  funders  may  at  least  expect  information  about 
operating  practices  (expecially  financial  reporting  and  governance  structures)  and  some  basic 
indicators  of  social  impact  created.  Even  this  is  often  unavailable,  and  hence  the  need  for 
certification  and registration  by organizations  such  as GiveIndia and GuideStar.   
 
At  present,  India  has  a  number  of  conduits  through  which  the  social  sector  receives  funding. 
These  are  both  new  (CSR,  Impact  investing,  Socially Responsible Investing or SRI, etc.) and old 
(philanthropy,  government  agencies,  etc.)  and  they  work  to  varying  degrees  of  effectiveness. 
Enabling  these  diverse  channels  to  come  together  on  a  common  platform  and  introducing 
uniform  frameworks  in  reporting,  measurement  and  standards  can  represent  an  important  step 
forward in development of this  sector.   This is where the SSE has a big role to play. 
 
2.4  The idea of an SSE 

This  report  takes the view that the SSE is a set of processes  as much as it is a place. This means 
that  the SSE is not only a place where securities or other funding structures (as described in later 
chapters)  are  “listed”  but  also  a  set  of  procedures  that  act  as  a  filter,  selecting-in  only  those 
entities that are creating measurable social impact and reporting such impact.  The working group 
believes  that  only  by  taking  such a holistic view of the SSE can we hope to address the issue of 
the  funding  gap  that  this  mechanism  is  expected  to  solve.The  SSE  shall  be  a  separate  segment 
under the existing stock exchanges. 
 
As  such,  the  measurement  of  social  impact  and  the  activity  of  social  reporting  must  be 
institutionalized  and  mainstreamed  for  socially  conscious  investors  to  want  to  participate  in  the 
social  sector.  We  recommend  that  both  FPEs  and  NPOs  are  subject  to  a  common  minimum 
standard  of reporting social impact, and operating practices (governance and financial reporting). 
While both FPEs and NPOs are concerned with social impact, the type of funding avenues open 
to  them  are  fundamentally  different given the nature of their legal structures and expectations of 
their  “fund  providers”.  As  such,  our  recommendations  for them are distinct and treated as such in 
different chapters.   
 
No new legal structure will need to be created for social enterprises (whether FPEs or NPOs) to 
conform  to.  Rather,  a  declaration  to  intent  to  create  social  impact  and  a  commitment  to 
measuring  and  reporting  such  impact  is  key  to  identifying  a  social  enterprise.  In  time,  the 
reporting  standard  will evolve to higher levels of rigour, sophistication and differentiation, but in 
the  immediate  term,  the  SSE  will  derive  much  of its momentum from the laying out of a clear 
and transparent  process for reporting social impact.    
 
We  expect  an  ecosystem  of  agencies  to  develop overtime for doing independent verification of 
above mentioned social impact reporting; however to ensure that only bonafide FPEs are able to 
associate  with  SSE,  SEBI,  in  consultation  with  the  existing  specialist  entities,  should  work  out a 
mechanism  for  assessing  credentials  of  the  social  impact  dimensions  self-declared  by  the  FPEs. 
This  is  crucial  to  identify  and  allow only the true FPEs, that are genuinely creating social impact, 
to be associated  with SSE. 
 
Many investors and investees see the standardization of procedures as a key outcome of the SSE. 
In  a  2019  survey  conducted  by  the  ATE  Chandra  Foundation  and  Sattva  Consulting,  various 
classes  of  investors  (high-  and  ultra-high  net  worth  individuals, corporate foundations, domestic 
foundations,  global  foundations  and CSR actors) were asked to identify the potential benefits of 
an  SSE.  Better  understanding  of  their  work  –  meaning the filing of detailed financial statements

investees,  the  design  of  compliance  metrics,  the  identification  and  appointment  of 
by 
independent  impact  evaluators,  and  a  standardized  framework  for  impact  measurement  – 
emerged  as  a  key  demand  from  this  group 19.  Additionally,  the  group appeared to agree on the 
necessity  of  developing  new  kinds  of  financial  instruments  and  of  treating  non-profits  and for-
profits differently.

3  A Minimum  Reporting Standard 

3.1  Defining a social enterprise 

In  the  last  few  decades,  investors  have  responded  to  increasing  signs  of  social  and  ecological 
degradation  with  concern  and  a  positive  intention to change things for the better. As a start, the 
performance  evaluations  of  companies  began  incorporating,  along  with  financial  performance, 
their impact on people and the environment, and this came to be known as the “triple bottom-line” 
approach  to  reporting.  The  turn  initially  was  to  move  towards  limiting  harm  through  the 
adoption  of  investment  frameworks  that  negatively  screened  out  companies  that  did  not  meet 
certain  thresholds.  But  soon  after,  efforts  came  to  focus  on  positive  goals.  Thus,  the  ESG, for 
instance,  opts-in  companies  that  go  beyond  limiting  harm  towards  creating  positive  impacts 
along the three  dimensions:  E (Environment),  S (Social)  and G (Governance)  .  
 
While the work of addressing social problems has had a much longer history in India, the advent 
of SDGs provides a new frame for the articulation of social and ecological problems20. This has 
created a call to action among both organizations and entrepreneurs who wish to serve the social 
sector, and investors  who wish to actively  fund them.  
 
What  is being envisioned is  a new kind of capital or a new kind of finance that expects “returns” 
beyond  the  purely  financial,  with  social  return  being  as  or  more important than financial return. 
Conventional  capitalist  enterprises,  even  if  they  are  to  bear  the  burden of being “responsible”, are 
not expected to conform to this  more refined standard of scrutiny.   
 
The  definition  of  a  social  enterprise  would,  therefore,  seek  to  select  a  class  or  category  of 
enterprises  that  are  engaging  in  the  business  of  “creating  positive  social  impact”.  With  this  in  mind, 
we recommend a minimum reporting standard that brings out this aspect clearly, by requiring all 
social  enterprises,  whether  they  are  FPEs  or  NPOs,  to  state  an  intent  to  create  positive  social 
impact,  to  describe  the  nature  of  the  impact  they  wish  to  create,  and  to  report the impact that 
they  have  created.  There  will  be  an  additional  requirement  for  FPEs  to  conform  to  the 
assessment  mechanism to be developed by SEBI. 
 
Therefore,  for  us,  an  enterprise  is  “social”  not  by  virtue  of  satisfying  a  legal  definition  but  by 
virtue  of  committing  to  the  minimum  reporting  standard.  We  should  note,  however,  that  even 
enterprises who do not state “impact” as their primary objective can create meaningful and lasting 
social  impact.  Thus,  according  to  Jeremy  Nicholls,  chief  executive  of  the  Social  Return  On 
Investment  (SROI)  Network,  “all  organizations  regardless  of  their aims and objectives have an impact, and 
so,  for  the  non-initiated,  impact  isn’t  and  cannot  be  something  unique  to  social  purpose  organizations  or  their 
investors”21.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  the  working  group  has  refrained  from  introducing  a 

                                              
20 To a large extent, ‘limiting harm’ is coded in each country’s legislations and regulations around human rights, child 
rights and juvenile justice, consumer protection, labour laws and fair compensation and equal remuneration, 
women’s rights, forest rights, and so on. Different countries have varying levels of these protections in place. Work 
is needed to improve these protections, and therefore, the minimum threshold for a particular outcome may vary 
across countries. For instance, taking care  to dispose effluents safely might already be in the law in some countries 
and so a company that does this cannot position itself as being environmentally conscious in that country but 
practising this in another country can attract ‘social’ investment because it is creating social impact compared to its 
peers in that country. Hence the need for internationally set standards such as the SDGs that go beyond country-
specific standards.  The Impact Management Project for instance, permits outcome thresholds to be a nationally or 
internationally agreed standard.

legal  definition  for  a  social  enterprise.  Rather,  it  envisions  a  future  where  more  enterprises 
incorporate  impact  into  their  operating  approaches  and  strategy  while  enjoying  the  freedom  to 
structure  their  legal form in a way that works best for them.   
 
3.2  Measuring social impact  

Requiring  that  a  social  enterprise  create  positive  social  impact  goes  further  than  requiring 
“responsible  corporate  behaviour”  or  “good  corporate  citizenship”.  Therefore  the  measurement  of  social 
impact  must  go beyond monitoring the behaviour of corporates, which frameworks like SEBI’s 
Business  Responsibility  Reporting  Framework  (BRRF)  aim  to  do.  Such  frameworks  are 
inadequate  when  thinking  of  social  impact  in  a  broader  sense  since  they  prioritize  profit 
maximization  while  treating positive social impact as a by-product. Our approach is to  prioritize 
social impact by adopting  a “beneficiary lens”, and raise the bar for what it means to be a true social 
enterprise.   

Social  impact  from  a  beneficiary’s perspective  is inherently difficult to measure because it cannot 
be  readily  expressed  in  monetary  terms.  This  does  not,  however,  imply  that  all  forms of social 
impact  are  equally  difficult  to  measure  or  that  efforts  to  standardize  the  measurement of social 
impact  are  bound  to  fail.  Professor  Alnoor  Ebrahim  notes,  for  instance,  that "delivering emergency 
relief  and  basic  services  in  sanitation,  water,  and  housing  is  easier  to measure than impact on public policy or on 
good  governance,  freedom,  and  rights.  Societal  transformation—such  as  improving  human  rights  or  democratic 
conditions—involve  multiple  actors  and  causal  mechanisms  that  are  still  poorly  understood.”  In  such cases,  he 
recommends  that  ‘it  can  still  be  useful  to  try  to  measure  what  an  organization  is  doing  and  whether  its 
strategies are working to influence  societal change.  22” 
 
When  thinking  about  how  to  measure  social  impact,  we  have  three  decades  of  international 
experience  to  fall  back  on,  and  a  study  of  this  experience  indicates  that  the  standardization  of 
social  impact  measurement  is  a  process  of  discovery  via  iteration  and  progressive  refinement. 
This process of discovery has both uncovered the challenges of measuring social impact and also 
sought  to  overcome  these  challenges  in  numerous  ways.  We  describe  all  of  this  experience and 
its many lessons  in Annexure  1 of this  report.  
 
After taking stock of the myriad frameworks described in Annexure 1 and the various challenges 
of  measuring  social  impact  in  a  standardized  manner,  we have concluded that  it will take a few 
more years to evolve a standardised framework  that could apply to  all FPEs and NPOs in India 
that seek to raise funds through SSE. Operationalising any framework also requires an ecosystem 
of  players  who  will  implement  that framework. Only a fledgling ecosystem exists in India today 
and there is a long journey ahead to mainstreaming  the  measurement of social impact.   
 
The minimum reporting standard outlined in our report  is a step in that direction. It is mandated 
from  day  1  of the SSE’s launching for all social enterprises, FPEs as well as NPOs, that wish to 
benefit from the SSE.  
 
The  minimum  reporting  standard  is  envisioned to grow in rigour, approaching the desired ideal 
state of widespread standardized impact measurement and impact reporting.

3.3  A minimum reporting standard for FPEs and NPOs in India 

We  present  the  details  of  the  minimum  reporting  standard  in  Annexure  2  to  this  report.  The 
standard has been created by  benchmarking elements from various frameworks of measurement 
that  have  been  developed  and  are  being  deployed  (UNDP,  Omidyar  Network  India,  Asha 
Impact,  SELCO/IIMA,  SRS,  IMP  –  see  Annexure  1 for details). The following figure captures 
the main elements  of this reporting standard.   
 

Figure 3.1: The minimum reporting standard for the immediate term 

 

 
While  recognising  that  creating  a  uniform  framework  for  reporting  across  the  diverse  range  of 
social enterprises in operation is difficult, we believe that the above framework does a fair job of 
capturing  the  performance  of these diverse organisations in a robust manner, while ensuring that 
the measurement  requirements  are practical  and implementable for such  organisations. 
 
The  work  of  ensuring  that  the  minimum  reporting  standard  is  met  by  all social enterprises  that 
wish  to  raise  funds  on  the  SSE  will  fall  largely  on  the  SSE  itself.  We  make  a  specific  policy 
recommendation  in  Chapter  6  for  how  this  could  become  possible,  through  the  means  of  a 
capacity  building  fund  that  will  create  an  ecosystem  of  social  auditors  and  information 
repositories  (IRs).  This  will  help  social  enterprises  do  the  reporting.  We  also  allow  for  the 
possibility  that  many  social  enterprises,  and  especially  many  of  the smaller NPOs, may not have 
the  financial  capacity  to  do the minimum reporting, and we make a specific recommendation in 

 

22 

Chapter  6  that  the  capacity  building  fund  can  pick  up  some  of  the  costs  of reporting for such 
social enterprises,  especially  in the  immediate term.  
 
It  is  expected  that  the  above  approach  to  reporting  will  build  confidence/comfort  among 
investors, greatly expand the scope and depth of participation, and bring to the market a kind of 
convening  capacity that is especially  needed in the early days for take-off.  
 
3.4  The pathway to comprehensive social impact measurement and reporting  

The  minimum  reporting  standard  is  to  be  enforced  in  the  immediate  term.  Over  time,  the 
reporting  requirements can begin to incorporate more rigour in a graded and deliberate manner. 
We  envision  an ideal end-state and a pathway to that end-state over an  intermediate term of 4-7 
years. Annexure  3 lays out such a pathway. The key aspects are:  
 
(a)  Clearer  and  more  refined  statements  of intent to create social impact (offering more specific 
details  of  who  the  social  enterprise  is  looking  to  impact,  what  the  intervention  is,  and  how the 
intervention  is expected to create the desired impact) 
 
(b)More  rigorous  assessments  of  the  social  impact  that  is  being  created  (along  the  reach, depth 
and inclusion  dimensions)  and more graded evaluations  arising therefrom 
 
(c)  A  greater  shift  towards  outcomes-oriented  measurement  in  place  of  inputs-  and  outputs-
oriented  measurement,  especially  for  those  NPOs  that  are  looking  to  create  social  impact  at 
longer horizons  than  a year 
 
(d)  A  gradual  shift  towards  articulating  the  sector-level  or  policy-level  impact  of  the  social 
enterprise’s  activities 
 
(e) More granular disclosures  of governance  mechanisms  and financial  operations 
 
While  in  the  immediate  term,  NPOs  need  only  self-report  and FPEs, in addition, will also have 
to  pass  through  the  assessment  mechanism  to  be  developed  by  SEBI; through the intermediate 
term  onwards,  social  auditors  can  be  required  to do independent verification of such reporting. 
We  expect  an  ecosystem  of  such  firms  to  develop  over  time.  Many  large  audit  firms  already 
possess  some  expertise  in  the  sustainability  reporting  and  advisory  domains23.  There  are  also 
other entities which specialise in research on ESG topics with a corporate focus24. Newer players 
can  also  enter  this  arena,  to  help  social  enterprises  self-report,  and  to  innovate  new  grading  or 
rating  capabilities  with  regard  to  the  various components of the reporting framework. Some of 
the new actors in this  arena would also need to possess impact evaluation  capabilities.   
 
Given that the social sector is still early in its development, we do not recommend the immediate 
creation  of  a  regulator  for  social  enterprises,  for  social  reporting  or  for  social  auditors.  We 
expect,  rather,  that  the  evolving  reporting  standard  will  gain  more  traction  with  time,  and  the 
government  can,  in  4-7  years,  assess  the  need  for  a  new  regulator  depending  on  whether  the 
sector can potentially benefit from more regulatory clarity and supervisory powers. The SSE and

the  instruments  listed  directly  on  the  SSE  will  fall  under  SEBI’s  purview  but  the  NPOs  and 
wider  ecosystem  are  outside  SEBI’s  remit  and  therefore  in  the  immediate  term  as  well  as  the 
future, other regulatory bodies will need to pitch in. 
 
IRs  are  needed  because  there  is  a  dire  lack  of  robust  information  on  NPOs,  unlike  in  the for-
profit  sector.  Although  some  intermediaries  do provide information on  NPOs, this information 
covers  only  a  small  fraction  of all NPOs. Nevertheless, these intermediaries  can start functioning 
as IRs for the SSE in the  immediate term. For example, GuideStar India is an IR of NPOs with a 
searchable  database  on  the  information  collected  from  them. DARPAN is a platform managed 
by  the  NITI  Aayog  that  aggregates  self-declared  information  on  over  87,000  different  NPOs. 
Credibility  Alliance  is  a  consortium  of  Voluntary  Organizations  (VOs)  committed  towards 
enhancing  the quality  of governance  in the voluntary sector through disclosures. 
 
The  IRs  would  perform  the  functions  of    enumeration  (listing  of  active  NPOs  and  their 
activities),  standardization  (articulating  a  standard  reporting  format  for  NPOs  and  helping them 
to  do  information  reporting),  and  verification  (due  diligence).  One  aspect  of  standardization 
would  be  to  articulate  a  common set of financial  reporting standards for NPOs. Currently such 
standards  do  not  exist,  except  for  Section  8  companies,  and therefore, we recommend that the 
existing  IRs,  with  the  help  of  SSEs,  consult  with  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accounts  of  India 
(ICAI) to come up with a set of common standards for all NPOs by the end of 2020, which may 
be utilized for revising the overall reporting format and deciding entry norms in the intermediate 
term Any NPO that lists  with an SSE should conform to these  standards 
 
We  recommend  that  in  the  immediate  term,  the  SSE  encourage  the  setting  up  of  a  Self-
Regulatory  Organization  (SRO)  that  will  bring  together  existing  IRs  such  as  GuideStar, 
DARPAN, and Credibility Alliance,  for meeting the above ends.

4  Non-Profit Organizations 

4.1  Background 

NPOs  take  a  variety  of  legal  forms  such  as  societies,  trusts  and  not-for-profit  companies25.  All 
NPOs must be registered under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act and file income tax returns. 
Upon  assessment of these returns, an entity is granted tax-exempt status for a particular year.  An 
NPO can extend tax deduction to its donors upon approval under Section  80G of the  IT Act.  
 
About  70%  of  funding  for  these  organisations  comes  from  four  sources:  individual  donations, 
contributions  made  under  the  Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA),  CSR grants, 
and  grants  availed  from  government  schemes.  However,  the  beneficiaries  of  these  forms  of 
funding  have  typically  been  the large NPOs in different sectors.  As of 2018, there  were only 1.8 
lakh  institutions  who  had  registered and claimed tax exemption status. Among  them, only about 
12%  had  obtained  FCRA  funding,  and  only  11%  had  obtained  CSR  funding.  The  number  is 
even  lower  for  grants  from  government  schemes26.  While  there  are  eligibility  requirements  that 
govern  access  to  these  institutional  sources  of  funds,  access  to  capital,  even for entities who are 
eligible,  remains a key concern for much of the  sector.   
 
Furthermore,  donations  to  NPOs  from  institutional  sources  (that  are  not  tax-deductible)  are 
typically permitted to be spent only towards programs, as a safeguard against their misuse. Non-
program costs such as rent, utilities, staff training, research, etc. have to be borne by NPOs from 
internal  resources.  This  has  produced the so-called “starvation cycle”, constraining NPOs’ ability to 
invest  in essential  organisational  infrastructure  and impeding their growth27.  
 
In general, raising funds from tax-exempt donations  is an attractive option  as this offers a source 
of  funding  without  stringent  restrictions  on  non-programmatic  spends.  However,  being  smaller 
in  size  and  spread  over  multiple  individual  donors,  these  donations  are  difficult  to  source  and 
sustain.  Enabling  structures  with  an  intermediary  to  help  aggregate  donations  from  multiple 
individual  donors  could  be  an  innovative  solution  that  can  provide  an  important  source  of 
funding. 
 
The SSE will enable the routing of grants and donations to NPOs in a variety of ways. But it will 
go  further,  in  also  enabling  the  routing  of  risk  capital  to  NPOs.  This  chapter  describes  the 
possibilities  in  terms  of  a  distinction  between  instruments  (Section  2)  that  do  not  require 
pooling, and structures  (Section  3) that do require pooling and therefore intermediaries. 
 
4.2  Funding instruments  

By  law,  NPOs  face  restrictions  on  their  ability  to    issue  debt,    equity  and  units.  A  notable 
exception  is  Section  8  companies  that  can  organize  on  a  share  basis  but  these  shares  are  not 
residual  claims  on  profits  as  Section  8  companies  cannot  pay  dividends  to  shareholders.  There 
are  no  regulatory  hurdles  in  listing  such  shares  or  debt  instruments  of Section 8 companies  and 
therefore  these  could  be  possible  avenues  for  direct  listing  by  select  NPOs28.  However,  so  far

these  avenues  have  not  been  utilized  by  Section  8  companies  apparently  due  to  their  inherent 
inability  to provide financial  return  on investments.   
 
Trusts and societies are not body corporates under the Companies Act, and hence,  in the present 
legal  framework,  any  bonds  or  debentures  issued  by  them cannot qualify as  securities under the 
Securities  Contracts (Regulation)  Act 1956 (SCRA)29.  
 
It  is  noted  that,  since  most  NPOs  are  not  revenue-generating,  it  is  not  clear  how  they  would 
issue  conventional  debt  securities  or  units.It  is  easier  to  imagine  that  they  will  use  funding 
structures  that  produce  debt  securities  or  units,  as  exist  already  in  practice,  but  these  structures 
are typically  intermediated. 
 
Despite  the  above  shortcomings,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  to  unlock  funds  from  donors, 
philanthropic  foundations  and  CSR  spenders, in the form of zero coupon zero principal bonds. 
These  bonds  will  be  listed  on  the  SSE.  They  will  carry  a  tenure  equal  to  the  duration  of  the 
project that is being funded, and at tenure, they will be written off the investee’s books. The zero 
coupon  zero  principal  bond  is  particularly  well  suited  to  investors  who  are  looking  to  create 
social  impact  but  do  not  wish  to  have  their  funds  returned  to  them.  However, such bonds are 
not  without  risk, as there is no guarantee that the social impact that an NPO is promising will in 
fact  be  created.  Accordingly,  investors  will  be  keen  to  channel  funds  only  to  credible  and 
legitimate  NPOs,  which  the  SSE  will  ensure  by  requiring  beneficiary  NPOs  to  report  on social 
impact  in  a  standardized  format.  NPOs  can  also  signal  their  credibility  and  legitimacy  to 
investors/  funders  by  registering  with  IRs,  although  such  registration  may  not  be  mandated.  
Furthermore, investors in zero coupon zero principal bonds may also be awarded a tax benefit to 
incentivize  their participation  in this  instrument.   
 
The feasibility  of introduction  of such bonds, their  exact modalities,  entry norms, regulatory 
framework, reporting/ disclosure  norms, compliance requirement/  penalty  provisions  etc may 
be worked out by the stock exchanges  and SEBI.   
 
SEBI  will  continue  to  explore  other  instruments that shall be feasible for direct listing by NPOs 
and  create  enabling  regulatory  framework  incorporating  the  listing/eligibility  conditions  for 
NPOs along with reporting/disclosure  norms, compliance requirements/  penalty provisions. 
 
The  demonstration  of  achieved  impact  will  also  benefit  the  NPO  for  future  rounds  of  fund 
raising  at  the  SSE,  whether through this route or through the funding structures  described in the 
next section.   
 
                                                                                                                                              
very few NPOs use this provision. For Michigan, see: https://hirzellaw.com/the-michigan-nonprofit-corporat ion -
act/, while for Pennsylvania, see: https://law.justia.com/codes/pennsylvania/2014/title-15/chap t er-57/s ect io n -
5752/. Further, a large humanitarian NPO in France, ACTED, has inssued “charity shares”, also called  As s o ciat ive 
Titles  and  Participatory  Titles,  except  that  these  instruments  are  tradeable,  and  could  have  a  component  of 
redemption at the discretion of the issuer. Aside from this, there appears to be little inform ation about these shares .

29 In the existing regulatory framework for AIFs, Mutual Funds, REITs and InvITs  it is noted that these entities are 
set up as Trusts. However, the assets of such Trusts are securities, bearing financial returns which are marketable 
instruments. Therefore, units issued by such Trusts to represent the beneficial interest of its members (investors) are 
also marketable instruments. For a Trust which is set up for purposes other than to man age the funds of its 
members by investing the same in securities, for e.g. undertake charitable work, the units issued, if any, to repres en t  
the  beneficial  interest  not  bearing  any  financial  return,  will  not  be  marketable,  and  therefore,  would  not  be 
equivalent to securities as defined in SCRA.

4.3  Funding structures  

The SSE will enable the routing of risk capital to NPOs via  funding structures (see Figure 4.1 for 
a  comprehensive  list)  that  can  catalyse larger and more efficient deployment of capital for them. 
While these structures differ in the details, the key idea in  all of them is the need for a specialised 
class of intermediaries  to channel  capital to NPOs. 
 
Over  70%  of  the  240  NPOs  surveyed  in  one  study  expressed  the  need  for  an  intermediary to 
provide  guidance  on  impact  reporting, monitoring and evaluation30. Intermediaries play a role in 
reducing  the  search and transaction costs associated with fund raising for  NPOs. This specialised 
class  of  entities  can  play  the  important  role  of  information  agents  and  delegated  monitors  for 
investors  while  creating  capital  markets  for  NPOs.  The  informational  advantage  also  comes  in 
the  form  of  specialisation  in  not  just  identifying  worthy  and  deserving  NPOs  but  also  in 
assessing  the nature of their operations and their capacity  to create impact31. 
 
In  the  Indian  context,  there  is  a  need  to  create  an  appropriate  investment  structure  (that  will 
function  as  an  independent  fund)  which   could take  a variety of forms, as seen in Figure 4.1. In 
some  cases,  grants  and  risk  capital  will  participate  side  by  side  in  the  same  structure.  In  other 
cases,  investors will be compensated by a new category of funders called “outcome funders” whose 
presence  in  the  funding  structure  will  incentivize performance on the part of the intermediary as 
well as the NPOs. Such  a pay-for-success  model might even work for grants.   
 
In  the  figure,  a  Social  Venture  Fund  (SVF)  is  a  category  1  Alternative  Investment  Fund  (AIF) 
that is allowed by SEBI to issue securities or units of social ventures  to investors who may agree 
to receive restricted  or muted returns.

31 Such a need for intermediaries was also expressed by the Social Investment Task Force (SITF) in the UK. Its  firs t  
report recommended the creation of “wholesale intermediaries” and this recommendation resulted in the form at ion o f 
Big Society Capital, an independent social investment institution that sources funds from dormant bank accounts via 
an  independent  Reclaim  Fund  and  four  commercial  banks  in  the  UK 31.  See:  Press  Release  Cabinet  Office,

Figure 4.1: Funding structures for NPOs 

 

The  above  figure  is  not  exhaustive,  but  it  does  illustrate  one  of  the  key  advantages  of  routing 
funding  through  the  SSE:  the  SSE  provides  a  venue  for  standardizing and rationalizing funding 
structures.  Some  of  these  structures  already  exist  (see  Annexure  4  for  examples),  but  there  isn’t 
much  awareness  about  them  among  the  NPO  community.  The  hope  is that the SSE will bring 
within  its  fold  the  many  structures  that  do  exist,  and  in  doing  so  also  expand  the  range  of 
possibilities.  In  turn,  NPOs  (that  are  able  to  conform  to  the  minimum  reporting  standard  of 
Chapter  3)  can  then  be  on-boarded  to  the  SSE  via  one  of  these  types  of  funding  structures, 
depending on their  own needs and those of their  funders.   
 
It  is  to  be  noted  that  not all structures create listable securities. In fact, the only ones that do are 
the  Mutual  Fund  and  SVF  for  risk  investors.  But  even  in  these cases, it is not necessary that the 
securities  be  listed  on  the  SSE.    Along  with  providing  avenues  for  direct  listing  of  NPOs 
(including  Section  8  companies),  the  SSE  has  also  been  envisioned  to  create  a  well-defined 
process  embodied  in  the  minimum  reporting  standard,  by which NPOs can identify themselves 
to  investors,  and  that  would  “pull”  investors  to  the  SSE.  Therefore, it is recommended that the 
SSE maintain a directory of all NPOs(directly listed or otherwise) that benefit from one or more 
of the structures  described in the above figure, and also a directory of the structures  themselves.

Here,  we  discuss  some  of  the  funding  structures  described  in  Figure  4.1 but leave much of the 
actual  details  to  Annexure  4.  In  the  Annexure,  we  also  review  successful  use  cases  of  these 
structures  that already exist,  making them attractive  options for kickstarting  activity  on the SSE.  
 
4.3.1  Mutual Fund structures 
A  conventional  AMC  could  offer  closed-end mutual fund units to investors. The units could be 
redeemable  in  principal  terms,  but  all  of  the  returns could be chanelled towards suitably chosen 
NPOs. If CSR spends are allowed to participate, the principal amount would have to be returned 
to the fund during fresh cycles of operation. The HDFC Cancer Fund is a successful example of 
this  kind of funding opportunity.   
   
4.3.2  Pay-for-success structures 

In  these  structures,  conventional  capital  coming  from  institutional  investors  or  banking 
institutions,  would  combine  with  social  capital  coming  from  philanthropic  foundations  or  CSR 
spends  or  impact  investors,  to  fund  a  specific NPO or a group of NPOs. Conventional capital 
would bear some risk as it would only earn a return if social impact is demonstrably created. That 
is  the  pay-for-success  part.  As  a  result,  the  NPO  beneficiaries  are  incentivized  to  perform  and 
gain  credibility,  or  else  risk  considerations  would  prevent  them  from  being  able  to  use  such 
structures  to  finance  themselves.  The  performance  of  NPOs  is  strictly  along  the  social 
dimension,  however,  since  the  financial  returns  are  provided  by  the  social  capital  participants 
upon  successful  creation  of  impact.  These  kinds  of  structures  are particularly well-suited for the 
SVF  classification,  and  are  already in vogue in the form of social impact bonds or development 
impact  bonds  (SIBs/DIBs)  around the world and in India. Many interesting variations exist, and 
Annexure  4 explores them in greater detail.  
 
4.3.3  Grants-in, grants-out 

The  SVF  classification  can  also  be  leveraged  to  activate grants-in, grants-out mechanisms, which 
are  not  as  sophisticated  as  the  previous  two  structures  reviewed  here,  but  nevertheless  just  as 
powerful.  SEBI’s  AIF  guidelines  provides  for  the  harnessing  of  SVFs  towards  charitable 
purposes,  as  per  Regulations  2(1)(v)  (which  describes  a  social  venture  as  one that pursues social 
performance  norms),  2(1)(u)  (which  states  that  charitable  trusts  and  Section  8  companies 
conform  to  these  norms  since  they  pursue  social  welfare,  solve  social  problems  and  provide 
social  benefits)  and  16(4)  (which  describes  the  grants-in,  grants-out  process).  In this context, the 
syndicate  financing  models  of  The  Power  of  Nutrition  (UK)  and  Gates  Philanthropy  Partners 
(US)  offer  successful  use-cases  that  the  SSE  could  emulate  for  Indian  NPOs.  Pratham,  one  of 
India’s  largest  NPOs,  has  tied  up  with  Godrej  Properties  Ltd.  to  innovate  a  loan-guarantee 
scheme  for  micro-entrepreneurs,  that  is  an  interesting  variation  on  the  grants-in,  grants-out 
structure.    
 
4.4  Attracting a full  spectrum of funders and investors to the SSE 

This  chapter  has  presented  a  number  of  mechanisms  for  funding  that  the  SSE  can  offer  to 
NPOs.  Whether  or  not  the  mechanism  creates  a listable security, it becomes a part of the SSE’s 
offering  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  the  SSE  mandates  a  minimum  reporting  standard  for  the 
beneficiaries  of  the  mechanism.  That  minimum  reporting  standard  will  be  a  key  factor  in 
overcoming  the  information  problems  that  typically  come  in  the  way  of  funders  and  investors 
discovering worthy and deserving NPOs. 
 
The  funders  and  investors  could  be  individuals,  government  organizations,  corporatio ns  (via 
CSR  contributions),  institutional  and  retail  investors,  and  philanthropic  foundations,  both 
foreign and domestic. There are at present some hurdles in allowing the full spectrum of funders 

 

29 

to  participate  in  the  fashion  envisioned  in  this  chapter,  and  these  hurdles  will  be  discussed  in 
Chapter  6,  and  recommendations  will  be  offered  on  overcoming  them.  There  are  also  various 
kinds of incentives that the government can offer to attract the full spectrum of funders onto the 
SSE (aside from the minimum reporting standard and other qualifiers which are already a strong 
pull factor). These  will also be discussed in Chapter 6. 
 
4.5  SSE for Covid19 

Our  recommendations  for  NPOs  are  also  motivated  by  a  very  urgent  concern  about  the 
economic damage inflicted by Covid19, especially upon the poorest Indian households and large 
swathes  of  the  informal  sector.  India  will  need  a  significant  amount  of  patient  capital  to  repair 
and  rebuild  those  livelihoods,  which  are  the  bedrock  of her economy. Conventional capital that 
prioritizes  financial  returns  will  not  be  able  to  carry such a burden all by itself. Social capital, on 
the  other  hand,  is  more  suited  for  this  role.  It  is  not  only  patient  but  its  goal  is  precisely  to 
support  and  fortify  social  structures  that  are  in  danger  of  collapsing  because  of    Covid19. The 
SSE  is  envisioned  as  one  of  the  possible  solutions  to  this pressing problem. It will unlock large 
pools  of  social  capital,  and encourage blended finance structures so that conventional capital can 
partner with social capital to address the urgent challenges  of Covid19.    
 
As  one  example,  the  recommendations  to  revitalize  SVFs  by  expanding  the  pools  of  source 
capital  and  innovating  new  structures  will substantially multiply the funding opportunities for the 
social  sector.  A  Covid19  Aid  Fund  can  be  set  up  by  SSE to activate solutions such as pay-for-
success  bonds  with  philanthropic  foundations,  CSR  spenders  and  impact  investors  as  outcome 
funders  and  domestic  banks,  Non  Banking  Financial  Corporations  (NBFCs)  and  impact 
investors  as  lenders.  Such  a  solution  would  be  particularly  effective  in  financing  the  work  of 
NPOs that are reaching  help and relief to migrant workers all over the country.

5  For-Profit Enterprises 

5.1  Equity listing 

FPEs  would  list  equity  on  the  SSE  subject  to  a  set  of  listing  requirements,  including  operating 
practices  (financial  reporting  and  governance)  and  social  impact  reporting.  That  is, FPEs would 
be  subject  to  the  minimum  reporting  standard.  This  is  similar  to  how  SEBI  created  the 
Innovators  Growth  Platform  (IGP)  for  start-ups  as  a  separate  platform  with  its  own  listing 
requirements. 
 
Certain  eligibility conditions for equity listings must also apply as per the SEBI’s Issue of Capital, 
Disclosure  Requirements  (ICDR)  SEBI  should  look  into  the  following  aspects  of  eligibility and 
recalibrate  the  existing  thresholds in the ICDR: Minimum Net Worth, Average Operating Profit, 
Prior  Holding  by  QIBs,  and  Criteria  for  Accredited  Investor  (if  a  role  for  such  investors  is 
envisaged).  Listing,  compliance  and  penalty  provisions  must  be  aptly  stringent  to  prevent  any 
misuse of SSE platform by FPEs. 
 
5.2  Beyond equity 

The  funding  structures  elaborated  in  Chapter  4  for  NPOs  could  be  used  for  funding  FPEs  as 
well.  Indeed,  AIFs  and  SVFs  already  exist  for  FPEs  but  do not require social reporting. So the 
inauguration of the SSE would bring under the fold of the minimum reporting standard all FPEs 
that  receive  funding  through  the  AIF/SVF  channel.  Futher,  the  reference  to  “muted  returns”  in 
the  current  SVF  guidelines  needs  to  be  revisited  as  the  term  is  misleading  and  a  deterrent  for 
investment. 
 
It is to be noted that the reporting standard ensures a prioritization of social returns. It requires a 
level  of  descriptive  detail  that  only bona fide FPEs will be able to provide, and that will be too 
costly  for  impostors  to  mimic.  Therefore,  only  the  true  FPEs  that  are  creating  positive  social 
impact  will  be  able  to  precisely  signal  their  “social  return”  credentials  to  potential  investors.  In 
other  words,  the  reporting  standard  empowers  the  investor  with  a  very  high  degree  of 
discrimination  so  that  he/she  is  able  to  single  out  an  FPE  that  is  genuinely  creating  positive 
social impact.  
 
Nevertheless, association of FPEs with SSE must not be based only on self-reporting. To ensure 
that  only  bonafide  FPEs  are  able  to  associate  with  SSE,  SEBI,  in  consultation  with the existing 
specialist  entities,  should  work  out  a  mechanism  for  assessing  credentials  of  the  social  impact 
dimensions  self-declared  by  the  FPEs.    A  mechanism  of  checks  must  be  developed  to  assess/ 
verify  the preference of such firms for social returns over financial returns and  their track record 
of  delivering  positive  social  impact  This  is  crucial  to  identify  and allow only the true FPEs, that 
are genuinely  creating social impact, to be associated  with SSE. 
 
Potential  exploitation  of  unintended  opportunities  for  regulatory  arbitrage  can,  of  course,  be 
handled  through  suitable  regulatory  interventions  such  as  appropriately  incorporating  the 
parameters  of  sole  object/  core  services  in  the  listing  criteria,  bringing  in  stringent  penalty 
provisions,  refining  the  reporting  standard  and  empowering  social  auditors  to  call  out  such 
attempts at arbitrage, designing an appropriate mechanism for scrutiny of the transfer cases from 
main board, if any   
 
That  the  structured  finance  route  works  for  FPEs  is  amply  demonstrated  by  an  entity  like 
Northern  Arc  Capital  Limited  (NACL),  which  enables  accelerated  access  to  capital markets for 

 

31 

for-profit  NBFC-MFIs,  and  has  thereby  helped  make  microfinance  a  mainstream  asset  class. 
Annexure  5 discusses  the NACL case in more detail.   
 
5.3  Attracting the full spectrum of funders and investors to the SSE 

Chapter  6  lists  some  of  the  policy  recommendations  that  are  targeted  towards  attracting 
investors  interested  in FPEs, and FPEs themselves,  onto the SSE platform.  
 
5.4  SSE for Covid19 

Many  FPEs  are  also  working  to  repair  the  damage  inflicted by Covid19.  For example,  NBFC-
MFIs are offering debt moratoriums to their downstream customers who are mostly low -income 
households.  However,  the  scale  of  such  relief  work  is  limited  by  the  willingness  of  upstream 
lenders to grant  debt moratoriums to those NBFC-MFIs..  
 
The  Covid19  Aid  Fund  mentioned  in  Chapter  4  can  be  used  to  provide  loan  guarantees  to 
NBFC-MFIs  that  wish  to  extend  debt  moratoriums  to their customers. An ideal offering could 
be  a  structured  pooled  loan  with  domestic  banks  and  NBFCs  as  senior  lenders,  and 
philanthropic  contributions,  CSR  spenders,  and 
lenders.  By 
participating  as  junior  lenders,  social  capital  would  cushion  the  downside  risk  for  conventional 
capital, and the SSE could make this  blended finance  solution a reality.

6  Policy Recommendations 

6.1  Designing appropriate policy interventions 

The  reader should read this Chapter alongside the executive Summary  (Chapter 1, Section 4) for 
a comprehensive  understanding  of the report’s recommendations. 
 
To  sustain  and  grow  the  flow  of  funds  through  the  exchange,  a  multi-dimensional  policy 
intervention  is  required  that  will  mitigate the various impediments  to the seamless flow of funds 
towards  the  social  sector,  and  also  route  new  sources  of funding to social enterprises, including 
those listed in the social stock exchange.   
 
A  framework  for  such  a  policy  intervention  could  consist of three broad categories: regulatio ns 
(aimed  at  reducing  non-tax  compliance  and  smoothening  wrinkles  in  the  major  regulations 
governing  the  flows  of  funds  to  the  social  sector), market making (aimed at kickstarting activity 
on  the  SSE)  and  tax policies (aimed at reducing tax compliance costs, increasing donor/investor 
participation,  and rationalizing  anomalies  in tax incidence)32.   
 
6.2  Smoothening regulatory wrinkles 

Clarifications or tweaks will be needed under the  CSR, SCRA, FCRA and the AIF regulations of 
SEBI.  The  government  may  consider  the  following  recommendations  in  respect  of  CSR  and 
FCRA. 
 
On CSR regulations:   

1.  Allow  funding  to  NPOs  on  SSE  to  count  towards  CSR  commitments  of 
companies.  According  to  the  Draft  CSR  Policy  Amendment  Rules  2020,  recently 
released  by  the  MCA,  only  contributions to Section 8 companies that are registered with 
the  MCA  can  count  towards  CSR  contributions33.  This  appears  to  be  too  restrictive, 
especially in light of the fact that the SSE  will mandate  a reporting standard for all NPOs 
and  will  facilitate  fund-raising  by  them  through  directly  listed  instruments  or  through 
intermediary  funding  structures.  The  association  of  a  particular NPO with SSE, either in 
form  of  direct  listing  or  as  a  beneficiary  NPO  being  placed  in  the  SSE  directory,will 
signal their credibility and legitimacy. Further, the  existing IRs and ICAI, would work out 
a  set  of  financial  reporting  standards  for  all  NPOs.  The  SSE  may  assist and coordinate 
this  process.  Given  these  requirements,  it  would  appear  that  all  NPOs    on  SSE  should 
qualify  to  receive  CSR  funds,  and  therefore  the  Draft  Amendment  Rules  2020  may 
reflect this  provision. 

2.  Allow CSR contributions to fund outcomes in the SSE’s funding structure 3B (see 
Figure 4.1 of Chapter 4, and Annexure 4, for details on how this funding structure 
works). As argued above, there is a strong case also, for extending CSR contributions to 
NPOs  benefiting  from  the  SSE’s  structure  3B  in  the  form  of  outcome  funding.  To 
enable  this  to  happen,  the  SSE  must  increase  awareness  about  this  possibility  for  using 
CSR  among  all  corporates.  Also,  the  following  changes  may  be made in section 135 of 
the Companies Act, and reflected in the Draft Amendment Rules  2020: 

                                              
32  This  framework  is  inspired by the Doing Good Index 2018 Maximising Asia’s Potential, Centre for Asian 
Philanthropy and Society 
33 The Draft Amendment Rules 2020 are available here: http://feedapp.mca.gov.in/csr/  

 

33 

a.  Allow  CSR  capital  to  be  parked  into  an escrow account for a period of 3 
years34.  At  the  end  of  the  3-year  time  period,  the  capital  in  the  CSR  escrow 
account  should  be  liquidated  and  spent  as  per  the  Companies  Act  schedule  VII 
within the subsequent  financial  year. 

b.  Allow accelerator grant to an NPO up to 10% of the program cost (in case 
outcomes  are  exceeded)  to  be  counted  as  CSR  expenditure.  Such  a  grant 
would  fund  non-programmatic  expenditure  such  as  research,  capacity  building, 
etc. 

c.  The  board and management of the corporate providing CSR funds should 

not be related to the NPO to avoid conflict of interest. 

3.  The  MCA  may  authorize  the  trading  of  CSR  spends  between  companies  with 
excess CSR-spends and those with deficit CSR-spends, and the SSE can provide a 
platform  for  this  purpose.  Annexure  6  to  this  report  describes  in  detail  how  such  a 
platform  might  work.  This  recommendation  needs  to  be  checked  against  the  Draft 
Amendment  Rules  2020,  as  these  rules  specify  that  corporates  with  unspent  CSR  funds 
(in  other  words,  corporates  with  deficit  CSR-spends)  must  deposit  them  in an Unspent 
CSR  Account,  and  aim  to  spend  the  amount  over  the  next  3  years. A trading platform 
would offer to such a corporate an alternative possibility. We recommend that the MCA 
consider  offering  this  alternative  possibility,  and  add  this  recommendation  to  the  Draft 
Amendment Rules 2020.  

4.  Allow  expenditure  by  corporates  on  building  capacity  for  the  SSE  to  count 
towards  their  CSR  commitments.  Such  funds  can  be  given  to  the  SSE  without  any 
expectation  of  return,  to  be  utilised towards capacity building (see the recommendations 
for  market  making  in Section 4 below, for more detail on this point). Implementing this 
would  require  suitable  amendments  to  schedule  VII  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013,  and 
their inclusion  in the Draft Amendment Rules 2020. 

 
On Regulatory Framework for SCRA:  

  The  zero  coupon  zero  principal  bond  of  NPOs  will  have  to  be  notified  as  a 
security  under  SCRA.  The  appropriate  regulatory  amendments  will  have  to  suitably 
examined by SEBI.   

 
On FCRA:  

  Clarify rule 4 of the FCR Rules, 2011, to enable foreign entities to invest in SVFs 
listed on the SSE, as the donors will not be taking decisions/have any discretion 
on  deployment  of  their  funds  to  specific  NPOs35.  These  decisions  will  be taken by 
SEBI-regulated Indian fund managers and will therefore be easier for the government to 
monitor  as  they  will  have  to  conform  to  the  Information  Memorandum  to  be  made 
public.  
 

On AIF regulations:   

1.  Lowering of the minimum corpus requirement  and minimum ticket size for SVFs 
to  be  suitably  examined  by  SEBI.  The  current  floors  of  INR  20  crores  and  INR 1 
crore  limit  the  participation  of  smaller  outcome  funders  in  the  structures  described  in 

                                              
34 The Draft Amendment Rules 2020 include a provision  for this, but it is unclear if the amendment has been 
accepted, since the deadline for the MCA’s call for public comments on these new rules was extended to  Ap ril 20, 
2020, in view of the Covid19 crisis. See: http://feedapp.mca.gov.in/csr/   
35 R. 4 of the FCRR, 2011 prohibits ‘any activity or investment that has an element of risk of appreciation or deprec iation  o f t he  
original investment, linked to market forces, including investment in mutual funds or in shares’. This requires a clarificat io n , as  it  
may prevent foreign entities from participating in SVFs.  

 

34 

Chapter  4.  The  reference  to  “muted  returns”  in  the  current  SVF  guidelines  needs  to  be 
revisited.   

 
6.3  Market making 

A  fledgling  exchange  like  the  SSE  would  find  it  difficult  to  ensure  liquidity  and participation in 
the initial  stages. The  SSE could consider the following measures  to address this  difficulty: 

1.  Consider  running  a widespread and high intensity awareness campaign for social 
enterprises  to  list  in  the  SSE.  Further,  as  recommended  by  the  RBI’s  Expert 
Committee  on  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (Chair:  U.K.  Sinha) SIDBI, being 
the apex body for the development of SMEs,  may collaborate with state governments to 
get social-minded SME units  from the states  onto the SSE. 

2.  Consider setting  up a INR 100 crore  “capacity building fund” to create a capacity 
building  unit  that  will  foster  overall  sector  development.  The  SSE  could  invite 
corporates  and  philanthropic  foundations  to  contribute,  with  the  understanding  that 
corporate  contributions  would  be  CSR  eligible  and  philanthropic  donations  would 
benefit  from  the  same  regulations  and  fiscal  benefits  as  are  available  under  80G,  etc. 
Capacity building involves  all of the following:  

a.  Organizing  existing  IRs  in  the  immediate term for extending requisite support to 

SSE (as explained in Chapter 3)   

b.  Implementing  the  reporting  standard  for  all  FPEs  and  NPOs  that  benefit  from 

the SSE 

c.  Enhancing  the  reporting  capabilities  of  smaller NPOs, and also picking up some 

of the financial  cost of such reporting for them 

d.  Creating  awareness  among  and  driving  adoption  of  the  fund  by  FPEs,  NPOs, 

investors  and donors 

e.  Actively  raising  awareness  and  promoting  the  fundraising  instruments/structures 

available on the  SSE among FPEs and NPOs 

 
6.4  Tax policy 

A  2016  Charities  Aid  Foundation  (CAF)  study  of  tax  regimes  for  philanthropy  in  various 
countries demonstrates that  the proportion of people donating money to charity is 12 percentage 
points  higher  in  countries  which  offer  some  form  of  tax  incentive  to  individuals  (33  per  cent) 
than  those  that  offer  no  incentives  (21  per  cent)36.  Furthermore,  this  difference  is  most 
pronounced  for  countries  in  the  Low  Income  group  (27  per  cent  versus  18  per  cent)37. 
Therefore, tax policy can be expected to be critical  for the SSE’s success. 
 
It  is  observed  from  the  CAFs  annual  world  giving  index  report  released in October, 2019 that 
India  is ranked at 82 out of the 128 countries. The report also suggests that governments should 
make it easier for people to give and offer incentives  for giving where possible.38  
 
SSE  provides means for social enterprises (both for profit and non profit organizations) to raise 
funds  through  a  regulated  mechanism.  Fund  raising  through  SSE  also  ensures  accountability, 
transparency  and  periodic  reporting  of  impact.  Thus,  in  order  to  provide  an  impetus  for  such

fund  raising  mechanisms  and  create  a    vibrant,  deep  and liquid market for social investments, it 
will be paramount to provide certain  tax incentives. 
 
India  appears  to be moving towards a more flat and simplified tax structure with low rates and 
few  exemptions39. The tax incentives proposed in this report are, for the most part, in alignment 
with  that  evolutionary  arc,  except  in  the  case  of  80G  exemptions  which  will  be  important  to 
retain  under  the  new  tax  regime  so  that  a  crucial  conduit  of  funding  to  NGOs  is  not  cut  off. 
Against  that background, the  government may consider the  following recommendations:  
 
For investors  and philanthropic  donors:  

1.  Exempt  investors from paying Securities Transaction Tax (STT) for trades made 
on  the  SSE.  A  tax  on  transactions  could  reduce  traded  volume  and  liquidity  on  the 
xchange40.  There  is  some  evidence  of  this  happening  in India post the imposition of  the 
tax in 200441.  

2.  Exempt  investors  from  paying  Capital  Gains  Tax  (CGT)  on  long  term  capital 
gains  accruing  from  sale  of  securities  in  the  SSE.  This  will  incentivise  investors  to 
stay  invested  for  longer  time  horizons  and  thus  provide  much needed long term  capital 
for the social enterprises.   

3.  Allow philanthropic donors to claim 100% tax exemption for their donations to all 
NPOs that benefit from the SSE. Countries such as Japan, Germany, China, Australia, 
UK  and  the  US  all  offer  100%  tax  exemptions  on  donations  to  NPOs42.  In  India, 
donations  to  private  NPOs  with  80G  certification  can  get  only  50%  tax  deduction, 
whereas  government  entities  get  100%.  This  creates  an  artificial  distinction  between 
private and government entities  doing similar work43.  

4.  Allow  all investments made in  securities/ instruments  of NPOs listed  on SSE to 

be tax deductible.    

5.  Allow  corporates  to  deduct  CSR  expenditure  that  goes  to  the  SSE  from  their 
taxable  income.  The  High  Level  Committee  on  Corporate  Social  Responsibility 
recommended that all CSR expenditure be made tax deductible44. 

6.  Remove the 10% cap on income eligible for deduction under 80G. In conversations 
with  stakeholders,  this  restriction  came  up  as  a  significant  barrier  towards  greater 
philanthropic  giving45.  

7.  Allow first time retail investors to avail a 100% tax exemption on their investments 
in  the  SSE  MF  structure,  subject  to  an  overall  limit  of  Rs.  1  Lakh46.  There  is 
precedent for this  through the 80CCG section of the IT Act.

charities to file a return on their donations. With this provision, both the donor and donee w o uld b e filin g t h eir

donations. Thus, there is a case to extend this benefit in the new tax regime also. 
44 The High Level Committee made the recommendation because current CSR rules appear to create an artificial 
distinction between types of CSR expenditure, with some (such as those going towards rural development, skill 
development, etc.) qualifying for tax exemption and others not.  
45 It may be noted that in other jurisdictions, the cap is much higher (100% in Australia, UK, Vietnam, Philippines , 
Ireland; 75% in Canada; 50% in USA; 40% in Japan; 30% in China)

For social enterprises:   

1.  Allow  a  tax  holiday  of  5  years  to  FPEs listed on the SSE, from the time of first 
listing.  This  tax  holiday  can  be  made  contingent  on  the  social  enterprise  reinvesting  its 
profits  in  the  business,  and  any  additional  criteria  deemed  necessary.  The  criteria  should 
be  designed  in  a  manner  so  that  these  tax  concessions  reach  only  the  genuine  FPEs 
creating  true social impact. 

2.  Enable  ease  of  getting  certifications  for  NPOs  under  12A,  12AA  and  80G  by 

allowing all NPOs benefiting  from the SSE to qualify  for these  certifications. 

3.  Re-evaluate  the current budget proposal to revalidate registration of NPOs under 
section  12A/12AA  for  NPOs.  The  current  proposal  could  significantly  increase 
compliance costs for NPOs. 

4.  Re-evaluate    the  current  budget  proposal  to  make  renewal  of  registration  for 
NPOs under 80G periodic. Any eligibility assessment for 80G may be conducted at the 
time of registration  itself.  Renewal doesn’t seem to be economically  beneficial.47. 

5.  Increase  the  limits under the IT Act on  NPOs raising funds from commercial or 
semi-commercial  activities  to  50%  from  the current 20% 48. This would help NPOs 
become more sustainable.   

 
For the SSE:  

1.  Allow  revenue  generated  by  stock  exchanges  through SSE to be tax deductible. 
Costs  attributable  to  just  the  SSE  would  need  to  be  separated  out  from  the  larger 
exchange. 

 

 

                                              
47 As per estimates of donations u/s 80G are available in Receipt Budget - Finance Bill 2020, the loss of revenue o n  
account of fake donations would be far lesser than the administrative cost of renewal.  
48 Countries such as the US, UK, Brazil and Australia do not appear to have such restrictions, provided the in co m e 
generated by an NPO through trading or other commercial activities can be attributed to the normal course of 
operations for which the NPO was established.

7  The Road Not Taken  

The models of SSEs in other jurisdictions may be classified into  (1) Matchmaking platforms, and 
(2)  Alternative  investment  instruments  listed  on  an  existing  stock  exchange.  The  characteristics 
and shortcomings  of these  models are examined below. 
 
7.1  Matchmaking platforms  

A  matchmaking  platform  is  a dedicated platform, set up separately from the existing exchanges, 
with  the  purpose  of  bringing  together  investors  and  investees.  Many  of  the  matchmaking 
platforms observed in other countries  cater either only to FPEs or only to NPOs, but there is no 
comprehensive  solution  for both categories in any country.   
 
7.1.1  NPOs 

Brazil’s  Socio-Environmental  Impact  Exchange  (BVSA)  was  the  first  SSE.  It  was  set  up  under 
the  BOVESPA  Stock  Exchange  in  200349.  The  BVSA  acts  as  an  information  exchange  to 
evaluate  NPOs  and  identify  projects  which  are  in need of funding from private investors50. The 
capital  raised  through  the  exchange  is  used to fund specific projects within a fixed time frame 51. 
From  2016, BVSA has relied on the  SDGs to measure impact on society52. Importantly, funders 
receive no financial  returns53. 
 
South  Africa’s  SASIX:    The  SASIX  was  set  up  by  the  Greater  Good  South  Africa  Trust  in 
200654.  Like  the BVSA, the SASIX does not provide financial returns to investors. SASIX allows 
investors  to  purchase  “shares”  of  a  specified value, that are directed at funding towards specific 
projects, within a time bound manner55. Impact is measured by outcomes in the community.   
 
7.1.2  FPEs 

of  Responsible 

2018.  Mobilizing 

UK  Social  Stock  Exchange:    The  UK  Social  Stock  Exchange  operates  as  an  information 
platform, but for established FPEs that are also listed on the London Stock Exchange56. In order 
to  be  listed  on  the SSE,  FPEs must file annual social impact reports indicating their progress on 
the  ground57.  Dadush  (2015)  notes  that  there  is  little  clarity  on  the  nature  of  “impact”  that 
businesses  must  achieve,  nor  is  there  a  clear  distinction  between  finance-first  and  impact-first 
models. As a result,  the SSE does not meet its full regulatory potential58.

Canada  Social  Venture  Connexion:  The  Canada  SVX  is  also  intended  to  be  an  information 
exchange.  It  is  operated  by  the  MaRS  Centre  for  Impact  Investing59.  The  platform  links 
accredited  investors  with  businesses  in  need  of  equity  investment60.  The  impact  of  each entity is 
determined  by  the  Global  Impact  Investing  Rating  System  (GIIRS)  system,  with  entities 
submitting proof of rating in order to be listed 61. Some commentators have  stated that there is a 
lack of clarity on what would disqualify  an entity  from being listed on the exchange62. 
 
7.1.3  Problems with match-making  platforms 

For  NPOs,  matchmaking  platforms only offer the benefit of discovery but do not innovate any 
new  instruments  or  funding  structures  as  such.  Consequently,  these  platforms  have  only  been 
able to attract a very limited set of investors, and do not show much activity. The situation is not 
that much different for the  FPE platforms. The Canadian platform is only for discovery and not 
for trading while the UK platform allows very limited amounts of trading.   
 
By  contrast,  the  SSE  being  envisioned  for  India  will  allow  trading  for  equities  issued  by  FPEs, 
although tax incentives will be in place to encourage patient capital. And for NPOs, the SSE will 
open  up  avenues  for  direct  listing,  will  streamline  a  whole  range  of    funding  mechanisms,  and 
will provide a reporting standard and other incentives  that  will pull investors  onto it.   
 
7.2  Alternate investment instruments traded on an existing stock exchange  

Another  model  for  an  SSE  is  Singapore’s  Impact  Investment  Exchange  (operated  jointly  with 
the  Stock  Exchange  of  Mauritius),  which  trades  impact-related  securities,  such  as  the  Women’s 
Livelihood  Bonds63.  These  impact-related  securities  are  not  strictly  pay-for-success  structures,  as 
they  promise  a  financial return even if social impact is not created.  Alternately, investors may use 
the  IIX  Growth  Fund  to  make  equity  investments  in  start-ups or small companies with a social 
impact64. The social impact is determined with reference to the SDGs.  
 
The  limitation  with  the  Singaporean  alternative  investment  instruments  is  that  the  funding 
instruments  appear  to  serve  only  FPEs,  and there is no systematic approach for funding NPOs. 
By contrast, the SSE being envisioned for India lays out a common minimum reporting standard 
for  all  social  enterprises,  whether  they  are  FPEs  or  NPOs.  Furthermore,  the  funding  structures 
for  NPOs  have  various  forms,  with  some  of  them  incorporating  an  explicit  pay-for-success 
mechanism  that incentivizes  good performance on the part of the NPO.

Annexure 1: Measuring Social Impact  – Frameworks & Challenges 

Currently,  there are several frameworks to measure impact. These vary greatly across dimensions 
such  as  the  degree  of  intentionality  (of  the  investor  and/or  the  enterprise),  the  rigour  of 
measurement,  the  relative  weightages  given  to  component  parts,  whether  the  measurement 
framework  is  conceived  for  NPOs  or  for  FPEs,  and  whether  the  framework  is  driven  by  the 
developmental  agenda  of  any  government  or  of  one or more multi-lateral organisations. This is 
the  outcome  of  an  evolutionary  process  of  selection  and  differentiation  as  more  recent 
frameworks  have sought to overcome the limitations of earlier ones. The tables in this Annexure 
provide a landscape of the variety of frameworks that exist today.  
 
At the level of least complexity is a set of frameworks  laid down by various statutory bodies in a 
jurisdiction  but  are  not  necessarily  mandated  for  all  enterprises  in  the jurisdiction. More than 70 
countries  already  have  some  form  of  mandatory  or  voluntary  social  reporting  for corporates65. 
An  example  specific  to  India is the Business Responsibility Reporting Framework (BRRF) that is 
mandated  by  SEBI  for  the  top  1000  corporates  according  to  market  capitalisation  and  is 
voluntary  for  others66.  This  seeks  to  operationalize  the  National  Guidelines  on  Responsible 
Business  Conduct (NGRBC), laid out by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in 2018 67,68,69. 
While  the  NGRBC  contains  an  indicative  mapping  of  each  of  the  principles  to  existing  laws in 
India,  and  all  enterprises  whether  ‘social’  or  not  must  comply  with  these  laws,  the  BRRF  helps 
enterprises  conduct  a  self-assessment  of  how  well-aligned  they  are  to  the  NGRBC and identify 
areas  for  improvement70.  The BRRF is therefore designed  to serve an objective of ‘limiting harm’, 
i.e.,  for  example,  not  causing  damage to the environment, or not exacerbating historical patterns 
of  social  exclusion.71  Downstream  to  these  government-led  policy  imperatives  are  instances 
where  stock  exchanges  in  the  country  place  directives  for  voluntary  reporting  by  companies 
listed  on  them  (such  as  Bombay  Stock  Exchange’s  ESG  Guidance).72,73  Internationally,  credit 
rating  agencies  (like Fitch and Moody’s) have developed frameworks to assess ESG compliance, 
which they provide as a service  to those who wish to comply.  
 
The  broad  standards  described  above  are  meant  to  encourage  generic  notions  of  corporate 
“responsibility”  through  reporting  practices  as  a  mode  of  governance.  However,  they  cannot  be 
said  to  speak  to  the  specific  kinds  of  impact  that  social  enterprises  and  socially  focussed

69 The MCA has also released an updated version of the NGRBC in 2019 that is meant to be more aligned with t h e 
SDGs  and  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  Broadly the nine principles covered are derived from the UN Guiding 
Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), UN Framework 
for Climate Change, and the ILO Core Conventions on Child Labour, besides provisions  in  t h e Co m pan ies Act

71 Reporting, however, is only one aspect of ensuring responsible corporate behaviour. More is needed with  regard  
to supervision by government bodies of industries likely to create most harm, and access to courts by aggrieved 
parties.

investors seek to create.  Here, there are a number of international frameworks which can broadly 
be  divided  into  two  categories.  The  first  category  includes  frameworks  created  by  multilateral 
development  organisations  such  as  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  and  the  United 
Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP),  and  development  financial  institutions  such  as  the 
UK’s  Commonwealth  Development  Corporation  (CDC).  The  second  category  includes 
frameworks  created  by  bodies  directly  or  indirectly  constituted  by  impact  investors.  Many  of 
these  frameworks  loosely  map  to  what  is  popularly  known  as  the  IOOI  Impact  Chain (Input-
Output-Outcome-Impact),  which  is  a  general  approach  to  study  the  impact  of  any  innovation. 
For  adopting  this  approach,  an  organization  interested in creating social impact must articulate a 
Theory  of  Change  (TOC)  or  Logic  Model.74.  The  Impact  Measurement  Project’s  (IMP) 
framework  goes  a  step  further  than  the  IOOI  Impact  Chain  model  in  that  it  deconstructs  the 
Output,  Outcome  and  Impact  elements  of  that  model  into  the  five  dimensions of What, Who, 
How Much, Contribution, and Risk75.    
 
The  applicability  of  these  frameworks  across  countries requires a consideration of the local legal 
and  institutional  context  within  each  country.76  In  the  absence  of  any  oversight,  global  pools of 
capital  are  more  likely  to  gravitate  towards  lax  regimes,  resulting  in  exploitation  and/or 
destruction  of  the  social  or  natural  fabric  in  those  countries.  The  international  impact 
measurement  frameworks that have evolved have each sought to address such problems.  
 
Among  the  frameworks  led  by  the  global  investor  community  in  collaboration  with  other 
stakeholders,  the  Evaluation  Framework  for  Inclusive  Investments  developed  by  SELCO  and 
Prof.  Ankur  Sarin  and  others  at  IIM  Ahmedabad  is  noteworthy  because  it  introduces  the 
dimension  of  “Inclusiveness”  in a very deliberate  and specific manner, as compared to many other 
mainstream  frameworks.77,78  There  are  also  frameworks  developed  specifically  for  NPOs  and 
many  accounting,  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  standards  available  for  a  variety  of 
industries  and sectors and applicable across legal jurisdictions.

strength  and  integrity  of  their  protective  mechanisms  such  as  law  enforcement.  Thus,  for  in stance,  a  forest

In  2019,  UNDP  released  for  comment,  via  its  flagship  initiative  called 
SDG  Impact,  the  SDG  Impact  Practice  Standards  for  Private  Equity 
Funds and an associated certification framework and SDG Impact Seal 
(assurance  standards  for  bonds  and  for  enterprises  is  forthcoming)  80. 
This is a collection of 18 standards grouped into three headings, namely 
standards  for  strategic  intent  and  goal  setting,  standards  for  impact 
measurement  and  management,  and  standards  for  transparency  and 
accountability.  The  framework  seeks  to  assess  whether  an  enterprise 
meets  the  standards  against  a  three-point  scale  (Does  Not  Meet,

IRIS,  managed  as  a  public  good  by  the  GIIN,  lays out a catalogue of 
standard  environmental-  and  social-performance  metrics  that  impact 
investors  have been using  for some time. 
The  GIIRS is a rating system for assessing the social and environmental 
impact  of  enterprises  and  funds,  considered  to  be  analogous  to 
Morningstar  investment  rankings  and  Capital IQ financial analytics. It is 
a  hybrid  public/private  good  in  that  it  is  provided  by  an  NPO  that 
charges for its ratings services to become sustainable, publishes data for 
public use, and makes available for free, standards and assessment tools

83 Many additional frameworks exist, such as Sustainable Livelihoods (SL), Demonstrating Value (DV) , t h e So cial 
Return on Investment (SROI) framework, and the <IR> Framework of the International Integrated Reporting 
Council (IIRC). The Conference Board’s “Framing Social Impact Measurement” Research Report R-1567-14-RR refers  
to many other existing frameworks and documents a set of 30 quantitative frameworks that attempt to measure 
impact. It also describes four different types of measurement frameworks, namely outputs frameworks , o ut co mes  
frameworks,  non-monetised  impact  frameworks,  and  monetised  impact  frameworks.  Table  3,  Table  4,  The

that  can  be  used  by  enterprises  for  internal  purposes.  The  NPO  in 
question  is  B-Lab,  an  organization  that  certifies  B  Corporations  and 
promotes the benefit  corporation structure. 
GRI,  based  in  the  Netherlands,  provides  a  Sustainability  Reporting 
Framework  and  aims  to make sustainability reporting standard practice 
so  that  all  companies  and  organizations  report  their  impact  along  the 
economic,  environmental,  social  and  governance  dimensions  of 
performance. 
The  IMP  seeks  to  build  a  global  consensus  on  how  to  measure  and 
manage  impact  and  brings  together  a  coalition  of  investors,  grant-
makers,  for-  and  non-profit  businesses,  wealth  managers,  evaluators, 
academicians,  and  some  of  the  existing  standard  setting  bodies.  IMP 
has  defined  impact  as  a  change  in  positive  or  negative  outcome  for 
people or the planet. This framework goes a step further than the IOOI 
Impact  Chain  model  in  that  it  deconstructs  the  Output,  Outcome and 
Impact elements of that  model into the five dimensions of What, Who, 
How  Much,  Contribution,  and  Risk,  and  it  also  classifies  an  enterprise 
and  its  projects according to whether they Act to Avoid Harm, Benefit 
Stakeholders  and Contribute to Solutions84.    
This  framework  introduces  the  dimension  of  “Inclusiveness”  in  a  very 
deliberate and specific manner, as compared to many other mainstream 
frameworks85.  “Inclusive  investments”,  as  defined  by  this  framework,  are 
“those  that,  while  being  conscious  of  their  environmental  footprint,  prioritise  the 
values  of  dignity, equity and sustainability of impact over other competing values and 
objectives”.  The  framework  is  designed  across  five  dimensions  of  Serve, 
Internal  Inclusion,  Governance, Ecosystem and Ecology.

D.  Frameworks designed for NPOs 

Specific  to  NPOs,  the  Social  Reporting  Standard  (SRS)  guide  is  an 
open-source  civic  society  initiative  led  by  the  University  of  Hamburg 
and  the  Technical  University  of  Munich89.  This  aims  to provide  NPOs 
with  a  systematic  results-based  reporting  framework for their activities, 
but  without  attaching  a  numerical  value  or  a  rating  to  the  reported 
information.  It  has  as  its  main  components,  Performance  (to  indicate 
the  efficiency  of  use of resources to achieve the social objectives of the 
NPO),  Risk  (to  factor  additional  risk  on behalf of the constituents that 
the NPO serves)  and Organisational  Capacity. 
GuideStar  India  is  currently  India’s  largest  information  repository  for 
NPOs.  Besides  hosting  a  searchable  database  on  information  collected 
from  these  NPOs,  GuideStar  also  performs  certification  across  three 
levels  (namely  Platinum  Seal/Champion,  Gold  Seal/Advanced  and 
Transparency  Key/Foundation)  for  interested  NPOs  after  a  detailed 
due  diligence  on  transparency,  public  accountability,  and  legal  and 
financial  compliance.

Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  Board  (SASB)  develops  and 
disseminates  industry-specific  sustainability  accounting  standards  as  a 
way  to  help  businesses  communicate  financial  material  sustainability 
information to their investors. 
AccountAbility  is  a  global  consulting  and  sustainability  standards  firm 
that  works  with  businesses,  governments  and  multilateral  organisations 
to  advance  responsible  business  practices  and  improve  long-term 
performance.  Its  AA1000  series  of  standards  are  founded  on  the 
principles  of Inclusivity,  Materiality,  Responsiveness  and Impact. 
SAI  is  a  global  non-governmental organization advancing human rights 
at work. SA8000 is a social certification standard for factories and other 
organisations  to  demonstrate  their  dedication  to  the  fair  treatment  of 
workers  across  industries  around  the  globe  and  incorporates  both  the 
Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  and  ILO  conventions  as  well 
as national  labour laws. 
Unlike  ISO  standards  that  provide  certifications,  ISO26000  provides 
guidance  to  organisations  to  help  clarify what social responsibility is, to 
translate  principles  into  effective  actions  and  shares  best  practices 
relating  to social  responsibility,  globally. 

 
Notwithstanding  the  growing  sophistication  of  social  reporting  standards,  it  should  be 
acknowledged  that  impact  measurement  remains  an  intrinsically  difficult  business,  fraught  with 
obstacles  and  challenges.  It  is  worth  examining  and  articulating  these  challenges  before 
prescribing a way forward for social enterprises  in India.

In  compiling  the  list  of  challenges  that  follow,  we  have  benefited  from  a  consideration  of  the 
international  experience as well as inputs  provided by important stakeholders90,91.   
 
Lack of a common  currency for measurement 
The  financial  performances  of different projects  can be represented in the same units within and 
across  organizations.  However,  social  goals  and  their  performance  are  not  amenable  to 
measurement  in  the  same  way.  For  instance,  neither  the  development  of  life-skills  nor  the 
empowerment  of  women  can  be  accorded  any  definitive  currency  value.  Similarly,  there  is  no 
objective  context-independent  sense  in  which  the  desirability  of  eradicating  female  infanticide 
may  be  compared  to  the  desirability  of  providing  nutrition  to malnourished  children, nor is  the 
social value of a 10% improvement in student learning outcomes in a Mumbai slum equivalent to 
the social value of a 10% improvement in student  learning  outcomes in Sukma, Chattisgarh.   
 
The use of proxies can dilute focus on the beneficiary 
Where  it  becomes  impossible  to  tangibly  measure  impact  (or  actual  beneficiary  outcomes), 
proxies  (such  as  data  on  inputs  and  outputs)  are  used.  However,  as  poverty  scholar  Jonathan 
Morduch observes, “rather than learning about the true impact of an intervention, readers of IRIS reports ‘get 
numbers  on  scale,  outreach,  costs,  and  revenues,’  and  proxies  that  are  too  abstracted  from  the  experience  of 
beneficiaries  to  be  useful92.”  In  reality,  beneficiaries  are  diverse,  heterogenous,  and  can  have 
conflicting  interests  at play93. 
 
Measurement can drive enterprise behaviour to the detriment of social impact 
When  a  metric  is  stated  upfront  either  by the funder or by the board and senior managers of a 
social  enterprise,  that metric can become the anchor for all of the enterprise’s efforts. This is not 
necessarily  a  bad  thing,  as  the  proper  choice  of  a  metric  can  indeed  drive  real  impact.  The 
problem  arises  when  the  metric  is  pursued  in  a  myopic  and  opportunistic  way.  The  metric 
becomes  the  focus  of  the  enterprise’s  efforts instead of the deeper thing that it points to, as for 
example  when  the  enterprise  is  motivated  by  a  target-setting  mentality  to  cherry-pick  those 
beneficiaries  that will allow it to achieve the target easily and quickly (also referred to as “ creaming 
off”). This kind of perverse behaviour ultimately results in underperformance by the enterprise on 
outcomes, as described in a 2014 European Commission report94. 
 
Difficulties in attribution, unintended externalities and the dilemma of the measurement 
timescale 
Enterprises  struggle  to  answer  the  question  of  whether  changes  in  outcome  indicators  can  be 
attributed  to  their  particular  intervention  (versus  those  outcomes  which  would  have  occurred 
irrespective  of  the  intervention,  also referred to as  “deadweight”95). The act of attribution refers to 
both  isolating  and  estimating  accurately  the  particular  contribution  of  an  intervention  and 
ensuring  that  causality  runs  from  the  intervention  to  the  outcome.  Attribution  may  be

established  through  intensive  impact  measurement  exercises  such  as  Randomised  Control  Tests 
(RCT)  but  these  are  expensive  to  administer.  In  addition,  leakages  could  result  from  benefits 
going  to  people  or  geographies  outside  of  the  targeted  beneficiaries’  group.  The  extent  of 
benefits  could  also  be  muted  by  reductions  in  positive  outcomes  elsewhere,  also  referred  to as 
“displacement”  and “substitution”96.   
 
In  financial  performance,  often  externalities  to  transactions  are  not  relevant  to  the  assessment. 
Most  of  the  financial  performance  metrics  do  not  include  a  valuation  of  the  externalities 
engendered  by  the  organization’s  activities.  Yet,  for  social  impact  assessments,  the  externalities 
are the direct concern, be they positive or negative97.   
 
Many  social  and  environmental  issues  are  multi-dimensional  and  vulnerable  to  unintended 
consequences.  For 
issues  associated  with 
agricultural  production  include  changes  in  land  and  water  use;  introduction  of  toxic  chemicals, 
nutrients,  and  pathogens;  reduction  and  alteration  of  animal  habitats,  and  introduction  of 
invasive  species.  Understanding  the  environmental  consequences  of  agricultural  production  is 
critical  to  minimize  unintended  environmental  consequences.  Such  understanding  could  take 
anywhere  from  a  few  crop  cycles  to  many  decades.  A  narrow  focus  on  metrics  like  yield  and 
farm  productivity  could  result  in  positive  impact  in  the  short  term  but  ignore  entirely  the 
economic and environmental  costs in the long term.

96 Ibid. 
97 This also implies that organizations that choose to measure social impact choose to become mindful of such 
externalities they might be introducing, those that choose not to measure their impact do not have to carry this 
‘additional tax’ on their businesses.

Annexure 4: Funding structures  for NPOs – A closer look 

The Mutual Fund structure (Structures 1A & 1B in Figure 4.1) 
A  simple  yet  effective  model  here  could  be  a  conventional  closed -ended  fund  structure  as 
depicted in  Figure 1 below. The fund, acting as the intermediary, aggregates capital from various 
individual  and  institutional  investors  to  invest  in  market-based  instruments,  much  like  a 
conventional  investment  vehicle.  The  returns  generated  by  these  investments  are  then  channeled 
towards  financing  the  operations  of  NPOs  working  towards  social  outcomes.  These  returns 
would  be  considered  as  donations  made  by  the  investors  to  NPOs.  Upon  winding  up  of  the 
fund,  the  intermediary  can  return  the  principal  investment  made  by  the  investors  while offering 
to  provide  tax-exemption  certificates in lieu of the dividends generated by the fund.  The role of 
the  intermediary  in  this  structure  could  be  played  by  a  financial  institution  that  is  already 
operating an asset management company (AMC).  

Figure 1: Donations through a Charity Fund 

 

The Social/Development Impact Bond structure (Structure 2A in Figure 4.1) 
A  skeletal  framework  for  an  impact  bond  model  is  presented  in  Figure  2  below.  Here,  a 
structured  finance  framework  involving  implementation  agencies  (or  NPOs)  working  towards 
similar  social  outcomes  is  aggregated  by  an  intermediary.  The  intermediary  attracts  outcome 
funders  with  a  promise  of  pre-defined  outcomes.  It  attracts  risk  investors  for  up-front  capital 
with  the  incentive  of  significant  returns  upon  the  achievement  of  desired  social  outcomes.  It  is 
also  essential  that  these  structures  require  the  intermediary  to  invest  in  these  bonds  or  assume a 
first  loss  guarantee  position  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  incentives  of  the intermediary and those 
of  the risk investors are aligned. This would involve a fixed term contractual agreement between 
several stakeholders  such  as the following:  

 
1.  A  collection  of  implementation  agencies  or  NPOs  working  in the same sector  accessing 

credit for an activity  that  creates social impact. 
 

 

57 

2.  Risk  investors  aggregated  by  the  intermediary  to  provide  up-front  capital  with  the 

incentive  of significant  returns  upon the achievement  of desired social outcomes. 
 

3.  Outcome  funders  who  are  investors  interested  in  creating  social  impact  in  the  same 
sector  as  the  implementation  agencies.  They  will  pay  out  based  on  the  social  impact 
resulting  from activities  of the implementation  agencies.   
 

4.  Third-party  evaluators  who  are  agencies  employed  for  a fee to  provide monitoring and 

evaluation  services  to assess  the impact of individual  implementation  agencies. 
 

5.  Intermediary  or  impact  fund  that  would  intermediate  between  the  risk  investors, 
performance  funders,  third  party  evaluators  and  implementation  agencies.    The  main 
function  of  the  intermediary  is  to  identify  implementation  agencies  working  towards 
common  impact  parameters,  to  standardize  the  product  offering  for  performance 
funders  and  implementation  agencies,  and  to  contractually  engage  risk  investors  and 
third-party evaluators.   

Figure 2: Financing through Social Impact Bonds 

 

In a typical  DIB pay-for-success model, the outcome funder generally shifts the risk of economic 
loss  from  non-performance  of  the  contract  to  private  investors  via  the  intermediaries.  In  the 
Indian  context,  domestic  government  agencies  and/or  outcome  funders  may  identify  a  social 
issue  that  they  want  to  focus  on,  such  as  primary  education,  public health, or the  prevention of 
early  child  marriages. The intermediary organisation raises funds from investors and contractually 
engages  implementation  agencies  and  third-party  evaluators.  Upon  successful  achievement  and 
verification  of  the  outcome-metrics,  the  outcome  funders  make  a  payment  to  the  investors 
through  the  intermediaries.  However,  if  the  desired  social  outcomes  are  not  achieved,  the 
outcomes  funders  may  choose  to  not  make  any  payments to the intermediary and the investors 
may  risk  losing  their  investments  in  part  or  full,  depending  on  the  terms  of  the  DIB

arrangements.  There  would  be  a  need  for  standardised  impact  measurements  and  licensing 
structures  for 3rd party evaluators.   
 
Pay-for-success through lending partners (Structure 3A in Figure 4.1)  
NPOs are subject to legal constraints on what they  may do with their profits. For example, to be 
registered  under  Section 8 of the Companies Act, an enterprise must be established “for promoting 
a  set  of  social activities provided the profits, if any, or other income is applied for promoting only the objects of the 
company  and  no  dividend  is  paid  to its members”. Thus, a Section 8 company cannot raise funds in the 
form  of  equity.  Debt  instruments,  on  the  other  hand,  are  not ruled out100. Access to sustainable 
finance  in  the  form  of  term  loans  is  an  attractive  option  for  NPOs  to  implement  innovative 
programmes  that  require  commercial  capital  to  scale.  However,  creditors  such  as  banks  and 
finance  companies  would  look  to  mitigate  the  risk  of default by either asking for evidence of a 
steady stream of revenue or (more commonly) collateral in the form of assets. This may be a tall 
ask  for  many  NPOs  even  if  they  are  revenue-generating.  In  such  cases,  the  debt  offering  may 
have to be structured  in a particular way to attract lenders. 
 
A  structured  finance  solution  can  work  for  an  NPO  or  a  cluster  of  NPOs working towards a 
common  social  outcome  across  different  regions  of  the  country.  This  would  involve  a 
contractual  agreement  between  several stakeholders as discussed in the previous section, with the 
difference  being  that  here,  lending  partners  such  as  banks  or  non-bank  financial  companies 
(NBFC)  will  provide  the  liquidity  instead  of  risk  investors.  A  skeletal  form  of  a  structured 
finance  solution  is provided in  Figure 3 below.  

Figure 3: Pay-for-success through lending partners 

In  this  structure,  the  intermediary  would  identify  a  well-tested  intervention  employed  by  an 
implementation agency (an NPO or a cluster of NPOs) to create social impact. The intermediary 
would  identify  lending  partners  to  provide  a  multi-year  unsecured  lending  facility  to  the  NPO 
implementation  agency  to  scale  its  operations.  The  intermediary  would  also  identify  and  on-

board  one  or  more  outcome  funders  who  would  be  willing to pay for a predetermined set of 
outcomes  that  the  program aims to achieve. An initial portion of these funds from the outcome 
funder  can  be  held  in  escrow  by  the  intermediary  to  help  make interest payments to the lender 
while the principal payments would be made only upon the achievement of outcomes. The credit 
risk  in this structure would be determined by the ability of the implementation agency to achieve 
the  outcomes  which  in  turn  would  release  the  payments  from  the  outcome  funder.  Therefore, 
these funding structures would only work for well-tested programmes that are ready to be scaled 
up  as  only  these  could  provide  the  lending  partner  enough  confidence  to  originate  these assets. 
In  order  to  mitigate  any  misalignment  of  incentives,  the  intermediary  can  offer  credit 
enhancements  in  the  form  of  first-loss  default  guarantee  (where  the  intermediary agrees to bear 
first losses on an investment in order to reduce the credit risk and thus motivate  other lenders to 
participate).   
 
It  is  important  to  note  that  such  a  structure  can  exist  without  a  lending  partner  where  funding 
for  innovative  programmes  is  aggregated  by  an  intermediary  and  disbursed  to  implementation 
agencies  as  grants.  However,  a  commercial  lender  can  bring  an  immediate  pool  of  capital  of 
larger  sizes  that  would  be  harder to mobilise from philanthropic sources. While this might seem 
to  be  a  risky  investment,  the  motivation  for  lenders  to  participate  in  these  structures  may  exist 
given  that  priority  sector  lending  (PSL)  norms,  as  defined  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI), 
include  loans for the purposes of creating  social infrastructure101. 
 
Pay-for-success through grants (Structure 3B in Figure 4.1) 
Using  CSR grants for pay-for-success models is an innovative funding mechanism which ensures 
that CSR funds are deployed effectively as payment is made only when social impact is achieved. 
A skeletal  form of such  a structure  is presented in Figure 4 below.  
 
In  this  structure,  the  CSR arm of a corporation selects an area where it wishes to create positive 
social  impact  and  selects  an  NPO  for  implementation.  CSR  capital  is  put in an escrow account 
earmarked for pay-for-success, for a pre-defined time period over which the impact is expected 
to  be  created  (say,  3  years).  The  CSR  funder  also  appoints  and  bears  the  cost  of  a  third -party 
evaluator  distinct  from  the  corporation  and  the  NPO.  Based  on  the intervention, outcomes are 
jointly  identified by the CSR funder, NPO and third-party evaluator, and targets are set up-front 
for  the  NPO  to  achieve.  To  achieve  the  outcomes,  the  NPO  requires  capital  to  carry  out  the 
intervention,  and  these  come  from  the  fourth  entity  in  the  structure,  an  interim  funding partner 
(typically  a domestic philanthropic  organization,  and distinct  from the third-party evaluator).   
 
Upon  completion  of  the  intervention,  or  at  the  stipulated  milestones  of  the  intervention,  the 
third-party evaluator verifies the impact achieved by the NPO and submits its report to the CSR 
funder.  If  the  CSR  funder  finds  that  the  NPO  has  achieved  the  outcomes,  then  it pays out the 
CSR  capital  from  the  escrow  account  partly  to  the  interim  funding  partner  to cover the latter’s 
cost of implementing the program, and partly to the NPO in the form of an accelerator grant up 
to 10% of the program cost in case the NPO exceeds the pre-defined outcome targets. The grant 
to  the  NPO  is  designed  to  provide  additional  support  for  non-programmatic  areas  such  as 
research,  capacity  building,  etc.  If  the  CSR  funder  finds  that  the  NPO  has  not  achieved  the 
outcomes,  then it either rolls over the CSR capital in the escrow account (if the pre-defined time 
period  is  not  yet  over),  or  routes  the  CSR  capital  to  items  provided  under  Schedule  7  of  the 
Companies  Act  such  as  the  PM’s Relief Fund (if the pre-defined time period is over). If, during

the  time  that  the  CSR  capital  is  in  escrow,  it  accumulates  interest,  then  this  interest  remains  in 
the account.

We now present  concrete examples of some of the structures,  where they exist. 
 
Mutual Funds 
The  HDFC  Charity  Fund for Cancer Cure was started with the principal objective of providing 
financial aid for treatment of needy cancer patients. The project provides financial aid up to Rs. 5 
lakhs  per  patient.  The  project  has  transformed  the  lives  of  over  7,400  underprivileged  cancer 
patients  across  the  country,  many  of  whom  completed  their  treatment  and  returned  to 
productive  life  again.  The  Fund  works  as  follows:  HDFC  AMC  solicits  funds  from  social-
minded  investors  who  wish  to  donate  returns  made  on  their  money,  either  partially or fully, to 
provide  financial  assistance  to  cancer  patients.  The  funds  are  then  invested  in  conventional 
assets,  predominantly  debt  securities,  and  the  interest  income  arising  from  these  investments are 
given  to  the  Indian  Cancer Society (ICS). Being closed-ended with a tenure of 3 years,  the Fund 
returns  the  principal  back  to  the  investors  every  3  years and raises a fresh round of capital.  The 
shareholders  receive  a  tax  benefit  under  80G of Income Tax Act to the extent of the dividends 
foregone by them every year subject to prescribed limits102.   
 
The  project  has  been  implemented  at  a  pan-India  level  with  20%  of the beneficiaries being less 
than  15  years  of  age  and 43% of the beneficiaries between 16-45 years of age, as per the recent 
demographic data issued  by ICS.

Since its inception, the fund has increased its scope for impact by steadily growing the number of 
patients  it  offers  help  to.  It  is  now  in  its  third  cycle  of  operation.  In  the  first  cycle,  only  retail 
investors  contributed  to  the  fund,  whereas  from  the  second  cycle  on,  HDFC  AMC  began  to 
match  investor  contributions  on  an  equal  basis.  Therefore,  this  fund  provides  an  illustration  of 
both  structure  1A  and  structure  1B.  From  raising Rs. 0.64 crores for aiding 94 patients in 2012, 
the  fund  has  grown  tremendously  to  disburse  more  than  Rs.  129  crores  to  7469 patients as of 
2019.  
  
Quantum  Mutual  Fund’s  SMILE  facility  and  HelpYourNPO  Foundation’s  Systematic  Giving 
Plan  are  other examples of structures that enable retail investors to donate to NPOs through the 
medium of a Mutual Fund.   
 
Development Impact Bonds 
DIBs  are  a  recent  financial  innovation  that  allows  private  investors  to  finance  social  services 
provided  by  NPOs.  The  investors  are  repaid  with  an  additional  return  by  outcome  funders  if 
providers  achieve  expected  social  outcomes  but  lose  their  investment  if  providers  fail  to  meet 
those  outcomes. Since  their  introduction  in  2010,  DIBs  have  become  a  popular  structure  for 
impact investing.  There have been at least 61 impact bonds issued across 16 countries103.   
 
India’s  first  DIB  was  launched  in  2015  by Educate Girls, along with UBS Optimus Foundation 
(UBSOF)  and  Children's  Investment  Fund  Foundation  (CIFF).  In  this  structure,  CIFF  (as  an 
outcome payer) promises to pay back the investor, UBSOF, the original investment amount plus 
extra  returns  if  the  agreed  targets  are  delivered  by  Educate  Girls  (the  service  provider).  The 
expected  outcomes  of  this  investment  were  an  increase  in  the  enrolment  of  marginalized  girls 
and  progress  in  literacy  and  numeracy  outcomes,  and  these  were  assessed  by  an  independent 
evaluator.  Instiglio,  a  financing  consultancy  firm,  designed  the  bond  and  IDInsight,  a  research 
firm,  was  the  designated  impact  evaluator.  While  UBSOF  played  the  role  of  both  the  investor 
and  intermediary  in  this  structure,  there  would  be  specialised  intermediaries  required  in  funding 
vehicles  when  multiple  implementation  agencies  are  involved  across  different  regions104.  Having 
achieved  160%  of  its  learning target, the Educate girls impact bond has motivated the execution 
of more impact bond structures in India such as the Utkrisht Impact Bond which aims to impact 
maternal  health  outcomes  in  Rajasthan  and  the  Lakhpati  Kisan  Bond  which  aims  to  increase 
income for small and marginal farmers.   
 
Lending partners 
In  the  pure  case  of  structure  3A,  the  lending  partner  bears  some  risk  if  the  promised  social 
impact  is  not  created.  The  intermediary’s role is to choose implementation agencies (NPOs) in a 
way  that  will  minimize  this  risk,  and  also  to  bear  some  risk  itself  by  providing  first-loss 
guarantees.  A  variation  on  this  structure  that  leverages  CSR  contributions  to  play  the  role  of 
outcome  funding  is  the  Livelihood  Impact  Fund  designed  by  Social  Alpha  as  part  of  the 
Lakhpati Kisan Project.

The  intermediary  here  is  a  wealth  manager  (the  Livelihood Impact Fund) that has raised money 
from a large Indian bank in the form of a 3-year unsecured loan facility which is to be repaid in 3 
instalments.  The  money is then disbursed to an NPO that has developed a high-impact agri-tech 
intervention  to  help  small  and  marginal  farmers,  and  wishes  to  reach  8500  farmer  households 
across  three  districts  in  India  (Dahod,  Kheonjar  and  Khunti).  The  farmers  do  not  bear  any 
liability,  and  so  the  repayments  are  financed  on  an  instalment  basis  via  CSR  contributions.  The 
CSR  cannot  substitute  for  the  initial  bank  loan  because  the  initial  requirement  was large enough 
that  aggregating CSR contributions (which are small in size) would have been infeasible, and also 
CSR  expenditures  have  to be accounted for on an annual basis  whereas the initial amount raised 
would have to be disbursed over 3 years. On the other hand, CSR contributions can be raised in 
small amounts on an annual  basis to make the loan repayments each year.   
 
It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  CSR  contributions  do  not  w ork  as  a  loan  guarantee,  but  rather  as 
outcome  funding  because if the agri-tech intervention fails to deliver impact, the wealth manager 
would fail to deploy the CSR contributions it has raised, to make the repayments. Therefore, the 
initial  loan  is  risk  capital,  even  though  the  risk  is  mitigated  greatly  by  the  fact  that  the  agri-tech 
intervention  is  itself  well-tested,  and  the  only  imperative  here  is  to  scale  that  intervention 
program.  
 
Grants-in, Grants-out 
There are interesting  variations  on this format that exist in practice.   
 
The  first  kind  of  possible  variation  is  a  syndicate  funding  structure  allowing  governments  and 
large  philanthropic  foundations  to  participate  alongside  other funders.  One such example is The 
Power  of  Nutrition,  a  UK-based  charitable  foundation  established  by the Children's Investment 
Fund  Foundation, UBS  Optimus  Foundation, Department  for  International  Development 
(DFID), UNICEF and World Bank. In this model, the foundation  operates as a lead  funder and 
first  identifies  projects  that  provide  basic  nutrition  supplements  and  services,  and  education 
through  multiple  implementation  agencies105.  Then,  it  invites  corporates  to  co-donate  in  these 
projects  towards  the  fulfilment  of  their  CSR  requirements.  Such  a  model  could  be  a  powerful 
tool  to  drive  significant  funding  towards  solving  fundamental  welfare  challenges  in  different 
parts  of  the  country  such  as  the  North-East  which  is  suffering  from  a  lack  of  adequate  social 
investment.  Another  example  of  this  syndicate  model  is  Gates  Philanthropy  Partners  (GPP) 
which  allows  donors  to  co-donate  in  the  philanthropic  projects  that  the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation  chooses to fund.  
 
The  second  kind  of  possible  variation  is  grants  made  to  large  NPOs  (which  are  the 
intermediaries)  that  in  turn  provides  grants  to smaller groups using innovative mechanisms. As a 
specialized  example  of  this,  Pratham  and  Godrej  Properties  Ltd. (GPL)  have  created  an 
innovative  model  that  boosts  micro-entrepreneurship  within  the  construction  industry.  GPL 
observed  a  short  and  irregular  working  capital  cycle  (time  taken to  turn  current  net  assets  and 
liabilities  into  cash)  and  a  lack  of  access  to  loans  for  small  contractors.  Both these factors were 
deterrents  to  scale.  Pratham,  one  of  the  largest  NPOs  in  India,  acted  as  an  intermediary  to 
identify  micro  and  small  contractors  without  a  formal  financial  footprint  or  credit  history,  and 
also a financial institution that would advance loans to these contractors. GPL then made a grant 
to Pratham, which was used as a loan guarantee.

Annexure 5: The case of Northern Arc Capital Limited 

Northern Arc Capital’s  (NACL’s) mission is to provide efficient and reliable access to capital for 
institutions  that  impact  financially  excluded  households  and  enterprises.  It  acts  as  a  bridge 
between  high-quality  debt  originators and debt capital market investors. It takes care to invest as 
principal  in  most  transactions  /  originators  it  backs.  Stringent  diligence  and  continuous 
monitoring have ensured very low delinquency  rates since  inception. 
 
NACL  provides  efficient  and  reliable  access  to  debt  capital  for  institutions  that  impact  low 
income  households.  Since inception, NACL has provided financing of more than Rs. 750 billion 
to  over  175  institutions  that  provide  financial  services  to  unbanked  or  underbanked 
households.  With  a  balance  sheet  size  of  Rs.  42  billion,  it  derives  income  from  loans, 
investments  and  debt  capital  markets  (DCM)  arrangement  businesses,  while  maintaining  tight 
control  on  asset  quality.  For  this  NACL  relies  on  internally  developed  stringent  underwriting 
guidelines  based  on  acquiring  deep  expertise  in  each  sector  and  on  its internal risk management 
platform that  helps it to maintain  a high-quality  asset  book even in times of stress  for the sector.

Annexure 6: A trading platform for CSR-spends 

A  trading  platform  could help alleviate the problem of unspent CSR funds.  This is important as 
CSR  funds  in  many  cases  remain  unutilised.  For  instance,  at  the  smaller  end  of  the spectrum, a 
company  that  has  made  Rs.25  crore  profits  for  the  past 3 years will have to show CSR spends 
amounting to 2% of those profits or Rs.50 lakh.  Given the yearly cadence to making CSR spends 
by  corporates,  high  impact  projects  that  meet  all  due  diligence  criteria  could  still  get  under-
funded  due  to  the  quantum  of  CSR  money  the  company  wants  to  give  in  the  year  (even  if  it 
wishes  to  give more and provide additional support). Smooth implementation of projects could 
get stalled due to these constraints. Companies also find it difficult to commit to multi-year CSR 
spends  based  on  projected  profits for future years, thus making the CSR route one of uncertain 
cash flows for non-profit social enterprises.   
 
A trading platform could help solve this problem by creating “CSR certificates” for the excess CSR 
spends  of  a  company. Such certificates would have a validity of 3-5 years but may be used only 
once.  Allowing  for  multiyear  validity  of  the  certificates  overcomes  issues  like  a  company  being 
unable  to  find buyer(s) in a particular year. Such a platform will help companies with excess and 
deficit  CSR  spends  discover  each  other  and  can  enable  smooth  transactions  across  different 
ticket  sizes.  While  such  a  bilateral  trade  essentially  amounts  to  company  A  paying  company  B 
their  CSR  money  to  reimburse  company  B’s  excess  CSR  expenditure  and  this  in  indeed 
theoretically possible, the problem of company A discovering company B remains unsolved, and 
further,  it  may  not  be  possible  to  effect  smooth  transactions  across  different  ticket  sizes  as this 
would  require  deal-making  across  multiple  companies.  Hence,  there  appears  to be a need for a 
third-party  platform  that  can  facilitate  such  trades.  A relevant example of such a platform is the 
RBI’s  E-Kuber  platform  which  is  an  auction  platform  for  trading  of  Priority  Sector  Lending 
Certificates  (PSLC)  between  banks  with  excess  PSL-eligible  assets  and  banks  that  have  fallen 
short of meeting their PSL targets.  It is to be noted that the PSLC does not need to be defined 
as  a  security  under the SCRA nor does it need to be a negotiable instrument. The nominal value 
of  PSLC  would  represent  the  equivalent  of  the  PSL  that  would  get  deducted  from  the  PSL 
portfolio of the seller and added to the PSL portfolio of the buyer 106. The buyer would pay a fee 
to  the  seller  which  will  be  market  determined.  The  pricing  of  a  PSLC  is  driven  by  the auction 
mechanism  and  so  the  price  that  a  bank  pays  is  in  fact  an  “expense”  that  it  incurs  to  meet  its 
annual  PSL  target.  There  is  no  credit  risk  transfer,  and  the  certificate  expires  on  31st  March of 
each year.  
 
However,  the  CSR-spend  trading  platform  would  differ  from  the  E-Kuber  platform  in 
significant  respects.  Firstly,  unlike  with  PSLCs  where  only  the  eligibility  for  PSL  gets  traded,  a 
transfer  of  CSR  certificate  must  entail  actual  transfer  of  funds  allocated  for  CSR  from  one 
company  to  the  other.  Secondly,  an  auction mechanism might not be appropriate in the nascent 
stages  of  such  a  platform  as  it  could  drive  pricing  towards  certain  types  of  projects  or  certain 
sectors  (under  schedule  VII  of  Companies  Act  2013)  to  the  detriment  of  others.  Rather, these 
transactions  must  involve  only  a  flat  transaction  fee  that  gets  charged  to the platform. This also 
avoids  the  situation  where  a  profit  can  be  made  from  the  sale  of  “excess  CSR”  certificates  by 
companies  without  taking  away  the  incentive  from  companies  to  spend  more  than  their annual 
limit on CSR on projects that they wish to fund. And finally, unlike PSLCs that expire at the end 
of each financial year, the CSR certificates will be valid for a time period that extends beyond the 
financial  year  in  which the spend occurred, usually between 3-5 years since the  occurrence of the 
spend.  If  the  platform  as described above succeeds in facilitating the trading of CSR certificates,

the  government  might  then  consider  licensing  private  platforms  that  provide  an  auction 
mechanism  for  the  trading  of  CSR  certificates  (similar  to  the  RBI’s  licenses  for  Trade 
Receivables  Discounting  Systems  or  TReDS).  However, 
this  would  require  additional 
clarifications  on  whether  CSR  certificates  must  have  the  status  of  negotiable  instruments  or  not 
and on how companies are to treat any profits from the sale of such certificates.

The SSE being envisioned  will be largely self-
governing, as the minimum reporting standard 
will make it possible for investors  to identify  the 
truly deserving social enterprises.   
 
No new or separate regulator is being proposed. 
 
The minimum reporting standard is sufficiently 
flexible to accommodate a very wide variety of 
NPOs. The social impact metrics are organized 
along broad dimensions  of measurement,  but 
leave sufficient  room for the NPO to describe 
the specific activity  that  it is engaged in, while 
signalling  its core mission adequately  and 
faithfully  to investors  and capturing  the nature of 
impact it is creating.   
There is no specific bias towards less 
measurement  in early years. Rather,  there is room 
for more flexibility  in defining  the kind of social

policies/institutions,  national  and international 
collaborations,  etc.) 

impact that a particular  NPO is creating.  This 
does not mean less  measurement,  but rather, 
more thoughtful  measurement  that is not 
necessarily  driven by a strict  quantitative  logic. 
There is also adequate room for defining social 
impact in such a way that  the scale of the 
organization  is not a hindrance  to such definition, 
and yet, the relation  between scale and impact 
can still  be captured in the reporting, should the 
NPO choose such  an approach.  
 
We are agnostic  about what the right time for 
introducing  3rd party verification  is. We have 
suggested a 5-10 year time frame to be 
conservative  rather than  aggressive, and to allow 
for the ecosystem  to develop organically  rather 
than  by strict  design. Nothing prevents those 
NPOs who wish to incorporate 3rd party 
verification  into their  reporting protocols from 
doing so, even as early as day 1 of the SSE’s 
functioning.   
 
The IRs and social auditors will assist  the NPOs 
in reporting, while the financial  costs will be 
picked up a capacity  building fund in the early 
years of the SSE.  
 
In the intermediate  term and ideal end state, 
NPOs will be required to report on the sector-
level and policy-level  impact that they are 
creating,  and this will adequately capture the 
dimension of long term systematic  change that  an 
NPO is able to effect.

more and more learning  is relying  on e-properties, 
whereas 2/3rds of our population does not have access 
to smartphones 

Aspects of reach/scale  (direct and indirect)  of 
impact, sector-level  impact, a recording of inputs 
and outputs, are all already incorporated in the 
minimum reporting standard. As such,  the 
standard is sufficiently  inclusive  and flexible to 
accommodate all the levels of differentiation 
desired by Akshara.

textbooks have linked their content  to Diksha, usage

scalability  in the design of the product/service should 
be an important metric in evaluating  the chances  of 
success  of a social enterprise 
funders should pay attention  not only to 
outputs/outcomes but also inputs/processes,  thus  for 
e.g. not only learning  outcomes but also whether 
teachers  are equipped with adequate teaching/learning 
materials and training,  etc. and this is especially 
important because not all outcomes are achievable  in a 
year (sustainable  improvements in learning  outcomes 
can take 4-5 years)

impact metrics should include  indirect outreach  (for e.g. 
TEA works with state governments  that support 30 
million children) 
the ideal end state of using  RCTs to attribute impact is 
problematic insofar as RCTs are very expensive,  and 
furthermore even an RCT will fail if the intended 
beneficiaries  have received interventions  from multiple 
agencies  at once 

  outcomes in our case are particularly  long-term since 
TEA works in the area of early childhood education, 
whose benefits accrue over decades, so will the impact 
reporting standard cause organizations  like ours to be 
crowded out? 

  disclosing  payroll information may draw unnecessary 

scrutiny  from IT authorities 

  disclosing  the compensation ratio of highest  paid to 

lowest paid employee may discourage crossover talent, 
whom one may be willing to pay more 

 

The recommendations of the report make 
adequate provision for assistance  to smaller 
NPOs on reporting, both operationally  and 
financially.  Please see the WG’s responses  to 
comments earlier in this table.   
 
“Self-reporting” does not mean that NPOs will 
not be accountable  for the reporting that they do. 
Registration  with IRs will help to generate 
credibility  as well as competence with reporting, 
and NPOs could lose their  registered status  if 
they are found to be violating trust in any way. 
This  is happening  already via the guidelines  and 
procedures by which IRs such  as GuideStar 
perform registration.   
 
We expect that proper third-party verification 
protocols will organically  emerge as the SSE 
evolves, and that the actors in this  space (doing 
the verification,  i.e.) can self-regulate  via an SRO, 
thus  not requiring  the government to intervene  in 
their processes  and operations. The report charts 
out just such  a course for the existing  IRs, and 
recommends that the SSE support and enable 
this  emergence.  
 
The use of RCTs is only envisioned  over a 10-
year horizon.  We feel confident that the state  of 
impact evaluation  via RCTs will become more 
sophisticated  in that time, and other, simpler, less 
expensive  methods of impact evaluation  will also 
emerge, that do not compromise on rigor, yet are 
able to capture causal impact to a reasonable

extent.   
 
The intent  for long-term outcomes can be 
incorporated into the reporting standard without 
much difficulty. The standard is sufficiently 
flexible that NPOs such  as TEA might be able to 
innovate  input and output metrics that speak to 
the long term impact that  their activities  are 
creating.  This will certainly  enthuse  investors  that 
care about such  impact but are not necessarily 
able to measure it precisely  in the short term.  
 
The reporting standard incorporates some room 
for disclosure  on payroll information.  The 
specific metrics are indicative  only. What the 
actual set of metrics  will be, is left to be 
discovered as part of a wider set of financial 
reporting standards,  by the IRs in consultation 
with ICAI, as recommended in the report.
