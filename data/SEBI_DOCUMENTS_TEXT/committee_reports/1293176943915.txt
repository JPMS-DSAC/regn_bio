Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

PREFACE 
 
The  SEBI  (Underwriters)  Rules  and  Regulations,  1993  deals  primarily  with  issues  such  as 
registration,  capital  adequacy,  obligation  and  responsibilities  of  the  underwriters.  The 
provisions  of  SEBI  (Underwriters)  Rules  and  Regulations,  1993  (“Regulations”)  were 
notified on October 8, 1993.  
 
Scope of Underwriting  
 
Underwriting  services  have  been  traditionally  provided  by  financial  institutions,  banks, 
brokers who are members of stock exchanges, merchant bankers, mutual funds and persons 
with adequate financial capacity, appropriate standing and experience. As per rule 3(1) of the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Underwriters)  Rules,  1993  no  person  can  act  as 
underwriter  unless  he  holds  a  certificate  granted  by  SEBI  under  the  Securities  and 
Exchanges Board of India (Underwriters) Regulations, 1993. Rule 3(2) exempts every stock 
broker  or  merchant  banker  holding  a  valid  certificate  of  registration  under  section  12  of 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  to  obtain  separate  certificate  for 
underwriting. As per rule 4(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Underwriters) 
Rules, 1993, an underwriter is required to enter into a valid agreement with the issuer entity 
and  the  said  agreement  among  other  things  should  define  the  allocation  of  duties  and 
responsibilities between him and the issuer entity.  
 
Background 
 
The provisions of the Regulation have by and large served well in fulfilling its object and 
purpose. However the rapid evolution in the domestic capital market over the past few years 
and its integration with world markets has given rise to new challenges. It was realised that in 
order to make the Regulations more efficient and effective, it was necessary to take a fresh 
look  at  the  Regulations  and  undertake  a  dispassionate,  well-informed  review  of  the 
provisions of the Regulations.

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), with a view to addressing these concerns, 
constituted a Committee. The terms of reference of the Committee are:- 
 
(cid:190) To review the working of the Regulations 
(cid:190) To consider suitable suggestions in the Regulations, in the light of experience gained so 

far and in view of the changes in capital market and practices. 

 
The Committee comprised of the following members: - 
 
Mr Vallabh Bhansali, Director, Enam Financial Consultants Pvt Ltd – Chairman 
Mr Vimal Bhutani, Vice President, SBI Capital Markets Ltd 
Mr B. Madhuprasad, MD, Keynote Corporate Services Ltd 
Ms Dipti Neelakantan, Executive Director, J M Morgan Stanley Pvt. Ltd.  
Mr Vishwavir Ahuja, CEO, Bank of America 
Mr T. R. Ramaswami, CEO, AMBI 
 
SEBI was represented by: 
Mr Amit Kapoor 
 
The Committee discussed and  considered  several  issues, which  were  raised  before  it.  The 
Committee  debated  on  the  market  conditions  and  the  environment  prevailing  during  the 
days of Controller of Capital Issue (CCI) as also during the time when the Regulations were 
drafted and the dynamic changes that have since taken place. The Committee reviewed the 
role of underwriters and the underwriting practices adopted during evolution of the capital 
markets. The Committee also dwelled upon the likely changes in capital market in the near 
future, its consequent pressures on underwriting and aligning underwriting practices with 
market developments. An underwritten issue today does not denote weakness requiring 
an underwriting support. On the contrary it adds to the issue's strength. It shows that there 
are  intermediaries  who  after  assessing  the  risks  have  decided  to  back  the  issue.  The 
Committee believes that its suggestions would contribute greatly to the capital market. It is 
with this objective in mind that the Committee has made the following recommendations.

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

The recommendations are categorised under different headings as under: 
 

1.  Definition of “Underwriting” 

 

 

 

 

1.1  Underwriting, as per rule 2(g) of the Regulations, is defined to mean “an agreement 
with or without conditions to subscribe to the securities of a body corporate when 
the existing shareholders of such body corporate or the public do not subscribe to 
the securities offered to them”.  

1.2  It was felt that the entire definition needed an overhaul since it fell short of practical 
need. The existing definition restricts underwriting to “subscription to securities”. It 
also restricts the underwriting to issues by a body corporate and excludes “offer for 
sale” from its definition.  

1.3  In practice, an underwriter need not always subscribe himself. He may also procure 
subscription from a third party. Such arrangement with third party is not captured in 
the current definition.  

 
1.4  Section  76  of  the Companies Act  too recognizes  that  commission  may  be  paid  in 
consideration  of  subscribing  /  procuring  subscription.  The  model  underwriting 
agreement  prescribed  by  SEBI  also 
to 
underwrite/procure subscription. 

records  underwriter’s  agreement 

The Committee recommends that  

 

S.1.  The existing definition of “underwriting” may be extended to include 

“subscribe / procure subscription”. The suggestion will bring the existing 

definition in line with Companies Act and model underwriting agreement. 

The definition may read as follows: 

 

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002 
3 

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

“an agreement to subscribe to or procure subscription for securities, issued 

or offered for sale, remaining unsubscribed. Underwriting includes sub-

underwriting” 

 
S.2.  The same definition may also be adopted in SEBI’s Disclosure and Investor 

Protection (DIP) Guidelines, 2000.  

 

S.3  The words “subscribe / procure subscription” may be replaced for the word 

“subscribe” in regulation 14(iii) of the Regulations.  

 
 
2.  Capital Adequacy requirement 

 

 

 

2.1  The  existing  capital  adequacy  prescribed  by  regulation  7(1)  of  the  Regulations 

requires minimum net worth of Rs 20 lacs.  

2.2  The capital adequacy for the underwriter was prescribed on October 8, 1993. Since 
then the capital markets have evolved and matured to a great extent. The minimum 
net  worth  requirements  of  almost  all  financial  intermediaries  including  merchant 
bankers and brokers has increased substantially in last few years.  

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

2.3  Minimum net worth for a merchant banker has gone up from Rs 100 lacs to Rs 500 
lacs, while for a broker on The Stock Exchange Mumbai (BSE) it is Rs 50 lacs and 
on National Stock Exchange (NSE) it is Rs 200 lacs. The method of computation of 
net worth for each category is distinct from each other as shown in Annexure “A”. 

 
2.4  It is the ability of the underwriter to satisfy his commitment, which shall make the 
capital  market  a  safer  place  and  increase  in  minimum  net  worth  is  a  step  in  that 
direction. A higher floor shall ensure committed and quality underwriters. 

 
2.5  Underwriting  being  a  financial  risk,  it  is  imperative  for  an  underwriter  to  have 

adequate net worth to finance the risk.    

 

The Committee recommends that  

 

 

 

S.4.  The minimum net worth requirement for underwriters may be increased to 

Rs 100 lacs. The underwriting capability of merchant bankers, brokers and 

entities registered with other regulators will be subject to satisfaction of 

norms prescribed herein. 

 

S.5.  Underwriters shall submit to the lead manager a certificate from a chartered 

accountant certifying its net worth and fructified outstanding obligations 
every time it seeks underwriting. 

 
 
3.  Computation of net worth 
 
3.1  The current definition of net worth as per explanation to regulation 7 includes paid 

up capital and free reserves.  

3.2  It is felt that the current definition is not explicit and specific.  

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

3.3  For  the  purposes  of  underwriting,  the  liquidity  of  the  underwriter  at  any  point  of 
time is more critical than net worth as on a particular date. The current definition 
does not give adequate weightage to tangible and liquid assets of the underwriters.  

3.4  Options  such  as  computing  net  tangible  asset  or  obtaining  certificate  of  liquidity 

from auditors are available. 

3.5  SEBI  has  prescribed  a  method  of  computing  net  worth  for  brokers  on  BSE  as 
reproduced in Annexure A. NSE also prescribes a method of computing net worth. 
Since this method is already tested in and adopted by the market, it may be extended 
for underwriters subject to suitable changes.  

The Committee recommends that  

S.6.  The definition of net worth may be tightened and computed more explicitly 

as follows: 
Net worth =  Capital + Free Reserves  

 

Less: Non-allowable assets viz., 

(a)  Fixed assets 

(b)  Unlisted securities 

(c)  Bad deliveries 

(d)  Doubtful debts and advances  

(e)  Prepaid expenses, losses 

(f)  Intangible assets 

(g)  30% of value of marketable securities and 30% of value 

of pledged securities net of outstanding liability

4.  Limit on underwriting obligations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.1  The  current  limit  of  maximum  20  times  net  worth  as  per  regulation  15(2)  of 
Regulations  was  believed  to  be  high  in  view  of  the  fact  that  net  worth  was  not 
explicitly defined.  

4.2  It was recognised that capital adequacy requirements of financial intermediaries has 

been consistently revised upwards in last few years.  

4.3  It  was  also  appreciated  that  underwriters  with  higher  networth  would  be  able  to 
arrange financing in a more efficient manner than those with a low networth. On the 
other hand, underwriters with low net worth and higher multiple stand a greater risk 
of default.  

4.4  Therefore, proposal to introduce slabs for limits on underwriting obligations based 

on net worth of the underwriter was found appropriate. 

 

The Committee recommends that  

S.7.  The leverage should be linked to net worth. The following slabs may be 

adopted for determining the leverage for underwriters. 

Net worth   

 

  Multiple of net worth 

Between Rs 1 cr to Rs 5 crs  

Greater than Rs 5 crs

5.  Subscription in case of devolvement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.1  The existing limit of 30 days for subscription/procuring subscription by underwriter 
as per model agreement is at a variance with limit of 45 days as per regulation 15(3) 
of the Regulations. 

5.2  Besides, both the limits are antiquated in the current environment when allotment in 
fixed price issue gets done within 30 days from issue closure and in book building 
within 15 days from bid closure. There is a need to review the existing time frame. 

5.3  However, the revised time frame has to also take into the account the time required 
for the registrar to the issue to co-ordinate with the bankers to the issue in order to 
determine  the  extent  of  under-subscription  and  the  underwriters’  obligation.  The 
figures are then to be authenticated by an auditor before notices can be sent out to 
the underwriters. After receiving the notices, the underwriters should be allowed a 
fair period of time to fund subscription or procure subscription. 

5.4  In the current environment, an investor is free to withdraw his subscription to the 
issue  before  allotment.  There  could  be  instances  when  the  investor  decides  to 
withdraw from the issue due to devolvement on the underwriters. In such cases the 
underwriter  is  exposed  to  a  larger  financial  risk  for  no  fault  of  his.  The  investors 
should be allowed to withdraw only in case of material developments which put their 
investment at risk. In all other cases investors having subscribed to the issue should 
not be permitted to withdraw after a particular milestone. 

5.5  Similar  principle  has  been  adopted  in  the  latest  amendments  to  Securities  and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers) 
Regulations,  1997  wherein  the  shareholder  may  withdraw  acceptance  tendered  by 
him  upto  three  working  days  prior  to  the  date  of  closure  of  the  offer  and  not 
thereafter.  

5.6  In a book building issue, underwriting is done once the price is discovered and bids 
allocated.  It  is  essentially  done  to  insure  against  defaults  from  bidders.  Syndicate

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

members are responsible for ensuring that the amount allocated to each is subscribed 
in  full.  However  this  amount  may  differ  from  what  is  underwritten  by  them 
individually. As a result, there could arise possibilities where although the syndicate 
member  is  responsible  for  default  in  payment  by  his  investor,  the  underwriting 
commission is paid to another member of the syndicate. 

 

 

 

 

 

5.7  The merchant banker’s role in collecting devolvement proceeds was reviewed. It was 
felt  that  although  underwriting  is  a  contract  between  the  Issuer  Company  and 
underwriters,  the  issuer  company  relies  on  the  lead  manager  for  appointment  and 
performance of underwriters. In such a situation, the lead manager should to the best 
of its capability facilitate collection of devolvement proceeds. It was also discussed 
whether  lead  manager  should  co-ordinate  the  dispatch  of  devolvement  notices  to 
underwriters and the subsequent follow up for collection of devolvement proceeds.  

The Committee recommends that  

S.8.  For fixed price issue, the issuer company shall communicate devolvement 

details to the underwriter by giving a preliminary notice within 7 days of 

issue closure followed by final notice with the auditors certificate within 18 

days of issue closure. Thereafter the underwriter shall subscribe / procure 

subscription within 7 days of the final notice from the issuer company. 

 

S.9.  Application once made in a fixed price issue may not be withdrawn after 

issue closure. Bids once made in a book building issue may not be 

withdrawn after bid closure.  

S.10. The earliest closing date may be done away with. The issue may remain 

open for minimum 3 days and maximum 10 days except where otherwise 

specifically prescribed by SEBI. 

S.11. In a book building issue the syndicate member shall underwrite all shares 

allocated to bidders who have bid through him, receive underwriting 

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002 
9 

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

commission on such bids and get devolved shares, if any. Alternately if the 

syndicate member is given underwriting which is different from the bids 

allocated to bidders who have bid through him, that syndicate member’s 

obligation shall be restricted to the amount underwritten by him. The 

syndicate member who has procured the bid shall retain the brokerage. 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

S.12. Lead managers (as mentioned in inter-se allocation of responsibilities) shall 

be given the responsibility of determining devolvement obligations, sending 

devolvement  notices  to  the  underwriters,  facilitating  collection  of 

devolvement proceeds.  

6.  Fees to Underwriter 

6.1  Currently underwriting commission is paid to the underwriters much after the issue 

closure and listing permissions are obtained.  

6.2  There is no obligation on the issuer company to expedite the release of commission 
to underwriters. The earliest obligation is while making an application to the regional 
stock  exchange  for  release  of  its  1%  deposit  after  four  months  from  the  date  of 
listing permission.  

6.3  The commission/brokerage cannot be paid before listing permission, where one of 
the objects to the issue is to meet issue expenses since the funds in the issue account 
cannot be utilized unless the securities are listed on all stock exchanges where listing 
is sought. 

 
6.4  Neither  can  the  underwriting  commission  be  netted  off  against  devolvement 
proceeds due to restriction mentioned above. Thus there is a need to put onus on 
the issuer company to expedite the commission / brokerage payment.  

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002 
10 

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

The Committee recommends that  

 

 

 

 

 

 

S.13. Brokerage may be paid to the underwriter on the amount subscribed / 

procured by him against his devolvement obligation.  

 

S.14. The commission and brokerage may be paid after obtaining listing 

approvals from stock exchanges but before obtaining trading permission.  

 

S.15. Stock exchanges may insist on certificate from lead manager or auditor for 

payment of commission / brokerage before granting trading permission 

approval. 

7.  Registration criteria and registration fees 

7.1  According  to  rule  3(1)  of  the  Regulations,  no  person  shall  act  as  an  underwriter 

unless he holds a certificate granted by SEBI under the Regulations. 

7.2  One of the criteria for considering application for registration as underwriter, as per 
regulation  6  and  Form  A  of  the  Regulations,  is  necessary  infrastructure  and  past 
experience in underwriting. However, adequate infrastructure and experience are not 
clearly defined. Neither do these criteria ensure commitment towards underwriting. 
It is believed that underwriting involves a financial risk where adequate net worth is 
critical rather than adequate infrastructure and experience. 

7.3  Most of the underwriters today are already registered with SEBI for some activity or 
the other. They may be merchant bankers, stock brokers, mutual funds etc. They are 
already regulated by SEBI for their actions under different regulations. Seeking one 
more registration for the same entity, as an underwriter, adds to the administrative 
burden of SEBI. Such separate registration may be avoided. 

7.4  There could be few underwriters such as banks, financial institutions etc who may 
not be registered and regulated by SEBI. However they are registered and regulated 
by some other regulators for e.g. RBI in case of banks and institutions. In such cases 

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002 
11 

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

the  respective  regulator  could  monitor  the  underwriting  activities  as  part  of  its 
regular  monitoring  of  various  other  activities  and  if  required  report  its  findings  to 
SEBI  for  necessary  action.  Thus  registration  with  any  regulator  would  be  an 
eligibility criteria but the underwriter will be governed by the Regulations. In case of 
any  default  by  the  underwriter,  the  lead  managers  will  report  the  same  to  SEBI 
through the issue monitoring reports. Thus the ability for action against underwriters 
continues with SEBI.  

The Committee recommends that  
 
S.16. Net worth may remain as the only criterion for underwriting.  

 

S.17. No separate registration may be prescribed for underwriters. Instead 

intermediaries already regulated by SEBI, Stock Exchanges, RBI or other 

regulators may be automatically allowed to undertake underwriting. 

 

S.18. There may be no separate registration and renewal fee for an underwriter 

 
8.  Code of Conduct 

8.1  The existing code of conduct as per regulation 13 and schedule III of the Regulation 

is generic.  

8.2  As  proposed  in  point  7,  there  may  be  different  regulators  monitoring  the 
performance of underwriters. Under the circumstances a separate code of conduct 
for underwriters may not be required since such regulators will have their own code 
of conduct which will apply to the underwriters. 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

The Committee recommends that  

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

S.19. There should be no separate code of conduct for underwriters. Instead a 

common code of conduct for all financial intermediaries may be suitably 

drafted and adopted.  

9.  Model underwriting agreement 

9.1  The existing model underwriting agreement as per SEBI Circular RUW Circular No 

1 (93-94) dt 19/11/93 is applicable only for fixed priced issues.  

9.2  Certain provisions of the aforesaid model underwriting agreement too have outlived 

its utility.  

9.3  There is a need to review and strengthen the model underwriting agreement for fixed 

priced issues. 

9.4  There is a need to adopt a model underwriting agreement for book built issues. The 
warranties and covenants adopted for underwriting agreement for book built issue 
may also be introduced for fixed price issue.  

The Committee recommends that  

S.20. The existing model underwriting agreement for fixed priced issues may be 

revised as follows: 

 

 

 

 

i.  In Para 3, the words “acknowledgement card” may be replaced by the

10. Mandatory underwriting 

There  has  been  some  debate  about  ‘safety  net’/  ‘hard  underwriting’  being  made 
mandatory as one of the most practical methods to boost the primary capital market.  
The following is noteworthy in this regard: 

1) 

During the CCI regime hard underwriting was compulsory.  Even after free 
pricing  was  introduced  under  SEBI  regulations,  hard  underwriting  was 
mandatory for the first few years. 

2) 

Traditionally, hard underwriting was mandatory for two important reasons: 

- 

it made entry in the capital market safe for the issuer. 

________________________________________________________________________ 
October 2002 
17 

Report of the Underwriting Committee 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 

 
3) 

4) 

- 

the prospective investors, retail as well as wholesale, felt safe that the 
underwriters had evaluated the issue and were backing the issue with 
financial commitment. 

‘Book  Built’  issues  also  have  underwriting.    However  under  the  Book 
Building  route  underwriting  covers  only  the  ‘payment  risk’  rather  than 
‘subscription risk’. 

Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) make the investment decision based on 
‘confidence’ rather than underwriting provided by the so called underwriter. 

Retail  investors,  under  the  current  guidelines  of  SEBI  get  the  price  and 
volume guidance from the QIB participation. 

There is no fall back option for the issuer to get the funds as there is no “last 
resort”. The issuer has to withdraw the issue in case of inadequate demand. 

If  an  underwritten  issue  fails  and  the  underwriters  are  unable  to  meet  the 
obligations, it disturbs the market. Similarly if a non-underwritten issue fails 
and the application money returned, it too disturbs the market. Issuers are 
driven  by  commercial  exigencies  and  considerations  to  determine  whether 
the issue should be underwritten or not. 
 
Neither ‘hard’ underwriting nor ‘soft’ underwriting have proved reliable guide 
of the post listing market price and therefore both of them fail to be a ‘safety 
net’. 

Equity  prices  are  influenced  by  complex  and  large  number  of  factors  and 
therefore ‘safety net’ insurance is very difficult to provide, particularly for the 
short-term.

What is the aggregate capability of the participants to underwrite large and 
small issues, including many issues at the same time, on an ongoing basis is a 
moot point.  

In  the  past,  the  term  lending  financial  institutions  and  banks  acted  as  the 
biggest underwriters because underwriting support was generally a part of the 
project finance provided by them. In the post ‘liberalisation’ era, not all such 
entities have either the financial ability or capital market expertise to do large 
underwriting. Banks also have some restrictions due to limits imposed by the 
Reserve Bank of India. 

What is relevant is the capability of the equity-oriented institutions such as 
Life Insurance Corporation, General Insurance Corporation and subsidiaries, 
New Insurance Companies, Mutual Funds etc. These institutions are active 
participants in the book-built issues and by earning underwriting commission 
can bring down their cost of acquisition. This should make them enthusiastic 
about underwriting. 

Hard underwriting, as practiced traditionally, makes it difficult to adjust the 
price  to  the  prevailing  market  conditions.  Improvement  is  needed  on  this 
front, which with modern day technology should not be difficult. 

It  was  seen  in  the  past  that  not  all  issuers  were  able  to  collect  the 
devolvement proceeds. In many cases, only ‘application / allotment money’ 
was  paid  and  the  issuer  was  left  shortchanged.  With  better  enforcement 
environment that is emerging, escaping underwriting liability should become 
difficult thus making underwriting more meaningful. 

Typically only a few underwriters manage the bulk of the ‘Book Built’ issues. 
Since underwriting can be a steady business for the prudent (like Insurance 
companies), it can attract more participants.
