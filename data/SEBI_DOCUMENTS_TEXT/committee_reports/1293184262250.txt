Structure of the paper 
 
This paper is broadly divided into six parts as follows: 
 
Part 1 – This part captures the basic nuances of the margin trading. Topics covered 
include the theoretical perspective, value drivers, mechanism and risks in the margin 
trading. 
 
Part  2  –  This  part  deals  with  the  present  status  of  funds  lending  and  borrowing 
mechanism  and  describes  the  number  of  alternative  business  models  for  the 
purpose. 
 
Part  3  –  This  elaborates  on  the  present  structure  of  the  securities  lending  and 
proposes number of business models to infuse efficiency in the system. As the client 
trades  on  the  borrowed  securities  by  paying  margin,  this  may  be  treated  as  the 
margin trading on the sell side. 
 
Part 4 – This part deals with the concept of Securities Banking, originating from one 
of  the  proposed  business  models  for  the  securities  lending  and  borrowing.  This 
proposal  is  expected  to  unlock  the  values  from  the  idle  holdings  of  the  small 
investors. 
 
Part 5 – This part deals with the creation of an independent organization for margin 
trading and securities lending.

Part 6 – Conclusion. 

 

Part 1  - Theoretical Perspective 

 
1.1 Meaning of margin trading 
 
Normally investors trade in securities on the strength of owned funds and securities. 
However,  sometimes,  based  on  their  outlook  about  the  market  and  some  specific 
securities in particular, they intend to trade beyond owned resources. This trading in 
the  securities  is  supported  by  the  borrowing facility for funds and securities, in the 
system. While trading with the borrowed resources, investors are required to put in a 
margin (good faith deposits) with the intermediaries and this phenomenon is called 
margin  trading.  This  margin  is  usually  a  percent  of  the  value  of  the  proposed 
transaction. 
 
Therefore, broadly speaking, margin trading is a trading in the securities market with 
the borrowed resources – funds or securities. As margin trading is providing a facility 
to investors to trade in the market with the margin money, it essentially is a leverage 
mechanism. Globally, in all the major markets the facility of the margin trading and 
securities  lending  is  available  to  the  investors.  However,  it  would  be  pertinent  to 
mention here that the business models for the margin trading and securities lending 
are different in different markets. 
 
1.2 Value drivers of the margin trading  
 
Prices  of  the  securities  in  the  market  are  determined  by  the  free  interaction  of 
demand and supply forces. Anytime availability of the buyer and seller in the system 
constitutes the essential ingredient of the Capital Market; it ensures the liquidity in 
the system, which is the hall mark of success of any market across the globe. 
 
As  margin  trading  can  be  done  on  both  the  sides  i.e.  buy  and  sell,  it  helps  in 
increasing demand for and supply of securities and funds in the market, which in turn 
contributes towards better liquidity and smooth price formation of securities. Further, 
with contracting settlement cycles, it becomes important to provide for this facility of

supporting buy and sell sides of trades for smooth settlement i.e. to reduce the fail 
trades.  
 
Margin  trading  also  facilitates  the  price  alignment  across  the  markets  through 
facilitating the arbitrage. For instance, in case of the mis-pricing between cash and 
derivatives  market,  margin  trading  supports  the  transactions  in  the  cash  market  to 
facilitate the arbitrage between the cash and derivatives, which results in the better 
price alignment across the markets.  
 
Margin trading also facilitates the hedging. For instance, if an investor holds say call 
options (right to buy the stocks) to  be exercised only after a  specific period of time, 
he may sell the securities in the cash market on margin trading and hedge his  risk. 
Similarly, the shares under say ESOP to be available to the employees after a while 
may be hedged with the help of the margin trading. 
 
Further,  margin  trading  and  trading  of  derivatives  generally  complement  rolling 
settlement,  where the time for round about transactions is limited to a day.  This  is 
why  the  markets  having  the  rolling  settlements  generally  provide  for  the  facility  of 
margin  trading.  This  is  important  for  the  efficiency  of  the  market  and  smooth 
settlement in the rolling settlement environment. 
 
Physical settlement in the derivatives specially  American  Options  also  requires  the 
availability of the funds and the securities for the smooth settlement of the trades. 
Funds  and  securities  lending  and  borrowing  become  critically  important  in  the 
environment when the derivatives are settled through the physical delivery. 
 
Based  on  the  above  points,  it  may  be  said  that  the  margin  trading  performs  the 
important  function  in  any  securities  market  and  improves  the  efficiency  and 
effectiveness of the whole system.  
 
Here, it may be slightly out of context but important to see what has happened to the 
market liquidity after the introduction of the rolling settlement. General perception is 
that post rolling settlement period, the liquidity in the  market has declined. But, the 
data available does not substantiate that. Actual data on trading after the compulsory

rolling settlement, collected from BSE and NSE is produced below. It clearly reveals 
that though there has been a sharp decline in volumes in terms of value, the decline 
in terms of quantity traded is not so sharp. The decline in value is because of low 
prices of stocks. In fact, the number of trades shows a continuous increasing trend 
over the period of time.

1.3 Motivation behind the margin trading 
 
The margin trading enables a client to purchase / sell more and thus increases his 
profits  if  the  prices  move  on  expected  lines.  It  also  amplifies  his  loss  if  the  prices 
behave  contrary  to  his  expectations.  This  amplification  effect  emanating  from 
leveraged nature of the transaction is the main motivation for a client to undertake 
margin trading. For example, an investor purchases Rs. 100 worth of securities, with 
his own money of Rs. 50 (margin of 50%) and borrowed money of Rs. 50. If the price 
of the security goes up by 10%, he will earn a return of 20%. Conversely, if the price 
falls by 10%, he will lose 20%. Thus margin trading exposes a client to the potential 
of higher gains / losses.

The Table 1 illustrates the amplification effect of margin trading. It assumes that the 
tenure  of  loan  as  well  as  the  investment  is  one  year.  Two  clients  (I  and  II)  have 
invested  same  amount  of  Rs.  100  in  a  securities  portfolio,  which  provide  similar 
returns. While client I has used his own funds only, the client II has used margin debt 
to the extent of 50%. If the portfolio returns 20%, the client I earns a return of 20%, 
while the client II earns 25%. When the portfolio returns 10%, client I and II earn 10% 
and 5% respectively. The client II gets higher return / suffers higher loss than client I 
because he has financed his portfolio partially by margin debt. Further, if the portfolio 
return exceeds the margin rate (interest cost), the client gets a higher return than the 
portfolio return. If, however, portfolio return is lower than the margin rate, the client 
gets  a  return  lower  than  the  portfolio  return.  Thus,  it  is  profitable  if  portfolio  return 
exceeds the margin rate. If portfolio return is lower than the margin rate, it is a losing 
proposition to do margin trading.

As  mentioned  earlier,  margin  trading  amplifies  the  return  in  either  direction.  Any 
change in portfolio return causes a much higher change in the return for the client. 
Table  2  illustrates  this.  If  the  extent  of  margin  is  50%,  and  the  value  of  portfolio 
depreciates by 50%, the client loses 100% of his own funds. The workings in table 2 
ignore  interest  cost  which  is  usually  high  and  compounded  on  daily  basis.  This

means, if interest is taken into account, the client loses more than his investment. 
The value of portfolio will not fall below Rs. 50, as the lender would dispose off the 
securities at Rs. 50. If the value of portfolio changes by 10%, the return for the client 
changes by 20%. Change in value of portfolio by 20% causes 40% change in return 
for the client. Thus, if the portfolio consists of volatile securities, the client runs higher 
risk.

Further,  the  client  gets  different  returns  from  the  same  portfolio  if  the  portfolio  is 
financed by different levels of margin. Assume that a client purchases Rs. 100 worth 
of securities which returns 20%. If the purchase is financed by own money of Rs. 50 
and  borrowed  money  of  Rs.  50  (margin  of  50%),  the  client  would  earn  30%. 
However, if margins were 25% and 75%, the client would earn returns of 50% and 
23.3% respectively. Table 3 makes it clear that the lower the margin, higher is the 
amplification effect. Hence lower the margin or higher the amount of funds borrowed, 
the greater is the risk to client.

It  clear,  thus,  that  the  more  volatile  the  price  of  the  securities  and  the  lower  the 
extent of margin, greater is the amplification effect, and there is possibility of making 
larger gains or losses.

The  lender  has  also  a  motivation.  He  earns  interest  on  the  funds  at  a  rate  higher 
than the bank rate. In case the lender happens to be the broker, which is often the 
case, he also earns higher brokerage on higher volumes of trades, that too, without 
any additional risk. 
 
The market is benefited in terms of better price discovery and higher liquidity which 
help in better allocation of resources.  
 
As discussed in case of the buy side, on the sell side also, one may see the impact 
of the margin trading. In other words, an investor may sell the securities short and 
borrow to deliver in the market based on a certain perspective.  Following  example 
would elaborate on the concept: 

Let's say that an investor thinks that company ABC has a poor outlook in the coming 
months. Right now the stock is trading at say Rs. 100, but investors sees it trading at 
8 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

much lower than this price in the near future. Therefore, he decides to do a short sell 
on  this  share.  He  may  do  so.  But  because  the  cash  market  is  settling  trades  on 
rolling settlement basis, investor would need to borrow the securities and deliver to 
the  market.  Let  us  assume  he  does  so.  After  say  15  days,  when  the  market  goes 
down as per his expectations, he would buy the stock from the market and return to 
the lender. His cash flows would be as follows:   

Day 1 
 
Borrowed and Short Sold 1,000 shares of stock ABC at Rs. 
100 

Rs. 1,00,000 

Day 15 
Bought and Returned 1,000 shares of stock ABC at Rs. 90  Rs. 90,000 
Rs. 10,000 
Gross profit* 

 

*Excluding  brokerage,  borrowing  costs  and  other  incidental  expenses  in  the 
transaction. 

It  may  be  seen  that  the  gross  profit  in  the  deal  is  Rs.  10,  000.  Net  profit  from  the 
transaction may be arrived at after the adjustment for the costs mentioned under the 
* mark. It is apparent that the short selling  would be profitable only if the return on 
the  stock  is  more  than  the  cost  involved  in  the  transaction.  In  other  words,  the 
strategy  can  also  be  risky  because  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  price  of  a  short 
stock  would  drop.  If  the  price  goes  in  contrary  to  the  expectations  of  the  investor, 
because he would still have to cover the short sale and return the securities, he may 
incur substantial losses. 

Further, as mentioned in case of the buy side margin trading, different margin levels 
would result in the different cost structures for the clients and so the different returns. 

Here,  it  would  be  pertinent  to  mention  that  the  motivation  behind  the  lender  of  the 
securities  is  to  unlock  the  values  from  his  idle  securities.  He  is  just  lending  the 
securities for a specific price (cost of borrowing the securities) to the borrower. It may 
be  noted  that  all  the  corporate  benefits  declared  during  the  lending  period  would 
belong  to  the  lender  and  borrower  would  have  no  right  whatsoever  on  these 
corporate  benefits.  In  other  words,  the  securities  are  lent  to  the  borrowers  for  the 
limited purpose of covering their position against the short sale in the market.

Having discussed the basics of the margin trading,  note now discusses  the specific 
business models for funds and securities lending and borrowing mechanisms. Now, 
paper takes up these two (funds and securities)  separately to fully  elaborate on the 
concepts. 
 
1.4 Mechanism of margin trading 
 
It is necessary to understand the mechanism to fully appreciate the risks in margin 
trading. In a typical transaction, a client interested to do margin trading is required to 
sign  an  agreement  with  the  lender  of  funds  (usually  the  broker)  to  formalise  the 
arrangement for margin trading. The agreement provides for the margin rate and the 
extent of margin. The margin rate is the prime lending rate / bank rate plus a mark up 
depending on exposure in the margin account. The interest is normally compounded 
on daily basis. The agreement provides for two types of margins, namely the initial 
margin  and  the  maintenance  margin.  The  initial  margin  is  the  portion  of  purchase 
value which the client deposits with lender of funds before the actual purchase. After 
the  agreement,  the  client  opens  a  margin  account  and  deposits  initial  margin 
amount, based on which the lender executes purchase order on behalf of the client. 
The  securities  so  purchased  are  kept  as  collateral  with  the  lender.  In  addition  to 
initial  margin,  the  client  is  required  to  maintain  a  certain  minimum  equity  in  the 
margin account. The equity is nothing but the net value of portfolio, that is, the value 
of portfolio less the margin debt. This equity should be a certain percentage of the 
market  value  of  securities.  This  percentage  is  called  maintenance  margin.  If  the 
equity is less than the maintenance margin, the client is called upon to bring in the 
shortfall. For example, assume that the initial and maintenance margins are 50% and 
25% respectively. A client has bought securities for Rs. 100. The price depreciates 
by 40%. The value of portfolio reduces to Rs. 60. The equity becomes Rs. 10 (Rs. 60 
– Rs. 50 (debt)), which is less than Rs. 15 (25% of the value of securities). The client 
is required to bring in Rs. 5. When the equity in the margin account falls below the 
maintenance margin, the lender makes a margin call. If margin call is not met, the 
lender can sell the collateral, partially or fully, to increase the equity. However, when 
price falls to an extent that the equity becomes zero, the lender, in stead of making 
margin call, usually sells off the securities to recover the debt. If he waits and prices 
10

fall  further,  he  would  not  be  able  to  recover  the  debt  from  collateral.  In  the  above 
example,  the  lender  would  make  margin  call,  when  the  portfolio  depreciates  by 
33.33%. If margin call is not met or if the equity reduces to Rs. 0, the lender sells off 
the collateral. If the minimum and maintenance margins were 50%, margin call will 
be  made  with  smallest  depreciation  in  the  value  of  portfolio.  The  lender  is  not 
generally required make a margin call or notify the client that the equity has reduced 
below  minimum.  It  is  for  the  client  to  find  out  for  him  self  and  make  payment 
accordingly. The client is required to repay the debt and interest as per agreement 
and till the full repayment is made, the collateral remains with the lender. In case he 
wants to sell the securities earlier, the proceeds go to the lender first to the extent of 
debt.  
 
The  Graph  1  presents  the  equity  when  the  value  of  portfolio  appreciates  and 
depreciates and the time for margin call, assuming initial and maintenance margin of 
50%  and  25%  respectively.  When  portfolio  appreciates,  there  is  no  need  to  make 
margin call. There is also no need for margin call for depreciations upto 33.33%. If 
portfolio depreciated by 33.33% - 50%, the margins calls are made. If it depreciates 
by more than 50%, no margin calls are made and the collaterals are disposed off.

margin call will be made only when the portfolio depreciates by more than 50%. This 
is  given  by  the  formula:  (Initial  Margin  –  Maintenance  Margin)  /  (1  –  Maintenance 
Margin)  *  100.  Lower  the  maintenance  margin,  given  initial  margin,  higher  is  the 
depreciation  in  value  of  portfolio  required  for  margin  call.  Similarly,  given  the 
maintenance margin, higher the initial margin, higher is the depreciation in value of 
portfolio required for margin call.

1.5 Risks for Client 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Leveraged portfolio generates an amplified effect for each rupee of investment. The 
higher the leverage, the higher is the amplification effect. Since markets can move in 
either direction, leveraging becomes a double edged sword.  A client is likely to lose 
lots  of  money  or  gains  lots  of  money  when  he  transacts  on  margin.   This 
amplification  effect  can  be  devastating  when  stock  prices  go  down.  Further  the 
increase in risk associated with margin trading is compounded by the riskiness of the 
portfolio. A  portfolio  becomes  risky  if  the  prices  of  constituent  securities  are  highly 
volatile or the portfolio is concentrated in a very small number of assets. Leveraging 
a  risky  portfolio  may  be  asking  for  trouble  at  times.   A  client  generally  faces  the 
following risks: 

(i) 
(ii) 

The client is exposed to potential of higher loss. 
In falling market, the client may lose more money than he has invested. 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

12 

(iii) 

(iv) 

(v) 

If  the  value  of  securities  purchased  on  margin  falls,  the  client  has  to 
provide additional funds to avoid forced sale of the securities. 
The  client  may  have  to  deposit  additional  cash  on  short  notice  to  cover 
market losses.  
The  lender  may  sell  some  or  all  of  the  securities  at  the  current  price 
without consulting the client to pay off the debt to itself. The current price 
may not be the best price at which investor would have liked to sell.  

1.6 Risks for Lender 
 
Generally brokers lend/arrange funds and securities for clients doing margin trading. 
Some  markets  have  special  purpose  vehicles  which  lend  funds  /  securities.  The 
requirement of initial margin, maintenance of margin, right to sell the collateral etc. 
protect  the  lender. The lender, however, needs to follow prudent risk management 
practices so as to ensure recovery of principal and interest and act swiftly to make 
margin calls or sell the securities in time. In the event of loss to a client, the loss to 
lender  is  limited  to  transaction  cost  that  he  would  incur  on  selling  the  collateral, 
liquidity risk that he may not be able to sell the collateral and loss of interest on the 
margin debt.  

1.7 Risk for Market 

 

If the lenders have risk management systems in place and act swiftly, they do not 
carry any risk, except to the extent mentioned earlier paragraph. If they have no risk, 
the  margin  trading  does  not  pose  any  risk  to  market.  Besides,  when  the  positions 
taken  by  brokers  in  cash  /  derivatives  market  are  fully  secured  by  adequate 
collateral,  their  involvement  in  margin  trading  as  lenders  do  not  affect  the  market 
integrity at all.  

 
However,  the  margin  trading  has  tendency  to  contribute  to  volatility  and  price 
manipulation.  In  case  of  rising  market,  the  value  of  equity  in  the  margin  account 
rises,  which  enables  a  client  to  take  still  larger  and  larger  positions.  This  fuels  a 
continuous rise in prices. For example, a client holds a portfolio of Rs. 100, financed 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

13 

by margin debt with initial and maintenance margin rates of 50%. Let us assume that 
the  value  of  portfolio  increases  to  160.  The  value  of  equity,  thus,  increases  to 
Rs.110, based on which the client can hold a portfolio of Rs.220. This would enable 
him  to  buy  additional  securities  for  Rs.60.    In  case  of  falling  market,  the  lenders 
liquidate positions to meet margin calls or to recover debt. This fuels a continuous 
fall  in  prices.  This  accentuating  effect  of  margin  trading  is  controlled  by  securities 
lending in case of rising market and by restrictions on short selling in case of falling 
market.  
 
1.8 US scenario 

The  Federal  Reserve  Board  and  self-regulatory  organizations,  such  as  the  NYSE 
and  NASD,  have  rules  that  govern  margin  trading.  Brokerage  firms  can  establish 
their  own  requirements  as  long  as  they  are  at  least  as  restrictive  as  the  Federal 
Reserve Board (FRB) and SRO rules. 

Before  trading  on  margin,  the  NYSE  and  NASD,  for  example,  require  a  client  to 
deposit with the broking firm a minimum of $2,000 or 100% of the purchase price, 
whichever is less. This is known as the "minimum margin." According to Regulation T 
of the FRB, the client may borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of securities and 
the  client  has  to  bring  in  balance  50%,  which  is  called  ‘initial  margin’.  Some  firms 
require  the  client  to  deposit  more  than  50%  of  the  purchase  price.  This  facility  is 
available only for select securities. 

After  the  client  has  bought  the  securities  on  margin,  the  NYSE  and  NASD  require 
him to keep a minimum amount of equity in the margin account. The rules require 
the  client  to  have  at  least  25%  of  the  total  market  value  of  the  securities  in  the 
margin  account  at  all  times.  This  25%  is  called  the  "maintenance  margin."  In  fact, 
many broking firms have higher maintenance requirements, typically between 30 to 
40%, and sometimes higher depending on the type of stock purchased. 

The SEC generally follows a hands-off approach. It does not prevent a broker from 
engaging in any fund based activity. It only limits the aggregate indebtedness of a 
broker towards all other persons to 1500% of its net capital.

It may, however, be noted that Regulation T is issued by FRB under the Securities 
Exchange Act, 1934 with the objective to regulate extensions of credit by brokers. It 
does  not  preclude  any  SRO  or  the  broker  himself  from  imposing  additional 
requirements. 
 

Part 2 - margin trading – Funds lending and borrowing 

 

2.1 Present status of margin trading 
 
There was an apprehension that brokers would not be able to lend funds for margin 
trading in view of provisions in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 as  
the  Rules  do  not  permit  a  broker  to  take  up  any  fund  based  activity.  This  was 
examined by SEBI in 1997 and a view was taken that a broker can not lend funds as 
a regular business activity or lending of funds can not be his prime activity. However, 
he can lend / borrow money if it is incidental to securities transactions. A clarification 
in  this  regard  was  issued  in  1997.  In  view  of  this  clarification,  some  brokers  are 
reportedly doing the margin trading. However, some brokers have sought clarification 
whether  they  can  do  the  margin  trading.  It  is  assumed  that  the  brokers  who  are 
undertaking the margin trading are following some standard laid down norms for the 
purpose.  
 
The market witnessed major reforms in 2001. The deferral products, such as MCFS, 
ALBM, BLESS etc. were banned and compulsory rolling settlement on T+5 basis was 
introduced in a big way in July 2001. The market participants apprehended that these 
reforms may affect the market liquidity. It was, therefore, felt necessary to provide the 
facility of margin trading in more explicit and organised way.  
 
To  supplement  the  resources  of  the  brokers,  it  was  considered  necessary  to  make 
available  a  line  of  credit  to  them  from  banks  for  margin  trading.    Based  on  the 
recommendations of RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee, RBI issued guidelines 
in  November  2001  in  this  regard.  It  provides  that  the  Board  of  each  bank  should 
formulate  detailed  guidelines  for  lending  for  margin  trading  subject  to  the  following 
parameters:  
 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

15 

(i) The finance extended for margin trading should be within the overall ceiling of 5%, 
prescribed for exposure to capital market.  
 
(ii)  A  minimum  margin  of  40%  should  be  maintained  on  the  funds  lent  for  margin 
trading.  The  bank  should  put  in  place  an  appropriate  system  for  monitoring  and 
maintaining the margin of 40% on a regular basis.  
 
(iii)  The  shares  purchased  with  margin  trading  should  be  in  dematerialised  mode, 
under pledge to the lending bank.   
 
(iv)  The  bank’s  Board  should  prescribe  necessary  safeguards  to  ensure  that  no 
“nexus”  develops between inter-connected stock broking entities/stockbrokers and the 
bank in respect of margin trading.  
 
These guidelines are in continuation of  RBI’s general circular, which restricts loan to 
an individuals against security of securities upto Rs. 10 lakh (Rs. 20 lakh for demat 
securities). 
 
Despite  these  enabling  provisions,  margin  trading  has  not  taken  off.  The  market 
participants feel that the following are the bottlenecks: 

 

a.  Though  RBI  has  issued  the  enabling  guidelines,  most  of  the  banks  have  yet  to 
formulate their internal guidelines and design the systems to get into and manage 
the margin trading. A few banks, who have these guidelines and systems in place, 
have already reached the ceiling of 5%, permitted under RBI guidelines.  

 
b.  Banks are not clear on various issues including how the collateral will be pledged 
to the lending bank, how to avoid nexus or how to ensure proper end use of funds.  

 
c.  The role of brokers under the margin trading guidelines of RBI is not quite clear.  
 
d.  The limit of Rs. 10 lakh (Rs. 20 lakh for demat securities) on security of securities 

for an individual discourages clients to get into margin trading in a big way.   

 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

16 

e.  Most  brokers  are  not  sure  if  margin  trading  is  incidental  to  the  securities 

transactions and that they are permitted to do so.  

 
f.  The lending and borrowing of funds can be carried on by the entities, registered 
under  the  Money  lenders  Act  only.  The  brokers  are  not  sure  whether  they  are 
required  to  be  registered  under  the  Money  Lenders  Act  for  carrying  on  margin 
trading. 

 
2.2 Suggested Business Models 
 
In view of the above discussion, it may be clear that margin trading is available in the 
Indian  Capital  Market through the brokers or through the banking system. Further, 
the existing structure of margin trading in the country is the Over the counter (OTC) 
structure.  Market  believes  that  some  alternative  structures  for  the  margin  trading 
may be explored, which ensure the following three things: 
 
?  Transparency of the system. 
?  Financial integrity of the system. 
?  Level playing field with equal opportunity to all stake holders in the market.  
 
Accordingly,  market  participants  have  suggested  a  variety  of  models  for  margin 
trading. Some of them are produced below: 
 
1.  Financing by the brokers. 
2.  Financing by the clearing corporation/Exchange. 
3.  Direct financing by the banks and financial institutions to the investors. 
4.  Financing by the specialized institutions like “Limited purpose banks”. 
 
Indeed, all the above business models are not exclusive of each other. There may 
be a situation wherein the financing takes place from brokers and brokers in turn get 
themselves financed from the banks and financial institutions.  
 
2.3 Model 1 - Financing by the brokers. 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

17 

 
Model  one  involves  brokers  as  the  prime  financer  to  their  clients  on  the  purchase 
transactions.  This  is  a  business  model,  where  a  client  interested  in  margin  trading 
signs an agreement with the broker. The agreement provides for the salient term of 
the contract, which are bilaterally decided. This agreement broadly provides for the 
margins,  collateral  and  the  rights  of  the  lender,  specially  in  case  of  default  by  the 
client on the margin payments.  
 
In this model, brokers finance the deals of the clients either with their own money or 
the money arranged from some other sources. The credit risk is borne by the brokers 
and  they  manage  their  risk  by  keeping  the  securities  received  from  the  purchase 
transaction  of  clients,  as  collateral.  Further,  as  the  settlement  in  the  market  has 
already taken place against the trade of the client, there is no settlement risk in the 
system. This margin trading transaction is OTC transaction, which like all other OTC 
deals, is not transparent and suffers from the inadequate transparency.  
 
However,  this  model  provides  for  tremendous  trading  flexibility  to  both  the 
intermediaries and the clients. It is assumed that the borrowing rates etc. would be 
taken  care  of  by  the  competition  in  the  market.  Probably,  because  of  the  trading 
flexibility only, this model is liked globally.  
 
This model is the model followed by number of markets across the globe including 
U.S. with certain pre-determined margin requirements. For instance, in U.S., brokers 
can  finance  their  clients  with  minimum  50%  margin  requirement  i.e.  50%  of  the 
purchase money has to come from the clients. Brokers, in fact, may demand more 
from the clients depending on their risk perception.  
 
Some market participants advocate that this model is most suitable and suggest that 
the  issues  of  concern  in  the  model  may  be  addressed  through  issuance  of 
efficacious guidelines on the subject. The guidelines proposed are the following: 
 
a)   Model agreement to be entered into between the client and the broker.

Provisions  for  liquidation  of  collateral  in  case  of  failure  to  meet  the  margin

contained in BSE Sensex, Nifty 50 and BSE 100 etc.  
f) 
Total indebtedness of the broker may be linked to his networth. Further, there 
may be limits for which market has proposed the range of debt to equity ratio from 
2:1 to 5:1. In U.S., this limit is 15:1. In India, Primary Dealers in the Money market 
have the limit of 6:1.   
The amount to be lent by the broker also needs to be linked with the net-worth 
g) 
of  the  broker.  It  may  be  provided  that  the  total  lending  by  the  broker  would  not 
exceed a multiple of the net-worth of the broker.  
The broker should be permitted to borrow the funds for this purpose. The total 
h) 
borrowing should not grow beyond a multiple of the net-worth of the broker. These 
borrowings may include all the borrowings made by the broker.

For margin trading, one client should deal with only one broker. This may be 
j)  
implemented through the single client ID. Till then brokers may take the undertaking 
from the clients that for the margin trading purpose, he is dealing with him only. 
 
2.4 Model 2 - Financing by the clearing corporation/Exchange. 
 
Second  model  involves  the  clearing  corporation/exchange  as  financer  of  the 
purchase deals, on margin. It must be clear that the Clearing corporation/exchange 
may  not  have  their  own  funds  and  just  be  an  intermediary  for  the  transaction 
between the actual financer and the clients. In other words, funds would essentially

corporation/Exchange  is  made  intermediary  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  risk 
management  from  mere  the  lending  entity.  The  idea  is  that  banks  and  financial 
institutions  would 
clearing 
corporation/exchange  than  the  individual  brokers  or  their  clients,  direct.  In  these 
cases, counterparty risk is borne by the clearing corporation/exchange.  
 
It is argued that the banks are allowed by the RBI to finance the securities market 
deals  on  the  margin  but  they  are  not  doing  it  because  of  their  discomfort  with  the 
intermediaries  in  the  securities  market.  Further,  it  is  assumed  that  they  would  be 
comfortable  financing  brokers  and  clients  through  clearing  corporation/  exchange. 
This  business  model  needs the support from the  clearing  corporation/house  of  the 
exchange and they must be willing to be an intermediary between the clients/brokers 
and  the  financing  banks/  financial  institutions.  This  model  basically  bridges  a  gap 
between the financers and the borrowers in the securities market. 
 
the  exchange/  clearing 
In 
corporation/house of the exchange  and  exchange  in  turn  would  lend  money  to  the 
brokers/clients through the online trading platform.  
 
This  model  assumes  the  lending  of  the  funds  through  the  online  trading  platform 
created  by  the  exchanges.  In  this  model,  all  demand  for  and  supply  of  funds  for 
securities  transactions  would  consolidate  and  the  price  of  the  funds  would  be 
discovered  by  the  system.  Any  body  and  every  body  including  banks  can  lend 
money  through  this  platform  and  any  client  can  borrow  funds  from  this  platform 
through a broker. This model automatically ensures better price discovery for funds 
(lenders and borrowers get most competitive rates) and effortless disclosure for the 
benefit of all market participants and risk management. Since the parties would be 
with  anonymous  counterparties,  it  is  essential  that  the  clearing  corporation  retains 
collateral on behalf of lenders and provides counter party guarantee. 
 
The  Stock  Exchange,  Mumbai  has  proposed  a  model  on  the  above  lines.  It 
envisages  that  the  buyers  of  securities  would  indicate  at  the  time  of  placing  buy 
order for securities (limited to BSE-100) if it would be financed under margin trading. 
The stock brokers, on their own behalf and on behalf of their clients, would indicate 
20 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

to  BOLT  system  the  amount  of  finance  required  under  margin  trading  and  the 
maximum  acceptable  interest  rate.  The  exchange  would  ascertain  the  amount 
required for margin trading by all buyers on a daily basis and disclose the same to 
market participants. The intending financiers, who are registered with the exchange 
for this purpose, would make competitive offers to lend funds for margin trading by 
indicating the quantity of funds, desired interest rate etc, through their brokers. The 
best offers would be accepted upto total funds required in the system. Based on the 
rates  of  various  accepted  offers,  a  weighted  average  rate  will  be  worked  out.  The 
lender of the funds would get the actual interest rates indicated by them whereas the 
borrowers would be charged the weighted average rate. The exchange would levy a 
certain  mark  up  over  the  interest  rate  in  the  system  to  cover  administrative 
expenses.  The  shares  against  which  finance  have  been  availed  of  would  be  kept 
with  the  clearing  house.  The  accounts  of  the  lenders  would be debited or credited 
directly by the exchange for the amounts borrowed from and repaid to them.  BSE 
has proposed a risk management system comprising of security selection, 40% initial 
margin, maintenance margin, concentration margin, exposure limits, financing limits, 
collateral and a margin guarantee fund. 
 
Alternative  to  this  model  may  be  that  the  exchange  would  provide  the  trading 
platform  for  the  anonymous  borrowing  and  lending  of  funds.  This  is  variant  to  the 
model described above because in this case, exchange/ clearing corporation would 
just facilitate the trades.  
 
There are also the views that the returns on the lending should not be linked to the 
scrip  financed.  Further,  exchange  if  is  guaranteeing  the  trade,  should  do  it  from  a 
separate settlement guarantee fund, created for the dedicated purpose of the  funds 
lending and borrowing. 
 
Sources  of  funds  to  the  market,  in  all  the  alternative  models  may  be  from  banks/ 
financial institutions or private financers. There have been concerns on the funding 
from the private financers in the market. Some market participants think that there 
may  be  a  ceiling  on  the  lending  by  a  private  financer  to  the  market  as  a  whole, 
irrespective  of  the  mode  of  the  financing  i.e.  direct  financing  to  the  clients  or 
financing to the clients through the brokers.

2.5  Model  3  -  Direct  financing  by  the  banks  and  financial  institutions  to  the 
investors. 
 
The third model assumes that the banks and financial institutions would finance the 
clients direct. As of now, as per the RBI directives, Banks may finance only through 
the  brokers.  But,  as  mentioned  above,  Banks  are  not  at  all  active  on  the  margin 
trading front.  
 
Following is suggested by  the market participants on the RBI’s existing scheme on 
margin trading: 
 
1.  RBI needs to encourage banks to take up the activity. Market needs to appreciate 

that the Securities Market and the Economy’s growth are tightly intertwined.  

 
2.  RBI guidelines need to be clear on  how  to  avoid  nexus  between  interconnected 

stock broking entities/stock brokers and the banks in respect of margin trading. 

 
3.  The role of brokers under the margin trading guidelines of RBI may be made clear.  
 
4.  The limit of Rs. 10 lakh (Rs. 20 lakh for demat securities) on security of securities 

for an individuals may be increased. 

 
5.  Margin level of 40% are too high and may be reduced to say 20% to encourage 

the activity. 

 
6.  At  present,  margin  financing  is  covered  within  the  5%  overall  ceiling  of  bank  for 
exposure to the capital market. There is a need of apportioning some dedicated 
percentage of the funds say 5% to the margin trading. 

 
7.  Going  by  the  conservative  attitude  of  the  banks,  it  would  be  difficult  to  see  any 
activity  in  the  market  without  bridging  a  gap  between  the  financers  (banks  and 
financial institutions) and the financees. There is a need of some intermediary say 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

22 

exchange/clearing corporation to carry out the risk containment measures. Model 
two elaborated above does the same thing.  

 
8.  Scheme  envisages  the  pledge  of  the  securities  in  favor  of  the  financing  bank. 
Banks may be allowed to outsource the risk management without insisting of the 
pledge  in  their  favor.  This  may  be  done  as  envisaged  in  the  proposed  second 
model wherein the Clearing corporation/exchange would do the risk management. 

 
2.6  Model 4 –  Financing by the specialized institutions like “Limited purpose 

banks”. 

 
Creation  of  the  special  bank  say  “limited  purpose bank  “  for  the  margin  trading  is 
another  idea  to  give  a  fillip  to  the  margin  trading  activity.  This  assumes  that  a 
dedicated entity can undertake the activity of financing the securities market trades.  
 
It is felt that the dedicate bank may do things in an organized manner with available 
resources.  People  interested  in  lending  the  funds  to  the  market  may  deposit  their 
money with this limited purpose bank and borrowers may borrow from this bank. This 
bank may finance the clients in number of alternative following ways: 
 
?  Bank may finance the clients direct.  
 
?  Bank may finance the clients through the brokers of the exchanges.  
 
?  Bank may finance the  clients through the clearing corporation/exchange through 

an on-line trading platform.  

 
In  the  first  two  cases,  bank  would  manage  its  risk  itself.  But,  in  the  last  scenario, 
exchange/clearing corporation would manage the risk for the bank. 
 
Advantages of this model are many: 
 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

23 

1.  It would be easy to track, who is financing in the market and to what extent. This 
would  help avoid any nexus built up between the financers, brokers and issuer 
companies.   

 
2.  Total quantum of the financing would be known to the market at any point in time. 
Limits on the financing to a client, scrip wise and total portfolio, would be easy to 
impose and monitor.  

 
3.  This would make the risk management effective. 
 
4.  Audit trail would be easy to manage.  
 
Only  issue  in  this  model  is  the  creation  of  a  fresh  infrastructure.  Building  a 
nationwide  bank  would  require  both  money  and  time.  But,  that  may  be  navigated 
with co-ordinated efforts of the market participants. Another opinion on the issue is 
that the existing infrastructure of the banks/financial institutions/exchanges may be 
leveraged on for the purpose.  
 
This model is further dealt with in the part 5. 
 

Part 3  - Securities lending and borrowing 

 
Selling short on margin is the other dimension of the business. It has been argued by 
the market that margin trading on both the buy and the sell sides should be in place 
to  provide  the  equilibrium  and  efficient  price  discovery.  At  present,  securities 
borrowing and lending facility is available in the market but market participants think 
there are alternative ways to approach the securities lending in efficient and effective 
manner.  Issues  covered  under  part  3  are  present  state  of  securities  lending  and 
borrowing and alternative business models for the same.  
 
3.1  Present state of Securities lending and borrowing 
 
SEBI approved the Securities Lending Scheme, which came into existence on Feb. 
6, 1997 and is called as SLS, 1997. According to the SLS, securities can be lent and 
24 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

borrowed through an approved intermediary, which is duly registered with SEBI.  As 
of  now,  there  are  eight  entities,  which  are  registered  with  SEBI  as  approved 
intermediaries, under the SLS (list enclosed at annexure A). Borrowers and Lenders 
do transact through these intermediaries as per the procedure laid down in the said 
scheme. 
 
It  is  important  to  describe  the  existing  business  model  of  these  approved 
intermediaries. These intermediaries deal with the lenders and borrowers on one to 
one  basis.  It  essentially  means  lenders  lend  the  securities  to  the  approved 
intermediaries  and  they  in  turn  lend  them  to  the  counterparties  i.e.  borrowers.  Full 
credit risk on the securities lent is born by the approved intermediaries. Therefore, in 
a broader sense, in these transactions intermediaries provide full novation in lending 
and  borrowing  transactions.    It  may  also  be  noted  that  the  existing  market  for  the 
securities lending and borrowing is an over the counter market (OTC market). 

 

As  these  approved  intermediaries  have  limited  geographical  reach,  facility  of 
borrowing  and  lending  of  securities  is  not  available  to  the  widely  scattered  retail 
segment  of  the  securities  market.  Limited  participation  in  the  securities  borrowing 
and  lending  market  and  lack  of  competitive  forces  have  resulted  in  the  cost  of 
borrowing  of  securities  being  exorbitantly  high,  which  renders  the  securities 
borrowing transactions uneconomical.  
 
It is felt in the market that there is an urgent need to redefine the existing securities 
lending  and  borrowing  mechanism/  or  discover  the  alternative  business  models  to 
ensure wider participation, at the reasonable cost and in a transparent manner. It is 
felt  that  a  transparent,  online  trading  platform  may  be  created  for  the  efficient 
securities lending and borrowing mechanism.  
 
3.2  Business Models for securities lending and borrowing  
 
Following four business models are proposed for the consideration: 
 

1.  Online trading platform with limited number of participants on the supply side. 
2.  Online trading platform with investors independently on supply side. 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

25 

3.  Lending through the depositories. 
4.  Lending through the special purpose bank. 

 
Model  1  –  Online  trading platform with limited number of participants on  the 
supply side. 
 
Model  1  visualises  the  lending  and  borrowing  of  securities  to  take  pace  through  a 
transparent online trading platform. This platform may be created by any interested 
entity including depositories in the market.  Alternatively, exchanges may offer this 
facility  through  their  existing  trading  platforms.  It  is  also  possible  that  these 
intermediaries would leverage on each others competencies and infrastructure and 
pool  down  resources  to  provide  efficient  mechanism  to  the  market.  For  instance, 
depositories  may  offer  the  securities  lending  and  borrowing  mechanism  through 
using  the  exchanges’  infrastructure. It  may  be  left  to  the  market  forces,  assuming 
that  the  market  is  prudent  enough  to  analyse  the  economic  dynamics  of  the 
business.     
 
Now,  all  the  borrowers,  who  would  have  short  position  in  the  market,  would  put  in 
their  requirements  through  brokers  on  the  online  computer  system  with  number  of 
securities required and their borrowing horizon.  Supply side would offer the shares 
indicating  the  associated  costs.  Lending  and  borrowing  transactions  would  be 
matched through the automated system in a transparent environment on price and 
time priority basis.  
 
Intermediary, managing the online platform for the securities lending and borrowing 
purpose,  would  be  responsible  for  the  clearance  and  settlement  of  all  said 
transactions. It is also thought that this session of the lending and borrowing could 
take place simultaneous to the normal trading sessions. 
 
However, it may be noted here that this session of Securities Lending and Borrowing 
would have no linkage whatsoever with the actual trading session at the exchanges. 
In other words, the exchange trading and settlement system would be independent 
of the Securities Lending and Borrowing Mechanism, which is being proposed. 
 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

26 

Now, there are certain issues in the proposed system, which are elaborated on here: 
 
a)  Which  securities  would  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  proposed  lending  and 
borrowing  mechanism:  Though,  theoretically  speaking,  all  the  securities  listed  and 
traded  on  the  exchanges  should  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  proposed 
mechanism,  globally,  wherever  the  securities  lending  and  borrowing  facility  is 
available,  securities  eligible  for  the  same  are  clearly  defined.  Decision  on  eligible 
securities is based on the following: 
 
1.  Liquidity in the scrips. 
2.  Avoid the participation of scrips  with  low  liquidity  in the borrowing and lending 
mechanism, which in turn would reduce the chances of manipulation through the 
use of system. 

 
Further,  in  India,  as  market  is  moving  towards  the  T  +  2  rolling  settlement 
environment,  only  the  electronic  form  of  shares  may  be  lent  in  the  market.  This 
would also keep the cost of transactions low. It is assumed that this move would also 
encourage  the  investors  to  convert  their  physical  holding  into  electronic  form  to 
create values from their idle holdings. 
 
b)  Who  can  lend  the  securities:  Strictly  speaking,  anyone  who  has  the  securities 
would  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  lending  process.  But,  this  model  limits  the 
lenders  to  only  the  DPs,  Custodians  and  other  approved  intermediaries  under  the 
Securities  Lending  Scheme,  1997  of  SEBI.  This  feature  of  the  limited  number  of 
professional parties on the supply side of securities is a very important feature of this 
model.  This  is  expected  to  professionalize  the  operating  environment  at  the 
securities lending and borrowing front. This also leads to the other dimension of the 
business called securities banking. This concept of the securities banking is defined 
in the part IV of this paper.  
 
c) Who can borrow the securities:  Again, anyone operating in the market should be 
eligible to borrow the securities. However, any borrower has to go through his broker 
to borrow securities. Broker would borrow the securities for its client/ clients as an 

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

27 

intermediary on the system. If an entity is debarred under any specific regulation, it 
would not be eligible to borrow the securities (for example - FIIs). 
 
This model also proposes the borrowing of securities strictly for the specific purpose 
of  delivering  in  the  market  against  a  sale  obligation  of  the  borrower.  This  is  also 
proposed with an objective to avoid any price manipulation attempt. This would be 
with exemption to DPs and other approved intermediaries, who can borrow to meet 
their temporary short fall of securities.   
 
d) What can be the duration of the lending: This model  appreciates the problem of 
duration  match,  for  lending  and  borrowing,  on  the  system  because  different 
borrowers  would  have  the  different  time  horizons  in  their  minds.  Therefore,  it  is 
proposed to standardize the time horizon for the borrowing. It may be packed to say, 
7 days, 14 days and so on with multiple of 7 days each. In any case, the maximum 
limit  on  one  time  borrowing  to  12  weeks.  It  essentially  means  that  if  someone  is 
interested  in  borrowing  for  say  24  weeks,  he  would  be  required  to  roll  over  the 
position after say 12 weeks of the first time borrowing.  
 
This  standardization  would  mean  that  even  if  someone  wants  to  borrow  the 
securities for less than 7 days, he / she would incur the cost of borrowing for at least 
7 days. Though it is true that this would cause some inconvenience to the borrowers 
for the broken period but this is proposed with an objective to create a standardized 
contract for online trading with liquidity consideration in mind. However, there would 
not be any limitation on the borrower returning the securities before the completion of 
initial borrowing period.  It may also be noted that it would generate the return for 
minimum seven days to the lender. 
 
e)  What  are  the  risk  containment  measures  and  prudential  norms  for  the  lenders: 
Once  the  borrowers  and  lenders  are  matched  by  the  laid  down  system,  securities 
would move from the lenders to the borrowers. Borrowers in turn would use these 
securities  to  settle  their  trades  on  the  exchange.  Sales  proceeds  from  the  short 
positions  would  be  retained  by  the  clearing  corporation/  house  of  the  exchange  or 
the trading platform manager. This entity would guarantee the return of the securities 
to  the  lenders.  In  addition  to  the  sales  proceed,  borrower  would  pay  margin  to 
28 
Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

provide for the potential losses. This margin may be  described by the regulator. In 
global markets, this margin varies and is generally around 40% to 50% of the value 
of  the  transactions.  Further,  securities  may  be  marked  to  market  on  daily  basis  to 
cover up the losses, which have taken place during the day. 
 
[Other sophisticated practices like margining of short sales on VAR basis may also 
be adopted, but that would make the margining slightly more complex and dynamic.] 
 
Alternatively  thought  is  that  as  the  securities  are  anyway  borrowed  to  meet  the 
settlement obligation in the regular market, the securities so borrowed  may not  be 
received by the borrowers but shall be delivered to the settlement account with the 
Clearing  Corporation, direct. This would make the audit trail of securities borrowed 
and returned easy. 
 
Further,  complete  segregation  of  borrowed  securities  and  the  regular  market 
obligations would be maintained by the clearing corporation/exchange. 
 
This  securities  borrowing  and  lending  mechanism  is  assumed  to  offer  an  efficient, 
transparent  and  effective  system  to  the  market.  It  will  have  following  distinctive 
advantages:   
 
1.  The wider participation :- Common trading platform for all would ensure very wide 

participation from the market participants across the country. 

2.  Reasonable cost of borrowing  :-  Equally accessible market to all would create 
competitive environment and reduce the cost of transaction. Further, prices would 
be  the  market  determined  prices  through  the  free  interaction  of  demand  and 
supply forces. 

3.  Transparency:-  Online  order  driven  price  and  time  priority  basis  system  would 

ensure the transparency in the system. 

 
Model 2 – Online trading platform with investors independently on supply side.

29 

The  model  1  assumes  the  availability  of  only  the  professional  entities  like  DPs, 
Custodians  and  approved  intermediaries  on  the  supply  side  of  the  securities.  It 
should  not  be  construed  that  the  individuals  would  not  be  given  the  opportunity  to 
participate  in  that  model.  Indeed,  the  model  proposes  the  participation  of  the 
individuals  in  the  system  through  the  organizations/systems  like  DPs  and  other 
approved intermediaries under SLS scheme of 1997. It is done to deliver the  better 
values to the market in terms of discipline and structure. Further, economies of scale 
and scope, enjoyed by the institutions would deliver additional values.  
 
An  alternative  to  the  model  1  may  be  the  model,  where  in  everyone  is  given  the 
independent  chance  to  participate  on  the  supply  side.  In  other  words,  individuals 
would  provide  the  supply  side  quote  on  their  own  through  their  brokers.  Some 
market  participants  think  that  giving  independent  choice  to  the  investors  through 
brokers would be better.  
 
Here,  it  may  be  noted  that  other  issues  raised  in  the  model  1  like  the  risk 
management,  selection  of  securities  etc.  would  also  be  the  part  of  this  model  and 
regulators would have to decide on the certain parameters of this market. Further, on 
borrowing  side, there is no limit and even the individuals can borrow through their 
brokers, as described in the model 1. 
 
Salient features of this model would be as follows: 
 
1.  The  Clearing  Corporation  /  Stock  Exchange  would  act  as  an  Approved 

Intermediary. 

2.  Stock Exchange to extend their trading platform to provide a nation wide access 

to the participants. 

3.  All  investors  shall  be  allowed  to  borrow  and  lend  securities  through  the  trading 
facilities with Trading Members of the Exchange / Clearing Members, Custodians, 
Depository Participants and Banks.  

4.  The rate of borrowing shall be determined on screen based trading system in the 

continuous market session. 

5.  The  lenders  of  the  security  shall  deliver  securities  to  the  Clearing  Corporation 

towards meeting the settlement obligation of the borrower of securities.  

Discussion paper on Margin Trading and Securities Lending 
 

30 

6.  The  borrowers  and  lenders  shall  be  identified  by  making  use  of  unique  client 
code which will be captured at the time of order entry. This will also be used to 
ensure  an  audit  trail  of  the  return  of  securities  borrowed  at  the  end  of  the 
prescribed tenure. 

7.  The tenure for borrowing shall be for a maximum of 7 days. Another opinion is 
that the borrowing facility for the different time horizons may be made available to 
the market participants. 

8.  The risk shall be managed by Clearing Corporation by  

i. 

Implementing  appropriate  risk  containment  measure  and  use  of 
effective margining system. 

ii.  By  position  monitoring  to  ensure  that  the  borrowing  is  within  the 

specified limits as also the overall exposure limits. 

iii.  Ensuring  return  of  securities  by  use  of  collateral  deposited  with  the 

Clearing Corporation. 

 
Advantages of the model 
 
It must be clear that the broad difference between the first and the second model is 
that in first model only DPs and approved intermediaries are on the supply side and 
in second model all the individual investors are required to put in their independent 
quotes  on  the  trading  terminal  for  borrowing  and  lending  of  securities.  This  model 
would provide the following advantages as mentioned in the previous model: 
  

1.  Nationwide  trading  platform  which  already  exists  and  reaches  the  entire 

investors. 

2.  Screen based continuous market session will ensure transparency, efficiency 

and market driven price discovery. 

3.  Clearing  Corporation  already  has  the  track  for  managing  risk  by  having  a 

mechanism for collecting collateral nationwide. 

4.  Clearing  Corporation  being  in  a  position  to  monitor  exposure  segment  wise 

shall ensure that borrowing is within specified limits. 

5.  Clearing  Corporation  would  ensure  that  the  borrowing  is  done  towards 
settlement  obligation  and  also  ensure  that  the  securities  so  borrowed  are 
returned to lenders.

3.4 Model 3 – Lending through the depositories. 
 
Another model may be the securities lending and borrowing model followed by the 
Singapore  Exchange  Ltd.  In  this  model,  depository  becomes  the  major  supplier  of 
the  securities.  This  model  envisages  the  securities  to  be  available  from  the  big 
investors,  who  get  themselves  registered  with  the  Depository  for  this  specific 
purpose.  It  may  be  noted  that  under  the  Singapore  Exchange  Ltd.  Model,  the 
payment to the lender of securities is fixed and linked to the value of the securities.  
 
This  model  further  envisages  investors  borrowing  the  securities  through  their 
depository participants. For that purpose, depository participants are registered with 
the  Depository  as  authorized  borrowers  for  their  clients.  Again,  in  the  Singapore 
model,  Depository  charges  fixed  rate  of  interest  from the Depository  Agents (DAs) 
for  their  borrowing  for  clients.  But,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  DAs  determine 
their own lending rates, while lending to the individual clients.  
 
It may be noted that it is basically a two tier model for the borrowing of the securities. 
First, depository is lending the securities to the DAs and then DAs are lending  the 
securities to the investors (their clients).  
 
It is important to mention here that in case of Singapore exchange, Depository called 
the Central Depository (CDP) is the clearing and depository division of the Singapore 
Exchange. Therefore, this kind of model may be created in India by the collaborative 
efforts of the clearing corporation/ house and the depositories. Only disadvantage in 
this model is that only the big investors would be eligible to be the part of the supply 
side  and  would  get  themselves  registered  with  depositories.  Other  small  investors 
may not be able to enjoy the values created through the system.  
 
Indeed, the model 1, suggested above is the refined version of this model wherein 
even  the  small  investors  would  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  lending  process 
through their depository participants.  Accordingly, some market participants feel that 
the  model  1  scores  over  the  instant  model  in  terms  of  values  to  the  investors  at 
large.

3.5 Model 4 – Lending through the special purpose bank. 
 
Creation of the special bank say “limited purpose bank“  for the securities lending and 
borrowing  is  another  idea  given  by  the  market  participants.  This  assumes  that  a 
dedicated entity can undertake the activity of supporting the securities market trades.  
 
It is felt that the dedicate bank may do things in an organized manner with available 
resources. People interested in lending the securities to the market may deposit their 
securities with this limited purpose bank and borrowers may borrow from this bank. 
As  described  in  case  of  the  funds  borrowing  and  lending,  this  bank  may  lend  the 
securities to clients in number of alternative following ways: 
 
?  Bank may lend the securities to clients direct.  
 
?  Bank may lend the securities to clients through the brokers of the exchanges.  
 
?  Bank  may  lend  the  securities  clients  through  the  clearing  corporation/exchange 

through an on-line trading platform 

 
In  the  first  two  cases,  bank  would  manage  its  risk  itself.  But,  in  the  last  scenario, 
exchange/clearing corporation would manage the risk for the bank. 
 
Advantages of this model are many: 
 
1.  It would be easy to track, who is lending the securities in the market and to what 
extent.  This  would  help  avoid  any  nexus  built  up  between  the  lender  of  the 
securities, brokers and issuer companies.   

 
2.  Total quantum of the securities lent would be known to the market at any point in 

time. Limits on the client wise borrowing would be easy to impose and monitor.

3.  This would make the risk management effective. 
 
4.  Audit trail would be easy to manage.  
 
Only  issue  in  this  model  is  the  creation  of  a  fresh  infrastructure.  Building  a 
nationwide  bank  would  require  both  money  and  time.  But,  that  may  be  navigated 
with co-ordinated efforts of the market participants. Another opinion on the issue is 
that the existing infrastructure of the banks/financial institutions/exchanges may be 
leveraged on for the purpose.  
 
This model is further dealt with in the part 5. 
 
All these models  mentioned above may not be mutually exclusive. Therefore,  there 
is always a possibility of having multiple models in the system. Indeed, they co-exist 
in the market and global markets bear testimony to it. 
 
Some market participants think that another important issue is that some institutions, 
specially  the  foreign  investors,  may  have  the  requirement  to  managing  their  own 
collateral as per their charters. Now, if India chooses to have only the model 1, they 
would not be able to participate in the deal as the sales proceeds from the short sale 
would  be  retained  by  the  Clearing  corporation/house  or  the  managing  party  of  the 
trading platform. Therefore, a system needs to be evolved for this kind of deals.  
 

Part 4 - Concept of the securities banking 

 
4.1 Introduction 
 
Securities Banking concept goes with the model 1 suggested above for the securities 
lending  and  borrowing.  This  concept  envisages  the  depositories/  depositories 
participants  to  become  the  securities  banks  i.e.  lend  securities,  earn  return  and 
share  that  with  their  customers/clients.  As  a  whole,  the  concept  imagines  that  the 
involvement  of  the  depositor  participants  in  the  securities  lending  and  borrowing 
mechanism  on  the  supply  side  would  result  in  the  value  creation  process  for  the 
individual  small  investors,  scattered  across  the  country.  This  would  create  an 
34

absolutely  fresh  opportunity  for  the  DPs/  Depositories  to  create  values  and  to  a 
certain extent address the issue of the cost of holding the electronic form of shares.  
 
On the operational side, it assumes that the contract agreement between DPs and 
clients may have  a standard clause wherein clients authorize the DPs to utilize their 
shares for stock lending and borrowing purposes (like in banks, it is understood by 
the customers that the bank would utilize the money for lending purpose). Now, DPs 
may use these shares for lending and generate money. Values generated from the 
business  may  be  passed  on  to  the  clients/  customers  in  terms  of  first  reduction  in 
cost of operating an account and then as interest on shares kept with DPs.  
 
Indeed,  a  scenario  may  be  visualized  when  DPs  would  offer  different  options  of 
accounts  like  current  account,  savings  account  or  term/fixed  accounts  to  their 
customers.  These  fixed  deposits  would  have  different  lock-in  periods  with  different 
interest rates.  
 
Further,  as  fixed  deposit  may  be  broken  prematurely  by  the  clients,  these 
intermediaries may have two choices – either don’t offer the premature option to the 
investors on their fixed deposits of securities or offer the option and in case of any 
unexpected shortfall, borrow the securities from the market based on their needs. As 
mentioned  above  in  the  model  one  for  securities  lending,  these  depository 
participants  would  be  allowed  to  borrow  the  securities  for  their  temporary  shortfall 
along with the actual short sellers in the market.  
 
Therefore, concept envisages that depository participants may transform themselves 
into a full fledge securities banks, over the period of time.  In that case,  prudent risk 
management practices of banking may be imported to demat industry. They need to 
just tailor the existing banking practices to suit to the best requirements of these new 
generation securities banks. 
 
This model would demand the risk management systems to be laid down. This may 
include the restrictions on the total  lending capabilities of the lenders. For instance, 
these  intermediaries  may  not  lend  more  than  say  X%  of  their  holdings  in  each 
category  (current  account,  savings  account,  different  durations  fixed  deposits)  / 
35

subject  to  the  overall  ceiling  of  Y%  on  the  total  lendable  securities  available  with 
them.  This would ensure some liquidity with the lenders at the same time they would 
not venture into business of borrowing securities to lend further.   
(Percentage X and Y needs to be defined by the regulator from time to time). 
 
4.2 Important issues in this model 
 
There are certain other issues in this model. They are mentioned below: 
 
?  All  the  securities  parked  with  the  DP  would  implicitly  be  available  with  DP  for 

lending purposes unless the client has explicitly denied for the same. 

 
?  DPs  and  custodians  may  be  registered  with  the  intermediary  managing  the 
trading  platform  (exchange  or  the  depository)  for  the  securities  lending  and 
borrowing, for the limited purpose of securities borrowing and lending. 

 
?  All  DPs  by  virtue  of  their  status  would  be  eligible  to  lend  the  securities  on  the 
proposed  system.  Here,  as  the  broker  members  of  the  exchanges  are  also 
allowed as DPs, regulator may need to revise the eligibility criterion for being DP 
itself.  Alternatively, to start with, only few strong DPs may be allowed to lend.  

?  Alternative model may be that only the Depository is allowed to lend the security 
and  the  depository  in  turn  appoints  its  DPs,  based  on  their  strengths,  to 
participate in the proposed lending and borrowing mechanism.  

 

Part 5 – Independent organization for margin trading and securities lending 

 
The  idea  of  funds  and  securities  lending  and  borrowing  through  an  independent 
entity has been discussed in the part 2 and part 3 of the report under the section of 
proposed  business  models.  Now,  thinking  is  that  a  single  dedicated  entity  may 
undertake  both  the  funds  and  securities  lending  activities.  In  other  words,  it  is 
envisaged that the independent entity may have a nationwide presence and all the 
interested  lenders  of  the  funds  and  the  securities  to  the  market  may  use  that  as

intermediary.  Similarly,  all  the  borrowers  of  the  funds  and  the  securities  would  be 
approaching this entity for the purpose. 
 
It is felt that this dedicate bank may do things in an organized manner with available 
resources – both funds and the securities. People interested in lending the funds and 
securities  to  the  market  may  deposit  them  with  this  limited  purpose  bank  and 
borrowers may borrow from this bank. As described somewhere else in this paper, 
business models for the lending funds and securities to the ultimate clients may be 
different as follows: 
  
?  Bank may lend the funds and securities to clients, direct.  
 
?  Bank  may  lend  the  funds  and  securities  to  clients  through  the  brokers  of  the 

exchanges.  

 
?  Bank  may  lend  the  funds  and  securities  to  clients  through  the  clearing 

corporation/exchange through an on-line trading platform.  

 
In  the  first  two  cases,  bank  would  manage  its  risk  itself.  But,  in  the  last  scenario, 
exchange/clearing corporation would manage the risk for the bank. 
 
Advantages of this model are many: 
 
1.  It would be easy to track, who is lending the funds and securities in the market 
and to what extent. This would help avoid any nexus built up between the lender 
of the funds and securities, brokers and issuer companies.   

 
2.  Total quantum of the  funds and securities lent would be known to the market at 
any point in time. Limits on the client wise borrowing would be easy to impose 
and monitor.  

 
3.  This would make the risk management effective.

4.  Audit trail would be easy to manage.  
 
Only  issue  in  this  model  is  the  creation  of  a  fresh  infrastructure.  Building  a 
nationwide bank would require both money and time. But, as mentioned earlier, that 
may  be  navigated  with  co-ordinated  efforts  of  the  market  participants.  Another 
opinion  on  the  issue  is  that  the  existing  infrastructure  of  the  banks/financial 
institutions/exchanges may be leveraged on for the purpose.  
 

Part 6 - Conclusion 

 
Topic may be concluded with the following important points: 
 
Margin trading has features similar to other forms of leveraged trading mechanism 
such as ALBM, BLESS or MCFS, which were banned recently.  
 
Globally, it is believed that the facility of the securities and funds borrowing facility is 
important  to  support  the  rolling  settlement  and  the  physical  settlement  of  the 
derivatives.  It  is  also  important  from  the  perspective  of  the  better  price  discovery, 
efficiency of the system, hedging and arbitrage as explained in detail under the head 
value drivers. 
 
Margin  trading  internationally  is  an  activity  outside  the  purview  of  the  exchanges. 
But, exchanges and clearing house/ corporations are generally there to facilitate the 
transactions. The same situation is envisaged in the proposed models in the Indian 
Securities Market. 
 
In the proposed systems, it is assumed that at no point in time, money or securities 
lending  would  be  clubbed  with  the  actual  settlement  of  the  normal  trading  on  the 
exchanges,  before  or  after  the  execution.  These  would  essentially  be  independent 
activities.

All the proposed models assume that a person would not be able to lend the funds or 
the securities, until he/she holds them in advance. In other words, nobody would be 
able to lend against his/her future proceeds. 
 
Based  on  the  comments  from  the  public,  SEBI  would  prepare  an  approach  paper 
which  will  be 
(SMAC). 
Recommendations of this SMAC will be posted on the web-site for the comments of 
public once again before final decision on the subject.
