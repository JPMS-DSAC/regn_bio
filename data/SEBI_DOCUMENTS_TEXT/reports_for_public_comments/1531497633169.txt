MARKET) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 

1.  BACKGROUND 

 

1.1 Investor  confidence  is  fundamental  to  the  successful  operation  of  securities  market.  That 

confidence  depends  on  investors  having  credible  and  reliable  financial  information  when 

making decisions about capital allocation. 

1.2 In pursuit of the objectives of SEBI (to protect the interests of investors in securities and to 

promote the development of and to regulate the securities market), it is important to ensure 

full, timely, and accurate disclosure of financial results and other information that is material 

to  investors’  decisions.  Full  and  fair  disclosure  is  essential  to  investor  protection,  enhances 

investor confidence, and promotes market liquidity and efficiency.  

1.3 An issuer may issue securities after making the required disclosures and after complying with 

applicable  SEBI  Regulations.  In  pursuit  of  the  objective  of  the  SEBI  Act,  SEBI  has  made 

various Regulations: 

 

 

 

 

a)  to facilitate raising of capital through issue of various securities, such as SEBI (Listing 

Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, SEBI (Issue of Capital 

and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009,  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt 

Securities) Regulations, 2008, etc.  

b)  for  channelization  of  savings  of  investors  in  the  securities  market  through  pooled 

Investment  Vehicles,  such  as  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  SEBI 

(Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, etc.;  

c)  to  facilitate  corporate  restructuring  such  as  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares 

and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations, 1998, 

SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009; 

d)  for  regulating  intermediaries  in  the  Securities  Market,  such  as  SEBI  (Portfolio 

Managers)  Regulations,  1993,  SEBI  (Merchant  Bankers)  Regulations,  1992,  SEBI 

(Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992, etc. 

 

1.4 The Regulations relating to the issue of capital mainly follow a disclosure based regime and 

investors 

rely  upon 

the  offer  documents  and 

financial  statements  which  are 

audited/examined/vetted  by  various  fiduciaries  such  as  Chartered  Accountant,  Company 

Secretary,  Valuer  etc.  and  also  by  various  intermediaries  in  the  securities  market.  Various 

fiduciaries  undertake  assignments  and  engagements  under  these  Regulations  and  provide 

various  certificates  and  reports  to  issuers,  companies,  intermediaries,  pool  investment 

vehicles,  investor  in  the  securities  market,  etc.  For  example,  the  certificate  requirement 

specified under the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009

1.5 Similar  assignments  and  engagements  are  taken  by  the  fiduciaries  under  other  Regulations. 

The  fiduciaries  also  play  an  important  role  in  respect  of  intermediaries.  These  fiduciaries 

periodically  conduct  audit  of  the  books  of  accounts  and  issue  compliance  certificates  as  to 

whether  the  intermediary  has  maintained  the  required  net-worth,  whether  risk  management 

systems  are  in  place,  whether  the  intermediary  has  a  robust  mechanism  for  redressal  of 

investor grievances or maintain records as per the regulations etc. 

 

1.6 Some  of  the  fiduciaries  such  as  Merchant  Bankers,  Credit  Rating  Agencies,  Custodian, 

Debenture  Trustees,  Registrar  to  an  Issue,  etc.  are  registered  and  regulated  by  SEBI  under 

specific Regulations notified for the said purpose.  

1.7 On  the  other  hand  there  are,  certain  other  fiduciaries  such  as  Practicing  Chartered 

Accountants,  Practicing  Company  Secretaries,  Cost  Accountants,  Valuers,  Monitoring 

Agencies, etc. that are neither registered nor regulated by SEBI. However, as per the various 

SEBI Regulations, they are engaged by the issuers, intermediaries, pool investment vehicles, 

 

5 | P a g e  

 

investor  in  the  securities  market,  etc.  to  issue  certificates  or  reports  as  required  under  the 

respective regulations, similar to that as has been elaborated in the table at para 1.4. 

1.8 Recommendation and rationale of Kotak Committee: 

The  Committee  on  Corporate  Governance  headed  by  Mr.  Uday  Kotak  while  considering 

measure  to  strengthening  monitoring,  oversight  and  enforcement  related  to  accounting  and 

audit related issues by SEBI, recommended that – 

Given SEBI’s mandate to protect the interests of investors in the securities market and 

regulating listed entities, the Committee recommends that SEBI should have clear powers 

to  act  against  auditors  and  other  third  party  fiduciaries  with  statutory  duties  under 

securities  law,  subject  to  appropriate  safeguards.  This  power  ought  to  extend  to  act 

against the impugned individual(s), as well as against the firm in question with respect to 

their functions concerning listed entities. This power should be provided in case of gross 

negligence as well, and not just in case of fraud/connivance. 

1.9 The  SEBI  Act,  1992  empowers  SEBI  to  issue  directions  to  any  person  associated  with  the 

securities market (including fiduciaries in the securities market), in the interest of investors or 

for the orderly development of securities market.  Under these provisions, SEBI, through its 

enforcement  proceedings  has  taken  action  in  the  past,  against  various  fiduciaries  in  the 

securities  market.  However,  since  these  fiduciaries  in  the  securities  market  are  not 

specifically registered with SEBI or regulated by SEBI under any Regulations notified for the 

said  purpose,  there  may  be  a  need  to  clarify  and  specify  the  actions  that  may  be  taken  by 

SEBI against such fiduciaries in case they submit false reports or certificates etc. 

 

2.  SCOPE 

2.1 This  paper and the proposed  amendment in  various  Regulations concern those entities who 

undertake third party fiduciary duties/assignments/engagements under the securities laws, in 

respect  of  any  Issuer,  Pooled  Investment  Vehicle,  Restructuring,  Intermediaries,  Market 

Infrastructure Entities or investors in the securities.  

 

6 | P a g e
