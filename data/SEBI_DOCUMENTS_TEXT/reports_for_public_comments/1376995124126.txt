Discussion Paper on "Revision of Clause – 41 of Equity Listing 

Agreement" 

 

Background: 
 
1.  Clause-41  of  Equity  Listing  Agreement  provides  the  framework  for 
preparation,  authentication  and  submission  of  Financial  Results  by  listed 
companies. 

2.  Though  sub-clauses  of  Clause-41  have  been  regularly  updated  as  and 
when  the  need  arose,  revision  of  entire  Clause-41  is  proposed  to  be 
undertaken due to the following: 

a)  As the focus of the present Clause-41 is on manufacturing companies, 
the non-manufacturing companies are required to make disclosures in 
line  with  that  of  manufacturing  companies  which  may  not  be 
appropriate. 

b)  Piece-meal  updation  of  sub-clauses  within  the  Clause-41  has    led  to 

inconsistencies and ambiguities in interpretation of the policy intent. 

c)  Receipt of various representations requesting for modifications. 

d)  Recent  adoption  of  Revised  Schedule-VI  of  Companies  Act,  1956, 

revision in Accounting/ Auditing Standards, etc. 

Reference to SEBI Committee on Disclosures and Accounting Standards 
(SCODA) 
 
3.  SCODA  is  an  advisory  committee  constituted  by  SEBI  to  advice  on 
matters relating to disclosures and accounting standards. As part of review 
of  the  extant  norms  relating  to  disclosure  requirements,  the  committee 
reviewed the Clause-41 of the Equity Listing Agreement.  

Revised Clause-41 
 
4.  Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  said  committee,  some  of  the 
provisions  of  Clause-41  have  been  revised  and  the  same  is  placed  at 
Annexure.  The  revised  format  is  expected  to  improve  the  disclosure 
standards and reduce the compliance cost/time for the listed companies.  

As  the  Companies  Bill,  2012  is  in  the  process  of  being  implemented;  the 
proposed  disclosure  requirements  under  Clause-41  may  be  revised  to 
make them consistent with requirements of Companies Bill, 2012.

The salient features of the revised Clause-41 are as under: 

Proposed new requirements  

4.1.  Format  for  Finance  Companies:  As  the  nature  of  business  of  Finance 
Companies  is  similar  to  banking  companies,  the  formats  have  been 
suitably  modified  which  can  now  be  used  by  both  banking  companies 
and other finance companies.  

4.2.  Disclosure  of  half  yearly  (every  six  months)  consolidated  financial 
statements: The disclosure of half yearly (every six months) consolidated 
financial  statements  has  been  made  mandatory  in  case  there  is  a 
variation in the revenue / total assets / total liabilities / profits (loss) in the 
consolidated financial results of 20% or more vis-à-vis the corresponding 
amounts in the standalone financial results as per the last annual audited 
financial statements.  

4.3.  In respect of foreign subsidiaries/ joint ventures the consolidated results 
shall  include  reviewed/  audited  results  of  such  number  of  foreign 
subsidiaries  which  together  with  the  reviewed/  audited  results  of  all 
Indian subsidiaries/ joint ventures would constitute not less than 80% of 
the consolidated turnover/ net worth/ profit (loss). 

4.4.  Mandatory  disclosure  of  Book  Value  of  equity  shares  half  yearly  (every 

six months). 

4.5.  Mandatory  presentation  of  amounts  in  financial  statements    in  Rs.  Cr. 

with 2 decimals in order to bring consistency and easy comparability.  

4.6.  Mandatory  submission  of  statement  of  cash  flow  half  yearly  (every  six 

months) in addition to the statement of assets and liabilities. 

4.7.  Mandatory disclosure of details of the discontinued operations as part of 

the notes to the financial results. 

4.8.  The  financial  results  of  the  companies  which  do  not  have  a  Managing 
Director,  are  compulsorily  required  to  be  approved  by  the  Board  as  the 
Committee for approval of financial results cannot be formed without the 
Managing Director.  In  order to  enable such companies to constitute  the 
Committee  for  approval  of  financial  results,  it  has  been  proposed  that  
the  Committee  for  approval  of  financial  results  shall  consist  of  not  less 
than one third of the directors and shall include  at least one whole time 
Director and one independent director. 

Proposed modifications 

4.9.  Publication  of  the  results  in  notified  Indian  Accounting  Standards:  The 
option of publishing consolidated results only in IFRS to be discontinued 
and  listed  companies  will  be  required  to  submit  consolidated  financial 
results as per notified AS (Indian GAAP). The listed companies may still 

 

Page 2 of 53 

have option to submit consolidated financial results as per IFRS notified 
by IASB in addition to publishing financial results as per notified AS. 

4.10. The formats of the Auditor's Report have been revised to align them with 
reporting  requirements  under  revised  auditing  standards,  such  as  SRE 
2410  (“Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent  Auditor  of  the  Entity”),  SA  700  –  706  (Standards  of 
Auditing), etc. 

4.11. The reference to "Chairman" has been replaced with "Chairperson". 

Proposed clarifications 

4.12. Clarification to Clause 41(I)(d) on the last quarter results: The figures of 
last  quarter  are  the  balancing  figures  between  the  audited  figures  in 
respect  of  the  full  financial  year  and  the  published  year  to  date  figures 
upto the quarter preceding the last quarter  of the financial year. Hence, 
the  same  shall  be  stated  as  “Fourth  Quarter  (balancing figures)”  unless 
the company presents audited quarterly financial results. Further, in such 
cases, no separate review / audit report is required to be submitted to the 
stock exchange with respect to the last quarter. 

4.13. Disclosure  of  impact  of  change  in  accounting  policy:    If  there  are  any 
changes  in  the  accounting  policies  during  the  year,  the  impact  of  the 
same  on  the  prior  quarters  of  the  year,  included  in  the  current  quarter 
results,  shall  be  disclosed  separately  by  way  of  a  note  to  the  financial 
results  of  the  current  quarter,  without  restating  the  previously  published 
figures. 

4.14. Clause - 41 refers to the expression “qualification or other reservation”. It 
is  clarified  that  the  expression  “other  reservation”  would  mean  “in  the 
nature of an adverse comment or disclaimer".  

4.15. “Exceptional Items” are highly judgmental and it was observed that many 
companies follow  divergent  and  inconsistent  practices. The  ‘exceptional 
items’ shall be disclosed as a line item in the main table instead of in the 
"Notes" to enhance visibility. Further, the definition of ‘exceptional items’ 
has also been modified to bring more clarity in disclosures. 

4.16. The  term  “Half-year”  has  been  modified  to  “every  six  months  in  the 
financial  year”  to  facilitate  companies  having  financial  year  with  fifteen 
months/ eighteen months.  

4.17. If a company submits quarterly consolidated financial results in addition 
to the standalone financial results, it may submit the  quarterly or annual 
segment information only in the consolidated financial results. 

4.18. The  quarterly  standalone  and  consolidated  (where  applicable)  financial 
results shall be approved on the same date by the Board of Directors of 
the company or by a committee thereof, other than the Audit Committee, 
and shall be submitted together, to the Stock Exchange. 

 

Page 3 of 53 

Proposed deletion 

4.19. Removal of the requirement for management to respond to variations in 
excess of 10% between the unaudited results and the reviewed/audited 
results, as auditors are now required to carry out their review/ audit prior 
to submission of the results making the said requirement redundant. 

5.  Public Comments 
 
It  is  proposed  to  replace  the  existing  Clause-41  of  Equity  Listing  Agreement 
with  the  draft  placed  at  Annexure.  Considering  the  importance  of  Clause-41 
for  listed  companies,  public  comments  on  the  draft  proposals  are  solicited. 
Specific  comments/  suggestions  clearly  indicating  the  sub-clause  referred  to 
would  be  highly  appreciated.  Such  comments  may  please  be  emailed  on  or

figures between the audited figures in respect of the full financial year and the

applicable  Accounting  Standards1and  other  recognised  accounting  practices  and  policies.    Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a

The  said  Part  I  of  the  Statement  includes  the  financial  results  of  the  following  entities  (list  of  entities  included  in  the

Scope of Review 
 
We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review  Engagements  (SRE)  2410,  ‘Review  of  Interim  Financial

matters,  and  applying  analytical  and  other  review  procedures.  A  review is  substantially  less  in  scope than  an  audit  conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of 
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our  attention that causes us to believe that the said Part I of the 
Statement  is  not  prepared,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  applicable  Accounting  Standards  and  other  recognised 
accounting practices and policies and has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Clause 41 of the Listing 
Agreement including the manner in which it is to be disclosed. 
 
Other Matters 

We did not review the interim financial information of _____ (number) branches included in the said Part I of the Statement. These 
interim  financial  information    have  been  reviewed  by  the  branch  auditors2  whose  reports  have  been  furnished  to  us,  and  our 
conclusion on the said Part I of the Statement, to the extent the same has been derived from such interim financial information, is 
based solely on the reports of such branch auditors. 

[We did not review the interim financial statements / information of _______ (number) subsidiaries and _______ (number)  jointly 
controlled  entities  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  results,  whose  interim  financial  statements  /  information  reflect    total 
assets (net) of Rs________ as at ________  (date of quarter / period end);   as well as total revenue (net) of Rs________ and Rs. 
________  for  the  quarter  and  period  ended  ________  (date  of  quarter  /  period  end),  respectively,  as  considered  in  the 
consolidated financial results.  The consolidated financial results also include the Group’s share of net profit /( loss) of Rs. ________ 
and  Rs.  ________  for  the  quarter  and  period  ended  ________  (date  of  quarter  /  period  end),  respectively,  as  considered  in  the 
consolidated financial results, in respect of _______(number)associates, whose interim financial statements / information have not 
been  reviewed  by  us.  These  interim  financial  statements  /  information  have  been  reviewed  /  audited  by  other  auditors  whose

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  said  Part  I  of  the  Statement  based  on  our  audit  of  such  interim  financial 
statements/consolidated  interim  financial  statements*.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  of  Auditing

assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the interim financial statements/consolidated interim financial statements*,

order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
