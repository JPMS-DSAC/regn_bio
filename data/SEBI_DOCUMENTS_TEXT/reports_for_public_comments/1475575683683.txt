CONSULTATIVE PAPER 

 

Corporate Governance Issues in Compensation Agreements 

 

 
A. Background: 

 

1.  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015 
(Listing Regulations) were notified on September 02, 2015 and came into effect 
from  December  01,  2015.  The  Regulations  provide  a  regulatory  framework  for 
continuous disclosures and other obligations related to listed entities, which inter 
alia, include corporate governance, related party disclosures, etc.  
 

into  side  agreements  with 

2.  It  has  come  to  the  notice  of  SEBI  that  certain  Private  Equity  (PE)  firms  have 
entered 
top  personnel  and  key  managerial 
personnel(KMPs)  of  a  listed  entity  by  which  such  PE  firms  (  who  were  allotted 
shares on a preferential basis) would share a certain portion of the gains above a 
certain  threshold  limit  made  by  them  at  the  time  of  selling  the  shares  and  also 
subject to the conditions that the company achieves certain performance criteria 
and the employee continues with the company for a certain period.   
 

B. Need for Review: 

 

3.  It is not unusual for private equity funds to incentivize promoters/ MDs/ CEOs of 
investee companies, based on performance of such companies. However, when 
such  reward  agreements  are  executed  between  the  private  equity  investor  and 
the  Promoter/  MD  of  the  listed  entity  without  any  prior  approval  of  the 
shareholders,  it  does  give  rise  to  concerns.  It  could  potentially  lead  to  unfair 
practices.  
 

4.  It  is  felt  that  such  agreements  are  not  desirable  and  hence  it  is  necessary  to 
regulate  such  practices.  One  view  is  that  there  is  no  place  at  all  for  such  side 
agreements in case of listed companies. Another view is that the focus may be 
on  the  principle  of  disclosure  and  transparency  in  governance  of  listed  entities. 
Therefore,  before  key  managerial  personnel,  directors  and  promoters  of  listed 
entities  enter  into  such  reward  agreements,  it  would  be  mandated  that  such

agreements undergo thorough scrutiny of the boards and shareholders who may 
vote on the resolution approving such agreements. 

 

5.  The  matter  was  placed  before  the  Board  in  its  meeting  held  on  September  23, 
2016.  The  Board  approved  the  proposal  for  initiation  of  public  consultation 
process on corporate governance issues in compensation agreements in case of 
listed companies.  
 
C. Proposal 

 

6.  The  consultation  paper  proposes  to  seek  public  comments  on  the  possible 

amendments to Listing Regulations, as detailed below: 
 
6.1. A new sub-regulation (6) may be added to Regulation 26 (which pertains to 
obligations  with  respect  to  directors  and  senior  management)  to  provide  on 
the following lines:  

"No employee, including key managerial personnel, director or promoter of a 
listed entity shall enter into any agreement with any individual shareholder(s) 
or  any other  third  party  with  regard  to  compensation  or profit  sharing  unless 
prior approval has been obtained from the Board as well as shareholders by 

 
 
 
 
 
  way of an ordinary resolution".  
 
"Provided that all such  existing  agreements  entered into prior to the date of 
 
notification  and  which  may  continue  beyond  such  date  shall  be  informed  to 
 
the  stock  exchanges  for  public  dissemination  and  approval  obtained  from 
 
 
shareholders  by  way  of  an  ordinary  resolution  in  the  forthcoming  general 
  meeting.  Provided  further  that  in  case  approval  from  shareholders  is  not 
 

received, all such agreements shall be discontinued ".
