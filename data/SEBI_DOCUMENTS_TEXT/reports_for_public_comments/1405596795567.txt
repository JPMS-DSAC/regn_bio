Draft SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 

SEBI  had  come  out  with  a  consultation  paper  on  Infrastructure  Investment  Trusts 
("InvITs")  on  December  20,  2013  on  which  comments  were  sought  till  January  20, 
2014.  

In the Budget for FY 2014-15, identifying the needs and requirement of Infrastructure 
sector, Hon'ble Finance Minister announced as under: 

'….As  an  innovation,  a  modified  REITS  type  structure  for  infrastructure  projects  is 
also  being  announced  as  Infrastructure  Investment  Trusts  (InvITs),  which  would 
have  a  similar  tax  efficient  pass  through  status,  for  PPP  and  other  infrastructure 
projects.  These  structures  would  reduce  the  pressure  on  the  banking  system  while 
also  making  available  fresh  equity.  I  am  confident  these  two  instruments  would 
attract long term finance from foreign and domestic sources including the NRIs… 

…  I  have provided a  conducive tax  regime  for  Infrastructure  Investment  Trusts and 
Real  Estate  Investment  Trusts  to  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  regulations  of  the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India..' 

In  pursuance  to  the  Budget  Announcement,  Finance  Bill  for  FY2014-15  provided 
various provisions in the Income Tax Act with respect to InvITs.  

Based  on  the  comments  received  on  the  consultative  paper  and  the  Budget 
announcement,  a  separate  regulatory  framework  under  draft  SEBI  (Infrastructure 
Investment  Trusts)  Regulations,  2014  (referred  to  as  "Regulations"  hereafter)  is 
being proposed for introducing InvITs in India.  

Salient features of the draft Regulations are as under: 

1.  InvITs are proposed to provide a suitable structure for financing/refinancing of 

infrastructure projects in the country.  

2.  Infrastructure  is  as  defined  by  Cabinet  Committee  on  Infrastructure  vide 
Notification of Ministry of Finance dated March 1, 2012 and shall include any 
amendments/additions made thereof.  

3.  InVITs shall invest in infrastructure projects, either directly or through SPV. In 

case of PPP projects, such investments shall only be through SPV.  

4.  An InvIT which proposes to invest atleast 80% of the value of the assets in the 
completed  and  revenue  generating  Infrastructure  assets,  shall  raise  funds 
only through public issue of units and minimum subscription size and trading 
lot for such InvIT shall be Rs five lakhs. Rest 20% may be invested in under 
construction  infrastructure  projects  (subject  to  maximum  of  10%)  and  other 
permissible investments. 

5.  An InvIT which proposes to invest more than 10% of the value of their assets 
in  under  construction  infrastructure  projects  shall  necessarily  raise  funds 
through  private  placement  from  Qualified  Institutional  Buyers  and  body 
corporate and the minimum investment and trading lot for such InvITs shall be 
of  Rs.  1  crore.  Such  InvITs  shall  mandatorily  invest  in  not  less  than  one 
completed  and  revenue  generating  project  and  not  less  than  one  pre-COD 
project.  

6.  Listing  shall  be  mandatory  for  both  publicly  offered  and  privately  placed 

InvITs. 

7.  An InvIT prior to making an offer of units, either through public issue or private 
placement,  may  have  Strategic  Investors  such  as  banks,  international 
multilateral  financial  institutions,  FPIs  including  sovereign  wealth  funds,  etc.,  
which together invest not less than 5% of the size of the InvIT or such amount 
as may be specified by the Board. 

8.  An  InvIT  shall  be  a  trust  with  parties  such  as  Sponsor(s),  Investment 

Manager, Trustee and Project Manager(s). 

9.  A trustee of InvIT can either be: 

a.  a Debenture Trustee registered with SEBI and not an associate of the 

sponsor(s)/investment manager; or 

b.  an associate of  the  sponsor/investment manager  having  not  less  than 
50% of its directors as independent and not related parties to the InvIT; 

However,  a  trustee  of  InvIT  cannot  be  trustee  to  another  InvIT  or  an 
Alternative Investment Fund engaged in infrastructure sector. 

10. The  proposed  holding  of  an  InvIT  in  the  underlying  assets  shall  be  not  less 
than Rs 500 crore and the offer size of the InvIT shall not be less then Rs 250 
crore at the time of initial offer of units. 

11. The aggregate  consolidated borrowing  of  the  InvIT  and  the  underlying  SPVs 
shall  never  exceed  49%  of  the  value  of  InvIT  assets.  However,  this  may 
exclude any debt infused by the InvIT in the underlying SPV. Further, for any 
borrowing  exceeding  25%  of  the  value  of  InvIT  assets,  requirement  of  credit 
rating and unit holders approval has been made mandatory.
