Discussion Paper on 'Review of guidelines governing stock related 

employee benefit schemes' 

 

Background: 
 
1.  SEBI  has  (i)  issued  SEBI  (ESOS  &  ESPS)  Guidelines,  1999  ("ESOS 

Guidelines")  to  enable  listed  companies  to  reward  their  employees  through 

stock  option  schemes  and  stock  purchase  schemes  and  (ii)  notified  SEBI 

(Issue  of  Sweat  Equity)  Regulations,  2002  ("Sweat  Equity  Regulations")  to 

regulate  issuance of  sweat  equity  shares  by  listed  companies  in accordance 

with Section 79A of the Companies Act, 1956. The ESOS Guidelines provide 

the  framework  for  two  stock  related  employee  benefit  schemes,  namely  (i) 

“Employee  Stock  Option  Schemes”  –  “Part  A”  and  (ii)  “Employee  Stock 

Purchase Scheme” – “Part B”. These Schemes can either be administered by 

the company itself or through a Trust. 

 

2.  Under  the  ESOS  Guidelines,  an  ESOS/ESPS  Trust  can  only  distribute 

options/shares  to  its  employees  issued  by  the  company.  However,  ESOS 

Guidelines,  till  recently,  were  silent  regarding  acquisition  of  shares  from 

secondary market.  It  came to the notice of SEBI that some listed  companies 

were  framing their own employees benefit schemes wherein  Trusts  were set 

up  to  deal  in  their  own  securities  in  the  secondary  market,  which  was  not 

envisaged within the purview of the ESOS Guidelines.  

 

3.  It  was  apprehended  that  some  entities  may  frame  such  schemes  with  the 

purpose  of  dealing  in  their  own  securities  with  the  object  of  inflating, 

depressing, maintaining or causing fluctuation in the price of the securities by 

engaging  in  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices.  Such  dealing  in  the 

company’s shares by the Trusts may also raise regulatory concerns regarding 

compliance  with  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices 

 

Page 1 of 17 

relating to the Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 and SEBI (Prohibition of 

Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992.   

 

4.  In  order  to  address  the  concerns  over  acquisition  of  shares  by  employee 

welfare trusts from the secondary market, it was decided to prohibit the listed 

companies from framing any employee benefit scheme involving acquisition of 

own securities from the secondary market.  

 

5.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the  approval  of  SEBI  Board  in  its  meeting  held  on 

August  16,  2012,  SEBI  issued  a  circular  dated  January  17,  2013,  inter-alia, 

prohibiting  secondary  market  acquisitions  by  employee  welfare  trusts  and 

requiring  existing  employee  welfare  schemes  to  align  themselves  with  the 

ESOS  Guidelines  by  June  30,  2013.  The  companies  having  non-compliant 

schemes  were  directed  to  disclose  the  details  of  such  schemes,  their 

beneficiaries and the holdings to stock exchanges within 30 days from date of 

the circular.  

 

6.  Subsequently,  representations  were  received  by  SEBI  from  various  industry 

bodies  and  companies  citing  difficulties  in  ensuring  compliance  with  the 

provisions of the aforesaid circular dated January 17, 2013. To address these 

concerns, SEBI vide circular dated May 13, 2013 clarified, inter-alia, as under: 

a.  The timeline for alignment was extended to December 31, 2013; 

b.  Trusts  which  have  already  acquired  securities  of  the  company  from 

secondary market before the date of first circular i.e. January 17, 2013 

may  continue  to  hold  such  securities  beyond  December  31,  2013 

provided such schemes have been aligned with the ESOS Guidelines; 

c.  Non-ESOP  schemes  involving  securities  of  the  company  were 

permitted  to  hold  the  securities  already  acquired  by  them  beyond 

December 31, 2013 provided the schemes have been aligned or else 

the  schemes  were  required  to  dispose-off  securities  of  the  company 

by December 31, 2013; 

d.  Additional  disclosures  regarding  details  of  schemes  to  the  stock 

exchanges were prescribed in specified formats.

Need for review: 

 

7.  It  was 

felt 

that  secondary  market  acquisitions  by  Trusts  being  an 

internationally  accepted  practice  should  be  considered  subject  to  necessary 

safeguards  to  prevent  misuse.  It  was  also  noted  that  secondary  market 

acquisitions allow companies to grant options to employees without having to 

dilute  their  existing  share  capital.  Further,  it  was  also  recognized  that  there 

are many kinds of employee benefit schemes involving own securities which 

being outside the purview of extant ESOS Guidelines are unregulated. There 

is also a need to provide for a suitable regulatory framework for such kind of 

schemes. 

 

8.  It was also felt that considering the provisions in Section 11A of the SEBI Act, 

1992,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  convert 

the  ESOS  Guidelines  into 

Regulations.  

 

Review process: 

 

9.  Accordingly, a Group with representatives from corporates, industry body, and 

trustee firms was formed by SEBI to deliberate on a framework for framing a 

set  of  regulations  with  a  view  to  ensure  better  enforceability,  address  the 

concerns  raised  with  regard  to  composition  of  employee  welfare  trusts, 

disclosures, etc. and  to enable secondary market transactions with adequate 

safeguards.  

 
10. The  report  of  the  Group  was  placed  before  the  Primary  Market  Advisory 

Committee  (PMAC)  of  SEBI  for  deliberations.  PMAC  suggested  some 

improvisations  and  recommended  that  public  comments  be  sought  on  the 

recommendations  of  the  report.  Accordingly,  various  issues  along  with  the 

recommendations thereon are listed in the Annexure.
