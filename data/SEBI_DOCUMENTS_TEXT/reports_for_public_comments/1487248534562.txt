Debenture  Trustees  (DTs)  for  examining  the  "Challenges  in  performing  the  obligations 
and duties as Debenture Trustees to protect the interests of the debenture holders". The 
task force  discussed the  amendments  to  be made  in  the  DT  Regulations  to  harmonise 
the  existing  provisions  with  that  of  the  Companies  Act  2013,  to  fortify  the  existing 
provisions to enable the debenture trustees to perform the task of securing the interest of 
the 
its 
recommendations  which,  inter  alia,  include  proposal  regarding  amendments  to  DT 
Regulations which can be classified in three broad issues: 

investors  and  consequential  changes.  The  Task  Force  has  submitted 

S.N.  Details of Amendments  
1. 

Amendments required in SEBI (Debenture Trustee Regulations), 1993 in the 
light  of  the  changes  in  the  Companies  Act  2013,  (Share  Capital  and

B.  Need for Review 
2.  It is observed that several existing provisions in the DT Regulations had reference to the 
Companies  Act,  1956  which  have  been  repealed  and  replaced  by  the  Companies  Act, 
2013.  Therefore,  such  provisions  in  the  DT  Regulations  require  to  be  amended  to 
synchronise them with the corresponding provisions in the Companies Act, 2013.  

3.  It  is  felt  that  several  existing  provisions  in  the  DT  Regulations  require  changes/ 
modifications/  improvements  to  enable  the  debenture  trustees  to  perform  the  task  of 
securing the interest of the investors more effectively. 

4.  It is felt that the provisions regarding liability for action against Debenture Trustees with 
regard  to  default/  non-compliance  require  to  be  modified  to  streamline  them  with  other 
SEBI Regulations so as to have consistency.

The  definition  of  associate

harmonized  with  the  definition 
as mentioned in the Companies

other company has a significant

of 
"significant 
influence"  means  control  of  at 
least  twenty  per  cent  of  total 
share  capital,  or  of  business 
decisions under an agreement;

As  the  regulations  talk  about 
"Issuers'  Auditor",  the  issuers 
insist  on  providing  certificate 
from 
Auditors‘ 
‗Concurrent  Auditors',  etc. 
and  not  Statutory  Auditors. 
Since,  the  Statutory  Auditor 
has  fiduciary  duties  towards 
the  Shareholders  of 
the 
Company  and  they  are  in  a 
better position to comment on 
the  financial  position  of  the 
Company,  it  is  proposed  to 
modify the clause to mandate 
the  Debenture  Trustees 
to 
obtain  certificate  of  end-
utilisation  of  issue  proceeds 
from  the  Statutory  Auditor  of 
the issuer company.   
 
Therefore, 
Regulation 
15(1A)(c)  may  be  replaced 
as stated. 
Since there may be investors‘ 
complaints/  grievances  etc. 
regarding 
the  payment  of 
redemption  amount, 
is 
proposed  that  the  books  and 
records  shall  be  maintained 
for  a  period  of  not  less  than
