Portfolio Managers – Proposal on Regulation of Fees and Charges  

 

A. Background 
 

Managers) Regulations 1993.  
 

1.  Portfolio  Managers  are  registered  and  regulated  under  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 

2.  As  per  the  aforesaid  regulations,  the  inter  se  relationship  between  the  portfolio 
to 
manager  and  client,  mutual  rights, 
management  of  funds  or  portfolio  of  securities  are  specified  in  the  agreement 
signed between the portfolio manager and the client. The contents of the portfolio 
manager-client agreement are laid out in Regulation 14 to be read with Schedule 
IV of the SEBI (Portfolio Manager) Regulations 1993. 
 

liabilities  and  obligations  relating 

3.  SEBI  has  been  receiving  complaints  from  clients  relating  to  fees  and  charges 
being levied by portfolio managers. Upon scrutiny of the complaints, it has come to 
the  notice  of  SEBI  that  the  clauses  relating  to  fees  and  charges  in  the  portfolio 
manager-client  agreement  do  not  always  clearly  reflect  the  fees  and  charges 
payable by the client and the manner of computation of the same.  

 
B. Proposal 
 

4.  In order to bring about greater uniformity, clarity and transparency with regard to 
fees and charges, it is proposed to advise portfolio managers to take the following 
measures in respect of all client agreements:  

Fees and Charges 
a)  Profit  sharing  /  performance  related  fees  are  usually  charged  by  portfolio 
managers  upon  exceeding  a  hurdle  rate  as  specified  in  the  agreement.  It  is 
proposed  to  be  advised  that,  henceforth,  profit  sharing  /  performance  related 
fees shall be charged on the basis of high water mark principle over the life of 
the investment.  
 
High Water Mark Principle: The high water mark principle means that if the 
portfolio value goes down and then recovers, the manager does not earn fees 
till all losses have been made up. High Water Mark shall be the highest value 
that the portfolio/account has reached. Value of the portfolio for computation of

less 

high watermark shall be taken to be the value on the date when performance 
fees are charged. For the purpose of charging performance fee, the frequency 
shall  not  be 
than  quarterly.  The  portfolio  manager  shall  charge 
performance  based  fee  only  on  increase  in  portfolio  value  in  excess  of  the 
previously achieved high water mark.  
 
Illustration: Consider that frequency of charging of performance fees is annual. 
A client’s initial contribution is Rs.10,00,000, which then rises to Rs.12,00,000 
in  its  first  year,  a  performance  fee/  profit  sharing  would  be  payable  on  the 
Rs.2,00,000  return. 
to 
Rs.11,00,000, hence no performance fee would be payable. If in the third year 
the Portfolio rises to Rs.13,00,000, a performance fee/profit sharing would be 
payable only on the Rs1,00,000 profit which is portfolio value in excess of the 
previously  achieved  high  water  mark  of  Rs.12,00,000,  rather  than  on  the  full 
return during that year from Rs.11,00,000 to Rs.13,00,000. 
 

the  portfolio  value  dropped 

the  next  year 

In 

b)  All  fees  and  charges  shall  be  charged  on  the  actual  amount  of  clients’  funds 

under management. 
 

c)  In  the  event  of  partial  withdrawal  of  funds  by  investors,  all  fees  and  charges 
shall  be  proportionately  charged  based  on  the  time  after  which  withdrawal  is 
made  and  the  value  of  funds  withdrawn,  and  the  high  watermark  shall  be 
accordingly adjusted.  
 

Maximum Liability 
 
d)  Regulation  14(1)(b)(xiii)  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers)  Regulations,  1993 
provides that the agreement between the portfolio manager and the client shall, 
inter alia, contain, in case of a discretionary portfolio manager, a condition that 
the  liability  of  a  client  shall  not  exceed  his  investment  with  the  portfolio 
manager. 
 

e)  Portfolio managers shall strictly comply with the aforesaid Regulation. 

Disclosure of fees and charges 
 
f)  To ensure transparency and adequate disclosure regarding fees and charges, 
the client agreement shall contain a separate Annexure which shall list all fees 
and  charges  payable  to  the  portfolio  manager.  The  Annexure  shall  contain 
details of levy of all applicable charges on a sample portfolio of Rs.10 lacs over 
a period of one year. The fees and charges shall be shown for 3 scenarios viz.

when  the  portfolio  value  increases  by  10%,  decreases  by  10%  or  remains 
unchanged. An illustration of the same is enclosed as Annexure-1 

g)  All  text  and  figures  in  the  Annexure  on  fees  and  charges  shall  be  in  size  12 

font.  

h)  The  client  shall  be  required  to  separately  sign  the  Annexure  on  fees  and 
charges  and  add  in  his  own  handwriting  that  he  has  understood  the  charge 
structure. 

 
 
Disputes 
 
i)  Regulation  14(1)  read  with  clause  18  of  Schedule  IV  of  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 
Managers)  Regulations,  1993  provides  for  settlement  of  grievances/disputes 
and provision for arbitration in the portfolio manager – client agreement.  
 
In case of any dispute regarding fees and charges, the same shall be referred 
to  arbitration  for  settlement  as  per  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  under  the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

5.  While  these  measures  are  proposed  to  be  made  applicable  for  all  fresh  client 
agreements  with  effect  from  the  date  of  issue  of  proposed  circular,  for  existing 
clients, it is proposed that revised client agreements incorporating these terms may 
be implemented by 01 October 2010.
