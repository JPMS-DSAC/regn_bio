hares* otherwise than by transfer,  for 

exa mple,  devolution by death,  succession,  inheritance,  bankruptcy,  marriage,  etc. 
Transmission is different vis-à-vis Transfer as in Transmission a person acquires an 
interest in the property by operation of law,
succession, whereas,  Transfer is effected  by act  (free volition) of the parties. In 
transmission case,  where title to s
beneficiary need  not carry out further formalities such as duly executed  sta mped  
instrument of transfer as stipulated  in Section 108 of the Companies Act, 1956. The 
Company concerned  also can not insist on such formalities.

INTRODUCTION 
 
To transmit is defined  as “1to cause to convey to another person or pla
ce”. Also “2to pass on a 
right or obligation to heirs or descendants”.  and  transmission is defined  as the “1action of 
transmitting or the fact of being transmitted: 
 
The word  'transmission' means devolution of title to shares otherwise than by transfer, 
for exa mple,  devolution by death,  succession,  inheritance,  bankruptcy,  marriage,  etc. 
While transfer of shares is brought about
(viz,  transfer deed) duly sta mped  and  executed,  transmission of shares is done by 
forwarding  the necessary documents (such as a 
the company. On the death or lunacy of the original holder (single holder),  his shares 
vest in his legal representative. On registration of transmission of shares,  the person 
whose name is entered  in the register of shareholders becomes the shareholder of the 
company and  is entitled  to all the rights and  is subject to all the liabilities as were of the 
original shareholder. 
 
Legal provisions related  to ‘Transfer by legal representative’ is contained  in section 109 
of the Companies Act 1956, Section 109 reads as, 
“A transfer of the share or other interest in a company of a dec
legal representative shall,  although the legal representative is not himself a member,  be as valid 
as if he had been a member at the time of the execution of the instrum
Section 109A deals with ‘Nomination of shares’ which provides for nomination by 
holder (s) of shares in respect of shares held  by them. Cases wherein a nominee has 
been appointed, the shares should  vest in the nominee on the death of the member
 
Section 109B deals specifically with transmission of shares. 
As per section 109B,  on the 
the option either to register himself as the 
death of the shareholder,  the nominee has 
holder of the shares of the deceased  or to transfer the shares to any other person. The 
transferee (s) may not necessarily be the legal heirs of the deceased  shareholder (s). 
Section 109B (1) states, “Any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of the provisions of 
section 109A, upon the production of such evidence as may be required by the Board

EXISTING PRACTICE  AND THE HARDSHIPS FACED BY 
INVESTORS 
  
Due to the fact that the Companies Act has not specifically m andated  any set  of 
documents which must be provided  in relation to

Problems faced  by investors:

1.  Small investors who have m a de will are not able to produce the probate of the 

 

will. Obtaining a probate requires the investor to approach a court and  it also 
involves payment of fees / sta mp duty. 

 
2.  While documents such as indemnity and  affid avit can be produced  without 

much difficulty,  procuring  other documents such as surety/ bank guarantee,  no
objection certificate (NOC) from  all legal heirs (particularly when a registered  
will is available),  and  issuance of press advertisement may cause 
to investors.

3.  In case a shareholder who dies intestate (without executing a will), 
 

has to follow the cum bersome process as given below:

the matter goes to the competent court on the basis of ‘pecuniary

b)   Application is to be made to the court with the names of all other heirs of the 
late relative as the respondents in the matter. Normally a newspaper notice is 
also issued  apart from  mandatory notice to the respondents. 

 
c)  Upon the expiry of the time period  (normally 1 and  a half months) from  the 

date of publication of the notice after the respondents have given their no 
objection,  the court  passes the orders  for issuance of the Succession 
Certificate,  for which the applicant has to sub mi

4.  The procedures brought out above,

 come at a cost to the investor. In some cases 
the cost of legal requirements and  newspaper advertisement could  exceed  the 
value of the shares to be transmitted.  

 
5.  Variation is also observed  in the procedure followed  by different companies, 

particularly related  to obtaining  NOC from  legal heirs, Surety/ Bank Guarantee 
and  issue of press / newspaper advertisement.   

 
6.  The protracted  procedures also cause opportunity loss to the investors
 
7.  Some of the procedures though not mandated  by law are in place basically as 
safeguard to the companies so that they do not face any claims / counter claims at 
a later stage. Further,  in respect of 
procedures adopted  by some of the sa mple 
companies,  it has been observed  that
 some have prescrib e d,  “the Company at its

PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN  PHYSICAL SHARES 
 
Various companies listed  with the Stock Exchanges have been following  divergent 
practices in relation to the t
shareholder in case of the death of the original shareholder. 
 
Practices followed  by a sa mple of companies for the “Transmission of Shares” were
obtained  from  websites of companies. The following  companies were part of the sa mple 
– HLL, RIL, REL, Jet Airways, SBI, ITC, Tata companies, HDFC, ICI Ltd.
 
General observations  
 
It was observed that there is no problem in case the heirs of the deceased  present a 
probate of a will. The problem lies in the divergent practices followed  by companies in 
cases where there is no will left by the deceased  or even if the will is there but there is 
no probate of the will.  It is  observed  from  the sa mple study that two different 
approaches are in use a mong  the companies / R &SATs, which are as follows: 
 

1.  In the absence of a probate of will,  some companies ask for  a ‘succession 

certificate’  or  a ‘letter  of ad ministration’  along  with a request  letter  and  
transmission form  to process the transmission. 

Some of the companies in the 

 

 

 
 

Page 12 of 25 

 

 

 

 
 

select sa mple do not explain the procedure to be followed  where there is a will 
which is not probated  or where there is no will and  no succession certificate.

  
2.  Certain other companies from  the sa mple list have provided  for an alternate 

 

procedure in case of absence of a probate of will / letter of ad ministration / 
succession certificate.  The alternate procedure is required  even if there is  a 
registered  will.  

Some companies have evolved  the alternate mechanism  that apply only upto a 
threshold. In cases where the value / num ber of shares involved  is lower than a 
certain threshold  limit, companies seek alternate documents instead  of insisting  on 
probate of will / succession certificate which may be cum bersome and  cost 
ineffective to obtain. As there is no standardization of the procedures, the 
documents sought differ from  company to company.   The documents sought by the 
sa mple companies are listed  below: - 
(a)  Request letter (all companies) 
(b)  Copy of death certificate (all companies) 
(c) Affid avit  affirming  the name of legal heirs  / Affid avit sworn in by the 
claim ants (all companies) 
(d)  Inde mnity agreeing  to indemnify the company against future claims that may 
be made on the company  (all companies) 
(e) NOC from  other heirs in favour of person claiming  the title to shares (most 
companies – whereas one company in the sa mple study does not ask for this).  
(f)  Bank Guarantee in favour of the Company for the market value of the Shares 
for specified  period. (only one company in the sa mple has this requirement) 
(g)  Surety Form  seeking  surety from  one or two persons covering  the value of 
shares involved. The surety form  often requires financial details to be filled  in 
by the surety (only two group companies from  the sa mple study have this 
requirement whereas others 
requires  financial details  to 
property and  PAN  no. etc. 
made to the Company (This requirement is there only for one company). 

(h) Press Advertisement informing  the public about the transmission request 

do not require surety). The surety form  mostly 
be provided  such as  movable / im movable

PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN  DEPOSITORY / DEMAT SYSTEM 
 
The procedures followed  for transmission of shares in the depository systems is 
also 
cum b ersome and  is a mplified  in the case of joint holding. The procedures involved  are 
outlined  below:-  
 
Single Holder 
 
A.  NSDL: 
 
NSDL requires that the legal heir(s) or the legal representative(s) of the deceased  person 
sub mit an instruction called  the 
Participant (DP) along  with the following  documents:  

Transmission Request Form (TRF) to the Depository 

a. 
b. 
c. 

d. 
e. 

Transmission form; 
Copy of the death certificate duly notarized;
Letter of Indemnity duly supported  by a guarantee of an independent 
Surety acceptable to the Depositories,  made on appropriate non judicial 
sta mp paper; 
 
An Affid avit made on appropriate non judicial sta mp paper; and
NOC(s) from  all the legal heir(s) who do not object to such

 transmission. 

 

The procedure followed  by NSDL is similar to that followed  by companies for physical 
shares,  and  the alternate procedure is m a de availab

le for shares of value less than Rs.1

A copy of the Succession certificate duly notarized  or an order of a court 
of competent jurisdiction where the deceased  has not left a 
will; or  
A copy of the probate or Letter of Ad ministration duly notarized. 
 

 

 
If the legal heir(s) or the legal representative(s) express inab
ility to produce either of the 
documents mentioned  under (b) and  (c) above, and  the market value of the shares held  
in each account of the deceased  as on the date of application for transmission does not 
exceed  Rs. 1 lakh, then the DP will process the transmission request on the basis of the 
following  documents: 
 

 
lakh.  The surety form  sought  by NSDL also seeks  financial details of movable
im movable property held  by the surety, as well as details such as PAN  no. etc.  
 
B.  CDSL: 
 
CDSL requires that the claim ant should  sub mit TRF along  with the following  
documents to the concerned DP:

The DP after ensuring  that the application is genuine will transfer the s

account of the claim ant. In case the market value of the shares do not exceed  Rs. 1 lakh, 
the Board  of Directors of CDSL,  even in the absence of the documen
ts specified  at (b)

above, has the discretion to transmit the s
 such 
terms and  conditions as it may specify.   
Joint Holder 
 The procedure of transmission in case of demat account operated  in joint names is 
similar to that followed in case of transmission of shares in physical form. In case the 
deceased  was one of the joint holders, then the surviving  holders have to request the 
vide a form  called  TRF along  with a copy of notarized death certificate to transmit the 
shares lying  in the account of the

  There have been suggestions from  various quarters of investors that demat account 
should  be treated  like a bank account and  the procedure followed  by banks for such 
accounts should  be replicated  in the depository accounts.  Some of the suggestions were

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The  Group deliberated  on the aforesaid issues  and  felt that the existing  rigorous 
procedures of companies and  R & STAs are depriving  the investor
investment decision. The group felt that there is an imperative need  to simplify the 
procedure involved  in relation to the Transmission of shares, particularly in view of the 
fact that investments in shares are made to provide financial assistance in times of n
Threshold  and  standardisation of documents  
Physical environment:  
Transmission of shares held  in physical form  can be categories into two
categories. 
CASE A: Cases wherein the shares ar
Estate of the deceased  is quite large.
In such cases, the heirs of the deceased  obtain succession certificate, probate of the will 
or letter of ad ministration as the case may be. As the succession certificate
will / letter of ad ministration is already there in respect of the property (including  the 
shares) bequeathed, cases falling  under these categories pose no major problem and  
turn around  time starting  with 
after effecting  transmission ranges from  3 to 4 weeks.
CASE B:  Cases wherein value of the holdings of the deceased  shareholder is quite 
small compared  to the cost of the legal representation in obtaining
probate of the will or letter of ad ministration as the case may be. It has been observed  
that the majority of the cases fall under this category and  
significant improvement  / simplification of the procedure
hardships faced  by investors.
The Board  of Directors of the respective companies 
are normally vested  with significant 
powers and  discretion by the AOA in relation to the transmission without production of 
legal documents. Further, some companies have prescrib e d  threshold  limits in terms of 
value of the shares exceeding  which the company requires more stringent procedure in 
relation to transmission as an investors’ friendly measure. This alleviates the undue 
hardships caused  to the investors.

Divergent views prevail with regard  to probate of will. 
Under Section 57 and  Section 
213 of the Indian Succession Act 1925, requirement of probate arises only where the 
properties are situated  at Mum b ai, 
Chennai and  West Bengal. Thus it would  follow that 
requiring  the heirs to obtain a probate at places other than Mum b ai, 
Chennai and  West

Dematerialised  environment  
While the above threshold  would  apply to the holding  in physical,  there cannot be a 
mirror application of this concept in the depository environment for all holding  in the 
various companies. Threshold  limit in case of shares held  in physical mode is applicable 
company-wise and  only if the values of the shares in respective companies exceed  the

However,  in case of shares held  in dematerialized  mode,  in a single BO account, the 
account  holder  can hold  shares of several companies and  fixing a threshold  limit 
as the holder can hold  the shares in a

particular BO account which m ay run in crores. Further,  in case of BO account, the 
documents which the claim ant of the deceased  needs to sub mit for 
transmission is 
account-wise and  not  company-wise and  this saves the claim ant  from  the undue 
hardship of approaching  the respective companies whose shares are to be transmitted. 
Group felt that the threshold  as specified  in
apply in case of shares held  in dematerialized  mode. However, the existing  threshold  of 
Rs. 1 lakh in value as provided  in the byelaws of the Depositories shall continue to 
apply. 
Joint holders in Demat Mode  
In relation to BO account held  in joint names, 
as per the existing  practice, when an 
accountholder dies, the surviving  holders have to make an application to
 the DP, along  
with fresh set of documents (as required  in case of opening  of a new account), to open a 
new account in the name of the surviving  m e m ber
(s), appearing  in the same order, as in 
case of original account.  This is time consuming and  ta
documents, which are already in possession of DP. Though, in relation to the automatic 
opening  of a new BO account on the basis of the existing  documents, 
expressed  their concern in the form  of possibility of change of name / ad dress, change in 
residential status,  updating  of signature
disabilities etc. and  the same may need  to be incorporated  in the records. 
The Group agreed  that the concerns were genuine but felt that the opening  of the new 
BO account can be on the basis of the existing  documents already in the possession of 
DP(s),  except in case of updation of the documents as per Know Your Client (KYC) 
norms,  and  any other ad ditional documents for transmission. For this  purpose

N omination Facility: 
Nomination is defined  as an act of nominating a person to act on his behalf in his 
absence. In case of shares, any holder of the security at any time can nominate a person

the nominator. 
 
Section 109A of the Companies Act talks about ‘Nomination of Shares’. Nomination
required  to be made in the prescrib e d  m anner,  i.e., in Form  2B [prescrib e d  under rule 
4CCC/5D of the Companies (Central Government’s) General Rules & Forms, 1956]. Non 
individuals including a society,  trust,  body corporate,  partnership
, karta of HUF and  
holder of POA cannot make a nomination. 
 
As per  Section 109A (3) of the Companies 
Act, a nomination m a de as per the provisions 
of the Act overrides anything contained in any other law for the time being in force
including any law of succession or  will or any other testamentary law,  including

In the absence of nomination, the company needs to transm

Many investors are not aware of the nomination facility and  its benefits; hence do not 
avail of this facility.  Thus the issue is more of creatin
the investors about the benefits of the facility provided  in law. In fact this fact was fairly 
acknowled ged  way back in 1999, which is evident in Press Release dated   July 23, 1999 
issued  by the Department of Company Affairs, the  text of which is reproduced  below:
 
“Under the Companies (Amendment) Act,  1999,  the shareholders have been allowed to nominate 
a person for their shares,  debentures and deposits.  The form  in which the nomination 
filed has been notified by the Department of company Affairs under the amended Companies Act.  
Earlier,  holders of shares and debentures in a company did not enjoy the nomination facility for 
s to them. They were required to obtain a 
shares,  debentures and deposits,  which caused hardship
letter of succession from  the competent authority.  The facility of nomination is intended to make 
the company law in tune with the present  day economic policies  of liberalization and 
deregulation.  This is also intended to promote investors confidence in capital market and to 
promote the climate for intercorporate investment in the country.”
facility could  prove to be a very useful re m e dy 
If properly utilised  by the investors, this 
against all the problems faced  by the investors while grappling  with the issue related  to 
the transmission of shares.  
Group felt that efforts need  to be made to make filling  up of the nomination form  
mandatory,  in a phased  m anner.  However,  if a person subscribing  for the s
hares does 
not wish to file his nomination, he shall necessarily have to give a declaration to the

effect. 
The Group felt that this  facility of nomination should  also be propagated  and  
encoura g e d  by the Depositories. With a view to encourage such a practice,  the group 
recom mends that the Depositories embark on a special drive to create awareness about 
the benefits of the nomination facility. 
A special drive should  be targeted  at  all its

to avail of the nomination facility or to take on record  the declaration of the BO that he

As regards new accounts opened  on or after October 01, 2007, it shall be provided  for

declaration to the effect that he does not want nomination for his account as under: ‘No, 
I do not want to nominate anyone on my behalf.’ 
 
As regards  nomination,  to place matters  beyond  doubt, it is recom mended  that 
provisions similar to sec 109A & 109B of the Companies Act 1956 should  be inserted  in 
Depositories Act so that a single nomination can be made for all s
account. 
 
Attestation of documents 
 
During  the deliberations,  representations were received  
the notarised  copy of the documents for the various processes involved  in the s
transactions, including  transmission.   
The Group felt that if the basic purpose of notarization is to authenticate the documents, 
even attestation of the documents, under seal, by a gazetted  officer should  
suffice.  
Time Frame 
To ensure that the transmission cases are dealt with in a time bound  m anner,  a 
stipulation of time limit on similar lines as has been stated  in Clause 12A (3) in relation 
of the Listing  
to ‘Transfer’ by way of insertion / amend ment to the said  Clause
