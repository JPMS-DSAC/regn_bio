Consultation Paper 

 

Review of requirement of Minimum Public Offer for large issuers in terms of 

Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 

1.  Objective 

1.1. The objective of this consultation paper is to seek comments/ views from the 
public  and  market  intermediaries  on  Review  of  requirement  of  Minimum 
Public  Offer  to  large  issuers  in  terms  of  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation) 
Rules, 1957 (SCRR)  

2.  Background and need for review: 

2.1. Securities  market,  including  the  market  for  Initial  Public  Offerings  (IPOs),  is 
dynamic  and  needs  to  keep  pace  with  the  evolving  market  conditions.  To 
address  concerns  of  various  market  participants  especially  the  investing 
community  and  the  issuers,  the  regulations  governing  the  primary  market 
have been amended from time to time. 

2.2. Market  participants  have  provided  feedback  that  the  compliance  with 
minimum  offer  to  public  requirement  i.e.  at  least  10%  of  post  issue  paid  up 
capital  calculated  at  offer  price  (also  referred  to  as  ‘post  issue  MCap’)  in 
terms of Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (SCRR) 
is cumbersome for large issuers.  

2.3. It has been represented that such large issuers already have investments by 
PE / other strategic investors who are classified as  public shareholders post-
listing  and  therefore,  mandating  minimum  10%  of  post  issue  MCap  at  the 
time of IPO leads to unnecessary dilution of holding of the promoter/ existing 
shareholder and is therefore a constraining factor for listing. 

3.  Present provisions in SCRR  

3.1. The  following  table  demonstrates  the  current  minimum  offer  to  public 

requirements 

Post issue MCap 

Minimum offer to public 

MCap ≤ 1600 
1600 < MCap ≤ 4000  
4000 < MCap 
Note: All values expect for those expressed as % are in Rs Crore 

25% 
Such % equivalent to 400  
10%

3.2. Thus, for large issues (i.e. where post issue MCap ≥ Rs 4000 Crores) at least 

10% of the post issue MCap needs to be offered to public. 

 

3.3. Further, as part of continuous listing requirement the newly listed company is 
required to bring public shareholding to at least 25% within three years from 
the date of listing (Minimum Public Shareholding Norms- MPS). 

3.4. The  minimum  offer  to  public  requirements  were  last  revised  in  2014.  The 

relevant Rules of SCRR are placed at Annex-A. 

4.  Trends of Past Issuances 

4.1. Based on analysis carried out in respect of public issuances since 2010, it has 
been  observed  that  the  average  issue  size  of  IPO/OFS  on  main  board  has 
increased in the last decade, while the number of issuers coming for IPO/OFS 
on the main board has declined1. This trend of larger issuances is expected to 
continue. 

4.2. Analysis  of  past  large  issuances  (i.e.  where  post-issue  MCap≥  Rs  4000 
Crores)  (for  the  period  Apr  01,  2014  -  Oct  16,  2020)2  indicates  that 
approximately 24% of the issuers with post issue MCap of more than Rs 4000 
Crores  have  just  met  the  minimum  offer  to  public  rule  (10%)  required  for 
listing of securities u/r 19(2)(b) of SCRR. 

4.3. Further, in case of very large issuers (say post issue MCap of Rs 1,00,000 Crs 
and above), there is a possibility that they may find it difficult to comply with 
MPS of 25% within 3 years of listing. 

4.4. Therefore, there is a need for the following: 

4.4.1. To review the minimum 10% offer to public requirement in case of large 

IPOs (say post issue MCap of Rs. 10,000 Cr and above). 

4.4.2. To  review  the  time  to  comply  with  MPS  of  25%  in  case  of  very  large 

issuers (say post issue MCap of Rs 1,00,000 Crs and above) 

5.  Proposal

The matter was deliberated at the Primary market Advisory Committee (PMAC), 
which has recommended that SEBI may seek public comments on the following: 

 

5.1. 

 It  is  proposed  to  reduce  minimum  offer  to  public  for  large  issuers  to  5%  of 
post issue market capital exceeding Rs. 10,000 Crs, as under :- 

 

Minimum offer to public 

Post issue market capital 

Existing Provision 

Proposal 

MCap ≤ 1600 
1600 < MCap ≤ 4000  

4000 < MCap ≤ 10000 

MCap > 10000  

25% 
Such  %  equivalent  to 
400  
10% 
10% 

Same as existing 

1000 + 5% of MCap exceeding 
10,000 

Note: All values expect for those expressed as % are in Rs Crore 

5.2. 

In  view  of  proposal  at  5.1  above,  there  could  be  a  scenario  in  case  of  large 
and  very  large  issuers  that  they  may  not  be  compliant  with  10%  MPS  at  the 
time  of  listing.  Thus,  there  may  arise  a  need  to  provide  additional  time  to 
such issuers to first comply with 10% MPS and subsequently with 25% MPS as 
proposed below:-

MPS of 25% to be achieved in 
three  years 
from  date  of

MPS of 10% to be achieved in 
2  years  and  25%  within  5 
years from the date of listing 

Note: All values expect for those expressed as % are in Rs Crore

be- 

i. 

ii. 

at least  twenty-five per  cent  of  each class  or  kind of equity shares or  debenture

the  company  calculated  at  offer  price  is  less  than  or  equal  to  one  thousand  six 
hundred crore rupees; 

at  least  such  percentage  of  each  class  or  kind  of  equity  shares  or  debentures 
convertible into equity shares issued by the company equivalent to the  value of

equal to four thousand crore rupees; 

iii. 

at  least  ten  per  cent  of  each  class  or  kind  of  equity  shares  or  debentures 
convertible into equity shares issued by the company, if the post issue capital of 
the company calculated at offer price is above four thousand crore rupees: 

Provided that the company referred to in sub-clause (ii) or sub-clause (iii), shall 
increase its public shareholding to at least twenty-five per cent within a period of 
three  years  from  the  date  of  listing  of  the  securities,  in  the  manner  specified  by 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India: 

Provided  further  that  this  clause  shall  not  apply  to  a  company  whose  draft  offer 
document  is  pending  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  on  or 
before  the  commencement  of  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Third 
Amendment  Rules,  2014,  if  it  satisfies  the  conditions  prescribed  in  clause  (b)  of 
sub-rule  (2)  of  rule  19  of  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1956  as 
existed prior to the date of such commencement. 

Provided  also  that  the  applicant  company,  who  has  issued  equity  shares  having 
superior  voting  rights  to  its  promoters  or  founders  and  is  seeking  listing  of  its 
ordinary  shares  for  offering  to  the  public  under  this  rule  and  the  regulations
