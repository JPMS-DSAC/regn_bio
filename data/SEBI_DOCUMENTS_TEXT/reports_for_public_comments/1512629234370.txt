Consultation Paper on permitting Mutual Funds and Portfolio Managers to 

participate in Commodity Derivatives Market 

 
 

1.  Objective: 

 
1.1. The  objective  of  the  consultation  paper is to  seek comments /  views  from  
the    public  on  the  proposal  of  permitting  Mutual  Funds  (MFs)  and  Portfolio 
Managers (PMs), who are authorized under an agreement to invest on behalf of 
their  clients,  for  participation  in  exchange  traded  commodity  derivatives  and  to 
determine an ideal regulatory framework for the proposal. 
 

2.  Background: 

 
2.1. The  Indian  Commodity  Derivatives  Market  has  been  running  without  any 
institutional participation thereby lacking the desired liquidity and depth, which is 
one  of  the  key  elements  for  the  efficient  price  discovery  and  price  risk 
management.  In  past,  various  committees  have  recommended  for  participation 
of institutional investors in the commodity derivatives markets, which would help 
in  improving  the  quality  of  price  discovery,  thereby  leading  to  better  price  risk 
management.  
 

2.2. SEBI  constituted  an  advisory  committee  known  as  Commodity  Derivatives 
Advisory  Committee  (CDAC)  to  advise  SEBI  for  effective  regulation  and 
development  of  the  commodity  derivatives  market.  CDAC  has  advised  that  the 
commodity derivatives market should be opened up to institutional  participation 
i.e. both domestic as well as international in a phased manner.  

 

2.3. Recently, SEBI has permitted Category-III Alternative Investment Funds (AIF), to 

participate in the Commodity Derivatives Market. 

 

2.4. SEBI has also held series of meetings with various stakeholders to discuss the 
issues  relating  to  participation  by  MFs  and  PMs  in  the  Commodity  Derivatives 
Market.  

 

3.  Commodities as an Asset Class: 

 

3.1. Commodity derivatives provide a new asset class to the investors, thereby may 
benefit  them  with  effective  portfolio  diversification.  Adding  commodities  in  the 
portfolio would typically increase some risk, but the overall risk adjusted return of 
the portfolio may improve. 
 

3.2. Addition of commodities to a hybrid portfolio can lower the overall volatility of the 
portfolio,  since  historically  returns  from  commodities  have  not  been  highly

correlated  with  returns  from  equities  and  fixed  income  asset  classes  as 
highlighted in Table under Para ‘4.1’ below. 
 

 

3.3. A  substantial  number  of  investors  (including  retail  investors)  are  not  able  to 
directly access the Commodity Derivatives Market due to lack of knowledge and 
expertise.  MFs  and  PMs  can  act  as  conduits  to  commodities  markets  for  such 
investors.  

 

3.4. Taking 

into  account 

the 
recommendations of CDAC and feedback received from various stakeholders, it 
may  be  considered  to  allow  participation  of  Mutual  Funds  and  Portfolio 
Managers in the Commodity Derivatives Market. 

the  aforementioned  benefits  and  based  on

5.  Mutual Funds 

 
5.1. Introduction: 
 

5.1.1. Mutual  funds  are  investment  vehicles  which  pool  money  from  investors  by 
issuing  units  to  them  and  invest  the  money  thus  collected  in  asset  classes 
and securities in accordance with the investment objectives as disclosed in 
scheme  offer  documents  of  various  schemes.  In  India,  MF  schemes 
generally invest in equity or debt instruments of companies, govt. securities, 
money market instruments, etc.  

 

5.1.2. In addition to the above, there are specific schemes such as Gold Exchange 
Traded Funds (ETFs) which invest in gold or gold related instruments  (gold 
related  instruments  includes  gold  deposit  scheme/  gold  monetization 
scheme)  and  Gold  Fund  of  Funds  (FoF)  schemes  which  invests  mainly  in 
units of Gold ETFs.  

 

5.1.3. At  present,  except  Gold  ETFs  there  are  no  other  category  of  mutual  fund 

schemes having exposure to Commodities market. 

 

5.1.4. Operation  of  MFs  in  India  are  being  governed  and  regulated  by  SEBI 
(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  and  various  circulars  and  guidelines 
issued there under from time to time. 

 

5.2. Existing Provisions & Schemes: 
 

5.2.1. Regulation 43(1) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 allows a mutual 
fund  to  invest  moneys  collected  under  any  of  its  schemes  in  various 
instruments  including  ‘Securities’  as  defined  under  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation) Act 1956. 
 

5.2.2. ‘Derivatives’  are  already  covered  under  ‘Securities’  definition  as  per 
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act  1956  and  definition  of  ‘Derivatives’ 
includes ‘Commodity Derivatives’.  

 

5.2.3. As  per  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  (Stock  Exchanges  and  Clearing 
Corporations)  Regulations,  2012,  a  Commodity    Derivatives    Exchange  
means    a  recognized    stock    exchange    which  assists,    regulates    or  
controls    the    business    of    buying,    selling    or    dealing  only  in  commodity 
derivatives. 

 

5.2.4. Existing  regulatory  provisions  applicable  for  mutual  funds,  allows  mutual 
funds  to  launch  only  one  kind  of  commodity  mutual  fund  scheme  i.e.  Gold 
ETFs  which  invest  in  gold  and  gold  related  instruments.  Gold  related 
instruments  include  gold  deposit  scheme  and  gold  monetization  scheme.

There  are  few  Gold  Fund  of  Fund  schemes  investing  only  in  units  of  Gold 
ETFs.  Gold  ETFs  are  required  to  invest  at  least  95%  of  the  asset  under 
management in gold and gold related instruments. As on 31st October, 2017 
the total asset size of Gold ETF is around Rs. 5,017 cr. (i.e. around 0.23% of 
the total industry Asset under Management (AUM)) with 3,55,085 folios.

commodities as permitted by SEBI from time to time? 

 

5.3.2.1.2.  Open-Ended Schemes (Passive/Active) based on Commodity 
Derivatives:  Can  open  ended  schemes  be  considered  which 
intend  to  invest  majority  of  the  AUM  in  exchange  traded

time? Such scheme could be launched either as an index fund 
or could be actively managed. 

 

5.3.2.1.3.  Commodity  Arbitrage  Funds:  Can  commodity  arbitrage  funds 
be  considered,  where  the  scheme  intends  to  benefit from  the

cumulative  gross  exposure  through  equity,  debt  and  derivative  positions 
(including  commodity  derivatives)  should  not  exceed  100%  of  the  net 
assets of the scheme. 

5.3.4.  Whether  there  is  a  need  for  investment  restrictions  to  be  placed  on  MF 

schemes which invest only in commodity futures?

can be permitted to invest in exchange traded commodity derivatives, not 
more than  ten percent  of  the  net  Asset  under  Management  (AUM)  of  the

6.2. Existing Provisions 

 
6.2.1.  ‘Derivatives’  are  already  covered  under  definition  of  ‘Securities’  as  per 
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act  1956  and  ‘Commodity  Derivatives’ 
have  been  covered  under  the  definition  of  ‘Derivatives’  vide  Finance  Act 
2015.  

 

6.2.2.  Regulation 16(3) of SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 allows a 
Portfolio  Manager  to  invest  funds  of  clients  in  money  market  instruments

circular dated September 27, 2016 in line with the stipulation by erstwhile 
FMC, stated that PMS would not be permissible in Commodity Derivatives 
Market. 

 

6.3. Proposal 

 
6.3.1.  In view of the benefits that investing in commodity derivatives may provide, 
it  is  proposed  to  rationalize  the  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers)  Regulations,

Derivatives  market.  Further,  during  the  deliberation  with  stakeholders,  it 
was suggested that: 

 

6.3.1.1.  Leveraging of  portfolio may be permitted in respect of investment in 

derivatives, which is presently not permitted. 

 

6.3.1.2.  Investing in high value commodity derivative contracts from individual 
clients’ accounts can lead to concentration risk. Therefore, pooling of 
investments may be permitted in respect of transactions in exchange 
traded commodity derivatives, which is presently not permitted. 

 

6.4. Matters for consideration: 

 

6.4.1.  Whether  PMs  can  be  permitted  to  participate  in  commodity  derivatives 

market? 
 

6.4.2.  Whether PMs can be permitted to leverage the portfolio of their clients for 

investing in commodity derivatives? If yes, then: 

6.4.2.1.  What can be the optimum extent of leveraging? 

 

6.4.2.2.  What mechanisms can be put in place to safeguard the interests of 

clients? 

 

6.4.2.3.  What  disclosures  can  be  included  in  the  Disclosure  Document  to 

adequately disclose the enhanced risk of portfolio leveraging?

adequately  disclose  the  enhanced  risk  caused  by  pooling  of 
commodity derivatives? 

 

6.4.4.  In  case,  portfolio  leveraging  and  pooling  of  commodity  derivatives  is 
permitted, should the participation in Commodity Derivatives be restricted 
only to the clients beyond a certain threshold?
