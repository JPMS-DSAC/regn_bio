Consolidation  and  re-issuance  of  debt  securities  issued  under  the  SEBI 
(Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 

A.  Market Structure of corporate bonds: 
 
The development of the primary market in corporate bond has been important part of the 
reform  process  as  it  was  essential  for  discovery  of  price  through  an  efficient  market 
mechanism  and  providing  for  both  listing  and  issuance  of  debt  securities  on  private 
placement and public issuance basis.

Table1 shows that the amount of private placement of corporate bonds has increased from 
Rs 1.18 trillion in the FY 2007-08 to Rs 4.78 trillion in the FY 2016-17. Thus, it can be seen 
that the  private placement issues have increased  by 176.41 % since  FY 2007-08 till date.  
Further, the public issues in the primary market have increased from nil figures in the  FY 
2007-08 to Rs 29,213 crores.  The total primary issuance in the corporate bond market has 
increased by 328.9% since FY 2007-08.

As  per  section  42  of  the  Companies Act, 2013  read  with  the    Companies  (Prospectus  and 
Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014, if  a  bond  issue  is made  to more  than 200  investors 
(excluding  QIBs),  the  issuer  has  to  follow  the  public  issue  route.  To  meet  their  funding 
requirements,  some  of  the  issuers  take  recourse  in  issuing  several  issues  of  bonds  in  a 
single month/quarter/year.This evidences that the private placement mode of issuance of 
corporate bond is substantially robust and favored for raising funds. 
 
While  the  primary  market  for  corporate  bonds/debt  securities  has  grown  since  the  year 
2007,  the  liquidity  in  secondary  market  has  not  been  high  and  commensurate  with  the 
growth in the primary market.

The above table shows that the trading of corporate bonds in the secondary marketing has 
increased  from  Rs  1.48  trillion  in  the  FY  2008-09  to  Rs  11.70  trillion  in  the  FY  2016-17. 
However, the average number of trades per day continues to be very limited at around Rs 
2000 crores.  Generally, the investors prefer to buy and hold the security, instead of trading 
it  in  the  secondary  market.  Moreover,  some  of  the  investors,  are  prohibited  from  trading 
the  debt  securities  in  the  secondary  market unless  the  rating  of  such  debt  securities  falls 
two  notches  below  their  initial  credit  rating.  The  absence  of  a  well-developed  corporate 
bond  repo  market  and  secondary  market  infrastructure  such  as  credit  default  swaps, 
interest rate futures, lack of participation on the dedicated debt segment of the exchanges 
etc. can be touted as some of the reasons due to the absence of liquidity in the secondary 
market.

The  trader  would  trade  in  those  corporate  bonds  of  a  particular  issuer,  which  have  been 
freshly issued, thus rendering the old outstanding issues of that same issuer illiquid. This in 
turn affects the secondary market liquidity in corporate bonds.  
Thus,  one  of  the  suggestions  is  the  capping  of  such  fragmented  issues  vide  consolidation 
and re-issuance.It is envisaged that such consolidation and re-issuance could be one of the 
possible  solutions  that  would  aid  in  generation  of  liquidity  through  minimal  number  of 
ISINs.It is also felt that such fragmented issues can be avoided, if the maximum number of 
investors  (which  are  two  hundred  at  present)  to  whom  private  placement  are  made  are 
increased to a higher number under the Companies Act, 2013. 
 
B.  Government Securities Market   

In  the  Government  Securities  (G-Sec)  market,  the  gradual  extinguishing  of  illiquid, 
infrequently traded and reissue of liquid bonds has helped in improving liquidity.  In the G-
Sec  market,  a  policy  of  passive  consolidation  through  reissuance  was  started  in  1999  in 
order to improve fungibility among the securities and to facilitate consolidation of debt. 

In the case of G-secs, it is pertinent to note that the process of carrying out consolidation 
and re-issuance is simpler as compared to the corporate bonds. Some of the reasons for the 
same being as under: 

a.  Government being one single issuer in case of G-secs; 
b.  Fungible nature of G-secs; 
c.  No requirement for credit rating and 
d.  The borrowing calendar for the government is fixed at the beginning of the financial 
year and the borrowings are made to finance the government expenditure as well 
as to cover shortfalls (deficits) in its annual budget.  

 
The  Gandhi  Committee  Report  ("Report  of  the  Working  Group  on  Enhancing  Liquidity  in 
the  Government  Securities  and  Interest  Rate  Derivatives  Markets")  had  recommended 
consolidation  of  G-Sec.  Considering  the  objective  of  the  working  group  i.e.  to  enhance 
secondary market liquidity, the group felt that there was a need to undertake consolidation 
of  the  G-Sec  outstanding  for  which  a  framework  needs  to  be  prepared  for  the  next  3-4 
years. The process should begin with the issuance of securities at various maturity points 

 

Page 4 of 14 

 

in conjunction with further steps like buyback and switches. The framework should outline 
the  various  objectives  proposed  to  be  achieved  through  the  exercise,  various  constraints 
that need to be taken into account in the process and the buyback program should be long 
drawn.  
 
The  process  should  lead  to  the  consolidation  of  the  GoI’s  market  borrowings  to  a  fewer 
securities and fresh borrowings through a limited number of securities thereby increasing 
the  outstanding  amount  of  each  security,  which  would  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the 
secondary  market  trade  volumes.    The  consolidation  in  the  G-sec  market  has  greatly 
improved  market  liquidity  and  helped  the  emergence  of  benchmark  securities  in  the 
market 
 
C.  Background for consolidation and re-issuance of debt securities: 
 
Section 121 of the erstwhile Companies Act 1956 had provisions of consolidation and re-
issuance.    However,  the  recently  notified  Companies  Act  2013  is  silent  regarding  the 
company's  power  to  reissue  their  bonds.  In  this  regard,  the  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs 
(MCA) has clarified that since Companies Act 2013 is silent on the issue, it may be assumed 
that such reissuance is possible if there is enabling provision in this behalf in the articles of 
the  company.    In  view  of  the  clarification  provided  by  MCA,  SEBI  provided  an  enabling 
framework for consolidation and re-issuance. However it may be noted that only one issuer 
has since come for taking advantage of this provision.  
 
As stated above, an amendment was made to the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) 
Regulations, 2008 (ILDS) in the year 2015, wherein regulation 20A was inserted, to provide 
for consolidation and re-issuance of debt securities. The regulation reads as under: 
 
An  issuer  may  carry  out  consolidation  and  re-issuance  of  its  debt  securities,  subject  to  the 
fulfillment of the following conditions: 
 

a)  there is such an enabling provision in its articles under which it has been incorporated;  
b)  the issue is through private placement;  
c)   the issuer has obtained fresh credit rating for each re-issuance from at least one credit 

rating agency registered with the Board and is disclosed;  

d)   such ratings shall be  revalidated  on a periodic basis and the change, if any, shall be 

disclosed;

e)  Appropriate disclosures are made with regard to consolidation and re-issuance in the 

 

Term Sheet. 

 
The  working  group,  on  Development  of  Corporate  Bond  market  in  India,  under  the 
chairmanship of Shri. H R Khan in its report has made the following observations in respect 
of consolidation and re-issuance: 
 

a.  One  of  the  reasons  for  the  lack  of  trading  volume  is  non-availability  of  sufficient 
floating  stock  for  each  International  Securities  Identification  Number  (ISIN)  as 
corporates have preferred fresh issuance rather than going for reissuance of bonds. 
Each new issuance from the same issuer receives a separate ISIN; hence older bonds 
in the same maturity become illiquid. 
 

b.  To augment market liquidity, it is necessary that corporates are encouraged to re-

issue existing bonds under the same ISIN code. 
 

c.  A major argument against common ISINs is the bunching of liabilities on the same 
date  which  can  lead  to  asset-liability  mismatch;  however,  this  can  be  resolved  by 
spreading  out  the  redemption  amount  across  the  year  through  amortizing  the 
payments. 
 

d.  SEBI  has  enabled  consolidation  and  re-issuance  with  a  view  to  reducing 
fragmentation  in  corporate  bond  market.  Though  SEBI  has  recently  allowed 
reissuances  by  the  corporates,  there  has  not  been  any  reissue  of  bonds  by  any 
corporate due to problems related to bunching of liabilities and stamp duty. 
 

e.  Corporates may be permitted to issue bonds under the same ISIN with a flexibility in 
terms  of  timing  for  raising  the  funds  as  well  as  structuring  of  the  redemption 
requirements. 

 
In  view  of  the  aforesaid  observations,  the 
  H  R  khan  working  group,  inter-alia, 
recommended that the issuers coming out with frequent debt issues with the same tenor 
during  a  quarter  may  club  them  under  the  same  umbrella  ISIN  which  in  turn  would 
increase the float in the market, thus enhancing its liquidity. These issuers  may come out 
with a feasible maturity structure wherein they can stagger the redemption amount across 
the year by amortizing the repayments.

The  Corporate  Bond  and  Securitization  Advisory  Committee  (CoBoSAC)  of  SEBI,  in  its 
meeting  held  on  November  16,  2016,  inter-alia,  deliberate  on  the  ways  to  increase 
secondary market liquidity in the corporate bonds. It was discussed that a sub-committee 
may be formed by SEBI to explore the mechanism for implementation of the consolidation 
and re-issuance in the corporate bonds.  
 
 
The  sub-committee  was  constituted  and  while  preparing  this  consultation  paper, 
inputs have been taken from the market participants 
 
D.  Structural issues faced in the consolidation for corporate bonds: 

While  carrying  out  deliberations  on  laying  down  an  implementable  and  feasible 
operational  framework  for  consolidation  and  re-issuance  for  corporate  bonds,  the 
following legal/structural issues have been noted by SEBI: 

Stamp Duty: 

i. 
 
It is understood that re-issuance is not legally recognized and is considered a fresh issue of 
securities. As a fallout of this, re-issuing securities attracts stamp duty thereby making the 
process  cost  ineffective.  However,  as  no  fresh  securities  are  actually  being  issued,  there 
should not be any incidence of stamp duty on the re-issued securities. In this regard, the H 
R Khan committee had already made the recommendation that the re-issuances may not be 
treated as fresh issuance for the purpose of stamp duty. The matter is under deliberation.   
 

ii.  Bunching of liabilities:  

 
In case of consolidation and reissuance of debentures, the maturities of debentures issued 
under  consolidation  will  fall  on  same  day  which  shall  create  liquidity  problem  and 
bunching of liabilities for borrowers. The same shall also have impact on their liquidity and 
rating. 
 
iii. 
 
The  issue  amount  is  not  predetermined  rather  the  issuers  bring  out  the  corporate  bond 
issuances in the market in accordance with the investor appetite. This is elaborated by the 
fact  that  the  mutual  funds  would  demand  only  for  those  papers  whose  maturities  are  in 
alignment with the tenure of their debt funds or those suiting their requirements.  

Issuances are triggered as per the demands of the investors:  

 

Page 7 of 14 

Consolidation  and  reissue  would  reduce  the  demand/appetite  of  the  investors  and  also 
increase the coupon rate because of lower demand.  
 

 

iv.  Re-issuance at a discount or premium 

 
The coupon rate on bonds is a dynamic factor and mostly market driven, hence the interest 
rate  frozen  at  the  time  of  issue  of  ISIN  may  change  and  in  such  case  subsequent  issue  of 
bonds  
 
have  to  be  made  at  discount  or  premium  depending  on  market  conditions.  This  kind  of 
arrangement may not be acceptable by to certain categories of investors like mutual fund, 
provident fund etc. This will also lead to accounting and taxation issues. 
 
E.  Objective of the consultation paper 
 
In  spite  of  the  technical  issues  mentioned  above,  in  carrying  out  consolidation  and  re-
issuance, it is felt that such a measure would help in building secondary market liquidity in 
corporate bonds. 
This  consultation  paper  has  been  prepared  with  the  objective  of  seeking  public 
comments/views  on  the  proposals  mentioned  in  this  paper.  Apart  from  the  proposals 
mentioned here, other suggestions/ inputs, to develop the secondary market for corporate 
bonds, are also invited from the public at large. 
 

i. 

Passive Consolidation :  

a.  Restriction on  the  maximum number of ISINs for  private  placement of debt 

securities; 

b.  Staggered repayments of the redemption amount on the debt securities; and 

 

ii.  Active consolidation:  

 

a.  Switching or conversion of less liquid debt securities into larger, more liquid 

benchmark bond issues. This can be carried out via following two methods: 
 

Tender offer method   

i. 
ii.  Reverse Auction Conversion/Switching Ratio 

F.  Proposals: 

 

 

Page 8 of 14 

1.  Passive Consolidation : 
1.1.  Restriction on maximum number of ISINs in a year:  

Option A: One ISIN per quarter: 

 

It  is  proposed  that  the  issuers  can  have  only  ISIN  per  quarter,  i.e  total  of  4  ISINs  in  a 
financial year. In case the issuer raises funds by way of private placement of debt securities 
in a particular quarter, then for the whole of that quarter, the issuer can have only one ISIN. 
Further, if the issuer makes another issuance of debt security in the same quarter, whose  
 
maturity is in the same quarter as that of the maturity of the existing debt instrument, then 
the issuer must consolidate both the issuers under the same existing ISIN by adjusting the 
difference in the issue price. The debt may be issued either at a discount or at a premium. 
 
If the issuer makes another issuance of debt security in the same quarter, whose maturity 
does  not  fall  in  the  same  quarter  as  that  of  the  maturity  of  the  existing  debt  instrument, 
then  the  issuer  has  the  flexibility  to  obtain  a  new  ISINs  for  that  particular  issuance. 
However,  the  total  number  of  ISINs  in  a  financial  year  shall  not  exceed  4  i.e.  1  ISIN  per 
quarter. 
 
 

Or 

 

 

 

 

Option B:One ISIN in a period of two months: 

It is proposed that the issuers can have only ISIN  in a period of two months, i.e total of 6 
ISINs in a financial year. In case the issuer raises funds by way of private placement of debt 
securities in a two month period, then for the whole of that two months, the issuer can have 
only  one  ISIN.  Further,  if  the  issuer  makes  another  issuance  of  debt  security  in  the  same 
period of two months, whose maturity is in the same half year as that of the maturity of the 
existing debt instrument, then the issuer must consolidate both the issues under the same 
existing ISIN by adjusting the difference in the issue price. The debt may be issued either at 
a discount or at a premium. 
 
If  the  issuer  makes  another  issuance  of  debt  security  in  the  same  period  of  two  months, 
whose  maturity  does  not  fall  in  the  same  half  year  as  that  of  the  maturity  of  the  existing 
debt instrument, then the issuer has the flexibility to obtain a new ISINs for that particular 
issuance. However, the total number of ISINs in a year shall not exceed 6. 
 
1.2.  Staggered repayments of the redemption amount 

 

Page 9 of 14 

 

 
It  has  been  pointed  out  that  if  the  restriction  as  above  are  implemented, it  may  lead  to  a 
situation of liquidity mismatch and bunching of liabilities for the issuer. In order to resolve 
this issue, it is proposed that the issuer can as a onetime exercise make a choice of having 
bullet  maturity  payment  or  in  order  to  avoid  bunching  of  liabilities,  the  issuer  can  make 
equated quarterly payment or equated monthly payment of the maturity proceeds within 
that  financial  year.  This  will  enable  the  issuers  to  stagger  the  redemption  amount  across 
the  year  by  amortizing  the  repayments.  However  this  should  clearly  be  disclosed  in  the 
information memorandum  
 
1.3.  Illustration to show as to how the number of ISINs will be capped for option A 

under proposal 1.1 above:  

 
Assuming first option i.e. wherein only one ISIN is allowed per quarter, then say an issuer 
issues 14 debt securities in the financial year 2017-18 (of maturity profile 1 to 5 years) as 
under :

From the aforesaid table, following can be deduced: 

 

Page 11 of 14 

For the Financial year 2018-19, as there are no securities due for maturity, the issuer can 
take 1 ISIN each in every quarter. 

 

For the financial year 2019-20, it can be seen that for the quarter ended June 2020, there 
are  two  securities  due  for  redemption.  Hence,  in  such  a  case  the  issuer,  for  the  security 
issue  on  01/04/2019,  the  issuer  would  take  a  new  ISIN.  However,  for  the  subsequent 
security issued on 15/06/2019, the issuer cannot take a new ISIN and will necessarily have 
to  consolidate  it  with  the  ISIN  of  the  security  issued  on  01/04/2019  as  both  these 
securities  are  due  for  redemption  in  the  same  quarter.  Further,  for  the  quarter  ended 
January-March 2020, the issuer can again take a new ISIN. 

Similarly  for  the  financial  year  2022-23,  it  can  be  seen  that  for  the  quarter  ended 
September 2023, there are three securities due for redemption.  Hence, in such a scenario, 
for  the  security  issued  on  10/08/2022,  the  issuer  would  take  a  new  ISIN.  For  the 
subsequent security issued on 20/08/2022 and 15/09/2022 the issuer cannot take a new 
ISIN  and  will  necessarily  have  to  consolidate  it  with  the  ISIN  of  the  security  issued 
on10/08/2022 as both these securities are due for redemption in the same quarter. 

In both the above scenarios, the issuer has to flexibility to make staggered re-payments on 
maturity of the instruments, instead of bullet repayment. 

2.  Active Consolidation: Switches-Conversion  

 

Switching or Conversion, would offer investors the opportunity to convert their holdings of 
smaller debt securities into larger debt securities of same issuer.A switching or conversion 
can be viewed as a repurchase of the debt securities in advance of maturity where payment 
for these repurchases would be in terms of newly issued more-liquid benchmark securities. 
Thus, a bond switching or conversion is a repurchase in advance of maturity, where other 
debt securities would be supplied as payment. The less-liquid debt securities would usually 
be paired with liquid benchmarks that are of similar maturity and coupon rate. 
 
Here, it may be pointed out that switching or conversion rate or ratio mostly depend on the 
secondary market prices at the time of the announcement of a conversion. However, due to 
lack  of  liquidity  here  the  pricing  may  be  a  concern.  Hence  the  following  is  proposed  for 
carrying out the switching or conversion.  

 
2.1. Proposed mechanics of Switching or Conversion 
 

2.1.1.  Conversion/Switching Rate/Ratio 

 

Page 12 of 14 

 
The  switching rate/ratio may be carried out by the  issuer  by exercising  call option as 
given in information memorandum in the following manner: 
 

 

2.1.1.1.  Tender offer method   

 
A  tender  offer  is  a  fixed  price  offer,  i.e.  the  issuer  will  fix  a  particular  price  for  the 
maximum number of debt securities it is willing to purchase and sends a letter of offer 
to  all  the  holders  of  debt  securities.  The  issuer  will  also  fix  an  outer  time  limit  for 
accepting the offer. The issuer may determine the rate which may be at a premium or 
discount.  However,  more  likely,  the  issuer  may  fix  the  rate  at  a  discount  in  order  to 
encourage holders to switch their debt securities. 

 

2.1.1.2.  Reverse Auction Conversion/Switching Ratio 

 
Reverse Auction Conversion/Switching is where the market participants would submit 
various competitive rates of conversion as well as the amount they wish to convert to 
the  issuer/arranger  and  is  essentially  an  auction.The  mechanics  that  underlie  the 
reverse auction conversion is same as standard conventional auction where bidders are 
bidding to purchase debt securities and are offering debt securities as payment for their 
purchase in lieu of cash. Thus offers are simply price or yield ratios.  This can further be 
done by multiple-price auction i.e. French Auction or single-price auction method based 
on discretion of the issuer.  
Further, the issuer, at the beginning of the financial year, shall specify the pre-notified 
amount for which he is willing to carry out the switch operations.  

Such switching or conversion may be done through the Electronic Book Platform (EBP) 
mechanism. 

 

 

2.1.2.  Reduction on number of ISIN’s issued 

It  is  proposed  that  the  issuers  having  large  number  of  outstanding  issues  and  multiple 
ISINs,  should  resort  to  Switching  or  Conversionto  reduce  the  number  of  outstanding 
ISINs in a phased manner.  
 
Assuming an issuer has 250 outstanding ISINs as on March 31, 2017 with maturities over 
say next 5 years. Issuer should switch all existing ISINs in such a manner so as to restrict 

 

Page 13 of 14 

the number of ISINs to maximum 12 ISINs in a financial year. This would be in addition to 
limit proposed above i.e. maximum number of ISINs for fresh issuances.  For example, say 
some of the ISINs in the said 250 ISINs may be due for maturity in the FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 
2020, FY 2021, FY 2022.  Then these ISINs should be switched in such a manner to reduce 
the number of ISINs to 60 i.e. 12 ISINs outstanding in each of FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020, 
FY 2021, FY 2022.
