Draft for Public Comments 

 Draft Listing Agreement for Securitized Debt Instruments 

 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had notified the Regulations for Public 
Offer  and  Listing  of  Securitized  Debt  Instruments  on  May  26,  2008.  The  Regulations, 
inter alia, specified initial disclosure requirements for offer documents for public issues of 
securitized debt instruments and privately placed securitized debt instruments that are 
proposed to be listed on stock exchanges.  
 
Further  to  the  initiative,  in  order  to  enable  listing  of  such  instruments  on  stock 
exchanges,  SEBI  has  prepared  a  draft  Listing  Agreement  for  Securitized  Debt 
Instruments  containing  continuous  disclosure  requirements.  The  draft  has  now  been 
placed on the SEBI Website for public comments/ suggestions till October 31, 2010. 
 
The draft Listing Agreement seeks to disseminate performance related information on a 
monthly basis. This format includes pool level, asset-level and tranche level information 
so as to enable investors to asses the performance of underlying pools. While disclosure 
of loan level details is proposed to be mandatory for pools with less than 20 loans per 
asset class, for others, quartile analysis of the performance of loans is proposed.  
 
The  draft  Listing  Agreement  for  Securitized  Debt  Instruments  places  the  burden  of 
disclosures  on  the  Special  Purpose  Distinct  Entity  (SPDE)  which  is  the  issuer  of 
securitized debt. In order to facilitate flow of information, the draft requires the SPDE to 
enter into back to back arrangements with the originator, servicer and the trustee.  
 
Public  comments/  suggestions  may  be  sent  by  e-mail  up  to  October  31,  2010  to  Shri 
Vikas  SS,  Assistant  General  Manager  (vikas@sebi.gov.in)  and/  or  Ms.  Nila  Kumar 
Hariharan,  Manager  (nilakumarh@sebi.gov.in).  Alternatively,  the  same  may  be  sent
