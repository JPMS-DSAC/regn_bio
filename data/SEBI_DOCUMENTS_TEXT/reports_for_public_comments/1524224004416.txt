Reduction in timelines for public issue of debt securities under the SEBI (Issue and 

Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 

A.  Background: 

 

1.  SEBI,  vide  circular  no.  CIR.  /IMD/DF-1/20/2012  dated  July  27,  2012  had  aligned  the 
timelines for issue process of debt securities issued under the SEBI (Issue and Listing of 
Debt  Securities)  Regulations,  2008  (ILDS  regulations)  with  that  of  equity  shares  and 
convertibles, as provided in the SEBI circular CIR/CFD/DIL/1/2011 dated April 29, 2011. 
The  said  circular  provided  for  indicative  timelines  with  respect  to  the  public  issue 
process requiring trading to commence on T+12th day (wherein the T day is issue closing 
date).  
 

2.  Further, vide SEBI circular CIR/CFD/POLICYCELL/11/2015 dated November 10, 2015, 
the  time  taken  for  listing  after  the  closure  of  public  issue  of  equity  shares  and 
convertibles  was  reduced  to  6  working  days.  To  enable  such  a  reduction,  Application 
Supported  by  Blocked  Amount  (ASBA)  was  made  compulsory  for  all  the  investors 
applying in a public issue.  

 

B.  Need for change: 

 

3.  In  the  last  few  years,  the  corporate  bonds  market  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  major 
sources of funding for  the  corporates  as  evidenced by increased number of  issuances. 
Concurrently,  various  regulatory  initiatives  such  as  implementation  of  centralized 
database  for  corporate  bonds,  introduction  of  electronic  book  platform,  capping  of 
number of ISINs etc. have been taken towards the aim of developing the corporate bond 
market. In this direction, it is felt that existing issuance processes may be rationalized 
further to make it easier and friendly for both the issuers and investors. 
 

4.  It is felt that the present timeline of T+12 for listing and commencement of trading  in 
case of public issue of debt securities is inefficient in terms of cost and time and does not 
ensure smooth functioning for the public issuance process.  Also, non-application of ASBA 
for  public  issuances,  physical  holding  of  debt  securities  lead  to  unnecessary  hassles 
pertaining to refunds, increased cost to the issuers as well as investors.

5.  Thus, reduction in timeline for listing in case of public issue of debt securities, mandatory 
ASBA  facility  for  making  payment  and  mandatory  holding  of  debt  securities  in  demat 
form would not just accrue benefits to the investors but would also considerably ease the 
issuance process for the issuers in terms of cost and time. 

 

 
C.  Review process: 

 
An agenda item was taken to the Corporate Bond and Securitization Advisory Committee 
(CoBoSAC)  of  SEBI  wherein  the  committee  recommended  that  ASBA  may  be  made 
compulsory  for  public  issue  of  debt  securities  along  with  reduction  in  timelines  for 
allotment and commencement of trading from T+12 to T+6 and doing away with physical 
holding of debt securities.  

 
D.  Proposals: 

 

I.  Reduction in timeline in listing and trading post closure of the issue: 

 

In  order  to  ensure  uniformity,  standardization  and  streamlining  of  issuance  of  debt 
securities with that of equity shares and convertibles, it is proposed to reduce the time 
lines for the public issue of debt securities  from T+12 to T+6.   The  detailed indicative 
timeline

CIR/CFD/POLICYCELL/11/2015  dated  November  10,  2015  and  a  brief  summary  of 
indicative timeline schedule for various activities may be as under:

II.  Making ASBA mandatory for public issue of debt securities: 

 

1.  In order to ensure standardization and streamlining of issuance of debt securities with 
that of equity shares and convertibles, it is proposed to make ASBA mandatory for public 
issue of debt securities under the SEBI (ILDS Regulations). 
 

2.  It may be noted that mandatory ASBA facility would reduce the time taken for collecting 
banks  to  commence  clearing  of  payment  instruments,  forwarding  application  forms 
along with bank schedules to registrar; undertaking of technical rejection test,  

 

Page 3 of 6 

 

 

submission of status of clearance status of payment instrument to around  4-5 days as 
against the present time of 7 days.   
 

3.  With ASBA facility, investors will be able to apply for subscription of debt securities and 
make payment by writing their bank account numbers and authorizing the banks to make 
payment in case of allotment by signing the application forms, thus obviating the need of 
writing the cheques. Hence, only the application amount will be blocked and no actual 
movement of money will happen from the account of the investors till allotment, thereby 
making the refund process easier, in case the securities are not allotted to her/him.  
 

III.  Mandatory allotment of debt securities in demat form: 

 

1.  An  analysis  of  public  issuance  data  of  debt  securities  in  the  table  below  reveals  that 
during calendar year 2016 and 2017, out of total number of investors, around 88.69% 
have opted to subscribe in demat mode as against only 11.31% of investors who have 
opted to receive debt securities in physical mode.  In light of this data, it is evident that 
majority of investors are willing to subscribe to debt securities in demat mode.

2.  It is therefore proposed that allotment and subscription of debt securities in demat mode 
may  be  made  compulsory  for  public  issue  of  debt  securities  under  the  SEBI  (ILDS) 
Regulations for all classes of investors, without providing any flexibility of subscription 
in physical mode under the Depositories Act, 1996.
