PROPOSED PROCESS OF ALTERNATIVE MODE OF PAYMENT IN ISSUES  

 
SEBI  Board  has  approved  the  concept  of  providing  an  alternative  mode  of 
payment  in  issues  whereby  the  application  money  remains  in  the  investors’ 
account till finalization of basis of allotment in the issue. Details of the process 
of  “Applications  Supported  by  Blocked  Amount  (hereinafter  referred  as  ASBA 
process) in public issue is given in three parts in this paper. 
 
ASBA  process  would  require  retail  individual  investors  bidding  at  cut-off,  to 
apply  through  Self  Certified  Syndicate Banks  (SCSBs),  in  which  the  investors 
have bank accounts. SCSBs are those banks which satisfy the conditions laid 
down  in  Part  I.  SCSBs  would  accept  the  applications,  block  the  fund  to  the 
extent  of  bid  payment  amount,  upload  the  details  in  the  electronic  bidding 
system of BSE or NSE, unblock once basis of allotment is finalised and transfer 
the amount for allotted shares, to the issuer. Part II details the procedure in 
ASBA process. Part III details the role and responsibility of each intermediary 
in the ASBA process. 
 
It  may  please  be  noted  that  ASBA  process  is  an  additional  mode  of  making 
payment  in  issues,  by  retail  individual investors  who  have  bid  at  cut-off  with 
single  option.  This  would  co-exist  with  the  current  procedure  of  investors 
applying through sub syndicate/ syndicate members with cheque as a payment 
instrument. 
 
Comments  /  suggestions  are  invited  on  the  proposed  ASBA  process. 
Comments/  suggestions  may  be  sent  to  the  address  mentioned  below  to  Mr 
Sudeep  Mishra,  Assistant  General  Manager,  Division  of  Issues  and  Listing, 
Corporation Finance department, SEBI, before June 06,2008.
