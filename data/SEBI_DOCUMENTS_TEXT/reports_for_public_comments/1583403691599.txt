CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON e-VOTING FACILITY PROVIDED 

BY LISTED ENTITIES 

Background and Rationale for review 
 
1.  Under  Regulation  44  of  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Listing 
Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  (LODR 
Regulations) listed entities are required to provide remote e-voting facility to 
their  shareholders  for  all  shareholders’  resolutions.  However,  it  has  been 
observed 
the  public  non-institutional 
shareholders/retail shareholders is at a negligible level.   
 

the  participation  by 

that 

2.  There  are  multiple  e-voting  service  providers  (ESPs)  providing  e-voting 
facility  to  listed  entities  in  India.  This  necessitates  registration  on  various 
ESPs  and  maintenance  of  multiple  user 
IDs  and  passwords  by 
shareholders. 

 

3.  Multiple 

for 

login  credentials,  apart 

the 
shareholders to remember, are also prone to misuse. It is important that the 
entire process of e-voting is secure, convenient and simple to use for the 
shareholders. 

from  being  cumbersome 

 

4.  In  view  of  the  above  inefficiencies  in  the  present  e-voting  process  which 
have  prevented  its  optimum  utilization  by  shareholders,  it  is  proposed  to 
review  the  e-voting  mechanism  as  provided  by  various  ESPs  and  seek 
public comments in this regard. 

 

Current regulatory provisions pertaining to e-voting by listed companies 

5.  Section 108 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with rule 20 of the Companies 
(Management  and  Administration)  Rules,  2014  deals  with  the  exercise  of 
right  to  vote  by  members  by  electronic  means  (e-voting).  The  provisions 
seek  to  ensure  wider  shareholders  participation  in  the  decision  making 
process in companies.  
 

6.  Regulation  44  of  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Listing 
Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015  (LODR 
Regulations) provides that listed entities are required to provide remote e-
voting facility to their shareholders for all shareholders’ resolutions. 

Analysis & Policy Proposals: 

7.  Depositories viz. CDSL and NSDL as well as Depository Participants offer 
internet  based  facilities  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  web  based  services) 
whereby demat account holders are allowed to access information related

to their holdings and transactions in their demat accounts and/or carry out 
secured electronic transactions. 

8.  To enable e-voting through a single login credential and thus increase the 
efficiency of the voting process, after consultation with the Depositories and 
ESPs,  an  alternate  mechanism  is  suggested,  wherein,  demat  account 
holders  may  access  e-voting  portals  of  multiple  ESPs  through  the  web 
based  services  provided  by  Depository  Participants  or  Depositories.  The 
existing and proposed architecture is depicted below –  

 

 

9.  Demat account  holders  would  be  able  to  cast  their  vote  on different  ESP 
portals  without  having  to  register  again  with  the  ESPs,  thereby,  not  only 
facilitating  seamless  authentication  but  also  enhancing  ease  and

convenience of participating in e-voting process. This can be done through 
either of the following two ways –  
 

a.  Direct  registration  with  Depositories  –  Shareholders  can  register 
directly  on  the  depository.  After  the  initial  one-time  registration, 
shareholders would be able to access the e-voting facilities through 
Mobile / E-mail based OTP verification. Shareholders would be able 
to access the e-voting links of ESPs without further authentication by 
ESPs for participating in the e-voting process. 
 

b.  Through  Demat  Accounts  with  Depository  Participants  –  Demat 
account holders will have the option of accessing various ESP portals 
directly  from  their  demat  accounts,  through  the  facility  provided  by 
respective  depository.  The  Depositories  may  authenticate  the 
investors through Mobile / E-mail based OTP verification for allowing 
such access. Shareholders would be able to access the e-voting links 
of ESPs without further authentication by ESPs for participating in the 
e-voting process. 

 

10. The  authentication  of  shareholders  would  happen  at  the  depository  level 
and ESPs shall allow the demat account holders to cast their vote based on 
the validation carried out by the Depository.  
 

11. Depositories  shall  share  necessary  details  and  logs  such  as  source  IP 
address, PAN, Demat Account number, Name of the account holder, Mobile 
no., Email ID etc., of the demat account holders with other ESPs. Similarly, 
ESPs shall also share the electronic logs and other related information with 
respect to the e-voting transactions with the depositories. 

 

12. Demat  account  holders  seeking  access  to  the  e-voting  system  of  ESPs 
through  the  web  based  service  provided  by  its  Depository  /  Depository 
Participants  shall  mandatorily  update  their  mobile  number  and  email 
ID registered  in  their  demat  accounts.  Depositories  should  also  have  the 
mechanism to periodically monitor the validity of such information. 

 

13. This facility shall be available to all the shareholders holding the securities 
in  demat  mode.  ESPs  may  continue  to  provide  the  facility  of  e-voting  to 
physical shareholders as per the existing process. 

 

14. Depositories  shall  establish  a  dedicated  helpline  to  resolve  technical 

difficulties faced by shareholders relating to the e-voting facility. 

 

15. ESPs shall  send the  details of the vote cast to  the shareholders via  SMS 
and  /  or  Email,  as  follows:  “You  have  cast  your  vote  in  favour  of  the 
resolution no(s)…. and against the resolution no(s)….in respect of…. shares

in ….(company). In case of any discrepancy, you may contact…..or mail at 
……” 
 

 

16. ESP  Portals  shall  provide  relevant  links  regarding  the  resolutions  of  the 
listed  companies.  Such  links  shall  provide  access  to  listed  companies’ 
websites through exchange corporate search link, proxy advisors’ websites 
etc.  This  would  enable  better  deliberation  and  decision  making  by  the 
shareholders while casting their votes.
