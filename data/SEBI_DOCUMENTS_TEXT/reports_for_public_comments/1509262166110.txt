Addendum to “Discussion paper on Growth and Development of Equity 

Derivative Market in India” 

 
 
Physical Settlement in Stock Future and Stock Option contracts 

 

1.  Equity  derivatives  turnover  is  largely  dominated  by  Index  options,  followed  by 

Stock  Futures,  Stock  Options  and  Index  Futures.  The  high  trading  volume  in 

derivatives  on  individual  stocks  especially  stock  futures  is  unique  to  only  few 

markets including India. The other markets where stock futures are traded actively 

are Korea Exchange, Moscow Exchange, Eurex, etc.  

 

2.  SEBI, in the past, through various committees has examined the issue of physical 

settlement  in  stock  derivatives.  The  following  issues  have  been  highlighted  by 

various committees with regard to physical settlement of stock derivatives: 

 

  Hedgers  and  arbitragers  are  in  a  better  position  to  manage  basis  risk,  if 

physical settlement is made mandatory for stock derivative contracts.  

 

  Globally, cash settlement is more cost effective than physical settlement.  

 

  There  may  be  a  possibility  of  a  short  squeeze,  in  the  absence  of  a  vibrant 

mechanism  for  securities  lending  and  borrowing.  A  pre-requisite  for 

successful  introduction  of  physical  settlement  of  derivatives  is  efficient  and 

transparent lending and borrowing mechanism in cash segment. 

 

  Physical  settlement  in  stock  derivative  contracts  may  be  introduced  in  a 

phased manner, first with single stock option contracts and then extended to 

cover single stock futures. 

 

  Another  perspective  could  be  that  the  threat  of  physical  delivery  in  stock 

derivative leads to better alignment, coupling and convergence between cash 

and derivative market.
