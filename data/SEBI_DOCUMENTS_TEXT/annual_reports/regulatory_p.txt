IMPORTANT  COURT
PRONOUNCEMNTS

SEBI vs Sangeeta J Valia – Bombay
High Court

The appeal arises from the Order dated
November  30,  2002  passed  by  the
Securities  Appellate  Tribunal.  Sangeeta
J Valia (Acquirer) had acquired 6,98,500
equity shares of Cumulative Convertible
Preference (CCP) and 11,76,895 shares
of Vasparr Fischer Ltd (VFL) on January
6  ,1999.  The  Acquirer  had  failed  to  file
report  with  SEBI  within  the  required
period  of  21  days  in  terms  of  Takeover
Regulations  1997.  The  Adjudicating
Officer  appointed  by  SEBI  found  that
there  was  a  delay  of  328  days  and
imposed  a  penalty  of  Rs.1,50,000/-
under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act, 1992.
This order was set aside by the Hon’ble
SAT.

SAT held that there is a specific provision
in clause (a) of Section 15A of the SEBI
Act,  providing  for  one  time  penalty,  in
case of each failure to furnish any report
to the Board, and rule 3(4) of Takeover
Regulation 1997 also requires to submit
the report to the Board. Therefore, clause
(b) of Section 15A could not have been
invoked by SEBI. Clause (a) takes care
of  matters  exclusively  dealing  with  the
Board,  clause  (b)  is  in  exclusion  of  the
matters  dealing  with  Board.  SAT  also
held  that  Sebi  further  supported  the
impugned  orders  on  the  ground  that
failure to file report or submit the report,
could not be under clause (b), as report,
contemplated  was  submitted  by  the
Acquirer,  to  the  Board  and  as  specific
provisions and penalties are provided for
failure to furnish any report to the Board,
therefore,  SEBI‘s  action  in  terms  of
clause  (b)  of  the  said  section  15A,
cannot be considered legal.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

Part-IV Regulatory Changes

Aggrieved  by  the  said  order,  SEBI
preferred an appeal to the Hon’ble High
Court, Bombay. The Hon’ble High Court
held  that  “we  find  substance  in  the
submission of the appellant that section
15A(a)  deals  with  the  situation  where
there  is  complete  failure  in  furnishing
documents, report, return, etc.. to SEBI
whereas  Section  15A(b)  is  attracted
where there is delay in filing any return
or  furnishing  any  information,  books  or
other  documents  within  specified  time.
Because the expression ‘report’ has not
been  used  in  15A9b)  –  the  expression
that  is  used  in  15A(a)  –  would  not
distinguish the two provisions itself. The
area  of  operation  of  the  two  provisions
15A(a)  and  15A(b)  is  different  for  the
reason  that  15A(a)  is  invokable  where
there is total failure in furnishing requisite
information while 15A(b) comes into play
where  though  there  is  compliance  by
furnishing necessary information but the
compliance  is  made  belatedly.  Section
15A(a)  and  15A(b)  are,  thus,  attracted
in  the  different  situation  as  noticed
above.  We  are  of  the  view  that  the
interpretation  put  by  the  Securities
Appellate Tribunal as well as the Learned
Counsel,  for  the  Respondent,  is  not
correct. It is well settled that if the power
to  act  in  the  authority  exists  in  a  fact
situation,  such  exercise  of  power  is  not
vitiated  by  the  reference  to  wrong
provision  of  law.  Mention  of  wrong
provision  of  law  shall  not  render  the
exercise  of  power  by  the  authority  bad
in  law  if  the  source  of  power  can  be
traced  in  some  other  provision.  The
present  is  a  case  where  the  authority
has  exercised  the  power  under  Section
15A(b) and that cannot be faulted for the
reasons we have indicated above. It may
be mentioned here that the Adjudicating
Officer  in  fact,  after  considering  the
bonafide  and  genuineness  of  the

110

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

statement  of  Respondent  levied  a
minimum penalty of Rs.500/- per day for
the delay of 328 days with upper ceiling
of  Rs.1,50,000/-  The  penalty  was  to  be
paid within 45 days of the receipt of the
said  order.  We  are  of  the  view  that
Adjudicating Officer had in fact taken into
consideration  all  other  factors  as
contemplated  under  section  15J  of  the
SEBI  Act,  while  adjudging  the  quantum
of the penalty under section 15A(b). We
see no reason to accept the contentions
of  the  Respondent  that  factors  as
contemplated under Section 15J of SEBI
Act, were not taken into consideration by
Adjudicating Officer, while awarding the
penalty as acquirer / Respondent failed
to  submit  the  detailed  information  and
documents  in  standardized  format  of
report  in  time  as  contemplated  and
under Regulation 3(4) and section 15A(b)
of the SEBI Act.
For  the  reasons  stated  above,  the
common order passed by the Securities
Appellate  Tribunal  dated  30.11.2000  in
SBA  No.17/2000  and  18/2000  is  set
aside.  The  Appeal  is  allowed  and  the
order passed by the Adjudicating Officer
dated  24.7.2000  is  restored  and
maintained.”

SEBI Vs Cabot International Capital
Corporation - Bombay High Court
The appeal arises from the order dated
January  25,  2001  passed  by  the
Securities Appellate Tribunal. The appeal
was preferred by SEBI.
Cabot  International  Capital  Corporation
(Cabot) was a foreign collaborator of the
Indian company namely, Cabot India Ltd.
(CIL),  and  held  51%  of  the  paid  up
capital  of  CIL.  During  the  preferential
allotment  by  CIL,  Cabot  approached
SEBI  seeking  exemption  under
Regulation  3  of  SEBI  (Substantial

II.

Regulations, 1997. On examination of the
proposal, SEBI found that the holding of
Cabot  in  CIL  had  increased  from  51%
to  60%  and  accordingly,  adjudication
proceedings under Section 15A and 15H
of  SEBI  Act,  1992  were  initiated  for
violation  of  Regulations  3(4)  and  11  of
Takeover Regulations. The Adjudicating
officer, after hearing, imposed a penalty
of Rs.1,50,000 on Cabot for violation of
Regulation 3(4) of Takeover Regulations
i.e.  failure  to  submit  report  to  SEBI.
Further, the Adjudication officer has given
the  benefit  of  doubt  to  Cabot  on  the
ground  of  lack  of  clarity  on  the  part  of
Cabot  as  to  the  applicability  of  1997
Regulations and hence, no penalty under
Section  15H  (ii)  was  levied  for  the
alleged  violation  of  Regulation  11.  The
matter  was  taken  in  appeal  by  Cabot
before  SAT  saying  that  there  was  no
deliberate and dishonest conduct or any
conscious  disregard  of  SEBI  Takeover
Regulations of 1994/1997; it was only a
technical or venial flaw from a bona fide
belief that Cabot was not liable to act in
a manner prescribed under the Takeover
Regulations 1997. Hence mens rea was
absent. SAT vide its order dated January
25th,  2001  allowed  the  appeal,  holding
that  the  order  passed  by  SEBI  was
unsustainable  as  none  of  the  factors  of
Section  15J  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  was
attracted  in  the  instant  case.  SAT  also
viewed the differential treatment regarding
the  applicability  of  Section  15H  to
violations  of  Regulation  3(4)  and
Regulation  11  of  Takeover  Code,  to  be
incorrect.

After  extensive  hearing  in  the  matter,
Hon’ble High Court held mens rea is not
essential  for  imposing  civil  penalties
under  the  SEBI  Act  and  Regulations.
According to the Hon’ble High Court, the

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

adjudication proceedings under the SEBI
Act are neither criminal nor quasi criminal
proceedings. The relevant findings of the
Hon’ble  High  Court  are  extracted
hereunder:
“Therefore,  for  respective  default  or
failure, penalty is provided under the Act.
The scheme of the SEBI Act of imposing
monetary  penalty  is  very  clear.  This
Chapter  nowhere  deals  with  criminal
offence.  These  defaults  or  failures  are
nothing, but failure or default of statutory
civil  obligations  provided  under  the  Act
and the Regulations made thereunder. It
is  pertinent  to  note  that  Section  24  of
SEBI Act deals with the criminal offences
under the Act and its punishment.
The adjudication for imposing penalty by
Adjudicating Officer, after due inquiry, is
neither  a  criminal  nor  a  quasi  criminal
proceeding.  The  penalty  leviable  under
this Chapter or under these Sections, is
penalty  in  cases  of  default  or  failure  of
statutory  obligation  or  in  other  words
breach of civil obligation. The provisions
and  scheme  of  penalty  under  SEBI  Act
and the Regulations, there is no element
of any criminal offence or punishment as
contemplated 
criminal
proceedings.  Therefore,  there  is  no
question  of  proof  of  any  mens  rea  by
the  Appellants  and  it  is  not  essential
element for imposing penalty under SEBI
Act and the Regulations.
The  penalty  imposable  under  the  SEBI
Act and the Regulations under Sections
15I and 15J, is deterrent in nature to see
that  the  parties  or  person  concerned
complies  with  the  Regulations  strictly.
The imposition of the penalty under SEBI
Act and Regulations is civil in nature and
cannot  be  equated  with  penal  in
character  as  referred  and  submitted  by
the respondents and/or observed by the
Appellate  Authority.  It  is  also  clear  that

under 

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

111

Part-IV Regulatory Changes

the  word  “penalty”  has  different  colour
and  shades  and  facets  and  that  has  to
be interpreted and imposed on the basis
of particular act and policies or scheme.
It  is  also  clear  that  there  can  be  two
distinct liabilities under the same act i.e.
civil and / or criminal. The Authorities or
Regulatory Authority have ample power
to  initiate  both  proceedings,  if  case  is
made  out,  within  the  framework  of  the
SEBI Act or the Regulations.

The  SEBI  Act  and  the  Regulations,  are
intended to regulate the Security Market
and  the  related  aspects,  the  imposition
of  penalty,  in  the  given,  facts  and
circumstances  of  the  case,  cannot  be
tested  on  the  ground  of  “no  mens  rea,
no  penalty”.  For  breaches  of  provisions
of SEBI Act and Regulations, according
to  us,  which  are  civil  in  nature,  mens
rea  is  not  essential.  On  particular  facts
and  circumstances  of  the  case,  proper
exercise of judicial discretion is a must,
but not on a foundation that mens rea is
an  essential  to  impose  penalty  in  each
and  every  breach  of  provisions  of  the
SEBI Act.

Now, the question, of the penalty, by the
Adjudicating  Authority,  in  the  facts  and
circumstances  of 
the  case,  was
warranted  or  not.  We  find  that  the
allotment  in  question  was  undoubtedly
covered under the exemption provided in
Regulation  3(1).  There  could  not  have
been insistence by the Appellants-SEBI
to  comply  with  the  requirements  of
Regulation 3(4). It is also clear that when
an  acquisition 
is  covered  under
Regulation 3, the acquirer is required to
report  to  the  Board  under  the  Sub-
Regulation 3(4) within the specified time,
as  referred  above.  In  view  of  this
undisputed  position,  merely  because
there  was  no  Report  filed,  that  itself
cannot be read as serious defect or non

112

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

compliances of the said provisions. The
Appellate Authority, after considering the
material on record, including the events,
referred in the pleadings, found that the
respondents-Company  had  no  intention
to  suppress  any  material  information
from the appellants or the share holders.
The  Company  had  informed  the  Stock
Exchange, Registrar of Companies and
complied with all other provisions of other
laws,  well  in  time.  It  cannot  be
overlooked  that  information  about  the
preferential allotment was well within the
knowledge of the appellants, as reflected
from the letter dated 2nd January, 1997.
The  appellants  were  aware  of  the
preferential allotment in question and in
fact prevented the Respondent-company
from  monitoring  and  pursuing  further
course of action. It is also clear from the
record  that  S.R.  Batliboi  &  Associates,
Chartered  Accountants,  being  statutory
Auditors of the company, had written on
14th  January,  1997,  to  the  respondents,
the Reserve Bank of India and reported
the  Company’s  decision  to  make
preferential  allotment.  It  appears  that
there  was  no 
the
respondents  to  avoid  filing  of  such  a
Report  with  the  appellants,  as  the
respondents  had  in  fact  complied  with
and  notified  the  relevant  details  to  all
other concerned Authorities, like Registrar
of  Companies,  Reserve  Bank  of  India
and  Stock  Exchange  in  respect  of  the
preferential  allotment  and  the  relevant
details.  Therefore,  SAT,  cannot  be  said
to have erred in the factual background
of  the  case  that  the  respondents  never
intended  or  consciously  or  deliberately
avoided  to  comply  with  the  obligations
under the SEBI Act and the Regulations
and  the  non  filing  of  the  Report  in
question  was  a  technical  and  a  minor
defect  or  breach  based  on  bonafide
belief  that  respondents  were  not  liable

intention  of 

or required to submit the said Report in
view of the admitted exemption available
under the SEBI Act and the Regulations.
In  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the
present  case  the  reversal  of  the  order
of the Adjudicatory Authority, by the SAT
cannot be faulted.
However, we are not in agreement with
the Appellate Authority in respect of the
reasoning  given  in  regard  to  the
necessity  of  mens  rea  being  essential
for  imposing  one  penalty.  According  to
us,  mens  rea  is  not  essential  for
imposing  civil  penalties  under  the  SEBI
Act and Regulations.”

III. Kalpana Bhandari and Others Vs.
SEBI and Others - Bombay High
Court
The  captioned  petition  is  filed  inter  alia
for  a  direction  to  SEBI  to  issue
appropriate  directions  restraining  Sesa
Goa Limited and Sesa Industries Limited
from  taking  any  steps  pursuant  to  or  in
implementation of or in furtherance of the
letter of offer dated June 05, 2003.
Sesa  Goa  Limited  and  Sesa  Industries
Limited had issued a letter of offer dated
June 05, 2003 to acquire up to 49,13,000
fully paid up equity shares representing
24.56%  of  the  equity  share  capital  of
Sesa  Industries  Ltd.  by  Sesa  Goa  Ltd.
The primary grievance of the petitioners
was  that  Sesa  Goa  Ltd.,  must  offer  the
petitioners  price  not  less  that  Rs.  57/-
per  share  for  acquiring  the  shares  of
Sesa Industries from the petitioners and
other investors.
The  Hon’ble  High  Court  vide  its  order
dated  August  05,  2003,  dismissed  the
writ petition in view of the disposal of the
similar writ petition (WP no. 1280/1999)
filed  by  some  of  the  shareholders.  The
Hon’ble  High  Court  disposed  WP  no.

failure  in  discharge  of  any  statutory
duties on the part of SEBI.
The Hon’ble High Court further observed
that  even  if  Sesa  Industries  was  not  a
listed  public  company  nor  was  held  to
have  intended  to  get  their  securities  on
any recognized stock exchange in India,
the  various  provisions  referred  to  in
section 55 A relating to issue of transfer
of  securities  and  non  payment  of
dividend was clearly administrated by the
Central Government and the petitioners
could  always  apply  to  the  Central
Government  for  the  various  grievances
raised before the court.

IV. A S Upadhyay Vs BSE and Others –

Bombay High Court.
The  captioned  petition  is  filed  inter  alia
for  canceling  the  notice  issued  by  BSE
and  NSE  dated  September  23,  2003.
BSE  and  NSE  vide  their  aforesaid
notices  shifted  nine  scrips  for  trading
and settlement on a Trade to Trade basis
with  effect  from  September  26,  2003.
The petitioner alleged inter alia that there
is violation of natural justice on the part
of  SEBI,  NSE  etc.,  as  no  notice  was
issued to the companies before shifting
their scrips to Trade to Trade Segment.
BSE and NSE had issued the impugned
circular  after  consultation  with  SEBI  for
the  purpose  of  market  safety  and
integrity. The Hon’ble Court had upheld
the validity of the circular issued by BSE
and  NSE  moving  the  scrip  of  HFCL  to
trade  to  trade  category  and 
inter  alia
observed  that  there  was  absolutely  no
substance  in  the  writ  petition  which
purported  to  challenge  the  legality  and
validity  of  the  circulars  issued  by  BSE
and NSE. The Court also held that there
was no illegality or impropriety in the said
decision of the stock exchanges to issue
the  aforesaid  circulars  which  are

obviously  in  the  interest  of  the  share
holders and particularly in the interest of
the  small  investors.  The  Hon’ble  court
further  observed  that  there  was  no
dispute  that  the  expert  committee
consisting  of  the  officials  of  SEBI,  BSE
and  NSE  was  empowered  to  have
surveillance  to  observe  that  the  stock
market  reflects  genuine  trades  and  to
ensure  that  false  transactions  are
prevented.  Such  decisions  were
transitory decisions which were taken by
SEBI,  BSE  and  NSE  considering  the
current  market  position  and  such
decisions  were  always  subjected  to
review. The Court also held that the said
regulators were appointed to protect the
small 
to  prevent
manipulation  in  the  stock  market  and  it
was  exclusively  for  such  expert  bodies
to take appropriate decisions to achieve
their objectives of stabilizing the market.

investors  and 

Therefore,  the  court  is  not  inclined  to
expand the vistas of article 226 of judicial
review  to  take  control  and  have
surveillance  over  the  decision  of  the
SEBI, BSE and NSE. The Hon’ble court
also observed that it had no expertise to
study  the  share  market  and  there  was
no  malafide  or  arbitrariness  or
unreasonableness in the circulars issued
by  the  above  stock  exchanges  which
was only a temporary measure to control
the  movement  of  certain  scrips  in  the
stock market.

V.

Shivkumar Bissa Vs BSE and Others
– Bombay High Court

The  captioned  petition  was  filed  by  the
petitioner  (member,  BSE)  inter  alia  for
declaring the circular dated February 20,
2002  of  SEBI  to  be  invalid.  SEBI  vide
letter  dated  February  20,  2002  had
informed Mumbai Stock Exchange (BSE)
that  main  broker  is  responsible  for  the

114

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

acts of the sub broker . SEBI vide letter
referred above had clarified that “ In this
regard  we  would  like  to  clarify  that  the
main broker is responsible for the acts ,
deeds  and  things  of  the  sub  broker
affiliated to it or for whom it has issued
contract  note  /consolidated  contract
notes”.

The  captioned  petition  arises  as  a
constituent  had  filed  an  arbitration
reference  against  the  sub-broker  and
also the petitioner for an amount of Rs.
9,00,000/-  The  learned  arbitrator  after
considering  the  rival  contentions  raised
by  the  parties  dismissed  the  claims  of
the constituent against the petitioner and
passed an award against the Sub-broker.
In  spite  of  the  claim  of  the  constituent
having  being  dismissed  against  the
petitioner, BSE had advised the petitioner
to immediately settle the complaint of the
constituent 
the  non
implementation of arbitration award. BSE
had  also  forwarded  the  letter  dated
February  20,  2002  passed  by  SEBI  to
the petitioner, which was impugned letter
in the matter. BSE had also called upon
the  petitioner  to  appear  before  the
disciplinary  committee.  The  petitioner
challenged 
inter  alia  the  letter  dated
February 20, 2002.

regarding 

SEBI  had  contested 
the  matter
vehemently and argued that a broker is
responsible  for  the  Acts  of  the  Sub-
broker especially in view of the definition
of  the  word  sub-broker  as  provided  in
SEBI  (Stock  Brokers  and  Sub-Brokers)
Rules,  1992.  The  Hon’ble  High  Court
dismissed the writ petition and observed
that  the  SEBI  Regulations  clearly
mentions that the sub-broker is an agent
acting  on  behalf  of  the  broker  and
therefore the main broker is liable for the
sub-broker  for  all  the  acts,  deeds  and
things  done.  The  Hon’ble  Court  had

further  observed  that  in  the  agreement,
the  main  broker  can  specify  to  what
extend the sub-broker is responsible and
can deal with the clients on behalf of the
main broker. On the reasons mentioned
above, the Hon’ble Court observed that
there  is  no  ground  whatsoever  to
interfere in the matter. The Hon’ble High
Court had further observed that there is
nothing illegal, arbitrary or irrational in the
said  circular,  which  is  in  fact  the  basic
principle  of  law  of  contract  wherein  the
Principal is always liable for the actions
of the agent.

VI. Banhem Securities Private Ltd. Vs.

that 

NSE, SEBI and Others - Bombay
High Court
The  petitioner  has  filed  the  captioned
petition  challenging  the  SEBI  Circular
dated  9/7/99  alleging 
the
enforcement of an award passed under
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
is  governed  by  the  said  Act,  and  SEBI
has no power or authority to override the
provisions of the said Act by way of an
administrative circular.
The petitioner had contended that by the
said  circular  the  SEBI  has  purported  to
direct  the  stock  exchange  to  debit  the
security deposit placed by the members,
towards  the  amount  of  any  award
passed  against  the  member.  As  a
consequence  of  such  a  debit  the
member  would  immediately  have  to
meet  the  short  fall  failing  which  the
trading  facility  of  the  member  would  be
discontinued  and  he  will  suffer  loss  to
his business. The petitioner submits that
the  power  to  require  a  party  to  submit,
security  is  a  power  conferred  on  the
Hon’ble  Court,  and  SEBI  cannot  take
upon  itself  such  powers  or  authority  to
over  ride  the  provisions  of  the  statute.
The  said  circular  is  clearly  contrary  to
the  provisions  of  the  Arbitration  and

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

Conciliation Act, 1996, where an award
cannot  be  enforced  till  it  becomes  a
decree.

The  petitioner  sought  for  a  declaration
declaring  the  said  SEBI  Circular  as
illegal, unlawful, ultra vires and void and
a  direction  to  quash  the  said  SEBI
Circular, mainly, on the grounds that the
SEBI Circular is merely an administrative
instruction  and  cannot  over  ride  the
statute  of  Parliament  i.e.  the  Arbitration
and  Conciliation  Act,  1996  (the  said
Act).The SEBI direction as contained in
the impugned circular is patently contrary
to  the  provisions  of  Section  36  of  the
said Act. The said Circular is ultra vires
the provisions of the SEBI Act, SC(R)A
arbitrary  and  illegal  as  it  makes  the
decree  enforceable  even  though  such
decree may not be enforceable at law.

By its order the Hon’ble High Court has
held that the challenge to the impugned
circular  is  without  any  substance.  The
circular  has  been  issued  by  the  SEBI
Board  in  exercise  of  powers  under
section  11  and  11B  of  the  SEBI  Act  in
order to protect interests of the investors.
SEBI  had  taken  note  that  arbitration
awards passed in favour of the clients /
investors  are  not  implemented  and  the
stock  exchanges  are  unable  to  take
appropriate  action  in  order  to  ensure
implementation  of  the  awards.  The
Hon’ble  High  Court  observed  the
decision taken by the SEBI is in the right
direction. It helps to protect the investors.
The  circular  issued  by  the  SEBI  is
confined  to  members  /  brokers  of  the
Stock  Exchanges  and  there  is  no
question of the circular being contrary to
the provisions of section 36 or any other
provisions  of  the  Arbitration  and
Conciliation Act, 1996. The Hon’ble High
Court  did  not  find  any  illegality  or
arbitrariness in the circular.

VII. Rakesh Agarwal Vs. SEBI –

Securities Appellate Tribunal
The  captioned  appeal  was  preferred
against  order  dated  106.2001  of
Chairman,  SEBI  against  Shri  Rakesh
Agarwal  (Appellant),  directing  that  the
appellant  shall  deposit  Rs.17,00,000
each  with  Investor  Protection  Funds  of
The  Stock  Exchange,  Mumbai  and
National Stock Exchange to compensate
any  Investor  who  may  make  any  claim
aggrieved with the sale of shares of ABS
Industries  to  Shri  I.P.  Kedia  during  the
period 9.9.96 to 1.10.96; that SEBI shall
initiate  prosecution  under  Section  24  of
the SEBI Act and that SEBI shall initiate
adjudication  proceedings  under  Section
15I  read  with  Section  15G  of  the  SEBI
Act.
The appellant was the Managing Director
of ABS Industries Ltd. (ABS), a company
incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act,
1956.  ABS  was  subsequently  acquired
by  Bayer  AG.  (Bayer),  a  company
registered  in  Germany.  Bayer  acquired
controlling  stake  in  ABS  Industries  Ltd
by acquiring 55,80,000 shares @ Rs.70/
-  per  share  in  a  preferential  allotment
made  by  ABS  Industries  Ltd.  and  20%
shares  from  existing  shareholders  @
Rs.80/- per share in a public offer made
by  them.  Allegations  were  made
regarding insider trading in purchase of
shares  of  ABS  Industries  Ltd  prior  to
announcement  by  Bayer  of  acquiring
controlling  stake  in  the  company.  SEBI
conducted  an  investigation  into  the
matter  and  found  that  prior  to  the
announcement  of  the  acquisition,  the
appellant through his brother in law, Shri
I.P. Kedia had purchased shares of ABS
from  the  market  and  tendered  the  said
shares in the open offer made by Bayer
thereby making a substantial profit. The
appellant being the Managing Director of

116

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

ABS  and  having  been  involved  in  the
negotiations had access to unpublished
price  sensitive  information.  Further  he
was  also  an  insider  as  far  as  ABS  is
concerned.  By  dealing  in  the  shares  of
ABS through his brother-in-law while the
information  regarding  the  acquisition  of
51% stake by Bayer was not public, the
appellant  had  acted  in  violation  of
Regulation 3 and 4 of the Insider Trading
Regulations.
The Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal
vide  its  order  dated  3.11.2003  has
allowed the captioned appeal finding that
the  appellant  was  not  guilty  of  Insider
Trading.  The  tribunal  has  held  that  the
that  merger  was  a  price  sensitive
information;  that  merger  of  Bayer  with
ABS  Industries  was  price  sensitive  and
unpublished;  that  Rakesh  Agrawal  an
‘insider’ and that he had purchased the
shares  of  ABS  on  the  basis  of
unpublished  price  sensitive  information.
However,  the  tribunal  held  that  since
Rakesh Agrawal acted in the interest of
the  company  he  cannot  be  considered
to  have  violated  the  Insider  Trading
Regulations. The tribunal also held that
although  Rakesh  Agrawal  had  made
profit  out  of  the  transactions  but  it  was
only incidental to the cause of the interest
of the company.
The tribunal held that although it is true
that  Regulations  3  and  4  of  the  SEBI
(Prohibition  of 
Insider  Trading)
Regulations, 1992 are per se pure vanila
sections without specific mention of the
requirement of the motive or intention, if
read  with  the  objective  of  prohibiting
insider  trading  it  becomes  clear  that
motive is built in and the insider trading
without establishing the motive factor is
not  punishable.  It  found  that  if  it  is
established  that  the  person  who  had
indulged  in  insider  trading  had  no

intention of gaining any unfair advantage,
the charge of insider trading warranting
penalty can not be sustained against him
In view of the above, the Tribunal allowed
the  appeal  in  respect  of  the  directions
to him to deposit a sum of Rs. 34 Lakhs
with  the  Investor  Protection  Funds.
Aggrieved  by  the  said  order,  SEBI  has
preferred  an  appeal  against  the  above
order of SAT before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court  of  India  and  the  Supreme  Court
has admitted the appeal.

VIII. Manu Finlease and Others Vs. SEBI

– Securities Appellate Tribunal
The appeal arises from the order dated
29.11.2002  passed  by  SEBI  debarring
the  company  and  its  directors  from
accessing and being associated with the
capital market for a period of five years,
under Section 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 and
Regulation  12  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of
Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices
Relating 
to  Securities  Market)
Regulations, 1995.
SEBI  conducted  investigations  into  the
affairs  relating  to  buying,  selling  and
dealing  in  the  shares  of  M/s.  Manu
Finlease  Ltd.  Investigations  inter  alia
revealed various irregularities committed
in the public issue by Manu Finlease Ltd.
viz.  forgery  in  the  amount  of  Stock
Invests,  back  dating  of  stock  invests,
acceptance  of  late  applications  and
multiple applications, stock invests used

for  various  applications,  stock  invests
issued  without  proper  securities,
allotment  of  shares  without  waiting  for
realization of stock invests and false and
misleading  basis  of  allotment.  The
company  was  also  found  to  have
involved in grey market transactions and
price manipulation of the scrip.

from 

SAT  vide  its  Order  dated  October  27,
2003  has  upheld  the  order  passed  by
SEBI. SAT in its order has inter alia held
that by invoking Section 11B of the SEBI
Act,  SEBI  had  prevented 
these
companies 
repeating  such
manipulations  by  debarring  them  from
accessing  the  capital  market  for
specified  period.  SAT  observed  that
viewed  from  the  investor  protection
angle,  which  is  the  objective  for  which
directions  under  Section  11B  can  be
issued, the said Section is a preventive
measure and such directions which are
relatable  to  the  violation  of  the  FUTP
Regulations in relation to the public issue
made by the Appellant company should
be upheld.

Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  SAT,  Manu
Finlease  and  one  of  its  directors  filed
Appeals  before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme
Court.  The  matter  came  up  for  hearing
on  08.03.2004  and  upon  hearing,  the
Hon’ble Supreme Court refused to grant
interim stay of the order passed by SAT.
However,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court
admitted the appeals.
