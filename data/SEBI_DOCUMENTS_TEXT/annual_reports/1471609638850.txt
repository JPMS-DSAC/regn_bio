CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT

securities  market  in  India  by  adopting  various  global 
standards  and  international  best  practices.  With  the 
implementation  of  different  regulations  prescribed  by 
SEBI, access to information has increased, risk of defaults 
has gone down and the overall governance has become 
conducive for the protection of investors’ interests and 
overall development of the securities market in India.

The  SEBI  Annual  Report  is  a  compilation  and  analysis 
of  the  happenings  in  securities  market.  The  Annual 
Report serves to enlighten the public at large on what 
SEBI  had  intended  to  accomplish  during  the  previous 
year  and  what  was  actually  carried  out.  During  2015-
16, our mandate of protecting the interests of investors, 
developing the market and regulation guided us through 
all our policy initiatives as well as our accomplishments 
across all the functional areas under SEBI.

On  September  28,  2015,  the  historic  merger  of  the 
erstwhile  commodities 
futures  regulator,  Forward 
Markets  Commission  with  SEBI  took  place  in  Mumbai. 
The  merger  was  effected  to  bring  about  convergence 
in  regulations  and  to  harness  the  economies  of  scope 
and  scale  for  the  Government,  exchanges,  financial 
firms,  and  other  stakeholders  at  large.  For  SEBI,  it  is  a 
recognition  of  its  tireless  efforts  towards  ensuring  an 
efficient securities market and reposition of its trust in 
itself  to  replicate  the  same  in  commodities  derivative 
milieu.

Post-merger, SEBI’s immediate priority was to ensure 
the  orderly  conduct  of  commodities  derivatives 
market  devoid  of  any  disruptions.  Going  forward, 
on  this  front,  SEBI  faces  many  complex  challenges, 
emanating  from  the  underlying  markets  which 
are  fragmented  and  dispersed  and  not  under  its 
regulatory  purview.  The  activities  and  movements 
in  the  physical  markets  influence  and,  at  times,  can 
have significant repercussions on the real economy. 
Hence, caution needs to be exercised while framing 
policies  for  commodity  derivatives  since  these  may 
influence the physical markets at different levels.

Notwithstanding these challenges, SEBI, in the past six 
months  has  been  continuously  endeavoring  towards 
reshaping  and 
refining  commodities  derivatives 
market regulations, strengthening its risk management 
framework,  aligning  existing  market  participants 
to  a  uniform  regulatory  framework,  boosting  the 
surveillance  mechanisms  at  exchanges  and  at  SEBI  to 
better monitor the markets and instil confidence among 

2015-16  was  not  the  brightest  year  for  the  global 
economy.  Global  economic  growth  displayed  signs 
of  slowing  down.  Emerging  risks  and  volatility  from 
global developments such as a slowdown in China, the 
crisis in Europe, weak global trade and prospects of an 
interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve raised concerns 
about the prospects of global economic growth in the 
future. Emerging economies also witnessed a significant 
slowdown in growth. Against this backdrop of negative 
to  modest  positive  growth  rates  for  major  world 
economies, the Indian economy holds the potential to 
register strong growth rates. The outlook for growth in 
India is improving gradually. Organisations such as the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank 
have been appreciative of India’s growth story and have 
embellished India’s outlook with words such as ‘bright 
spot’, ‘silver lining’ and the like.

The Indian securities markets have come a long way in the 
last two and a half decades in terms of both quantitative 
as  well  as  qualitative  transformations.  They  have  also 
witnessed quite a few ups and downs including a global 
financial  crisis.  The  relationship  between  the  rate  of 
economic growth and growth in the securities market is 
two-fold and symbiotic. Strong economic growth helps 
securities  market  to  develop  and  developed  securities 
market mobilizes capital to fuel economic growth. Since 
SEBI  was  established  in  1992,  we  have  witnessed  this 
virtuous cycle. 

Since  the  establishment  of  SEBI,  the  securities  market 
in  India  has  developed  significantly.  Establishing  SEBI 
led  to  successful  transition  from  a  highly  controlled 
merit  based  regulatory  regime  to  a  market  oriented 
disclosures  based  regulatory  regime.  Over  the  last 
two  and  a  half  decades,  SEBI  has  at  all  times  ensured 
that  Indian  securities  market  develops  in  terms  of 
products,  technology,  participants,  surveillance  and 
enforcement  in  tandem  with  international  standards. 
SEBI has incessantly strived for a well regulated modern 

all stakeholders. Hon’ble Finance Minister, in the Union 
Budget 2016-17 has announced the introduction of new 
products  in  the  commodities  derivatives  space.  In  the 
years to come, SEBI’s vision is to evolve this market with 
new products and new categories of participants leading 
to better liquidity thus facilitating fair price discovery for 
the  benefit  of  stakeholders.  In  this  regard,  the  recent 
initiative  of  Government  in  setting  up  the  National 
Agricultural  Market  (NAM)  -  a  pan  India  electronic 
trading  portal  networking  the  existing  APMC  markets, 
so as to create a unified national market for agricultural 
commodities  will  go  a  long  way  in  streamlining  the 
underlying market and enabling uniform spot prices.

It  has  been  SEBI’s  continuous  endeavour  to  reach  out 
to  the  largest  number  of  people.  We  continued  our 
journey  to  increase  our  presence  pan-India  and  have, 
in  this  year,  opened  local  offices  in  Raipur  and  Patna. 
Local  offices  serve  to  bring  physical  proximity  of  SEBI 
Offices  to  the  investors  and  intermediaries.  They  also 
facilitate  the  redressal  of  investor  grievances  against 
listed  companies  and  securities  market  intermediaries 
apart  from  spreading  investor  education  and  financial 
literacy. We  also  carried  out  a  comprehensive  investor 
survey during the year to reach out to retail participants 
directly  and  gauge  their  experiences  vis-à-vis  the 
securities market first-hand. 

With  firm  and  steady  steps,  SEBI  will  ensure  that  in 
coming  years,  commodities  derivatives    market  is  at 
par  with  securities  market  in  all  aspects  –  technology, 
new  products  and  participants,  risk  management, 
regulations, 
investor 
supervision, 
protection and enforcement.

surveillance, 

Recognising  the  problems  faced  by  banks  in  ever 
growing NPAs, SEBI assisted the Reserve Bank of India in 
formulating the strategic Restructuring of Debt Scheme, 
whereby banks can acquire equity in lieu of debt. On its 
part, SEBI liberalized its regulatory framework so as to 
facilitate successful implementation of the scheme. 

One  of  the  major  tasks  of  the  securities  market  is  to 
help raise investible resources for the industry. Towards 
this end, SEBI has taken several initiatives. The recently 
established  framework  of  REITs  and  InvITs  will  help 
unlock  capital  tied  into  real  estate  and  infrastructure 
projects.  In  a  similar  vein,  SEBI  is  recognising  the 
difficulties  faced  by  start-ups  in  getting  listed  due  to 
their peculiar circumstances. It has created a specialised 
institutional platform to address their concerns. Existing 
primary  markets  have  been  made  more  progressive. 
Measures  such  as  a  framework  for  e-IPO  endeavor  to 
reduce the gap between closure of an issue to listing/
trading to as little as six days from the existing 12 days. 
Further,  having  recognized  that  state  municipalities 
play  a  major  role  in  creating  infrastructure  and  the 
concomitant need for an active municipal bond market, 
SEBI has announced the norms for municipal bonds in 
India. 

An investor is the most important person in the securities 
market. The lengthy disclosures in offer documents are 
for her benefit. Yet, at times, such disclosures seem to act 
as  a  barrier  to  communication  and  informed  decision 
making.  Even  the  abridged  prospectus,  sometimes 
runs  into  60-70  pages. Therefore,  during  the  year  SEBI 
created a format that limits its length to ten pages. This 
has  attracted  global  attention  so  much  so  that  even 
the  regulatory  authorities  in  European  markets  are 
considering a similar proposal. 

In the process of discharging its functions, SEBI has to 
necessarily  ask  for  more  and  more  disclosures.  This 
increases  the  compliance  burden  of  companies  and 
market  participants.  SEBI  has  taken  an  initiative  to 
reduce the compliance burden through system driven 
disclosures.  Not  only  at  home,  SEBI  enthusiastically 
also helped the international community of regulators 
as  well.  During  2015-16,  SEBI  contributed  significantly 
to  the  revision  of  OECD’s  principles  of  corporate 
governance.  

In  this  ever  changing  global  financial 
landscape, 
financial  markets  too  are  evolving,  growing  and 
getting  more  complex.  To  effectively  regulate  these 
markets  regulators  and  policymakers  also  need  to  be 
proactive,  keep  themselves  updated  and  upgraded.  
Over  a  period  of  time,  SEBI  has  strengthened  both  its 
regulatory purview and internal capacity to ensure that 
the interests of the investors are well protected. Efforts 
are under way to deepen the corporate bonds market, 
widen  the  penetration  of  mutual  funds  across  the 
country  and  strengthening  the  commodities  market.  I 
am sure that with the efforts of the government and of 
policymakers, the Indian financial market will ascend to 
newer heights.

financial 
turbulence.  There  has  been  an  unusual 
economic 
volatility 
environment. Activity softened toward the end of 
2015 in advanced economies and stresses in several 
large emerging market economies showed no signs 
of abating. Markets have begun to swing on fears 
that  the  global  recovery  may  be  faltering,  while 
risks of extreme events are rising. Adding to these 
headwinds  are  concerns  about  the  global  impact 
of the transition in China’s economy as it shifts to 
a  more  moderate  growth  path  after  a  decade  of 
strong  credit  and  investment  growth,  along  with 
signs  of  distress  in  other  large  emerging  markets, 
including  from  falling  commodity  prices.  Amidst 
this gloomy landscape, India stands out as a haven 
of  stability.  India’s  macro-economy  is  stable  with 
economic  growth  being  one  of  the  highest  in  the 
world, coupled with the government’s commitment 
to  fiscal  consolidation  and  low  inflation.  In  its 
Staff  Report  for  the  2016  Article  IV  Consultation, 

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that 
India’s  financial  system  is  generally  sound  and 
recommended that efforts should continue to build 
on its commendable progress in financial inclusion, 
underpinned  by  new  technologies  and  expanding 
the range of financial services.
In  a  move  seen  as  unanimous  recognition

the mandate to promote the development of, and to 
regulate the commodity derivatives market in India 
since September 28, 2015. Adding these dimensions

 REVIEW  OF  THE  GENERAL  ECONOMIC  ENVIRONMENT  AND  THE 
INVESTMENT CLIMATE

I. 

GLOBAL ECONOMY: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

 
The  global  economic  recovery  in  2015-16 
remained  at  an  ever  slowing  and  increasingly 
fragile pace. Recovery in advanced economies was 
still hampered by the legacies of the global financial 
crisis, low growth in productivity and unfavourable 
demographic developments. Major macroeconomic 
realignments  are  affecting  prospects  differentially 
across  countries  and  regions.  These  include  the 
slowdown  and  rebalancing  in  China;  a  further 
decline in commodity prices, especially for oil, with 
sizable  redistributive  consequences  across  sectors 
and  countries;  a  related  slowdown  in  investment 
and trade; and declining capital flows to emerging 
markets  and  developing  economies.  The  world 
output was projected to have grown by 3.1 percent 
in  2015  (3.4  percent  in  2014)  with  the  advanced 
economies  growing  by  1.9  per  cent  (1.8  per  cent 
in  2014),  the  emerging  market  and  developing 
economies (EMDEs) by 4.0 per cent (4.6 per cent in 
2014) and the emerging and developing Asia by 6.6 
per cent (6.8 per cent in 2014); 2015, thus, marked 
the  fifth  consecutive  year  of  declining  growth  for 
EMDEs. 
 
In  the  United  States,  in  spite  of  overall 
improvement in labour market conditions, economic 
growth  weakened  with  weaker  external  as  well  as 
domestic  demand  and  a  decline  in  non-residential 
investments.  The  euro  area  recovered  on  the  back 
of  strengthening  domestic  demand,  while  Japan 
continued  to  reel  from  a  sharp  drop  in  private 
consumption.  Concerns  heightened  during  2015 
about the unwinding of prior excesses in China as 
it transitioned to a more balanced growth path, the 
recession in Brazil and Russia and weaker terms of 
trade  and  tighter  external  financial  conditions  in 
many of the oil exporting countries. As per the IMF 
estimates, in 2015, the United States is projected to 
have grown by 2.4 per cent (2.4 per cent in 2014), the 
euro area by 1.6 per cent (0.9 per cent in 2014), Japan 

by 0.5 per cent (0.0 per cent in 2014), China by 6.9 per 
cent (7.3 per cent in 2014), while Brazil registered a 
decline in output of 3.8 per cent (growth of 0.1 per 
cent in 2014) and Russia too shrunk by 3.7 per cent 
(growth of 0.7 per cent in 2014) (Table 1.1). 

 
The  sharp  fall  in  commodity  prices  brought 
about  headline  inflation  in  advanced  economies 
of  0.3  per  cent  in  2015  (1.4  per  cent  in  2014),  the 
lowest  since  the  global  financial  crisis.  Lower  oil 
and commodity prices exerted downward pressure 
on  inflation  in  many  EMEs,  though  inflation  rose 
in  some  countries  like  Brazil  and  Russia  due  to 
sizable currency depreciations. On average, inflation 
hovered  at  4.7  per  cent  in  EMDEs  in  2015  (4.7  per 
cent in 2014).

Concerns about lack of policy space in advanced 
economies  to  respond  to  a  potential  worsening  in 
the  outlook,  the  impact  of  very  low  oil  prices  and 
the slowdown in China triggered volatility in global 
financial  markets  in  2015.  The  IMF  attributed  the 
market  turbulence  largely  to  concerns  regarding 
the prospects of the financial sector relating to fears

the European Central Bank (ECB) moved further in 
following  an  unconventional  monetary  policy.  The 
Bank of Japan (BoJ) introduced a negative interest rate 
on marginal excess reserves in January 2016. Many of 
the commodity exporting EMDEs raised policy rates 
in 2015 to rein in currency depreciation and associated 
changes in inflation and inflation expectations.

 THE 
INDIAN 
DEVELOPMENTS

ECONOMY:  RECENT 

 
A number of international as well as national 
agencies have described India’s growth in 2015-16 to 
be ‘haven of stability’, ‘bright shining star’, ‘a silver 
lining’. These achievements are remarkable not least 
because they have been accomplished in the face of 
global  headwinds  and  a  second  successive  season 
of poor rainfall. During 2015-16, the Government of 
India (GoI) implemented a number of useful reforms, 
each incremental but collectively effective, to boost 
India’s growth. Most noteworthy among them were 
transparency in governance, autonomy of regulatory 
bodies, the Make in India programme, liberalisation 
of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  norms,  easing 
the  cost  of  doing  business,  launching  of  the  Start-
Up India Scheme, stability and predictability in tax 
decisions,  creation  of  the  National  Investment  and 
Infrastructure Fund, the Jan Dhan Yojana, licensing 
of  payment  banks  and  small  finance  banks, 
advancing  the  JAM  (Jan  Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) 
agenda  and  power  sector  reforms.  As  a  result,  the 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

Indian economy continued to consolidate the gains 
achieved in restoring macroeconomic stability. The 
World  Bank’s  South  Asia  Economic  Focus,  Spring 
2016,  noted  that  India  made  the  most  dramatic 
strides in reducing its macro vulnerabilities. While 
in 2012 India was the most vulnerable of the EMEs, 
since  2013  its  index  has  improved  by  5.3  per  cent 
points compared to 0.4 per cent for all countries in 
India’s investment grade (classification of BBB by the 
Fitch Ratings Agency). 

A.  GROWTH

 
The Indian economy is estimated to have grown 
by 7.6 per cent during 2015–16, on top of a growth of 
7.2 per cent in 2014-15. The rate of growth in gross 
value added (GVA) at basic prices was 7.2 per cent 
during 2015-16 (7.1 per cent during 2014-15) (Table 
1.2 and Chart 1.1). IMF has estimated that the Indian 
economy grew by 7.3 per cent in 2015 (7.2 per cent in 
2014). The World Bank has also estimated the rate of 
growth of the Indian economy to be 7.3 per cent in 
2015 (7.3 per cent in 2014). The Asian Development 
Bank estimated that the Indian economy grew by 7.6 
per cent in 2015 (7.2 per cent in 2014). 

 
India’s  growth  story  has  largely  remained 
positive on the strength of domestic absorption. The 
significant  increase  in  the  growth  of  government 
consumption  expenditure  in  2014-15  got  corrected 
in  2015-16.  There  was  a  pick-up  in  the  growth  of 
fixed  capital  formation,  boosted  by  the  growth  in 
capital goods. While the growth in valuables added 
to  domestic  growth,  a  substantial  decline  in  global 
demand for India’s exports dragged domestic growth. 

 
A Rational Investors Ratings Index, combining 
growth and the macroeconomic vulnerability index 
to proxy for rewards and risk respectively, has been 
presented  in  the  Economic  Survey  2015-16.  India 
performed well not only in terms of the change in the 
index but also in terms of the level, which compared 
favourably to its peers in the BBB investment grade 
and even it betters in A grade.

B.  AGRICULTURE

 
GVA  in  the  ‘agriculture,  forestry  and  fishing’ 
sector  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  1.2  per  cent 
during  2015-16  as  against  a  contraction  of  0.2  per 
cent during the previous year. During 2015-16, the 
south-west  monsoon  and  the  north-east  monsoon 
had  registered  a  deficit  of  14  per  cent  and  23  per 
cent respectively relative to the long period average, 
while  there  was  cyclonic  weather  and  excess 
precipitation in Tamil Nadu. The deficiency as well 
as the highly skewed spatial distribution affected the 
sowing  of  crops.  The  production  of  food  grains  is 
forecast to have declined by 0.5 per cent (decline of 
4.9 per cent during 2014-15). The stock of food grains 
acted as an important buffer. On January 13, 2016, 
the  Fasal  Bima  Yojana  was  announced  to  provide 
full insurance against crop loss on account of natural 
calamities. While production of oilseeds is expected 

to have declined by 4.1 per cent (decline of 16.0 per 
cent during 2014-15) that of fruits and vegetables is 
expected to have increased by 0.6 per cent (1.7 per 
cent  during  2014-15).  Agriculture  accounted  for  
15.4 per cent of GVA during 2015-16.  

C. 

INDUSTRY 

in 

Growth 

 
industry  accelerated  during 
2015-16  on  the  strength  of  the  improvements  in 
manufacturing  activity.  The  growth  in  GVA  for 
2015-16  for  the  manufacturing  sector  is  forecast  to 
be  9.3  per  cent  (5.5  per  cent  during  2014-15).  The 
private corporate sector is estimated to have grown 
by  9.9  per  cent  during  April-December  2015.  The 
Index  of  Industrial  Production  (IIP)  shows  that 
manufacturing  sector  grew  by  2  per  cent  during 
April 2015-March 2016, slightly slower than the rate 
during  the  corresponding  period  in  the  previous

(Table  1.4).  The  on-going  manufacturing 
recovery  in  2015-16  was  aided  by  robust  growth  in 
petroleum  refining,  automobiles,  wearing  apparels, 
chemicals,  electrical  machinery  and  wood  products 
and  furniture.  The  mining  segment  witnessed  

2.2  per  cent  growth  during  2015-16  (1.4  per  cent 
during the corresponding period last year). There was 
a  deceleration  in  growth  in  the  electricity  segment 
to  5.6  per  cent  during  April  2015-March  2016  (8.4  
per cent during the corresponding period last year).

According  to  the  United  Nations  Industrial 
 
Development  Organisation  (UNIDO),  in  India  the 
manufacturing  value  added  grew  by  7.6  per  cent 
in 2015. Thus it ranked sixth among the world’s ten 
largest manufacturing countries. 

D.  SERVICES

 
The  growth  in  GVA  in  the  services  sector 
decelerated to 8.2 per cent during the year (9.4 per cent 
in 2014-15). Among the services sector, construction 
is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  3.9  per  cent  during 
2015-16, trade, hotels, transport and communication 
by  9.0  per  cent,  financial,  insurance,  real  estate  and 
professional  services  by  10.3  per  cent  and  public 
administration and defence and other services by 6.6 
per cent. In the construction sector, the production of 
cement decelerated, while the consumption of finished 
steel  accelerated.  The  services  sector  accounted  for 
61.87 per cent of the GVA for 2015-16.  

E. 

SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS

 
During  2014-15,  gross  saving  has  been 
estimated as ` 41.17 lakh crore (` 37.25 lakh crore 
during 2013-14). The rate of gross savings to gross 

national disposable income for 2014-15 stood at 32.3 
per cent, the same level as in 2013-14. The rate of 
gross saving to GDP stood at 33.0 per cent for 2014-
15,  the  same  level  as  in  2013-14  (Table  1.5).  Even 
with  a  decline  in  its  share,  the  household  sector 
continued  to  be  the  highest  contributor  to  gross 
saving. A decline in household savings in physical 
assets resulted in the share of the household sector in 
gross saving falling to 57.8 per cent in 2014-15 (63.4 
per cent in 2013-14). The share of the non-financial 
corporations  and  financial  corporations  stood  at 
37.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively in 2014-
15  (32.7  per  cent  and  7.9  per  cent  respectively,  in 
2013-14). The dis-saving of the general government, 
on the other hand decreased to 3.2 per cent in 2014-
15 (4.0 per cent in 2013-14). 

 
The gross capital formation at current prices is 
estimated at  ` 42.76 lakh crore for 2014-15 (` 39.12 
lakh crore during 2013-14). The rate of GCF to GDP 
declined  from  34.7  per  cent  during  2013-14  to  34.2 
per cent during 2014-15. The rate of capital formation 
from 2011-12 to 2014-15 was higher than the rate of 
saving because of net capital inflows from the rest of 
the world (ROW).

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 

 
India’s  trade  deficit  narrowed  to  US$  105.6 
billion  in  April-December  2015  from  US$  112.4 
billion during the same period in 2014-15. Aided by 
a contraction in the trade deficit, the current account 
deficit  (CAD)  on  a  cumulative  basis  narrowed  to  
1.4  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2015  (April-December) 
from  1.7  per  cent  in  the  corresponding  period  of  

2014-15.  Net  FDI  inflows  during  April-December 
2015 rose sharply by 24.8 per cent over those in the 
corresponding period in the previous year. However, 
due  to  a  downfall  in  global  demand,  exports  have 
continuously  decreased  during  each  successive 
month of 2015-16 which may be a cause for concern 
in  the  long  term. According  to  a  report  from  ‘FDI 
Intelligence’,  a  data  division  of  the  Financial Times,

London,  in  2015  India  was  the  highest  ranked 
country  by  greenfield  capital  investments.  With 
US$ 63 billion in FDI in 697 projects, India knocked 
China  from  the  FDI  top  spot.    Foreign  portfolio 
investments, however, witnessed a net outflow US$ 
3.4 billion during April-December 2015 (a net inflow 
of  US$  28.5  billion  during  April-December  2014). 
During  April-December  2015,  the  level  of  foreign 
exchange reserves (on a BoP basis) went up by US$ 
14.6 billion. The IMF, in its Staff Report for the 2016 
Article IV Consultation, observed that due to further 
reduced  external  vulnerabilities,  improved  growth 
prospects and continued monetary accommodation 
in  advanced  economies,  India  experienced  large 
foreign direct investments (FDI) and portfolio capital 
inflows  and  a  robust  rebound  in  foreign  exchange 
reserves during 2014-15.

FISCAL DEFICIT
G. 
 
Union  Budget  2016-17  has  reiterated  the 
commitment of the Government of India to adhere 
to fiscal prudence and to stick to fiscal targets. The 
fiscal deficit in 2015-16 (Revised Estimates) and 2016-
17 (Budget Estimates) has been retained at 3.9 and 
3.5 per cent, respectively. The Union Budget 2016-17 
noted that the governments at the Centre and in the 
states  have  made  rapid  progress  under  the  Fiscal 
Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  Act,  2003 
(FRBM  Act).  At  the  same  time,  the  Union  Budget 
2016-17  underscores  the  need  for  fiscal-monetary 

coordination  and  the  advantage  of  having  a  fiscal 
deficit  range  as  a  target  which  will  give  necessary 
policy  space  to  the  government  to  deal  with 
dynamic  situations.  The  Government  of  India  has,  
accordingly,  proposed 
the  constitution  of  a  
committee  to  review  the  implementation  of  the 
FRBM Act and to give its recommendations for the 
way forward. 

EXCHANGE RATE
The 

H. 
 
foreign  exchange  market  remained 
orderly  owing  to  the  appropriateness  of  the 
policy  mix  by  the  authorities.  The  refining  and 
rationalisation  of  foreign  exchange  regulations 
contributed  to  the  widening  and  deepening  of 
the  foreign  exchange  market,  while  simplifying 
the  documentation  requirements  and  increasing 
the  participation  in  both  over-the-counter  and 
exchange  traded  currency  derivatives  aimed  at 
deepening  the  derivatives  markets.  The  foreign 
investment measures were simplified so as to make 
it  more  user-friendly  both  for  domestic  firms  and 
foreign investors. During 2015-16, the Indian rupee 
touched  a  low  of  68.8  (February  26,  2016)  against 
the US$ and a high of 62.2 (April 06, 2015) against 
the  US$.  The  Indian  rupee  closed  at  66.3  against 
the US$ on March 31, 2016. During the year, Forex 
reserves have increased considerably by about US$ 
17 billion. The reserves were recorded at US$ 359.8 
billion as on April 01, 2016.

 REVIEW OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

 
The  reform  of  the  Indian  securities  market 
continues  to  be  top  priority  in  top  gear  for  the 
Government of India. 2015-16 saw the merger of the 
Forward Markets Commission with SEBI. 

SEBI 

initiated  a  host  of  policies  and  

 
programmes during 2015-16 with the objectives of:
 

(i) 

 protecting  the  interests  of  investors  in 
securities; 
 promoting 
securities market; and 
 regulating the securities market.

the 

 

 

(ii) 

(iii) 

This section presents a brief review of SEBI’s 

 
policies and programmes during 2015-16.

The policies and programmes are categorised 
 
under  eight  major  heads:  Primary  Securities 
Market,  Secondary  Securities  Market,  Commodity 
Derivatives Market, Mutual Funds, Intermediaries 
Associated  with  the  Securities  Market,  Foreign 
Portfolio  Investors,  Corporate  Debt  Market  and 
Other  Policies  and  Programmes  having  a  Bearing 
on the Working of the Securities Market. 

I. 

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

of 

the 

confidence 

 
SEBI has been adopting various measures to 
make the primary securities market more efficient 
and  vibrant.  A  healthy  and  regulated  primary  
market 
is  vital  for  mobilising  capital  while 
maintaining 
issuers, 
intermediaries and investors. In order to keep pace 
with  the  changing  economic  environment  and  to 
address  concerns  of  various  market  participants, 
especially  issuers  and  the  investing  community, 
regulations  governing  the  primary  market  have 
been  amended  from  time  to  time.  Such  steps  are 
intended  to  facilitate  easy  capital  mobilisation 
by  industry  while  ensuring  adequate  investor 
protection.

A. 

 Strengthening  the  Continuous  Disclosure 
Requirements for Listed Entities
 
It  was  observed  that  the  level  of  disclosures 
varied  amongst  listed  entities,  which  many  a  time 
resulted in such disclosures adhering to the letter but 
not to the spirit of the disclosure requirements thus 
leading  to  asymmetric  information  with  different 
types of investors. To address these concerns, provide 
guidance  and  improve  the  compliance  culture, 
continuous disclosure requirements were amended. 
 
The  regulatory  requirements  now  divide  the 
events  that  need  to  be  disclosed  by  listed  entities 
broadly  into  two  categories  ---  those  that  have  to 
be  necessarily  disclosed  without  applying  any  test 
of  materiality  and  those  that  should  be  disclosed 
if  considered  material  by  the  listed  entity.  For 
providing  guidance,  the  listing  regulations  now 
also include criteria for determining the materiality 
of  the  events/information.  A  listed  entity  is  also 
required to frame a policy for the determination of 
the materiality, based on the criteria specified which 
has  to  be  duly  approved  by  its  board  of  directors 
and  publicly  available  by  way  of  disclosure  on  its 
website. An indicative list of the information which 
may be disclosed when an event occurs has also been 
specified.
 
timely  disclosures  while  not 
overburdening listed entities, the regulations provide 
that such disclosures should be made as reasonably 
soon as possible but within a timeframe of 24 hours 
of the occurrence of the event. However, disclosures 
of the outcome of board meetings have to be made 
within 30 minutes of the closure of such meetings.
 
In order to provide continuity in information 
to investors and to meet the essence of continuous 
disclosure  requirements,  Listing  Regulations  now 
provide that material developments with reference 
to an event should continue to be disclosed till such 
time that the event is resolved/closed.

To  ensure

The disclosure requirements specify the details 
that  need  to  be  provided  while  disclosing  various 
events. In case the entity does not disclose any specified 
details, it has to state the reasons for not doing so in 
the disclosure. In case the securities of the listed entity 
are  also  listed  abroad,  parity  in  disclosures  has  to 
be  followed  and,  accordingly,  whatever  is  disclosed 
overseas  has  to  be  simultaneously  disclosed  to  the 
Indian stock exchange(s).   
 
The listed entity has to disclose on its website 
all events/information which are material and such 
information has to be hosted for a minimum period 
of  five  years  or  more  as  per  its  archival  policy  as 
disclosed on its website. The listed entity also has to 
disclose all events or information with respect to its 
subsidiaries which are material for the listed entity.
 
The  listed  entity  has  to  provide  specific 
and  adequate  replies  to  the  queries  of  the  stock 
exchange(s)  with  respect  to  rumours  and  may  on 
its  own  initiative  confirm  or  deny  any  reported 
information to the stock exchange(s).

B. 

 Facilitation of More Issuers to Raise Capital 
through the ‘Fast Track’ Route 
 
In  order  to  enable  more  listed  issuers  to 
raise  further  capital  using  the  fast-track  route,  the 
requirement  of  market  capitalisation  of  the  public 
shareholding  of  the  issuer  has  been  reduced  from  
` 3,000 crore to ` 1,000 crore in case of further public 
offers  (FPOs)  and  to  `  250  crore  in  case  of  rights 
issues,  subject  to  compliance  with  the  following 
additional conditions:

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

v. 

 In case of a rights issue, the promoters shall not 
renounce  their  rights,  except  to  the  extent  of 
renunciation within the promoter group, or for 
the purposes of complying with the minimum 
public shareholding norms;
 Annualised delivery-based trading turnover of 
the equity shares of the issuer is at least 10 per 
cent of the total paid-up capital;
 There  is  no  conflict  of  interest  between  the 
lead  manager  and  the  issuer  or  its  group  or 
its associate company in accordance with the 
applicable regulations;
 Equity  shares  of  the  issuer  have  not  been 
suspended  from  trading  as  a  disciplinary 
measure during the last three years; and
 The  issuer  or  the  promoter  group  or  the 
directors  of  the  issuer  have  not  settled  any 
alleged  violation  of  securities  laws  through 
the consent or the settlement mechanism with 
SEBI  during  the  last  three  years  or  no  quasi-
judicial or court proceedings initiated by SEBI 
has  been  pending  against  the  issuer  or  its 
promoters or its whole time directors.

Introduction of System-Driven Disclosures
C. 
 
SEBI  has  taken  a  major  initiative  for  easing 
the compliance burden of disclosures to be made by 
individuals and companies under SEBI (Substantial 
Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations, 
2011  and  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading) 
Regulations, 2015 with respect to acquisition/holding 
and disposal of shares (Box 1.1). 

Box 1.1: Introduction of System-Driven Disclosures to Eliminate the Possibility of Inadvertent 

Violations by Entities and Reduction of Compliance Burden

SEBI issued guidelines in 2015 regarding system-driven disclosures wherein the onus of disclosure shifted 
from individuals/companies to the securities market infrastructure through integration among depositories, 
exchanges and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs). Initially, the system has been made operational parallel 
to disclosures by individual entities in respect of certain disclosures under SAST and PIT regulations. Once 
it stabilises, it will replace manual disclosure obligations. 
Such a system would aid in eliminating the possibility of inadvertent violations by the entities and would 
help in providing information to investors on timely basis to take investment decisions and would thus 
lead to fairness in the markets.

 Clarity on Re-classification of Promoters into 
the Public Category
 
There  had  been  a  demand  from  market 
participants  for  clarity  with  regard  to  the  re-
classification of promoters into the public category. 
Accordingly, certain provisions were brought in the 
listing regulations. An existing promoter of a listed 
entity may cease to be a promoter and/or re-classify 
itself as public under the following major conditions:
a.  
 

Pursuant to change in promoters:
i. 

to 

 When  a  new  promoter  replaces  the 
previous  promoter  subsequent  to  an 
open  offer  or  in  any  other  manner,  re-
classification  shall  be  permitted  subject 
to the approval of the shareholders in the 
general meeting.
 Shareholders  need 
specifically 
approve whether the outgoing promoter 
can hold any key management personnel 
(KMP)  position  in  the  company.  In  any 
case, the outgoing promoter may not act 
as KMP for a period of more than three 
years from the date of the shareholders’ 
approval.
 The  outgoing  promoter  cannot  hold 
more than 10 per cent of the shares of the 
company.

ii. 

iii. 

Inheritance:
 In case of transmission/succession/inheritance, 
the inheritor shall be classified as a promoter.
 Company not having any identifiable promoter:
 Existing  promoters  may  be  re-classified 
as  public  in  case  the  company  becomes 
professionally  managed  and  does  not  have 
any identifiable promoter. A company will be 
considered as professionally managed for this 
purpose, if:
i. 

 No person or group along with persons 
acting  in  concert  (PACs)  taken  together 
holds  more  than  1  per  cent  of  the 
shares  of  the  company  (including  any 
convertibles/outstanding warrants/ADR/ 
GDR holdings).

can  each  hold  up  to  10  per  cent  of  the 
shares  of  the  company  (including  any 
convertibles/outstanding  warrants 
/ 
ADR / GDR holdings).
 Erstwhile 
their 
relatives  may  hold  the  KMP  position 
in  the  company  only  subject  to  the 
shareholders’ approval and for a period 
not exceeding three years from the date 
of the shareholders’ approval.

and 

 The  outgoing  promoter  shall  not  have 
any special rights through any formal or 
informal arrangements.
 The outgoing promoter shall not, directly 
or  indirectly,  exercise  control  over  the 
affairs of the company.
 Increase in public shareholding pursuant 
to  the  re-classification  of  the  promoters 
may  not  be  counted  towards  achieving 
compliance  with  the  minimum  public 
shareholding  (MPS)  requirements  under 
Rule  19A  of  the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation) Rules, 1957.
 If  any  public  shareholder  seeks  to  re-
classify  itself  as  promoter,  it  shall  be 
required  to  make  an  open  offer  to  the 
shareholders  and  would  not  be  eligible 
for exemption from the said obligation.
 The  event  of 
re-classification  may 
be  disclosed  as  a  material  event  in 
accordance  with  the  listing  agreement/
regulations.

E. 

 Restrictions  on  Wilful  Defaulters  from 
Raising Funds, Taking Over Companies and 
Becoming Market Intermediaries 
 
The Master Circular on ‘Wilful Defaulters’ issued 
by the Reserve Bank of India lays down safeguards to 
be exercised by banks from time to time to contain the 
financial activities of wilful defaulters (Box 1.2).

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

11

Box 1.2: Restrictions of Access to Wilful Defaulters from Accessing Funds from the Public

The Master Circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India defines the term ‘wilful default’ to occur if the 
‘unit’ has, inter-alia, defaulted in meeting its payment obligations or not utilised the finance from the lender 
for the specific purposes for which it was availed or has siphoned off the funds. Further, the Master Circular 
defines the term ‘unit’ to include individuals, juristic persons and all other forms of business enterprises, 
whether incorporated or not.
With the objective of restricting access to capital markets by such wilful defaulters, the following proposals 
have been approved by the Board:
a. 

 No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities/debt securities/non-convertible redeemable 
preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of wilful defaulters. 
However, the company can come out with a rights issue and can raise funds from qualified institutional 
buyers subject to adequate disclosures and certain restrictions.

Restriction of access to wilful defaulters from taking over other companies:
b. 

 Any company or its promoter or its director categorised as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to 
take control over another listed entity. However, if a listed company or its promoter or its director 
is categorised as wilful defaulter, and there is a take-over offer with respect to the listed company, it 
may be allowed to make a competing offer for the listed company in accordance with SEBI takeover 
regulations. 

Restriction of access to wilful defaulters from becoming market intermediaries:
c. 

 The  criteria  for  determining  a  ‘fit  and  proper  person’  in  the  SEBI  Regulations  is  being  amended 
to include the provision that no fresh registration shall be granted to any entity if the entity or its 
promoters or its directors or key managerial personnel, are included in the list of wilful defaulters.

Deemed Public Issues

 Notification of SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 

 
SEBI has prescribed that companies which had 
earlier issued securities to more than 49 but up to 200 
persons  in  a  financial  year  as  permitted  under  the 
Companies Act, 2013, may avoid penal action if they 
provide such investors with an option to surrender 
the securities and get the refund amount at a price 
not less than the amount of the subscription money 
paid along with the interest thereon or the amount 
assured to the investors. This will have to be certified 
by peer reviewed auditors.

 
SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations 
and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2015 
(Listing  Regulations)  on  September  2,  2015,  after 
following the consultation process. A time period of 
90 days has been given for implementing the Listing 
Regulations.  The  salient  features  of  the  Listing 
Regulations are provided in Box 1.3.  

Box 1.3: Consolidation and Streamlining of Listing Requirements for Companies

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations) consolidate 
and streamline the provisions of existing listing agreements for different segments of the capital market 
--equity (including convertibles) issued by the entities listed on the main board of stock exchanges; small 
and medium enterprises listed on the SME exchange and institutional trading platforms; non-convertible 
debt  securities;  non-convertible  redeemable  preference  shares;  Indian  depository  receipts  (IDRs);and 
securitised debt instruments and units of various schemes issued by mutual funds. The Listing Regulations

12

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

have, thus, been structured to provide ease of reference while consolidating all the listing requirements for 
the various types of securities listed on the stock exchanges into one single document.
The Listing Regulations are sub-divided into two parts: (a) substantive provisions incorporated in the main 
body of the Listing Regulations; and (b) procedural requirements provided in the schedules to the Listing 
Regulations.
The salient features of the Listing Regulations are:
a. 

 Guiding Principles: The Listing Regulations provide the broad principles (in line with the IOSCO 
Objectives  and  Principles  of  Securities  Regulation)  for  periodic  disclosures  by  listed  entities  and 
also  incorporate  the  principles  for  corporate  governance  (in  line  with  the  G20/OECD  Principles 
of  Corporate  Governance).  These  principles  underlie  the  specific  requirements  prescribed  in  the 
different chapters of the Listing Regulations. In the event of the absence of any specific requirement 
or if there is ambiguity, these principles will serve to guide the listed entities.
 Common Obligations Applicable to All Listed Entities: Obligations which are common to all the 
listed entities have been enumerated.  These include general obligation of compliance of the listed 
entity, appointment of a common compliance officer, filings on an electronic platform and mandatory 
registration on SCORES.
 Specific  Obligations:  Obligations  which  are  applicable  to  specific  types  of  securities  have  been 
incorporated under separate chapters.
 Obligations of Stock Exchanges and Actions in Case of Default: Stock exchanges have been given the 
responsibility of monitoring compliance or the adequacy/accuracy of compliance with the provisions 
of the Listing Regulations and to take action for non-compliance.
 Ease  of  Reference:  Related  provisions  have  been  aligned  and  provided  in  one  place  for  ease  of 
reference. For example, all clauses dealing with disclosure of events or information which may be 
material or price sensitive which were spread across the listing agreement have been provided as a 
schedule to the Listing Regulations. All disclosures to be made on the website of the listed entity have 
been enumerated in a single place for ease of reference and all requirements pertaining to disclosures 
in the annual report have been combined.
 Streamlining and Segregation of Initial Issuance/Listing Obligations: In order to ensure that there 
is no overlapping or confusion on the applicability of the Listing Regulations, pre-listing requirements 
have been incorporated in respective regulations -- ICDR Regulations, ILDS Regulations, etc.  These 
provisions pertain to allotment of securities, refund and payment of interest, a 1 per cent security 
deposit  (in  case  of  public  issuance),  etc.  Post-listing  requirements  have  been  incorporated  in  the 
Listing Regulations.
 Alignment with the Provisions of the Companies Act, 2013:  Wherever necessary, the provisions of 
the Listing Regulations have been aligned with those of the Companies Act, 2013.
 Listing  Agreement:  A  shortened  version  of  the  listing  agreement  (about  two  pages)  has  been 
prescribed  which  is  required  to  be  signed  by  a  company  getting  its  securities  listed  on  the  stock 
exchanges.  Existing listed entities are required to sign the new listing agreement within six months 
of the notification of the Listing Regulations.

 Exit Opportunity to Shareholders in Case of 
Change in Objects by Issuers

The  Companies  Act,  2013  provides  that  a 
 
company which has raised money from the public 

through  a  prospectus  and  still  has  any  unutilised 
money  so  raised,  will  not  change  its  objects  for 
which  it  raised  the  money  through  a  prospectus 
or  vary  the  terms  of  a  contract  referred  to  in  the 
prospectus unless a special resolution is passed by

the company. The Companies Act, 2013 also provides 
that the dissenting shareholders will be given an exit 
opportunity by the promoters and the shareholders 
having  control  over  the  company  in  such  manner 
and  with  such  conditions  as  may  be  specified  by 
SEBI by making regulations in this behalf. 

 
Accordingly, SEBI has introduced an elaborate 
framework  specifying  conditions  for  the  exit  offer, 
the  parameters  for  pricing,  procedures,  etc.  The 
framework  has  been  made  applicable  for  issues 
which  opened  after  April  01,  2014  and  where  the 
amount to be utilised for the objects for which the 
prospectus was issued is less than 75 per cent of the 

amount raised (including the amount earmarked for 
general corporate purposes as disclosed in the offer 
document), subject to the proposal for the change in 
the objects being dissented against by at least 10 per 
cent of the shareholders.

Streamlining of the Public Issue Process 
I. 
Certain  measures  have  been  introduced  for 
 
reducing  the  post-issue  timeline  for  listing  from 
existing T+12 days to T+6 days, increasing the reach 
of retail investors and reducing the costs involved 
in a public issue of equity shares and convertibles. 
(Box 1.4)

Box 1.4: Reduction of Listing Time Period and Simplification of the Application and Refund Process 

for Investors 

 Presently more than 99.5 per cent of the applications are received from centres where the application 
supported by blocked amount (ASBA) facility is available. Based on an analysis of a few public issues 
in terms of amount, ASBA applications account for 99.90 per cent of the total bid amount received 
from all investors. Considering ASBA’s reach and advantages it is now mandatory for all investors to 
make ASBA applications. 
 Among  its  many  other  significant  advantages,  ASBA  enables  investors  to  give  the  mandate  for 
payment of application money in the application form itself without suffering loss of interest for the 
intervening period. It also obviates the hassle of refund of money by the issuer as per the difference 
in the application amount and the amount for which shares are finally allotted.
 In  order  to  substantially  enhance  the  points  for  submission  of  applications,  registrar  and  share 
transfer agents (RTAs) and depository participants (DPs) will also be allowed to accept application 
forms (both physical as well as on line) and make bids on the stock exchange platform. This will be 
over and above the stock brokers and banks where such facilities are already available.
 The system was made effective for public issues which opened on or after January 01, 2016. 
 The time period for listing of securities has now been reduced from T+12 to T+6.

J. 

 Effective  Utilisation  of  the  Funds  Raised 
through Public Issues 

 
Investigations  into  some  of  the  past  public 
issues revealed that the issue proceeds were utilised 
for  objects  other  than  those  mentioned  in  the 
offer  document,  viz.,  inter-corporate  deposits  and 
diversions to other companies.

 
In  order  to  avoid  the  mis-utilisation  of  issue 
proceeds  and  to  ensure  that  the  issuers  use  the 
issue  proceeds  only  in  bank  deposits  that  are  not 
market  linked,  the  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and 

Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009  have 
been amended. As a result, the net issue proceeds, 
pending  utilisation,  have  to  be  deposited  by  the 
issuers only in scheduled commercial banks.

 Extension  of  the  Applicability  of  Business 
Responsibility Reporting Requirements
SEBI  had 

 
earlier  mandated  business 
responsibility  reporting  (BRR)  requirements  in 
its  annual  reports  for  the  top  100  listed  entities 
based on market capitalisation. The key principles 
which  are  required  to  be  reported  by  the  listed 

14

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

entities 
include  areas  such  as  environmental, 
social  and  economic  responsibilities,  governance 
and  stakeholders’  relationships.  The  applicability 
of  BRR  requirements  has  now  been  extended 
to  the  top  500  listed  entities  based  on  market 
capitalisation as on March 31st of every year. As a 
green initiative, business responsibility reports can 
be made available on the websites of the companies, 
while providing links to the websites in the annual 
reports. 

L. 

 Prompt Dissemination of the Impact of Audit 
Qualifications
 
SEBI has decided to put in place a mechanism 
to review the impact of the qualifications contained in 
audit reports. With the objective of ensuring that the 
impact of the auditor’s qualifications is disseminated 
without  any  delay  and  to  further  streamline  the 
process, the following revised procedures have been 
prescribed: 
i. 

impact  of  all 

 The listed entities will be required to disclose 
the  cumulative 
the  audit 
qualifications on relevant financial items in a 
separate form called the ‘Statement on Impact 
of Audit  Qualifications’.  Such  disclosure  will 
be  in  a  tabular  form  along  with  the  annual 
audited  financial  results  filed  in  terms  of  the 
Listing Regulations. 
 The management will have the right to give its 
views on the audit qualifications.  
 The existing requirement of adjustment in the 

ii.

books of accounts of the subsequent year will 
not be necessary. 

The new mechanism is applicable from the financial 
year ended March 2016, as well as for earlier cases.  

M. 

 Allocation  to  Anchor  Investors  in  Public 
Issues Revised

The  restriction  of  a  maximum  number  of  25 
 
anchor  investors  in  a  public  issue  has  been  revised. 
The  requirement  of  the  number  of  anchor  investors 
for allocation of up to `  250 crore remains the same. 
In case of allocation beyond ` 250 crore, there can be 
ten  additional  anchor  investors  for  every  additional 
allocation of ` 250 crore subject to a minimum allotment 
of  `5  crore  per  anchor  investor.  This  step  will  help 
issuers who intend to raise large amounts of funds. 

N. 

 Introduction  of  an  Institutional  Trading 
Platform 

listing  of  companies, 

SEBI has introduced a rationalised framework 
 
including  start-
for  the 
ups,  on  the  ‘Institutional  Trading  Platform’;  vide 
amendments carried out to the SEBI (Issue of Capital 
and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009. 
Various  consequential  amendments  to  other  SEBI 
regulations pertaining to takeovers, listing, delisting 
and AIFs have also been undertaken in this regard. 
A number of relaxations in regulatory requirements 
were  introduced  enabling  companies,  including 
start-ups,  to  raise  funds  from  the  public  for  their 
projects (Box 1.5).

Box 1.5: Facilitating Capital Raising by Start-Ups

The salient features of the new framework to facilitate capital raising by start-ups introduced after wide 
discussions with market participants are: 
i. 
 

The said platform is accessible to:
a. 

 companies which are intensive in their use of technology, information technology, intellectual 
property, data analytics, biotechnology and nanotechnology to provide products, services or 
business platforms with substantial value addition and with at least 25 per cent of the pre-issue 
capital being held by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) or
any other company in which at least 50 per cent of the pre-issue capital is held by QIBs.

x. 

xi. 

 No person (individually or collectively with persons acting in concert) in such a company shall hold 
25 per cent or more of the post-issue share capital.
 Disclosure  requirements  have  been  rationalised  for  companies  raising  funds  on  this  platform. 
Considering the nature of the business of a company which may list on the said platform, disclosures 
may contain only the broad objects of the issue and there will be no cap on the amount raised for 
general corporate purposes as applicable for the companies listed on the main board. Further, lock-
in requirements of the entire pre-issue capital will be for a much shorter period of only six months 
from the date of allotment uniformly for all the shareholders, subject to certain exemptions to ensure 
liquidity.  
 As standard valuation parameters such as P/E, EPS may not be relevant in the case of many such 
companies, the basis of issue price may include other disclosures (except projections) as deemed fit 
by the issuers.
 Only two categories of investors can access the proposed ITP - (i) Institutional investors (QIBs, along 
with family trusts, systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI and intermediaries registered 
with SEBI, each with a networth of more than ` 500 crore) and (ii) Non-institutional investors (NIIs) 
other than retail individual investors. 
 In case of a public offer, allotment to institutional investors may be on a discretionary basis whereas 
to NIIs it will be on a proportionate basis. Allocation between the two categories will be in the ratio of 
75 and 25 per cent respectively. 
 In case of discretionary allotment to institutional investors, no institutional investor will be allotted 
more than 10per cent of the issue size. All shares allotted on a discretionary basis will be locked-in, in 
line with the requirement for lock-in in the case of the anchor investors, that is, for 30 days.  
 The minimum application size in case of such issues will be ` 10 lakh and the minimum trading lot 
will also be of the same amount. 
 The number of allottees in case of a public offer will be more than 200. 
 The company will have the option to migrate to the main board after three years subject to compliance 
with the eligibility requirements of the stock exchanges. 
 For  Category  I  and  II  AIFs,  which  are  required  under  the  SEBI  (Alternative  Investment  Funds) 
Regulations, 2012 to invest a certain minimum amount in unlisted securities, investments in shares 
of companies listed on this platform may be treated as investments in 'unlisted securities' for the 
purpose of calculating investment limits.
 The same platform will also facilitate capital raising by SMEs.

P. 

 Simplification of the Procedure for Delisting 
by Small Companies

The SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and 
 
Takeovers)  Regulations,  2011  have  been  amended 
to  provide  for  general  exemption  from  open  offer 
obligations arising due to a passive increase in voting 
rights as a result of the expiry of the call notice period 
and the forfeiture of the partly paid-up shares. This 
will ease the procedural difficulties arising out of the 
expiry of the call notice period and the forfeiture of 
the partly paid-up shares.

SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 
 
2009 provide for a simplified procedure for delisting 
by  small  companies  and  also  exempt  them  from 
certain  requirements  as  specified  subject  to  certain 
conditions. One of the conditions stipulates that the 
shares of the company should not have been traded 
during the one year period preceding the date of its 
board  meeting.  This  condition  has  been  modified. 
Henceforth,  even  if  there  has  been  some  trading

However, to protect the interests of investors 
 
it has been specified that the exit price should not be

Rationalisation of the Abridged Prospectus 

 
It was observed that the abridged prospectus 
had  become  voluminous  thereby  defeating  the 
very  purpose  of  having  an  abridged  prospectus. 
With a view to addressing this issue, the disclosure 
requirements  in  the  abridged  prospectus  have 
been  rationalised  in  consultation  with  investor 
associations and market participants (Box 1.6).

Box 1.6: Readability of Abridged Prospectus Improved

The revised requirements for the abridged prospectus have been specified by a circular dated October 30, 
2015. The abridged prospectus has been reduced from 50-60 pages to just ten pages without compromising 
on important disclosures. 
The disclosures in the abridged offer document include details of promoters, business model/overview, 
board of directors, objects of the issue, shareholding pattern, financials on a standalone and consolidated 
basis for the last five years, important internal risk factors, summary of outstanding litigations, claims and 
regulatory actions and the track record of merchant bankers.   
The revised abridged prospectus improves readability and contains relevant information for investors to 
take well informed investment decisions. Also, investors have the option of obtaining the full prospectus 
from market intermediaries associated with the public issue and can also download it from the websites of 
stock exchanges, merchant bankers and SEBI.

 Rationalisation  of  Disclosure  Requirements 
for Issuers 

 
In order to rationalise disclosure requirements 
for all issuers, whether intending to list on the main 
board or the institutional trading platform, it has been 
decided  that  the  disclosures  in  the  offer  document 
with  respect  to  group  companies,  litigations  and 
creditors  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  policy  on 
materiality as defined by the issuer. However, all the 
relevant disclosures will be available on the issuer’s 

website. Also,  product  advertisements  of  an  issuer 
will not be required to give the details of the public/
rights issue.

SEBI  has  issued  guidelines  for  the  disclosure

of  the  promoters.  For  example,  the  reason  may  be 
for the purpose of collateral for the loans taken by 
the company, personal borrowing and a third party 
pledge. Henceforth, the ‘name of the entity in whose 
favour  shares  were  encumbered’  will  also  contain 
the disclosure of the names of both the lender and 
the trustee who may hold the shares directly or on 
behalf of the lender.

W.  

 Streamlining  the  Process  of  Issuance  of 
Observations on Offer Documents 

 
During  the  year,  the  process  of  issuance  of 
observations  on  draft  offer  documents  filed  by 
merchant bankers for raising funds by the companies 
or for takeover of other companies was streamlined. 
The total time taken in the entire process has been 
reduced considerably. There were studies and articles 
published in the media by independent analysts on 
this subject. 

 
The status of processing each offer document, 
clearly indicating the reasons for pendency and also 
whether these were pending with SEBI or with the 
merchant  banker  or  other  regulatory  agency,  was 
displayed  on  the  SEBI  website  on  a  weekly  basis. 
The  responses  were  sent  to  merchant  bankers  in  a 
time  bound  manner,  that  is,  within  30  days.  With 
a  view  to  ensuring  a  higher  level  of  transparency 
and  accountability  within  SEBI,  the  website  also 
mentions that in case any application has remained 
unattended,  the  applicant  should  not  hesitate  to 
approach the senior officials - Chief General Manager 
or the Executive Director of the Corporation Finance 
Department. Their e-mail IDs are also provided on 
the website.

18

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

 
While the process of issuance of observations 
has been expedited, the level of disclosures had also 
been enhanced. As pricing of an issue is an important 
factor  for  investors  to  make  investment  decisions 
merchant bankers were advised to make additional 
disclosures on risks associated with a specific pricing 
of  the  issue  in  pre-issue  advertisements  on  price 
bands. Examples of some of the risk factors which 
need to be disclosed in this respect, their applicability 
depending on each issue are:
i. 

 The  track  record  of  merchant  bankers  in  the 
past  three  years  in  terms  of  issues  handled 
and issues closing below the issue price on the 
listing date. 
 Higher  price  earnings  ratio  of  the  issuer  as 
compared to the average ratio of the industry 
peer group.
 Negative  weighted  average  return  on  net 
worth, negative book value, etc.  
 Losses  incurred  by  the  Issuer  Company  and 
negative earnings per share (EPS).  
 Average cost of acquisition of equity shares for 
promoters  or  other  major  shareholders  if  the 
issue price for public is higher.

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

v. 

 
These  disclosures  are  required  to  be  made 
prominently in the same font size as the price band 
in the advertisements and also on the website of the 
company and the stock exchanges. 

 
This step by SEBI will help common investors 
assess  specific  risk  factors  attendant  to  the  pricing 
of a public issue and take well informed investment 
decisions.

X.   Monitoring of Compliance by Listed Entities

 
During  the  year,  SEBI  further  strengthened 
its  monitoring  of  compliance  by  listed  entities. 
New  listing  regulations  with  better  enforceability 
were  notified  during  the  year.  As  the  number  of 
companies listed on the stock exchanges is very large 
in India, the focus has remained on the introduction 
of a compliance culture among them.  

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

 
SEBI envisaged and implemented four levels of 
monitoring for listed entities by way of regulations 
and guidelines. 
 
At the first level, company secretaries and the 
respective  boards  of  directors  of  the  listed  entities 
will  monitor  the  compliance  of  various  regulatory 
requirements.  Compliance  reports  on  corporate 
governance  and  the  report  of  an  independent 
company  secretary  on  compliance  related  issues 
are now required to be placed before the boards of 
listed entities. The boards are required to review the 
compliance reports as well as corrective steps taken 
in case of any non-compliance.  
 
At the second level, an independent practising 
company secretary will review compliance and will 
certify  the  same  as  required  under  the  provisions 
of  the  Companies  Act,  2013.  The  certification  in 
this regard is published in the annual report of the 
company which, inter-alia, includes the observations 
of the practicing company secretary. As mentioned 
earlier, SEBI has made it mandatory that such reports 
(along  with  the  corrective  steps  taken)  should  be 
placed before their boards.  
 
At  the  third  level,  the  stock  exchanges  will 
monitor  compliance  or  regulatory  requirements  of 
listed  companies.  Based  on  their  monitoring  they 
may  levy  fines,  penalties,  freeze  the  promoters’ 
holdings in the company or suspend trading in the 
securities of the company depending on the level of 
non-compliance. 
 
At  the  fourth  level,  SEBI  will  have  overall 
regulatory oversight on the compliance standards of 
the corporate sector through various reports received 
from the stock exchanges. 
SEBI  repealed  as  many  as  128  circulars 
 
pertaining  to  listing  issued  over  the  years  and  the 
contents  of  these  circulars  have  been  incorporated 
in the newly notified Listing Regulations. SEBI also 
issued  11  circulars  under  the  same  regulations. 
With these circulars, SEBI has enhanced disclosure 
requirements for listed entities and helped the stock 
exchanges  in  monitoring  compliance  by  the  listed 
entities through various filings made by them.

2015-2016

Y.   Compliance of Board Composition

 
SEBI monitored the compliance of composition 
of  boards  of  the  listed  entities  to  ensure  that  they 
had appointed the requisite number of independent 
directors and women directors. 

 
With  regard  to  women  directors,  steps  were 
taken to ensure compliance with the requirement of 
appointing women directors on the boards of listed 
entities. Follow up was done with the listed entities 
and stock exchanges on a regular basis so that they 
appoint women directors before the stipulated time 
period.  SEBI  also  advised  the  stock  exchanges  to 
impose fines depending on the duration of delay in 
compliance by listed entities.  

 
In case of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), 
the matter of non-compliance (by some of them) was 
also taken up with the Government of India.

Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in the standard-
setting process and to convey the concerns/issues of 
the Indian corporate sector for consideration before 
finalisation of the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs).

 
During  2015-16,  the  group  met  three  times 
under  the  chairmanship  of  Mr  Y.  H.  Malegam, 
former managing partner, M/s S.B. Billimoria & Co.

 Requesting stock exchanges for the annulment 
to  be  submitted  within  30  minutes  from  the 
execution of the trade(s). Stock exchanges may 
consider requests received after 30 minutes, but 
no longer than 60 minutes, only in exceptional 
cases.
 The  stock  exchanges  shall  expeditiously,  not 
later  than  the  start  of  the  next  trading  day, 
examine and decide upon such requests.
 As  an  alternate  mechanism,  stock  exchanges 
may consider resetting the price of the trade(s) 
under consideration to an appropriate price(s).
 The  stock  exchanges  shall  undertake  the 
annulment or the price reset only in exceptional 
cases after recording the reasons in writing in 
the interests of the investors, market integrity, 
and  maintaining  the  sanctity  of  the  price 
discovery mechanism.
 Stock  exchanges  shall  convey  their  reasoned 
decisions on the annulment of the trade(s) or 
the price reset to all the counterparties to the 
trade(s) under consideration. Stock exchanges 
will also publish the details of such a decision 
on its website.
 A  mechanism  to  request  a  review  of  the 
decisions  taken  by  stock  exchanges  will  be 
provided. To this end, the aggrieved party has 
to submit such a request to the stock exchange 
before the pay-out deadline of the trades.
 Stock exchanges will charge an application fee 
equal to 5per cent of the value of the trade(s)for 
accepting the annulment request from a stock 
broker, subject to a minimum fee of ` 1 lakh (` 
0.1 million) and maximum fee of ` 10 lakh (` 1 
million).

 Review of the Capacity Planning Framework 
of Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations

 
Being  critical  infrastructure  of  the  securities 
market,  it  is  imperative  for  stock  exchanges  and 
clearing  corporations  to  continuously  assess  and 
monitor  their  system  capacities.  Stock  exchanges 
and  the  clearing  corporations  have  been  advised 
to  ensure  fulfilment  of  the  following  requirements 
while  planning  capacities  of  their  trading,  clearing 
and  settlement  and  risk  management  related 
infrastructure:
i. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

 The  installed  capacity  has  to  be  at  least  1.5 
times (1.5x) of the projected peak load.
 The projected peak load will be calculated for 
the next 60 days based on the per-second peak 
load trend of the past 180 days.
 All  the  systems  in  the  trading,  clearing  and 
settlement ecosystem will be considered in this

 Co-location/Proximity  Hosting 
Offered by Stock Exchanges

Facility 

 
SEBI has issued guidelines for stock exchanges 
on  co-location/proximity  hosting  to  ensure  fair, 
transparent  and  equitable  access  to  the  co-location 
facility wherein the stock exchanges are required to:
 Ensure that all the participants who avail of the 
i 
co-location/proximity hosting facility have fair 
and equal access to the facilities and the data 
feeds provided by the stock exchange.
 Ensure that all stock brokers and data vendors 
using co-location/proximity hosting experience 
similar  latency  with  respect  to  the  exchange 
provided infrastructure.
 Ensure that the size of the co-located/proximity 
hosting space is sufficient to accommodate all

the  stock  brokers  and  data  vendors  who  are 
desirous of availing the facility.
 Provide  flexibility  to  avail  rack  space  in  the 
co-location/proximity  hosting  so  as  to  meet 
the needs of all the stock brokers desirous of 
availing such a facility.
 Facilitate the stock brokers to receive data feeds 
from other recognised stock exchanges at the 
co-location  facilities  and  allow  the  routing  of 
the orders to other recognised stock exchanges 
from the co-location facility.
 Publish  suitable  quarterly  reports  on  the 
latencies  observed  at  the  exchange  on  their 
websites.
 Ensure that the facility of co-location/proximity 
hosting does not compromise the integrity and 
the security of the data and trading systems.

 Cyber  Security  and  Cyber  Resilience 
Frameworks  of  Stock  Exchanges,  Clearing 
Corporations and Depositories
 
SEBI has laid down a detailed framework with 
regard to cyber security and cyber resilience that stock 
exchanges,  clearing  corporations  and  depositories 
are  required  to  adopt.  The  framework,  inter-alia, 
covers areas such as governance, identifying critical 
assets  and  cyber  risks  (threats  and  vulnerabilities), 
accessing  controls,  physical  security,  network 
security  management,  security  of  data,  hardening 
of hardware and software, application security and 
testing,  patch  management,  disposal  of  systems 
and  storage  devices,  vulnerability  assessment 
and  penetration  testing  (VAPT),  monitoring  and 
detection,  response  and  recovery,  sharing  of 
information, training and periodic audits.

 Review of the Offer for Sale (OFS) of Shares 
through the Stock Exchange Mechanism

 
Offer for sale (OFS) through the stock exchange 
mechanism  is  one  of  the  mechanisms  available 
to  promoters/large  shareholders  for  offloading 
their  shareholdings  in  listed  companies.  Market 
participants have found the OFS mechanism useful

2015-2016

21

as it ensures transparency, wider participation and 
quicker  settlement.  In  order  to  further  streamline 
the  OFS  process  with  the  objective  of  encouraging 
greater participation of all investors including retail 
individual  investors,  the  following  modifications 
have been introduced in the OFS framework:
i. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

v. 

vi. 

 The  seller  will  notify  the  stock  exchanges  its 
intention of the sale of shares latest by 5:00 pm 
on the T-1 day (T day being the day of the OFS). 
The  stock  exchanges  will  inform  the  market 
immediately on receipt of such a notice. 
 On the commencement of OFS on T day, only 
non-retail investors will be permitted to place 
their bids. The cut-off price will be determined 
based on the bids received on T day as per the 
extant guidelines. 
 Retail  individual  investors  will  bid  on  T+ 
1  day  and  they  may  place  a  price  bid  or  opt 
for bidding at the cut-off price. The seller will 
make appropriate disclosures in this regard in 
the OFS notice. 
 The  settlement  for  bids  received  on  T+1  will 
take place on T+3 days (T+1 day being the trade 
day for retail individual investors). Discount, 
if  any  to  retail  individual  investors,  will  be 
applicable to bids received on T+1 day. 
 In  order  to  ensure  that  the  shares  reserved 
for  retail  individual  investors  do  not  remain 
unallocated  due  to  insufficient  demand  from 
retail  individual  investors,  bids  of  non-retail 
investors will be allowed to be carried forward 
to T+1 day.
 The  unsubscribed  portion  of 
the  shares 
reserved  for  retail  individual  investors  will 
be  allocated  to  non-retail  bidders  (the  un-
allotted bidders on T day, who choose to carry 
forward their bids onto T+1 day) on T+1 day at 
a price equal to the cut-off price or higher as 
per the bids. In this regard, an option will be 
provided to such non-retail bidders to indicate 
their willingness to carry forward their bids to 
T+1 day. If non-retail bidders choose to carry 
forward their bids to T+1 day, they may then be 

permitted to revise such bids. The settlement 
for such bids will take place on T+3 day.

F. 

 Revision  of  the  Activity  Schedule  of  the 
Auction Session

 
In  the  equity  segment  of  stock  exchanges, 
in case of default by the selling broker in a normal 
settlement, the security delivered short is bought in 
the  auction  session  (conducted  on  T+2  day)  and  is 
delivered to the buying broker on T+3 day. With a 
view to facilitating reduction of the time involved in 
delivering the shares to the buying broker in case of 
default  by  the  selling  broker  clearing  corporations 
have been  provided the flexibility to decide the time 
for conducting the settlement of the auction session 
on or before T+3 day. Thus, the activity schedule for 
conducting the settlement of the auction session and 
the close-out has been revised as:

Auction session

By T+3

G. 

 Review of the Minimum Contract Size in the 
Equity Derivatives Segment

 
The requirement of the minimum contract size 
of  ` 2 lakh (` 0.2 million) in the equity derivatives 
segment  has  been  reviewed  and  increased  to  `  5 
lakh  (`  0.5  million).  Further,  the  mechanism  to  fix 
the trading lot of the derivatives contracts has been 
modified to give flexibility to stock exchanges to set 
the lot size in such a manner that the contract value 
of the derivatives on the day of the review is within 
` 5 lakh (` 0.5 million) and ` 10 lakh (` 1 million).

 Introduction  of  Exchange  Traded  Cash 
Settled Interest Rate Futures (IRF) on 6-Year 
and 13-Year Government of India Security

 
SEBI had earlier prescribed a framework for 
stock  exchanges  to  launch  cash  settled  interest 
rate  futures  (IRFs)  on  Government  of  India  (GoI) 
securities having a residual maturity between nine 

22

SEBI Annual Report

and 11 years as on the day of the expiry of the IRF 
contract. In order to provide hedging instruments 
for  managing  the  interest  rate  exposure  across 
different  maturities  and  to  further  enhance  the 
depth  and  the  liquidity  in  the  underlying  bond 
market,  SEBI  permitted  the  stock  exchanges  to 
introduce  cash  settled  IRFs  on  6-year  (residual 
maturity between four and nine years) and 13-year 
(residual  maturity  between  11  and  15  years)  GoI 
securities. Effectively, the stock exchanges are now 
permitted to launch IRF contracts on GoI securities 
with a residual maturity between four and 15 years 
as on the day of the expiry of the IRF contract. 

 
Additionally,  SEBI  has  also  permitted  the 
stock  exchanges  to  introduce  three  quarterly 
contracts of the March/June/September/December 
cycle  in  addition  to  the  three  serial  monthly 
contracts  of 
IRFs.  This  will  enable  market 
participants  to  take  a  longer-term  view  on  the 
movement of interest rates.

uniformity  in  the  matter  of  obtaining  information 
from them in the areas of, inter-alia, administration, 
clearing and settlement related activities, net worth 
and  shareholding,  SEBI  advised  the 
  clearing

M.  Risk Management Policy at the Depositories

 
Based on the recommendations of Depository 
Systems  Review  Committee  (DSRC),  depositories 
were  advised  to  establish  a  clear,  comprehensive 
and well documented risk management framework 
which should include:
i. 

 An  integrated  and  comprehensive  view  of 
the  risks  to  the  depository,  including  those 
emanating  from  participants,  participants’ 
clients and third parties to whom activities are 
outsourced, etc.; 
 List  out  all  the  relevant  risks,  including 
technological, legal, operational, custodial and 
general business risks and the ways and means 
to address them; 
 Systems,  policies  and  procedures  to  identify, 
assess, monitor and manage the risks that arise 
in or are borne by the depository; 
 The depository’s risk-tolerance policy; and
 Responsibilities  and  accountability  for  risk 
decisions  and  decision  making  processes  in 
crises and emergencies.

N.  Review of Annual Custody/Issuer Charges
 
the  dual  objective  of  promoting 
financial  inclusion  and  expanding  the  reach  of 
depository services to Tier II and Tier III towns, the 

Depository  Systems  Review  Committee  (DSRC) 
has  recommended  that  the  revenue  sources  of  the 
depositories  may  be  augmented  and  depository 
participants  (DPs)  may  be  incentivised  by  setting 
out  a  revenue  sharing  mechanism  between  the 
depositories  and  DPs.  It  has  also  suggested  that 
annual  issuer  charges  may  be  enhanced  and  the 
incremental  revenue  be  shared  suitably  by  the 
depositories  with  their  DPs  for  promoting  basic 
services  demat  accounts  (BSDAs)  and  for  opening 
new accounts in Tier II and Tier III towns. 
Based on DSRC’s recommendations, per folio 
 
charges were revised from ` 8.00 to ` 11.00, subject 
to  a  certain  minimum  amount.  Further,  in  order 
to  compensate  DPs  for  the  cost  of  opening  and 
maintaining BSDAs, the depositories were advised 
to pay an incentive of ` 100.00 for every new BSDA 
opened by their DPs in cities other than the Top 15 
ones. 
 
In addition, the depositories were advised to 
pay  `  2  per  folio  per  ISIN  to  the  respective  DP  in 
respect of the International Securities Identification 
Number (ISIN) positions held in BSDA in order to 
incentivise the DPs to promote holdings in BSDAs.

O.  Guidelines on Outsourcing by Depositories
 
Guidelines  on  outsourcing  by  depositories 
have been issued based on DSRC’s recommendations 
wherein the depositories have been advised that the 
core and critical activities of the depositories will not 
be outsourced. Guidelines have also been prescribed 
with  regard  to  due  diligence  while  selecting  a 
third  party  for  outsourcing,  risk  management  and 
monitoring and audit of outsourced activities.

 Facility  for  Basic  Services  Demat  Account

eligible  individuals  with  the  objective  of  achieving 
wider  financial  inclusion  and  for  encouraging  the 
holding  of  demat  accounts.    In  order  to  facilitate 
eligible individuals to avail of the benefits of SDA,

to  continue  to  avail  the  facilities  of  regular  demat 
accounts.

III.  COMMODITY DERIVATIVES MARKET 

Subsequent to the merger of Forwards Market 
 
Commission with SEBI, SEBI undertook various steps 
to  strengthen  and  streamline  the  norms  governing 
commodity derivatives market as well as to on-board 
stakeholders in the commodity derivatives market to 
the regulatory framework of the Securities Contracts 
(Regulation) Act, 1956 (Box 1.7). 

A.  Amendments to Securities Regulations

SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) (Amendment) 
Regulations,  2015  and  SEBI  (Regulatory  Fee  on 
Stock  Exchanges) 
(Amendment)  Regulations, 
2015  were  notified  on  September  08,  2015.  The 
amendments,  which  provide  carve-outs  and 
transitory provisions, were carried out to ensure the 
smooth and undisruptive transition of stakeholders 
in  the  commodity  derivatives  market  from  one 
regulatory framework to another.

Box 1.7: Merger of the Forward Market Commission (FMC) with SEBI

In the Union Budget for FY 2015-16, the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister proposed merger of Forward 
Markets  Commission  (FMC)  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI).  The  merger  was 
supposed to bring convergence of regulations, harnessing economies of scope and economies of scale for 
the exchanges, financial firms, and other stakeholders.
Given SEBI’s expertise in effectively regulating the securities market for more than 25 years and the wider 
powers it has to regulate the markets, it was also expected that under SEBI the commodity derivatives 
market will be brought at par with the securities market in all aspects – technology, new products and 
participants,  regulation/code  of  conduct  for  intermediaries,  risk  management,  regulations,  supervision, 
surveillance, investor protection and the enforcement framework.
Pursuant to Central Government notifications F. No. 1/9/SM/2015 S.O. 2362 (E) and F. No. 1/9/SM/2015 S.O. 
2363 (E) under the powers conferred by Finance Act, 2015, the FMC was merged with SEBI on September 
28, 2015 and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 was amended to include commodity derivatives 
within the definition of securities and Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 (FCRA) was repealed.
To  ensure  smooth  transition  and  merger  process  SEBI  started  working  towards  merger  right  after  the 
announcement by Hon’ble Finance Minister in Union Budget and following steps were taken by SEBI: 
Merger Planning 
• 

 Formation of Commodity Cell and various Committees by posting of senior officials who were given 
dedicated responsibility for preparing road map and successful execution of the merger process and 
also coordination across various departments and entities.

Consultation with International Experts
• 

• 

 To  understand  the  regulatory  framework  for  commodity  derivatives  markets  in  other  countries, 
interaction  was  done  through  teleconferences/video  conferences  with  international  regulators/
exchanges.
 International Advisory Board (IAB) of SEBI was apprised of the progress of the merger process. IAB 
inter alia advised that the emphasis during initial phase of merger should be on avoiding any crisis in 
the market and market development may be visited only after fully understanding the strengths and 
weaknesses of commodities markets

Gap Analysis
• 

 Departments within SEBI carried out the gap analysis of SEBI Regulations/norms in equity/equity 
derivatives market vis-à-vis norms in commodity derivatives markets.
 Necessary  changes  in  various  regulations  especially  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  (Stock 
Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) (Amendment) Regulations, 2015 and SEBI (Stock Brokers and 
Sub-brokers) (Amendment) Regulations, 2015 were brought in.

Organisational Structure
• 

 To  bring  out  the  maximum  benefit  out  of  merger  and  enable  faster  integration  of  work  culture/
Expertise FMC was horizontally merged with SEBI, however,  for focusing on the policy issues in 
Commodity Derivatives market a separate department ‘Commodity Derivatives Market Regulation 
Department (CDMRD)’ was created.
 In other departments such as Market Intermediaries Regulation & Supervision Department (MIRSD), 
Integrated  Surveillance  Department  (ISD),  Investigations  Department  (IVD),  Department  of 
Economic Policy and Analysis (DEPA), Legal Affairs Department (LAD), Enforcement Department 
(EFD) the work related to commodity derivatives market was completely merged at department level 
by creating dedicated divisions.
 The manpower requirement for these new departments/divisions was met by having suitable mix 
of  officers  from  FMC  and  SEBI  to  ensure  continuity  and  expertise  in  regulating  the  commodity 
derivatives market.

Risk Management
• 

 In order to increase robustness and to streamline the Risk management and margining framework 
across National Commodity Derivatives Exchanges, norms were issued by SEBI right after the merger 
which  inter  alia  prescribed  guidelines  for  margin  calculations,  margin  collection,  Base  Minimum 
Capital, acceptable forms of Liquid Asset deposits with appropriate haircuts and concentration limits 
etc. Subsequently, Risk management norms for regional commodity derivatives exchanges were also 
prescribed by SEBI.

Surveillance of commodity derivatives market
• 

 To  bring  the  surveillance  of  the  commodity  derivatives  market  at  par  with  Equity  markets,  data 
acquisition equipment’s were installed and connectivity was established with national commodity 
derivatives exchanges thereby integrating trading data with IMSS (Integrated Market Surveillance 
System) and DWBIS (Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence System) surveillance systems of 
SEBI. Data Integration facilitated in generation of commodity market reports and alerts in DWBIS 
and IMSS systems. 

Capacity Building
• 

 Various  presentations/workshops  were  held  with  FMC/Commodity  Derivatives  Exchanges/
Commodity  Derivatives  Brokers/Market  experts/Consultants  for  understanding  the  nuances  of 
commodity derivatives market and its ecosystem.
 Various teams of SEBI officials visited commodity market ecosystem such as exchanges, warehouses, 
mandis, and vaults etc. to understand the process of deposit, delivery and storage of commodities.
 SEBI officials were also provided training on the commodity derivatives market by market experts.

A  committee  of  experts  has  been  constituted 
under the chairmanship of Professor Ramesh Chand, 
member,  NITI  Aayog,  to  advise  SEBI  for  effectively 
regulating and developing the commodity derivatives 
market.  The  committee  will  advise  SEBI  on  various 
aspects related to the commodity derivatives market, 
which, inter-alia, include measures for improving the 
market structure, market safety, efficiency, transparency, 
aspects  related  to  the  regulation  of  intermediaries, 
investor protection, contract design and new products, 
warehouses and delivery mechanisms and governance 
of commodity derivatives exchanges.
The  Commodity  Derivatives  Advisory 
 
Committee 
for 
interaction and deliberation on issues related to the 
commodity derivatives market. It acts as a platform 
for SEBI to evaluate its regulatory and development 
activities.  During  2015-16,  CDAC  met  on  March 
04,  2016  to  discuss  various  issues  concerning  the 
commodity derivatives market.

IV.  MUTUAL FUNDS

A. 

 Modification of Product Labelling in Mutual 
Funds 
SEBI  had  earlier  introduced  the  concept  of 
 
product labelling in mutual funds that provided for 
three colour codes to depict low, moderate and high 
levels of risk. SEBI, in consultation with the Mutual 
Fund  Advisory  Committee  (MFAC)  reviewed  the 
system  of  product  labelling  in  mutual  funds  and 
introduced the following changes:
i.  

 The level of risk in mutual fund schemes has 
been increased from three to five as:

Label
Low 
Moderately Low 
Moderate 
Moderately High 
High 

Level of Risk 
Principal at low risk
Principal at moderately low risk
Principal at moderate risk
Principal at moderately high risk
Principal at high risk

28

2015-2016

ii.  

 Depicting  the  risk  using  colour  codes  will 
be  replaced  by  a  pictorial  meter  named 
‘Riskometer’  which  will  appropriately  depict 
the level of risk in any specific scheme.

B.   Stress Testing

 
Stress  testing  has  been  made  mandatory  for 
all  liquid  fund  and  money  market  mutual  fund 
(MMMF) schemes in India in order to strengthen risk 
management practices and for developing a sound 
framework  to  evaluate  potential  vulnerabilities  on 
account of plausible events and for providing early 
warning on the health of the underlying portfolios 
of  liquid  fund  and  MMMF  schemes.  Stress  testing 
guidelines mandate that this should be carried out 
internally at least on a monthly basis and should test 
the impact (on daily NAVs of concerned schemes) of 
risk parameters (among others as deemed necessary 
by  the AMC)  such  as  interest  rate  risk,  credit  risk  
and  liquidity  and  redemption  risk.  Further,  the 
trustees of mutual funds will be required to report 
compliance with these guidelines and steps taken to 
deal with the adverse situations faced, if any, in the 
half-yearly reports submitted by the trustees to SEBI. 

C. 

 Managing/Advising  of  Offshore  Pooled 
Funds by Local Fund Managers 

As  per  earlier  requirements,  a  fund  manager 
 
managing a domestic scheme was allowed to manage 
an off-shore fund, only if, (i) the investment objectives 
and the asset allocation of the domestic scheme and 
the  offshore  fund  were  the  same,  (ii)  atleast  70  per 
cent  of  the  portfolio  was  replicated  across  both  the 
domestic scheme and the off-shore fund, and (iii) the 
off-shore fund was broad-based, that is, there were at 
least 20 investors with no single investor holding more 
than 25 per cent of corpus of the fund. Otherwise, a 
separate fund manager was required to be appointed 
for managing an offshore fund. 

 
SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  have 
been  amended  to  remove  these  restrictions  for 
managing  off-shore  funds  belonging  to  Category 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

I  FPIs  and  appropriately  regulated  broad-based 
Category II FPIs by a local fund manager who is also 
managing a domestic scheme. This will enable local 
fund managers to manage off-shore funds effectively 
and also garner more off-shore business in the future.

D. 

 Investments  by  Gold  ETFs  in  Banks’  Gold 
Monetisation Schemes

 
SEBI had earlier allowed Gold exchange traded 
funds (ETFs) to invest in banks’ gold deposit schemes 
(GDS). RBI has now allowed the Gold Monetisation 
Scheme,  2015  (GMS)  to  replace  GDS.  However, 
deposits  outstanding  under  GDS  will  be  allowed 
to  run  till  maturity  unless  these  are  prematurely 
withdrawn by depositors. Thus, it has been decided 
that GMS will also be designated as a gold related 
instrument in line with banks’ GDS. Investments in 
GMS by Gold ETFs of mutual funds will be subject to 
the following conditions: 
i.  

the  other  conditions  applicable 

 Cumulative investments by Gold ETFs in GDS 
and  GMS  will  not  exceed  20  per  cent  of  the 
total assets under management (AUM) of such 
schemes. 
 All 
to 
investments  in  banks’  GDS  will  also  be 
applicable  to  investments  by  Gold  ETFs  in 
GMS. 
 Existing investments by Gold ETFs of mutual 
funds  under  GDS  will  be  allowed  to  run 
till  maturity  unless  these  are  withdrawn 
prematurely.

 Tightening  Exposure  Limits  on  Investments 
by Mutual Funds
In  order  to  mitigate  the  risks  arising  on 
 
account of the high levels of exposure in the wake 
of  the  events  pertaining  to  credit  downgrades  and 
to  put  mutual  funds  in  a  better  position  to  handle 
adverse credit events, it has been decided to review 
the  restrictions  on  investments  by  mutual  funds 
at  the  single  issuer  level  and  the  sector  level  and 
also  to  introduce  group  level  exposure  limits  for 
investments in debt instruments.

 The  Association  of  Mutual  Funds  in  India 
(AMFI)  will  also  provide  on  its  website  a 
consolidated  list  of  the  investors  across  the 
mutual fund industry in whose folios there are 
unclaimed amounts. The information provided 
therein has to contain the name of the investor, 
the  address  of  the  investor  and  the  name  of

only on providing proper credentials (like PAN 
card, date of birth, etc.), along with adequate 
security control measures being put in place by 
the mutual fund/AMFI.
 The  websites  of  mutual  funds  and  AMFI 
will  also  provide  information  on  the  process 
of  claiming  the  unclaimed  amount  and  the 
necessary forms/documents required for this.
 Further, information on the unclaimed amount 
alongwith  its  prevailing  value  (based  on  the 
income  earned  on  the  deployment  of  such 
an  unclaimed  amount),  will  be  separately 
disclosed 
through  periodic

 With  respect  to  sector  level  and  group  level 
limits, SEBI specified that:  
 The single sector exposure limit was reduced 
from the current 30 per cent of NAV to 25 per 
cent of NAV and the additional exposure limit 
provided  for  HFCs  in  the  finance  sector  was 
reduced from 10 per cent of NAV to 5 per cent 
of NAV.
 Group  level  limits  were  introduced  for  debt 
schemes  wherein  mutual  funds/AMCs  were 
required to ensure that the total exposure of 
the debt schemes of mutual funds to a group 
(excluding investments in the securities issued 
by the PSUs, public financial institutions and 
public  sector  banks)  will  not  exceed  20  per 
cent  of  the  net  assets  of  the  scheme.  Such 
investment limits may be extended to 25 per 
cent of the net assets of the scheme with the 
prior approval of the board of trustees.

 Registration  of  Commodity  Derivatives 
Brokers Pursuant to FMC’s merger with SEBI
 
Pursuant  to  FMC’s  merger  with  SEBI,  the 
supervision and regulation of commodity derivatives 
brokers  has  been  vested  with  SEBI.  Accordingly, 
amendments  have  been  made  to  the  SEBI  (Stock 
Brokers  and  Sub-Brokers)  Regulations,  1992  to 
provide  for  the  regulation  and  the  supervision  of 
commodity derivatives brokers.

Enhanced Supervision
B. 
 
With  a  view  to  re-examining  the  current 
regulatory  and  supervisory  mechanisms  for  the 
protection of clients’ assets in India, SEBI constituted 
a committee on April 17, 2015 to examine this issue 
in  a  holistic  manner  and  recommend  measures  to 
enhance  the  supervision  of  the  stock  brokers.  The 
committee deliberated on various issues pertaining 
to enhanced supervision of stock brokers, including 
augmented disclosures, periodic reconciliations and 
continuous  information  sharing.  The  committee 
finalised eight recommendations:

India to compete with international finance centres 
in  Singapore/Dubai.  This  was  announced  by  the 
Union  Minister  of  Finance  during  his  Budget 
Speech  2015-16.  In  furtherance  of  this  objective, 
the  SEBI  (International  Financial  Services  Centres) 
Guidelines,  2015  were  issued  that  provide  for  an 
enabling  regulatory  framework  for  the  registration 
and  conduct  of  securities  market’s  activities  in  the 
International  Financial  Services  Centre  (IFSC).  The 
guidelines provide for the mode through which an 
intermediary can operate in IFSC, the nature of the 
activities it can undertake, the type of the clients it 
can service and the infrastructure requirements.

D.  Aadhaar Based e-KYC
 
SEBI  had  earlier  enabled  the  Aadhaar  based 
e-KYC service offered by UIDAI for KYC verification 
on authorisation by the client to the intermediary. To 
clarify certain operational aspects, SEBI has stated:
i. 

 In-person verification of clients is not required 
to be carried out, if:
a. 

b. 

 

 

ii. 

or 

(fingerprint 

the  client  with 
 the  verification  of 
UIDAI is carried out through biometric 
authentication

 the verification of the client with UIDAI 
is  carried  out 
through  a  one-time 
password (OTP) received on the client’s 
mobile number or at the e-mail address 
registered  with  UIDAI,  provided  the 
amount  invested  by  the  client  does  not 
exceed  `  50,000  per  financial  year  per 
mutual fund and the payment for this is 
made  through  electronic  transfer  from 
the client’s bank account registered with 
that mutual fund.

 If the KYC verification of the client is carried 
out through the Aadhaar based e-KYC service 
offered  by  UIDAI  and  the  PAN  number  of 
the  client  is  verified  from  the  website  of  the 
Income  Tax  Department,  the 
information 
downloaded  from  UIDAI  will  be  considered 
as  sufficient  information  for  the  purpose  of 
the KYC verification and the client will not be

 Risk Assessment of the Securities Market to 
Identify Various Money Laundering/Terrorist 
Financing Risks 

 
In view of Recommendation 1 of the Financial 
Action Task Force’s (FATF) recommendations, each 
country is required to assess money laundering and 
terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks posed to its financial 
system. In line with FATF recommendations, SEBI 
is carrying out the risk assessment exercise for the 
securities market.

 USA’s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
(FATCA) and Common Reporting Standards 
(CRS)

 
US  enacted  the  Foreign  Tax  Compliance  Act 
(FATCA)  with  the  objective  of  tackling  tax  evasion 
by  obtaining  information  with  respect  to  off-shore 
financial  accounts  maintained  by  US  residents  and 
citizens  outside  the  USA.  Further,  the  Organisation 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
working with G20 countries has developed a common 
reporting standard (CRS) for automatic exchange of 
information between participant countries. OECD has 
modelled CRS on FATCA. For the implementation of 
FATCA and CRS, the Government of India has made 
the  necessary  legislative  changes  to  Section  285BA 
of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and notified Rules 114F 
to 114H under the Income Tax Rules, 1962. Financial 
sector regulators were also required to issue directions 
to  the  intermediaries  registered  with  them.  In  this 
regard, SEBI has communicated the changes in Income 
Tax  Act/Rules  to  all  SEBI  registered  intermediaries 
and advised them to take necessary steps to ensure 
compliance.

on  July  05,  2016  respectively  from  the 
existing limit of `7,000 crore. 
 Further,  keeping  in  view  the  extent  of 
the  utilisation  of  the  limits  for  central 
government  securities  by  long  term  and 
other investors, it was decided that from 
the next half-year onwards (from October 
01, 2016) any unutilised limit within the 
government debt limit for long term FPIs 
at the end of the half-year, will be made 
available for investment as the additional 
limit to all the categories of FPIs for the 
subsequent half-year.

C. 

Investments by FPIs in New Instruments

 
In March 2016, FPIs were permitted to invest in 
units of the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), the 
Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIt) and Category 
III AIFs.  Further,  FPIs  have  also  been  permitted  to 
acquire NCDs/bonds, which are under default either 
fully  or  partly  in  the  repayment  of  the  principal 
on  maturity  or  principal  instalment  in  case  of  an 
amortising bond. SEBI has mandated, inter-alia, that 
an FPI will not hold more than 25 per cent stake in a 
Category III AIF.

VII.  CORPORATE DEBT MARKET

A. 

 Amendments to the SEBI (Public Offer and 
Listing  of  Securitised  Debt  Instruments) 
Regulations, 2008

 
SEBI notified amendments to the SEBI (Public 
Offer  and  Listing  of  Securitised  Debt  Instruments 
(SDI))  Regulations,  2008  clarifying,  inter-alia,  the 
roles and responsibilities, the terms of appointment, 
capital requirements and the code of conduct of a 
securitisation trustee in April, 2015. It also laid down 
a standardised term sheet format for securitisation 
transactions  (for  both  public  issues  and  private 
placement which further gets listed). This step will 
help in building a robust and a vibrant market in 
SDIs.

B. 

 Notification  of  the  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing 
of  Debt  Securities  by  Municipalities) 
Regulations, 2015 

 
SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of 
Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 
in July 2015, which provide a framework governing 
the  issuance  and  the  listing  of  bonds  by  the 
municipalities and also will enable investors to make 
informed  investment  decisions  before  investing 
in  these  bonds.  These  regulations  also  provide  for 
disclosure  requirements  to  be  met  by  prospective 
issuers.  The  proposed  framework  provides  for  the 
public  issuance  and  the  listing  of  privately  placed 
municipal bonds.  

C.  

 Aligning  the  Disclosure  Requirements  for 
NBFCs  

 
SEBI  has  prescribed  additional  disclosures 
to  be  made  by  non-banking  financial  companies 
(NBFCs) in their offer documents for public issues 
of  debt  securities.  This  was  done  to  align  the 
disclosures made by NBFCs in offer documents with 
the stipulations for NBFCs as required by RBI. The 
salient features of the disclosure requirements are:
i. 

 NBFCs will now provide aggregated exposures 
to  the  top  20  borrowers  with  respect  to  the 

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

concentration  of  advances/exposures  to  be 
disclosed in the manner as prescribed by RBI 
in its guidelines on corporate governance for 
NBFCs from time to time.
 NBFCs will no longer have to provide details 
of  the  top  10  loans.  Instead,  they  will  have 
to  provide  details  of  the  loans,  overdue  and 
classified  as  non-performing  in  accordance 
with RBI guidelines.
 In  case  any  borrower(s)  of  NBFCs  form  a 
part  of  the  ‘Group’  as  defined  by  RBI  in 
its  regulatory  framework  for  NBFCs,  then 
appropriate  disclosures  will  be  made  by 
NBFCs concerning lending to such a ‘Group’ 
in the format prescribed.
 NBFCs  need  to  additionally  disclose  in  their 
offer  documents  a  portfolio  summary  with 
regard  to  the  industries/  sectors  to  which 
borrowings have been made by them, quantum 
and percentage of secured vis-à-vis unsecured 
borrowings made by them and any change in 
the  promoters’  holdings  in  NBFCs  during  the 
last financial year beyond a particular threshold. 
At present, RBI has prescribed such a threshold 
level at 26 per cent. The same threshold or as 
may be prescribed in this regard by RBI from 
time to time shall be applicable.

B.  ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS 

 
SEBI  has  allowed  the  alternative  investment 
funds  (AIFs)  to  invest  in  equity  and  equity  linked 
instruments only of those off-shore venture capital 
undertakings  which  have  an  Indian  connection 
subject  to  the  overall  limit  of  US$  500  million 
(combined limit for AIFs and venture capital funds 
registered  under  the  SEBI  (Venture  Capital  Funds) 
Regulations, 1996). Such investments cannot exceed 
25 per cent of the investible funds of AIF scheme.

IX.  ASSESSMENT AND PROSPECTS

A.  ASSESSMENT
 
As a regulator of Indian securities market SEBI 
continued  to  pursue  its  mandated  three  statutory 
objectives:  protecting  the  interests  of  investors  in 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

the securities markets, promoting the development 
of  and  regulating  the  securities  markets.  A  major 
thrust  of  various  policy  initiatives  undertaken 
during 2015-16, was, inter-alia on enhanced investor 
awareness  and  education,  increasing  its  reach  to 
investors,  enhancing  investor  confidence  through 
effective  market  surveillance  while  simultaneously 
maintaining  high  standards  of 
integrity  and 
diligence  among  the  market  intermediaries.  As  a 
regulator, SEBI and its policy measures have always 
endeavored  to  communicate  transparency  and 
an  ethical  conduct  at  all  levels  and  among  all  the 
stakeholders.

 
A proactive and evolving regulatory regime is 
integral  to  dynamic  financial  markets,  participants 
and  investors.  Indian  markets  are  vibrant  and 
a  timely  review  is  inevitable  in  the  light  of  new 
technological  developments,  introduction  of  new 
products,  growth  of  financial  markets,  trade  and 
capital  flows  and  global  integration.  Pursuant  to 
the  announcement  in  Union  Budget  2015-16,  the 
erstwhile commodities market regulator the Forward 
Markets Commission (FMC) was merged with SEBI 
with effect from September 28, 2015. For SEBI, this 
merger stands out as recognition of the exemplary 
work  that  it  has  done  in  the  securities  market 
arena.  The  merger  also  presented  some  challenges 
in  respect  of  risk  management  and  enforcement 
practices.  It  will  be  SEBI’s  endeavour  to  steer  the 
commodities  market  through  a  well  orchestrated 
regulatory  framework  and  introduction  of  wider 
range  of  products  to  enhance  market  participation 
and deepen the market.

 
Subsequent  to  the  merger,  SEBI’s  immediate 
priority  is  to  ensure  that  the  Indian  commodity 
derivatives markets operate transparently, efficiently, 
and fairly, in parallel with the securities market. In this 
backdrop, securities regulations have been amended 
in  order  to  enable  non-disruptive  convergence  of 
the  regulatory  framework  of  the  two  markets.  In 
tandem with the securities market stock exchanges, 
an exit policy for commodity derivatives exchanges 
has also been designed. Towards this end, SEBI has

SEBI  also 

followed international best practices and principles 
laid  down  by  the  International  Organisation  of 
Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  which  include 
independence,  accountability,  consistent  regulatory 
process and transparency.
 
SEBI  has  always  valued  feedback  received 
from  its  stakeholders  and  advisory  committees  set 
up in all major areas of work to advise proactively 
on the development and regulation of the securities 
markets.  In  2015-16,  a  new  advisory  committee 
for  development  of  commodity  derivatives  for 
facilitating the launch of new market infrastructure 
institutions  was  constituted.  The  expert  committee 
on clearing corporations set up by SEBI to examine, 
interalia,  issues  pertaining  to  investment  policy 
and  calculation  of  liquid  assets  for  net  worth  of 
clearing  corporations  (CCs),  transfer  of  percentage 
of profits of the exchanges to CCs, interoperability 
between different CCs, as well as other related issues 
submitted its report in 2015-16.
 
takes  policy  decisions  after 
consultations  with  the  all  stakeholders  and  by 
disseminating  policy  papers  for  public  comments. 
SEBI also floated discussion papers on a variety of 
areas like ‘exit to dissenting shareholders’, ‘overseas 
investments  for  Alternative  Investment  Funds/
Venture  Capital  Funds  (AIFs/VCFs),  ‘issuance  of 
Green  Bonds’  and  ‘private  placement  on  electronic 
book’  on  its  website  for  public  comments.  Further, 
with  a  view  to  enhancing  its  online  presence  and 
disseminating  information  about  its  international 
engagements  with  its  peer  regulators,  SEBI  has 
created a special section on its website bringing out 
the nature of engagements and activities carried out 
by  SEBI  with  international  organizations,  foreign 
regulators and law enforcement agencies.
to  promote 
 
the  securities  market,  new 
development  of 
investment avenues for investors were launched in 
2015-16  supported  by  notification  of  appropriate 
regulatory  framework.  SEBI  brought  out  new 
regulations  on  issue  and  listing  of  debt  securities 
by municipalities in July 2015 in order to provide

additional  avenue  for  raising  funds  for  urban 
infrastructure.  The  year  also  saw  the  notification 
of  Listing  Regulations  to  enable  easy  reference 
by  consolidating  all  the  listing  requirements  for 
various types of securities listed on stock exchanges 
in one document. 
 
is 
embedded in almost all the laws, rules and policies 
enacted  by  SEBI  for  promoting,  developing  and 
regulating markets. A further step in this direction 
has been envisioned through recent policy measures 
including reducing the post-issue timeline of listing 
to  six  days  from  the  existing  12  days,  reducing 
costs involved in public issue of equity shares and 
convertibles,  a  specialised  Institutional  Trading 
Platform for start-ups and improving the readability 
of  abridged  prospectuses.  SEBI’s  endeavours  in 
setting  up  a  credible  regulatory  framework  often 
lead  international  trends.  For  instance,  European 
Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  is  also 
reported to be considering rationalization of abridged 
prospectus for public issues in its jurisdiction, as has 
already been done by SEBI.
 
Unlike  2014-15  when  the  Sensex  and  Nifty 
registered newer peaks, 2015-16 was relatively muted 
year for the Indian equity markets. Global economic 
growth slowed down. However, the Indian economy 
and the capital market exhibited signs of growth on 
the  back  of  improved  global  growth  expectations. 
The derivatives market continued to remain the most 
dominant  segment  in  the  Indian  securities  market; 
Indian  derivatives  featured  in  global  rankings  as 
well. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) in 
its  2015  report  has  said  that  traded  volumes  have 
exceeded 2011 levels and the Asia-Pacific region was 
responsible  for  a  large  proportion  of  this  growth; 
NSE accounted for nearly 50 percent of total global 
volumes in stock index options. 
 
While  investor  interests  are  ensured  through 
various policies, checks and balances, the expeditious 
redressal  of  their  grievances  is  a  pre-requisite  for 
retaining their confidence in markets and regulation 
and  for  potential  investors  as  well.    During  the 

38

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

year,  the  average  time  taken  to  resolve  investor’s 
complaints through SCORES, a cornerstone of SEBI’s 
efforts to redress investor grievances in a time-bound 
manner, reduced from 38 days to 36 days. The Indian 
capital market has evolved manifold in terms of size, 
reach, diversity of investors and product complexity. 
Amidst  this  dynamic  and  developing  financial 
landscape, SEBI continued to showcase its keenness 
to promote and deepen the Indian securities markets 
and protect investors’ interest.

PROSPECTS
B. 
 
The  Indian  economy  is  expected  to  maintain 
its growth momentum in the near future. According 
to  projections  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF) India will grow by 7.5 per cent both in 2016 
and  2017.  The  World  Bank  projects  that  the  rate 
of  growth  will  move  up  to  7.8  per  cent  in  2016 
and  further  to  7.9  per  cent  both  in  2017  and  2018. 
Continued fiscal consolidation and a tight monetary 
stance  have  enhanced  India’s  policy  credibility. 
In  addition  to  private  consumption,  both  private 
investments  and  public  infrastructure  investments 
are forecast to contribute to the growth story. While 
sluggish global growth and appreciation of the real 
effective  exchange  rate  is  expected  to  adversely 
affect  exports,  rebounding  commodity  prices  and 
larger domestic demand may lead to the widening of 
the current account deficit.  Continued weaknesses 
in corporate balance sheets and in the asset quality 
of public sector banks continue to figure among the 
prominent domestic risks.
 
Financial sector reforms are a continuous effort. 
As such, calibration of the regulatory framework has 
become the hallmark of the Indian securities market. 
Both  the  Government  of  India  and  SEBI  recognise 
that  a  further  deepening  of  the  securities  market 
will facilitate financial intermediation in the Indian 
securities market during 2016-17.
 
Over  time,  the  securities  market  in  India  has 
witnessed  significant  developments  on  various 
fronts. However, with the merger of the commodities 
regulator with SEBI, one of the significant tasks that 

PART ONE: Policies And Programmes

lies ahead for SEBI in 2016-17 is to provide a vision 
for  the  comprehensive  development  of  securities 
as well as commodities market. SEBI shall indicate 
the confidence reposed in it by the Parliament with 
dedication  and  hard  work. A  steep  learning  curve 
presented by the merger needs to be recognised by 
putting  its  current  expertise  to  application  in  the 
field while laying down ambitious plans to acquire 
newer expertise. 

transparency 
information 

 
Transparency in the securities market enables 
market  participants  to  have  equal  opportunities 
to  receive  relevant  information  to  make  informed 
covers  public 
decisions. 
Such 
dissemination  of 
through  various 
disclosures. Greater transparency not only helps the 
market to fight fraud and manipulation, but it also 
improves market efficiency and investor protection. 
For example, since 2014, the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) has allowed banks to issue Additional Tier 1 
(AT1)  instruments  through  retail  investors.  It  was 
felt  at  that  time  that  retail  investors  may  not  fully 
appreciate  the  characteristics  of  these  instruments 
and therefore, there is need for additional disclosure 
norms for retail/public issuance of such instruments. 

Cash  benefits  in  the  securities  market  such 
 
as  dividend,  interest  and  redemption  payments 
are currently distributed to investors through their 
Registrar  and  Transfer  Agents.  There  is  further 
scope for improvement in areas related to efficient 
tracking  of  payments,  having  a  consolidated  view 
of  all  benefits  received,  non-payment  and  delayed 
payments,  updation  of  investor  bank  details  and 
disclosures  of  unpaid  cash  benefits.  In  order  to 
further  enhance  investor  experience  and  to  make 
the securities market more transparent and efficient, 
SEBI is considering a proposal for distributing cash 
benefits through depositories. A consultation paper 
on  this  has  been  placed  on  the  SEBI  website  for 
public comments. Presently, there is no post-listing 
requirement  on  distribution  of  dividends  by  listed 
companies.  SEBI  has  put  a  discussion  paper  on 
putting in place a policy for disclosures of dividend 
distribution by listed companies. 

SEBI Annual Report

SEBI is also reviewing warehousing norms to 
strengthen warehousing facilities in the commodity 
futures  market  to  ensure  integrity  of  delivery 
mechanisms  through  scientific  warehousing  and 
to  bring  transparency  in  the  warehousing  field  for 
the  smooth  functioning  in  the  entire  process.  The 
commodity derivatives exchanges currently use the 
polling  methodology  for  determining  spot  prices. 
This  is  being  reviewed  with  intent  to  improve  the 
credibility and transparency of such process.

 
SEBI  was  born  in  an  era  when  technology 
was  in  its  infancy.  Since  then,  SEBI  has  moved  in 
tandem with technological advancements. A strong 
regulatory framework coupled with technologically 
advanced  systems  can  improve  the  efficiency  and 
effectiveness of the market economy multifold and 
achieve optimal allocation of resources. Introduction 
of the electronic book for private placement, review 
of  framework  for  public  issuance  of  convertible 
securities,  rationalising  and  sorting  out  multiple 
disclosures 
simplification  and 
standardisation  of  self-certification 
for 
FATCA/CRS  purposes,  introduction  of  an  online 
paperless  mechanism  for  applying  for  registration 
and  related  matters,  inspection,  periodic  reports 
and  fees,  introduction  of  a  ‘Dashboard’  to  provide 
performance  and  other  important  details  of  each 
scheme of mutual fund investors on respective asset 
management  company  (AMC)  websites  would  be 
some of the measures which SEBI may initiate in the 
coming year.

in  prospectus, 

forms 

 
Development  of  the  markets  is  one  of  the 
mandates  provided  by  the  SEBI Act. A  number  of 

new developments are in the fray. SEBI has issued 
a  consultation  paper  seeking  comments  on  the 
issuance  of  Green  Bonds  in  India.  Public  issue  of 
units  of  Infrastructure  Investment  trusts  will  be 
allowed  as  per  the  draft  guidelines  issued  earlier. 
After the Listing and Other Disclosure Requirements 
Regulations,  2015  have  come  into  effect,  a  new 
monitoring mechanism including penalties for non-
compliance  of  regulations  by  listed  companies  is 
envisaged.

The  definition  of  ‘forward  contract’  under 
 
FCR  Act  restrained  introduction  of  cash  settled 
commodity  derivatives  products  or  derivatives 
products  on  commodity  indices.  However,  the 
repeal  of  FCRA  and  broadening  of  the  definition 
of  commodity  derivatives  in  SCRA  to  also  include 
a  contract  for  differences  which  derive  value  from 
prices  or  indices  of  prices  of  underlying  goods  or 
activities,  services,  rights,  interests  and  events,  has 
enabled the introduction of products as commodity 
options,  index  futures,  index  options  etc.  Thus, 
new  products  may  be  considered  for  launch  on 
commodity derivatives exchanges.

During  2016-17,  SEBI’s  priority  will  be 
 
achieving its mandated statutory objectives through 
various policy initiatives targeted towards investor 
protection,  market  development  and  effective 
regulations. Additionally, it will be SEBI’s endeavour 
to cooperate with other regulators, not only in India 
but across the globe for strengthening and promoting 
a conducive environment for the securities market to 
flourish within the caveats of regulation.

1. 

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

In  2015-16,  activity  in  the  primary  market 

showed  signs  of  moderate  growth  as  reflected 
in resource mobilisation by the corporate sector. 
A healthy and regulated primary market is vital for 
maintaining the confidence of issuers, intermediaries 
and  investors.  In  order  to  keep  pace  with  the 
changing  economic  environment  and  to  address 
concerns  of  various  market  participants,  especially 
issuers  and  the  investing  community,  regulations 
governing the primary market have been amended 
from  time  to  time.  Such  reviews  are  intended  to 
facilitate  easy  capital  mobilisation  by  companies 
while  ensuring  adequate 
investor  protection. 
Streamlining of the public issue process, facilitating 
capital raising by start-ups, simplifying the procedure 
of delisting by small companies and SEBI’s notification 
(Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 were some important developments 
that took place in 2015-16.

I. 

 Resource  Mobilisation  through  Public  and 
Rights Issues

 
During  2015-16,  108  companies  accessed  the 
primary market and raised ` 58,166 crore through 95 

public and 13 rights issues, as against 88 companies 
which  raised  `  19,202  crore  in  2014-15  through 
public  (70)  and  rights  issues  (18)  (Table  2.1).  At 
74,  the  number  of  IPOs  in  2015-16  was  higher  as 
compared to 46 in 2014-15. Of the 74 IPOs, 50 have 
been listed on the SME platform. The amount raised 
through  IPOs  in  2015-16  was  higher  at  `  14,815 
crore as compared to ` 3,039 crore during 2014-15. 
As in the previous year, there was no FPO in 2015-
16. The share of public issues in the total resource 
mobilisation increased to 84.1 per cent during 2015-
16  from  64.8  per  cent  during  2014-15;  while  the 
share of rights issues decreased from 35.2 per cent 
in 2014-15 to 15.9 per cent in 2015-16. (Chart 2.1) The 
share of debt issues in total resource mobilisation 
stood at 58.6 per cent and that of equity issues at 
41.4 per cent in 2015-16. The IPO issues that opened 
in  2015-16  received  an  overwhelming  response 
from the investors as out of 24 issues that opened 
during  the  year,  seven  were  oversubscribed  more 
than  20  times.  Three  IPOs  were  oversubscribed  
30-40 times, while one IPO was oversubscribed by 
70-80 times.

Chart 2.1 represents the relative shares of the 
four modes of resource mobilisation -- IPOs, FPOs, 
bonds and rights issues -- since 2011-12. The share 
of bonds is seen to be the highest for the current as 
well as the preceding three years.

Resource Mobilisation

A.  Resource mobilisation via the SME platform

 
The SME platform of the exchange is intended 
for small and medium sized companies with high 
growth potential and post issue paid up capital less 
than or equal to ` 25 crore. In 2015-16, 50 companies 
were listed on SME platform raising a total amount 

of  `  379  crore  as  compared  to  `  278  crore  raised 
through 39 issues in 2014-15, registering an increase 
of 36.6 per cent in resource mobilisation. (Table 2.2)

Sector-wise Resource Mobilisation
B. 
 
A  sector-wise  classification  of  the  resource 
mobilisation  shows  that  97  private  sector  issues 
and 11 public sector issues were mobilised through 
the  primary  market  in  2015-16  as  compared  to 
85  private  sector  issues  and  three  public  sector 
issues in 2014-15. In 2015-16, private sector issues 
mobilised ` 27,068 crore compared to the ` 31,098 
crore  mobilised  by  the  public  sector  companies. 
(Table 2.3) The private sector contributed 46.5 per 
cent  to  the  total  resource  mobilisation  in  2015-16 
as compared to 87.3 per cent in 2014-15 (Chart 2.2). 
The amount raised through public sector issues was 
53.5  per  cent  of  the  total  resource  mobilisation  as 
compared to 12.7 per cent during 2014-15.

major  share  in  the  primary  market  for  resource 
mobilisation.  These  larger  issues  had  a  share  of 
85.1 per cent in resource mobilisation in 2015-16 as 
compared to 56.4 per cent in 2014-15. (Table 2.4)

The average size of an issue (including public and 
rights) which accessed the primary market in 2015-
16  increased  to  `  539  crore  as  compared  to  `  218 
crore in 2014-15. In 2015-16, the mean public issue 
size was ` 515 crore as compared to ` 178 crore in 
2014-15.  However,  the  mean  IPO  size  increased 
almost three times from ` 66 crore in 2014-15 to `

II.  Resource Mobilisation through QIP and IPP
A.  QIP and IPP
 
In addition to the public and right issues, SEBI 
introduced  the  qualified  institutions’  placement 
(QIP) as one of the mechanisms in 2006 to facilitate 
listed companies to raise capital in Indian securities 
market. QIP enables a listed company to issue equity 
shares,  fully  and  partly  convertible  debentures  or 
any  securities  other  than  warrants  to  a  qualified 
institutional buyer (QIB). 

SEBI 

 
institutional 
placement  programme  (IPP)  route  under  Chapter 

introduced 

also 

the 

VIII-A  of  SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations,  2009  during 
2011-12 for the listed companies to achieve minimum 
public  shareholding  requirements.  The  IPP  route 
can be used either by way of fresh issue of capital or 
dilution by the promoters through an offer for sale. 
Under Chapter VIII-A of the ICDR Regulations, any 
offer, allocation and allotment of securities under the 
IPP route is to be made only to QIBs. 

 
During 2015-16, 24 issues garnered a total of ` 
14,587 crore through the QIP route as compared to ` 
29,102 crore raised in 2014-15 (Table 2.7). There was 
no IPP issue in 2015-16.

 Offer  for  Sale  through  the  Stock  Exchange 
Mechanism 
 
In addition to IPP, SEBI also introduced offer for 
sale (OFS) by promoters through the stock exchange 
mechanism. OFS enables promoters to off-load their 
holdings in listed companies in a transparent manner 
with wider participation and this route is being used 
more  often  than  IPP.  In  2015-16,  promoters  of  16 
companies used this route through BSE and NSE to 
conform to public shareholding norms as compared 
to 22 companies in 2014-15. These 16 companies came 
out with 18 OFS issues during 2015-16. The allotted 
value through OFS registered a decrease of 26.3 per 
cent from ` 26,875 crore in 2014-15 to ` 19,817 crore 
in 2015-16. (Table 2.8)

 Resource Mobilisation through Preferential 
Allotment
Preferential  allotment 

 
is  covered  under 
Chapter VII of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements)  Regulations,  2009.  This  mode  of 
resource mobilisation is utilised by a listed company 
to issue equity shares/ fully convertible debentures 
(FCDs)/partly convertible debentures (PCDs) or any 
other financial instruments which will be converted 
to or exchanged with equity shares at a later date. 
The allotments are done on a preferential basis to 
a  select  group  of  investors  under  Section  81(1A) 
of  the  Companies Act,  2013.  Further,  the  issuer  is 
required to take the permission of shareholders and 
should comply with various provisions as specified 
in the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 vis-à-vis the 
Companies Act, 2013. 
 
During 2015-16, 333 preferential issues raised 
` 49,916 crore, which is 76.6 per cent higher than the 
` 28,260 crore garnered in 2014-15. (Table 2.9)

 Resource  Mobilisation 
Placement of Corporate Debt

through  Private 

 
Private placement of corporate bonds is a mode 
of raising capital by allotting them to institutional 
investors. Resource mobilisation through this route 
has been increasingly used by corporate entities in 
recent years to garner fresh capital. 
Indian companies raised a record of ` 4,58,073 
 
crore in 2015-16 through private placements which 

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

is 13.3 per cent higher as compared to a total of ` 
4,04,137 crore raised in the previous financial year 
(Table  2.10).  In  terms  of  numbers,  2,975  issuances 
were made in 2015-16, as compared to 2,611 issues 
in  2014-15.  The  growth  in  the  amount  raised 
through  the  private  placement  route  shows  that 
this is a preferred route for raising funds by Indian 
companies.

SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

Equity Markets in India
During  2015-16, 

I. 
 
Indian  equity  markets 
remained subdued mainly on account of the turmoil 
in  global  equity  markets  in  August  2015.  During 
the financial year, the benchmark indices S&P BSE 
Sensex (henceforth referred to as Sensex) and Nifty 
50 (henceforth referred to as Nifty) decreased by 9.4 
and 8.9 per cent respectively over March 31, 2015 
(Chart 2.3). The Sensex closed at 25,342 on March 
31, 2016, registering a decrease of 2,616 points over 
27,957 as on March 31, 2015. The Nifty decreased by 
753 points to close at 7,738 on March 31, 2016 over 
8,491 at the end of March 31, 2015.

Chart 2.3: Movements of Benchmark Indices

decreased  by  78.0  per  cent  while  the  turnover 
at  NSE  increased  by  16.6  per  cent  during  2015-
16  as  compared  to  an  increase  of  120.9  per  cent 
at  BSE  and  45.5  per  cent  at  NSE  during  2014-15. 
The  Metropolitan  Stock  Exchange  of  India  Ltd. 
(MSEI) recorded insignificant volumes in the cash 
segment and no trading was observed in its equity 
derivatives segment (Table 2.11).

The  segment-wise  composition  of  the  value 
 
traded in the secondary market is shown in Chart 
2.4.  In  the  Indian  secondary  market,  in  terms 
of  traded  turnover,  equity  derivatives  led  with 
a  dominant  share  of  82.9  per  cent  followed  by 
currency derivatives (9.1 per cent), the equity cash 
segment  (6.0  per  cent),  corporate  bonds  (1.2  per 
cent) and interest rate derivatives (0.8 per cent)

Chart 2.4: Value Traded in the Secondary Market 

 
The  benchmark  indices  Sensex  and  Nifty 
reached  their  maximum  on  April  13,  2015,  when 
they touched the highest levels of 29,044 and 8,834 
respectively. The lowest level attained by Sensex was 
22,952 on February 11, 2016 while Nifty touched a 
low of 6,971 on February 25, 2016. The biggest gain 
in Sensex and Nifty was observed on March 1, 2016 
when both the indices appreciated by 3.4 per cent.

On the global front, financial market stress in 
China and monetary policy dilemmas in advanced 
economies,  amidst  a  fragile  global  recovery,  led 
to  increased  uncertainty  in  the  global  economy. 
The  recent  Federal  Funds  Rate  hike  and  the 
developments in China call for a careful calibration 
of domestic policies to withstand global headwinds. 
The risks associated with weaker growth prospects 
in key advanced and emerging market economies 
combined with tighter financial market conditions 
and  weak  commodity  prices  could  pose  many 
challenges. Despite the favourable combination of 
prudent  policy  measures  and  benign  commodity 
prices, there are a few issues that we need to take 
note of as we prepare to take on the emerging risks.

In  contrast 

 
to  other  major  developing 
countries, growth in India remained robust, buoyed 
by  strong  investor  sentiment  and  positive  effect 
on real incomes of the recent fall in oil prices. As 
monetary policy tightens in the United States, some 
of  the  developing  countries  may  be  vulnerable  to 
rollover,  exchange  rate,  and  interest  rate  risks. 
When  compared  to  the  previous  year,  growth  in

advanced economies is expected to pick up slightly, 
while it is projected to decline in emerging market 
and developing economies in 2016. With declining 
commodity  prices,  depreciating  emerging  market 
currencies,  and 
financial  market 
volatility,  downside  risks  to  the  growth  outlook 
have  risen,  particularly  for  emerging  market  and 
developing economies. Global activity is projected 
to gather some pace in 2016.

In  comparison  to  last  year,  a  majority  of  the 
indices  that  were  considered  showed  negative 
returns.  Among  the  emerging  markets  the  year-
on-year  index  change  was  the  highest  in  Hungary 
(34.3 per cent), followed by Argentina (13.2 per cent) 
and  Mexico  (4.9  per  cent)  (Chart  2.5).  Among  the 
developed  equity  markets,  the  year-on-year  index 
changes were negative in all the markets that were 
considered with it; being the highest in Europe (18.7 
per cent), followed by Singapore (17.6 per cent) and 
Germany (16.7 per cent). The lowest declines were 
registered in USA DJIA (0.5 per cent), USA NASDAQ 
(0.6 per cent) and UK FTSE 100 (8.8 per cent).

Along  with  the  benchmark  indices,  sectoral 
and  other  broad  based  indices  also  witnessed  a 
downturn  during  2015-16.  The  trends  of  these 
indices  are  shown  in  Tables  2.12  and  2.13  and 
Charts  2.6  and  2.7.  Among  the  broad-based  BSE 
indices,  BSE  100,  BSE  200  and  BSE  500  recorded 
year-on-year  negative  index  changes  of  9.0,  7.9 
and  7.8  per  cent  respectively  over  the  previous 
year.  The  BSE  small-cap  index  observed  a  fall  of 
3.2  per  cent  during  2015-16.  Similarly,  among  the 
NSE indices, the Nifty 500, Nifty Next 50 (formerly 
known as CNX Nifty Junior) and the Nifty Midcap

Ahmedabad Stock Exchange -- was practically nil. 
At  BSE  and  NSE,  the  turnover  decreased  by  13.4 
and  2.1  per  cent  respectively  in  2015-16  over  the 
previous  financial  year.  (Table  2.15)  Month-wise,

Widening  the  geographical  reach  of  capital 
 
markets is one of the important aspects of developing 
of  the  securities  markets  in  India  (Table  2.16).  On-
line  trading  facilities,  dematerialised  securities  and 
electronic  IPO  application  systems  are  a  few  of 
the  features  that  catalyse  the  penetration  of  equity 
investment  culture  into  the  farthest  corners  of  a 
diverse nation like India. About 52.5 per cent of the 
total  turnover  of  BSE  and  59.1  per  cent  of  the  total 
turnover  of  NSE  was  concentrated  in  Mumbai  and 

Thane,  the  financial  hub  of  the  country.  At  NSE, 
Delhi/Ghaziabad  contributed  8.6  per  cent  and 
Kolkata/Howrah  accounted  for  5.7  per  cent  of  the 
turnover.  On  the  other  hand  at  BSE,  Kolkata  and 
others accounted for 7.5 and 23.1 per cent of the total 
turnover  respectively.  The  top  five  cities  accounted 
for 84 per cent of the turnover at NSE during 2015-16 
compared to 80.2 per cent in 2014-15. At BSE, 90.3 per 
cent of the turnover was contributed by top five cities 
during 2015-16 compared to 85.3 per cent in 2014-15.

SEBI notified the exit policy for de-recognised/
non-operational  stock  exchanges  in  2012.  As  on 
March  31,  2016,  17  regional  stock  exchanges  had 
been  granted  exit  by  SEBI.  Exclusively  listed 
companies  at  regional  stock  exchanges  (RSEs), 
which  failed  to  obtain  a  listing  on  any  other 
stock  exchange,  had  to  be  listed  companies  and 
moved  to  the  dissemination  board  by  the  exiting 
stock  exchange.  The  exiting  stock  exchanges 
were  required  to  enter  into  an  agreement  with 
at  least  one  of  the  stock  exchanges  with  nation-
wide trading terminals providing a dissemination 

board.  In  2015-16,  shares  of  372  exclusively  listed 
companies at RSEs were made available for buying/
selling on the dissemination board of NSE while in 
2014-15,  198  exclusively  listed  companies  at  RSEs 
had  been  made  available  for  buying/selling  on 
the dissemination board at NSE. Similarly at BSE, 
while  in  2015-16,  the  shares  of  1,422  exclusively 
listed companies at RSEs were made available for 
buying/selling on the dissemination board, in 2014-
15  the  shares  of  95  exclusively  listed  companies 
had been made available for buying/selling on the 
dissemination board. (Tables 2.17 and 2.18)

IV.  Market Capitalisation

 
Market  capitalisation  is  the  total  value  of  a 
publicly  traded  company’s  outstanding  shares  at 
any  point.  It  is  a  major  indicator  that  reflects  the 
size of the stock market. The market capitalisation 
at BSE has been higher than that of NSE reflecting 
that  BSE  has  more  listed  companies.  The  market 
capitalisation at BSE declined by 6.6 per cent to  ` 
94,75,328 crore in 2015-16 from ` 1,01,49,290 crore 
in 2014-15. (Table 2.19) On the other hand, at NSE 
market capitalisation decreased by 6.2 per cent to 
` 93,10,471 crore in 2015-16 from ` 99,30,122 crore 
in  2014-15.  In  line  with  general  trends,  market 
capitalisation  at  BSE  and  NSE  also  witnessed  a

mixed trend. The increase at both BSE and NSE was 
the highest in July 2015 followed by May 2015. 

 
At BSE, the market capitalisation of the shares 
included in the BSE benchmark index, the S&P BSE 
Sensex decreased by 4.3 per cent in 2015-16 (Table 2.19). 
Among the sectoral indices that were considered, the 
S&P BSE PSU observed the highest fall of 18.7 per cent 
in market capitalisation as compared to the previous 
year.  During  the  year,  market  capitalisation  of  the 
shares  included  in  the  Nifty  50  index  decreased  by 
5.9 per cent (Table 2.20). At NSE, among the sectoral 
indices analysed, Nifty IT had the maximum decrease 
in  market  capitalisation  (46.5  per  cent)  followed  by 
Nifty Next 50 (13.7 per cent).

Stock Market Indicators

Ratios  such  as  market  capitalisation 

 
to 
GDP  (m-cap  ratio),  traded  value  to  GDP  (traded 
value  ratio)  and  price  to  earnings  per  share  (P/E 
ratio)  were  observed  to  estimate  the  extent  of 
development  of  the  stock  market. After  declining 
for  three  successive  years,  market  capitalisation 
ratios showed improvement from 2013-14 onwards. 

However,  after  increasing  for  two  consecutive 
years,  market  capitalisation  ratios  registered  a 
decline  in  2015-16.  The  BSE  market  capitalisation 
to GDP ratio decreased from 81.3 per cent in 2014-
15 to 69.8 per cent in 2015-16. Similarly, at NSE the 
ratio decreased from 79.5 per cent in 2014-15 to 68.6 
per cent in 2015-16. (Table 2.21) The all-India cash 
turnover to GDP ratio also observed a fall in 2015-

The valuation of shares can be gauged from 
 
the  price-earnings  ratio  (P/E)  (Table  2.22).  As  on 
March 31, 2016 Sensex and Nifty’s P/E ratios were 
19.3 and 20.9 respectively as compared to 19.5 and 
22.7  respectively  on  March  31,  2015.  The  highest 
Nifty P/E ratio was observed in July 2015 when it 

reached the level of 23.5, while that of Sensex was 
observed in  October 2015 (22.7). Month-wise data 
indicate that Sensex and Nifty’s P/E ratios were the 
lowest in February 2016. During 2015-16, there was 
a decrease in the P/E ratios of almost all the indices 
analysed.

The  price  to  book  (P/B)  ratio  is  another 
important indicator which measures the returns left 
for shareholders after providing for the liabilities of 
a company. At the end of 2015-16, the P/B ratio was 

the highest for the Nifty IT index at 6.0, followed by 
S&P BSE Teck at 4.6, Nifty at 3.1 and Sensex at 2.8

VI.  Volatility in Stock Markets

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

Market Indices

 
During 2015-16, the Indian equity market was 
well placed as compared to its peers to withstand the 
volatility in global financial markets. The decline in 
the prices of equity shares was widespread during 
the year, with blue chip indices, broad based indices 
and sectoral indices all ending the year in the red as 
compared  to  2014-15.  However,  the  Indian  equity 
markets maintained a reasonable degree of resilience 
during  the  year,  despite  the  spill-over  effects  from 
global  factors.  India’s  first  volatility  index-  India 
VIX- indicates investors’ perceptions of the market’s 
volatility in the next 30 calendar days. The India VIX 
closed at 16.6 on March 31, 2016 as compared to 14.5 
on  March  31,  2015  registering  an  increase  of  14.5 
per cent, indicating investors’ expectations of rising 
volatility.

The  annualised  volatility  of  the  Sensex, 
 
measured by the standard deviation of log returns, 
increased to 17.0 per cent in 2015-16 from 13.5 per 
cent in 2014-15. A similar trend was also observed 
for  Nifty  which  moved  up  from  13.5  per  cent  to 
17.1 per cent during the same period (Table 2.24). 
The highest volatility among the other indices was 
observed in the S&P BSE small cap index followed 
by Nifty Next 50 and the Nifty 500 index. 

Source: Bloomberg Services.
An  international  comparison  of  P/E  ratios 
 
indicates that the Indian markets have ratios falling in 
between the lower and higher range of all advanced 
and emerging economies taken together. The average 
P/E  ratio  of  all  advanced  and  emerging  economies 
stood  at  22.5  as  compared  to  20.1  of  the  Indian 
stock markets (BSE & NSE). Among the developed 
markets,  Japan’s  Nikkei  index  had  the  highest  P/E 
ratio followed by the US’ NASDAQ Composite and 
France’s  CAC  40  index.  In  the  emerging  markets 
category,  Brazil’s  Bovespa  index  had  the  highest 
P/E ratio followed by Mexico’s MEXBOL index and 
Colombia’s Indice General Bolsa (Chart 2.8).

A  comparison  of  volatility  of  indices  across 
developed  and  emerging  market  indices  is  shown 
in  Table  2.25  and  Chart  2.9.  Among  the  emerging 
markets,  China  depicted  the  highest  volatility 
(41.0  per  cent),  followed  by  Russia  (36.5  per  cent), 
Argentina (32.9 per cent) and Brazil (25.7 per cent). 
In  2015-16,  volatility  in  Indian  benchmark  indices 
was  substantially  lower  than  in  the  indices  chosen 
for  comparison  showing  signs  of  macroeconomic 
stability, resilience and optimism in Indian markets. 
Among the developed markets, annualised volatility 
was the highest in Japan (25.8 per cent), followed by 
Germany (25.4 per cent) and Europe (25.1 per cent).

VII.  Trading Frequency

 
Liquidity  prevalent  in  the  stock  markets 
is  measured  by  the  trading  frequency  of  stocks 
listed  at  NSE  and  BSE  (trading  at  MSEI  is  almost 
negligible). The number of companies listed at BSE 
and NSE at the end of March 2016 was 5,911 and 
1,808  respectively.  Trading  frequency  improved 
at  both  the  stock  exchanges  in  2015-16  over  the 
previous financial year. During 2015-16, the number 
of stocks traded at BSE was 5,035 as compared to 
4,814 in 2014-15 (Table 2.26). Similarly, the number 
of stocks traded at NSE was higher at 1,703 in 2015-
16 as compared to 1,691 in 2014-15. The percentage 
share  of  stocks  traded  at  BSE  for  more  than  100 
days decreased from 70.2 per cent in 2015-16 to 62.3 
per  cent  in  2014-15.  At  NSE  too,  this  percentage 
registered  a  slight  decrease  from  92.5  per  cent  in 
2015-16 to 91.1 per cent in 2014-15. The percentage 
share of stocks traded for ten days or less in 2015-16 
was 14.2 per cent at BSE and 3.6 per cent at NSE.

The share of the top 100 brokers in the annual 
cash  market  turnover  in  2015-16  at  NSE  and  BSE 
was 81.5 and 79.1 per cent respectively (Table 2.27). 
The  share  of  the  top  100  securities  in  the  annual 
cash market’s turnover in 2015-16 at NSE and BSE 
was  71.7  and  58.5  per  cent  respectively.  At  NSE, 
the share of participants in the annual cash market 
turnover in 2015-16 shows that proprietary trades, 
FPIs  and  mutual  funds  contributed  20.8,  22.2  and 
5.4 per cent respectively whereas others (including 
individuals,  partnership  firms,  HUFs,  trusts  and 
NRIs) contributed 51.5 per cent. However, in 2015-
16,  domestic  institutions  (excluding  MFs)  did  not 
contribute  in  the  annual  cash  market  turnover  as 
compared to 4.3 per cent share in 2014-15. Similarly, 
data for the BSE annual cash market turnover for 
2015-16  shows  that  proprietary  trades,  domestic 
institutions  (excluding  mutual  funds),  FPIs  and 
mutual  funds  contributed  18.9,  3.0,  16.2  and  3.3 
per  cent  respectively  whereas  others  (including

individuals,  partnership  firms,  HUFs,  trusts  and 
NRIs) contributed 58.6 per cent. (Table 2.28)

VIII. Activities of Stock Exchanges
 
Over the years, NSE and BSE have emerged 
as nation-wide stock exchanges contributing more 
than 99 per cent of the total turnover (Table 2.29).
 
During  2015-16,  the  all-India  turnover  at 
the stock exchanges in terms of number of shares 
traded  decreased  by  6.9  per  cent  on  top  of  a  rise 
of  60.2  per  cent  during  2014-15.  The  number  of 
shares traded, number of shares delivered and the 
value of shares delivered decreased at both BSE and 
NSE as compared to the previous year. In the total 
quantity of shares traded, NSE had a share of 74.2 
per cent while BSE’s share was 24.7 per cent. NSE 
had a share of 63.3 per cent in the quantity of shares 
delivered while BSE had a share of 35.9 per cent. In 
the total value of shares delivered, NSE’s share was 
83.5 per cent while that of BSE was 16.5 per cent.

process of exit. The Delhi Stock Exchange was de-
recognised on November 19, 2014. As many of the 
RSEs are dormant, their activities are mainly routed 

through subsidiaries which have taken up trading 
membership of BSE and NSE. With respect to the 
exiting  exchanges,  the  turnover  in  subsidiaries  is 
considered upto the date of the exit order. The total 
turnover of the remaining subsidiaries registered a 
decline of 43.5 per cent to ` 79,523 crore during 2015-
16 from ` 1,40,793 crore during 2014-15 (Table 2.30). 
Some of the subsidiaries recorded nil turnovers.

IX.  Dematerialisation

Dematerialisation  is  the  process  through 
 
which securities in physical form are converted to 
electronic form. Dematerialisation allows investors 
to  handle  investments  in  an  effective  manner. 
Dematerialisation of shares has been an important 
milestone in Indian capital markets as it has stirred 
the  micro-structure  of  markets  in  general  and  of 
stock exchanges in particular.

 
At  the  end  of  March  2016,  there  were  145.7 
lakh  demat  accounts  at  the  National  Securities 
Depository  Limited  (NSDL)  and  107.9  lakh  demat 
accounts at the Central Depository Services (India) 
Limited  (CDSL);  15,638  companies  had  signed  up 
for  dematerialisation  at  NSDL  and  10,021  at  CDSL 
as  on  March  31,  2016  (Table  2.31).  The  quantity  of 
dematerialised  securities  at  NSDL  increased  by 

18.6  per  cent  to  1,10,02,089  lakh  in  2015-16  from 
92,73,570 lakh in 2014-15. At CDSL, the quantity of 
dematerialised securities increased by 10.5 per cent 
from  20,60,123  lakh  in  2014-15  to  22,75,489  lakh 
in  2015-16.  The  number  of  shares  settled  in  demat 
form and the value of shares settled in demat form 
decreased  at  both  NSDL  and  CDSL.  Similarly  the 
quantity of securities in demat form and their value 
observed  an  increase  at  both  NSDL  and  CDSL  in 
2015-16. At NSDL, the total value of demat settled 
shares  decreased  by  2.9  per  cent  from  `  20,69,409 
crore  in  2014-15  to  `  20,09,725  crore  in  2015-16. At 
CDSL,  too,  the  value  of  shares  settled  in  demat 
decreased by 12.1 per cent from ` 5,48,511 crore in 
2014-15  to  `  4,82,355  crore  in  2015-16.  The  ratio  of 
dematerialised  equity  shares  to  total  outstanding 
shares of listed companies was 85.4 per cent at NSDL 
and 12.8 per cent at CDSL at the end of 2015-16.

Besides equity shares, dematerialisation facility 
 
is  also  extended  to  instruments  like  commercial 
papers  and  bonds.  The  total  dematerialised  value 
of commercial papers increased at both NSDL and 
CDSL  (Table  2.32).  At  NSDL,  it  increased  from  ` 
1,88,375 crore in 2014-15 to ` 2,58,812 crore in 2015-

16. The dematerialised value of commercial papers at 
CDSL increased from ` 413 crore in 2014-15 to ` 849 
crore in 2015-16. The number of active instruments 
and  the  dematerialised  value  of  debentures/bonds 
also  increased  at  NSDL  and  CDSL  in  2015-16  over 
2014-15.

decline.  DP  locations  for  NSDL  were  available  in 

1,942  cities  in  2015-16  as  compared  to  1,549  cities 
in 2014-15 (Table 2.33). The number of DP locations

X.  Derivatives Segment

 
A  derivative  as  defined  in  the  Securities 
Contracts  (Regulations)  Act  is  a  security  derived 
from  a  debt  instrument,  share,  loan,  whether 
secured  or  unsecured,  risk  instrument  or  contract 
for differences or any other form of security. With 
the Securities Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1999, 
derivatives  have  been  included  in  the  definition 
of  securities.  USE  has  merged  with  BSE  vide  the 
Bombay High Court order dated April 24, 2015. The 
derivatives  market  contributes  approximately  93 
per cent of the total traded value in the secondary 
market (Chart 2.4). Currently, India’s NSE and BSE 
are among the top 30 derivative exchanges, when 
positioned in terms of number of contracts traded 
and/or cleared.

A.  The Equity Derivatives Segment 

 
The  equity  derivatives  segment  is  the  most 
vibrant,  active  and  dominant  segment  in  the 
Indian  securities  market.  Over  the  years,  there 
has been manifold increase in its volumes - both 
in  terms  of  the  number  of  contracts  traded  as 
well  as  traded  value  and  products  traded.  India 
holds  a  significant  place  in  the  arena  of  world 
derivatives  markets.  In  recent  years  the  equity 
derivatives  segment  has  been  the  most  traded 
and valued segment. Its turnover to GDP ratio for 
2015-16 stood at 511, which in itself illustrates the 
kind of liquidity that this market has. The World 
Federation of Exchanges (WFE) in its 2015 report 
said that the traded volumes exceeded 2011 levels 
and the Asia Pacific region was responsible for a 
large proportion of this growth. According to the 
report,  NSE  accounted  for  nearly  50  per  cent  of 
total  global  volumes  in  stock  index  options.  The 
total turnover in 2015-16 in the derivatives segment 
was  approximately  14  times  the  turnover  in  the 

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

cash market, but was 8.8 per cent lower than the 
total futures and options (F&O) turnover recorded 
in 2014-15 (Chart 2.10). NSE had a majority share 
in  trading  volumes  at  93.5  per  cent  in  2015-16, 
while BSE contributed only 6.5 per cent, a marked 
decline  from  the  previous  year’s  contribution  of 
26.8 per cent.

Market Turnover

The total number of contracts traded in NSE’s 
derivative  segment  increased  by  14.2  per  cent  to 
209.8 crore in 2015-16 from 183.7 crore in 2014-15; 
whereas,  at  BSE  the  number  of  contracts  traded 
decreased  significantly  by  79.0  per  cent  from  50.5 
crore in 2014-15 to 10.6 crore in 2015-16. The value 
of the contracts traded in NSE’s equity derivatives 
segment increased by 16.6 per cent to ` 6.48 crore 
in 2015-16 from ` 5.56 crore in 2014-15, whereas the 
turnover in the equity derivatives segment at BSE 
was more than halved to ` 44,75,008 crore in 2015-16 
from ` 2,03,62,741 crore in 2014-15. MSEI recorded 
no  turnover  during  the  year.  The  open  interest  in 
NSE’s  derivative  segment  decreased  by  13.9  per 
cent from ` 1,79,344 crore at the end of 2014-15 to ` 
1,54,411 crore at the end of 2015-16; whereas at BSE, 
the open interest for 2015-16 was less than one per 
cent  of  the  previous  year’s  figure  of  `  1,001  crore 
(Table 2.34).

The  monthly  turnover  in  the  derivatives 
segment  at  NSE  recorded  an  encouraging  trend 
during 2015-16. The highest turnover was recorded 
in  February  2016  (`  65,72,745  crore),  followed  by 
March  2016  (`  59,80,733  crore)  and  August  2015 
(`  58,98,674  crore).  Growth  in  BSE’s  derivatives 
turnover shrunk in 2015-16 -- the highest turnover 
was  recorded  in  July  2015  (`  13,27,202  crore), 
followed by June 2015 (` 6,30,200 crore) and August 
2015 (` 6,26,775 crore). The average daily turnover 
at  NSE  in  2015-16  increased  by  14.7  per  cent  to  ` 
2,62,453  crore  from  `  2,28,833  crore  in  2014-15, 
while at BSE it declined to less than a quarter from 
` 83,797 crore to ` 18,117 crore.

 
Index  options  have  gained  a  share  among 
various  derivatives  products  traded  in  the  Indian 
derivatives market. The Financial Year 2013-14 and 

2014-15 saw a surge in turnover in index options to 
the extent that WFE attributed the positive increase 
in derivatives globally to this growth without which 
global  growth  would  have  been  negative.  The 
dominance of index options in derivatives turnover 
extended to 2015-16 (Table 2.35). 

 
During 2015-16, index options accounted for a 
major share at NSE and BSE (75.5 and 98.0 per cent 
respectively).  The  share  of  single  stock  futures  at 
NSE was 12.1 per cent, while it was nil for BSE and 
MSEI. The share of index futures constituted 7.0 per 
cent of the turnover of the NSE derivatives market 
in 2015-16, while contributing a mere 0.3 per cent at 
BSE. In 2015-16, the share of stock options at NSE 
was  5.4  per  cent  while  at  BSE  it  was  1.7  per  cent 
(Chart 2.11).Tables 2.35 and 2.36 cover the trends in 
all the derivatives instruments mentioned here.

C.  Trends in Interest Rates Derivatives

 
Interest  rate  futures  contracts  are  contracts 
based  on  a  list  of  underlying  assets  as  may  be 
specified  by  the  exchange  and  approved  by  SEBI 
from time to time. The underlying asset for interest 
rate futures is an interest bearing instrument. BSE, 
NSE  and  MSEI  started  interest  rate  derivatives 
trading during 2013-14. 

 
Trends  in  turnover  and  open  interest  in  the 
interest  rate  derivatives  at  NSE,  BSE  and  MSEI 
are shown in Table 2.46. During 2015-16, the total 
turnover  in  the  interest  rate  derivative  segment 
registered  an  increase  of  nearly  40  per  cent.  NSE 
witnessed a turnover of ` 5,26,425 crore in 2015-16 
as  compared  to  `  4,21,558  in  2014-15. At  BSE,  the 
turnover increased from ` 41,913 crore in 2014-15 to ` 
1,14,121 crore in 2015-16. MSEI also recorded a surge 
in turnover from ` 10,312 crore in 2014-15 to ` 22,814 
crore in 2015-16. NSE contributed the major share to 
the turnover (79.4 per cent) while BSE contributed 
17.2  per  cent  and  MSEI  contributed  3.4  per  cent  
(Table 2.46).

D.  Trends in VIX Futures Segment

 
NSE  launched  trading  in  futures  contracts 
on  India  VIX  in  the  futures  and  options  segment 
w.e.f.  February  26,  2014.  India  VIX  is  a  volatility 
index  based  on  Nifty’s  index  options  prices. 
India VIX is computed using the best bid and ask 
quotes  of  the  out-of-the-money  near  and  mid-
month  Nifty  options  contracts  which  are  traded 
on  the  F&O  segment  at  NSE.  India  VIX  indicates 
investors’  perceptions  of  the  market’s  volatility  in 

the  near  term.  The  turnover  in  VIX  futures  was  
only `10 crore in 2015-16 compared to ` 2,256 crore 
in 2014-15 (Table 2.47).

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES MARKET

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

I. 

 Overview  of 
derivatives market

the 

Indian 

commodity 

 
In 2015-16, the Indian commodity derivatives 
market witnessed a significant transition when the 
erstwhile commodities market regulator, FMC was 
merged with SEBI with effect from September 28, 
2015.  At  present,  the  Indian  commodity  futures 
market  active  eco-system  comprises  of  three 
national exchanges (NCDEX, MCX and NMCE) and 
three commodity specific regional exchanges (COC 
Hapur,  the  Rajkot  Commodities  Exchange  and 
IPSTA  Kochi).  While  113  commodities  have  been 
permitted  for  trading  in  the  commodities  futures 
market,  38  commodities  were  actively  traded  at 
these  exchanges,  of  which  28  were  agricultural 
commodities  and  10  were  non-agricultural 
commodities.

 
2015-16  had  good  prospects  for  the  Indian 
commodity  derivative  segments  as  most  of  the 
indicators -- volume traded, turnover and number 
of  contracts  traded  --  exhibited  upward  trends. 
While the prices and the indicators in commodities 
market  are  primarily  shaped  by  fundamental 
factors  of  demand-supply,  shifts  in  trajectories  of 
global growth, commodity specific-factors and the 
weather are also vital determinants.

the 

The  broad  performance  of 

 
Indian 
commodity  derivatives  market  can  be  discerned 
from  the  movement  of  the  benchmark  indices- 
MCX  COMDEX  and  NCDEX  Dhaanya.  While 
MCX COMDEX is a composite index of three sub-
indices,  i.e.  MCX  Metal,  MCX  Energy,  and  MCX 
Agri indices, NCDEX Dhaanya is represented by 10 
agri commodities. During 2015-16, MCX COMDEX 
declined 6.3 per cent and NCDEX Dhaanya gained 
15.3  per  cent  respectively  over  March  31,  2015. 

MCX COMDEX closed at 2,731 on March 31, 2016, 
registering  a  fall  of  184  points  over  2,915  as  on 
March 31, 2015. NCDEX Dhaanya increased by 378 
points and closed at 2,857 on March 31, 2016, over 
2,479 as on March 31, 2015 (Chart 2.13).

Chart 2.13: Movement of Benchmark Commodity 

Indices

 
MCX COMDEX recorded a high of 3,276 on 
May 13, 2016, while NCDEX Dhaanya reached the 
highest  level  of  3,023  on  October  15,  2015.  MCX 
COMDEX  recorded  the  lowest  level  of  2,450  on 
January  12,  2016  and  NCDEX  Dhaanya  recorded 
a low of 2,515 on April 1, 2015. The highest gain 
in  the  financial  year  was  3.2  per  cent  for  MCX 
COMDEX recorded on August 27, 2015 and 3.1 per 
cent for NCDEX Dhaanya on October 5, 2015. The 
highest fall of 2.5 per cent in MCX COMDEX was 
observed on July 7, 2015, while NCDEX Dhaanya 
registered the highest fall of 2.1 per cent on June 
15, 2015. Volatility, in annualised terms, increased 
for  both  indices  during  the  year.  The  annualised 
volatility  was  15.0  per  cent  for  NCDEX  Dhaanya 
and  15.3  per  cent  for  MCX  COMDEX  in  2015-16, 
as  compared  to  13.2  per  cent  and  13.1  per  cent 
respectively in 2014-15.

II. 

 International  scenario  in  the  commodity 
derivatives market
Globally, 

 
in  2015-16,  commodity  prices 
continued on a declining trend of past three years, 
reinforced by a slowdown in growth in emerging 

and developed economies that are net exporters of 
commodities.  Waning  growth  prospects  of  China, 
which has been largest consumer of many industrial 
commodities  for  the  last  one  and  a  half  decades, 
accentuated  the  downward  pressure  in  prices  of 

70

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

major  commodity  groups,  especially  metals.  Oil 
prices  declined  mostly  on  account  of  news  about 
strong  supply  magnified  by  risk-off  behaviour  in 
financial markets. Food prices declined as a result 
of a record high harvest and unfavourable weather 
triggered by El Niño. 
IMF  in  its  World  Economic  Outlook  2016  has 
 
highlighted  the  two-sided  risk  in  commodity 
markets.  While  a  further  decline  in  commodity 
prices  may  worsen  the  situation  for  commodity 
producers, ‘increasing yields on energy sector debt 
threaten a broader tightening of credit conditions’. 
The  World  Bank  in  its  outlook  on  commodity 
markets  (2016)  lowered  the  forecasts  for  80  per 
cent  of  the  commodities  in  2016  (37  of  the  46 
commodities that the World Bank monitors), driven 
largely  by  consistent  large  supplies  and  weaker 
demand  in  emerging  markets.  It  opined  that  the 
benefits of lower commodity prices will transform 
into stronger economic growth for importers in the 
long run.

Chart 2.14 represents the monthly movement 
 
of the World Bank commodity indices for a period 
of two years. The Index for Energy, Food and Metal 
has  been  plotted  in  the  graph,  which  shows  a 
declining trend since April 2014.

a sub-group of the Index for Non-Energy and is composed 
of cereals (28.2 per cent), vegetable oils and meals (40.8 per

also a sub-group of the non-energy index and is composed 
of metals excluding precious metals.

III.  Permitted commodities
 
Over the years, the total number of permitted 
commodities  has  declined  at  the  exchanges.  On 
March 31, 2016, NCDEX has the highest number of 
permitted commodities at 25, followed by MCX (16) 
and NMCE (13) (Table 2.49). Permitted commodities 
were the highest for the agri segment at NCDEX and 
MCX. NMCE and the commodity specific regional 
exchanges traded only agri commodities.

4.  MUTUAL FUNDS

 
The  Indian  mutual  fund  industry  has  been, 
and remains, one of the fastest growing and most 
competitive  segments  of  the  securities  market. 
In  2015-16,  the  net  inflows  to  the  industry  were 
the  most  significant  since  2008-09,  and  the  assets 
under management were at an all-time high. This 
growth  may  be  jointly  attributed  to  a  positive 
outlook in domestic markets along with well-timed 
initiatives by SEBI to re-energise the mutual fund 
industry.  During  2015-16,  the  regulatory  reforms 
undertaken  by  SEBI 
introduction 
of  mandatory  stress  testing  of  Liquid  Fund  and 
Money  Market  Mutual  Fund  (MMMF)  schemes, 
modification of product labelling in mutual funds, 
relaxation of restrictions on managing/advising of 
offshore pooled funds by domestic fund managers, 
tightening  of  exposure  limits  on  investments  by 
mutual funds, and enhancement of scheme related 
disclosures.

Chart 2.20: Trends in Resource Mobilisation by 

Mutual Funds

 
In  2015-16,  mutual  funds  showed  a  positive 
growth in terms of net resource mobilisation. The 
gross mobilisation of resources by all mutual funds 
was  `  1,37,65,555  crore  compared  to  `  1,10,86,259 
crore during the previous year, showing an increase 
of 24.2 per cent over the previous year (Table 2.57). 
Correspondingly,  redemption  increased  by  24.1 
per  cent  to  `  1,36,31,374  crore  in  2015-16  from  ` 
1,09,82,971  crore  in  2014-15.  The  net  resources 
mobilised by all the mutual funds in 2015-16 was 
` 1,34,180 crore compared to net mobilisation of ` 
1,03,287 crore in 2014-15, showing a rise of 30 per 
cent.  In  equity  oriented  schemes  there  was  a  net 
inflow of ` 74,026 crore in 2015-16.
 
The  AUM  of  mutual  funds  industry  has 
witnessed  a  constant  growth  and  it  increased 
by  nearly  `  6.41  lakh  crore  in  last  five  years.  The 
cumulative  net  assets  of  all  mutual  funds  as  on 
March  31,  2016  was  `  12,32,824  crore  as  against  ` 
10,82,757 crore on March 31, 2015, representing an 
increase of 13.9 per cent (Chart 2.20).

Sector-wise Resource Mobilisation
 
Like in the previous year, private sector mutual 
funds retained their dominance in the mutual fund 
industry in 2015-16, with a share of 80.8 per cent in 
gross resource mobilisation and 68.1 per cent in net 
resource mobilisation. The corresponding share of 
UTI mutual funds and other public sector mutual 
funds was 8.1 per cent and 11.1 per cent respectively 
in  gross  resource  mobilisation.  In  absolute  terms, 
gross  resource  mobilisation  by  the  private  sector 
mutual funds rose by 21.7 per cent to ` 1,11,26,277 
crore  in  2015-16  from  `  91,43,962  crore  in  2014-15 
(Table  2.58).  Net  resource  mobilisation  by  private 
sector mutual funds, however, declined to ` 91,394 
crore  in  2015-16  compared  to  `  1,03,700  crore  in 
2014-15.

 
The  share  of  public  sector  mutual  funds  in 
net  resource  mobilisation  increased  significantly

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

from the previous year (wherein they contributed 
a  mere  0.8  per  cent).  In  2015-16,  public  sector 
mutual  funds  contributed  20.4  per  cent  to  the  net 
resource  mobilisation,  not  including  UTI  mutual 
funds’ share of 11.5 per cent. Net resources raised 

by  public  sector  mutual  funds  (including  the  UTI 
mutual  fund),  although  lesser  than  the  private 
sector,  represented  an  astonishing  increase,  from 
outflows  of  `  412  crore  in  2014-15  to  inflows  of  ` 
42,787 crore in 2015-16.

Note: UTI figures are reported with public sector mutual funds.

 
In  contrast  to  the  trends  observed  in  the 
past,  during  2015-16,  both  open-ended  and  close-
ended schemes witnessed overall net inflows. Only 
close-ended and interval schemes of private sector 
mutual funds witnessed net outflows.

 
A scheme-wise pattern reveals that net inflows 
were positive for all the scheme categories except 
the  fund  of  funds  investing  overseas  schemes. 

Growth/equity  oriented  schemes  registered  the 
highest  net  inflows  in  2015-16,  amounting  to  ` 
74,026  crore,  followed  by  income/debt  oriented 
schemes at ` 33,008 crore. Non-ELSS schemes under 
growth/equity oriented schemes registered inflows 
of ` 67,612 crore, followed by balanced schemes at ` 
19,742 crore and liquid/money market schemes at ` 
17,108 crore (Table 2.59).

Over  the  past  several  years,  mutual  fund 
investments  in  equity  have  been  outweighed  by 
investments in debt; 2015-16 continued in the same 
vein.  During  2015-16,  combined  net  investments 
by mutual funds in debt and equity were` 4,42,436 
crore  as  compared  to  `  6,27,741  crore  in  2014-15, 
indicating a decrease of 15.2 per cent (Table 2.61). 
Net  investments  by  mutual  funds  in  the  equity 
segment  were  `  66,144  crore,  whereas  their  net 
investments  in  the  debt  segment  were  `  3,76,292 
crore  during  the  same  period.  The  positive  trend 
by mutual funds in the equity segment in 2014-15 
continued even during 2015-16. 

Total  net  investments  were  the  highest  in 
 
March 2016 (` 72,144 crore) followed by June 2015 

(` 64,980 crore). Net investments of mutual funds in 
the debt and equity segment were positive for all the 
months except in March 2016 in the equity segment.

Unit Holding Patterns

 
As on March 31, 2016, 97.5 per cent of the total 
folios were subscribed to by the individual category, 
their share in the total net assets being 46.7 per cent. 
On  the  other  hand,  corporate/institutions  had  a 
miniscule share of 0.8 per cent in the total number 
of folios and a significant share of 48.8 per cent in 
total net assets. As compared to 2014-15, the share of 
corporates in total net assets increased marginally 
while  their  share  in  folios  declined  marginally. 
NRIs/OCBs with 1.7 per cent share in folios had a 
3.6 per cent share in total net assets (Table 2.62).

with  a  higher  number  of  folios  and  greater  net 
assets. While private sector mutual funds had a 66 
per cent share in total folios of around 4.8 crore, the 
corresponding share of public sector mutual funds 

(including the UTI mutual fund) was 34 per cent as 
at the end of March 2016. In total net assets worth 
` 12.3 lakh crore as on March 31, 2016, the share of 
private sector mutual funds stood at 82.9 per cent as

 INTERMEDIARIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIES MARKET

I. 

Portfolio Managers

 
A  portfolio  manager  is  a  body  corporate 
which,  pursuant  to  a  contract  or  arrangement 
with  a  client,  advises  or  directs  or  undertakes  on 
behalf  of  the  client  (whether  as  a  discretionary 
portfolio manager or otherwise), the management 
or administration of a portfolio of securities or the 
client’s  funds.  Portfolio  managers  are  registered 
and  regulated  under  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers) 
Regulations, 1993.

 
Wealth  management  industry  in  India  is 
steadily  growing  with  the  rise  an  increase  in  the 
number of HNIs and also in wealth. This is evident 
in  the  expanding  clientele  base  of  the  portfolio 
management industry. The total number of clients 
increased to 52,288 in 2015-16 from 46,706 in 2014-
15. While the number of clients taking discretionary 
and  non-discretionary  services  increased,  those 

Table 2.64: Assets Managed by Portfolio Managers

opting for advisory services decreased in 2015-16. 
In the clientele base, the dominant share was that of 
clients taking discretionary services (88.1 per cent 
of the total number of clients).
 
The  AUM  of  the  portfolio  management 
industry increased by 12.7 per cent to ` 10,45,428 crore 
from  `  9,27,385  crore  in  2014-15.  The  discretionary 
services  offered  to  EPFO/PFs  constituted  70.3  per 
cent  of  the  total  assets  under  the  management  of 
portfolio  managers  followed  by  advisory  services 
which constituted 16.7 per cent. In 2015-16, the AUM 
of  discretionary  portfolio  managers,  managing 
EPFO/PF funds, increased by 16.4 per cent over the 
previous  year  (Table  2.64).  The AUM/GDP  ratio  of 
portfolio  managers  has  been  witnessing  a  growth 
every year and stood at 7.7 per cent in 2015-16 while 
the AUM/GDP ratio mutual fund industry was 9.1 
per  cent,  indicating  the  near  comparable  levels  of 
asset managed by both sectors.

II.  Alternative Investment Funds

 
SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (AIF  Regulations) 
on  May  21,  2012  providing  for  three  categories 
of  alternative  investment  funds  (AIFs)  which 
subsumed the existing venture capital funds (VCFs) 
and foreign venture capital investors (FVCIs). AIFs 
regulations  endeavour  to  extend  the  perimeter  of 
regulation  to  unregulated  funds  with  a  view  to 
systemic  stability,  increasing  market  efficiency, 
encouraging  the  formation  of  new  capital  and 
consumer  protection.  The  main  source  of  active 

capital provided by private equity (PE) or venture 
capital (VC) etc. plays a very important role in the 
growth of the corporate sector and it brings a lot of 
governance  and  good  quality  money  on  the  table 
of  an  investee  company.  In  view  of  this,  SEBI  is 
striving  to  introduce  reforms  in  this  private  fund 
industry  so  as  to  facilitate  capital-raising  by AIFs 
and for boosting entrepreneurship. 

Since  the  implementation  of  the  regulations,  209 
AIFs had been registered with SEBI as on March 31, 
2016. The figures show that while Category I made

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

PART TWO: Trends and Operations

investments  of  `  2,828  crore,  Category  III  made 
investments of ` 3,907 crore. Category II (comprising 
of  private  equity  funds  and  debt  funds)  made  the 
highest  investments  of  `  11,502  crore.  The  total 
investments made by AIFs in 2015-16 were ` 18,237 
crore as compared to  ` 7,357 crore in the previous 
financial year. The cumulative amount mobilised by 
AIFs as on March 31, 2016 is shown in Table 2.65.

The existing VCFs/FVCIs continue to be regulated 
as per the SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996 and SEBI 
(FVCI)  Regulations,  2000.  The  cumulative  net 
investment  of  VCFs  increased  by  2.3  per  cent  in 
2015-16  to  `  37,410  crore  from  `  36,563  crore  in 
2014-15.  Net  investments  by  FVCIs  registered  an 
increase  of  1.1  per  cent  to  reach  `  44,984  crore  in 
2015-16 (Table 2.66).

FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT

 
Sustained capital inflows -portfolio and direct 
-  is  a  sine  qua  non  for  any  economy.  In  particular, 
the  challenge  is  creating  favourable  conditions 
for continuous inflow of foreign capital, retaining 
it  and  utilising  it  for  productive  purposes  like 
infrastructure  and  other  investment  needs.  The 
new  policy  initiatives  in  the  FY16  Budget  are 
also  aimed  at  projecting  to  the  world  that  India 
is  attracting  larger  foreign  investments.  The  FPI 
regime  commenced  with  effect  from  June  1,  2014 
wherein  the  existing  FIIs,  sub-accounts  and  QFIs 
were merged to form a new investor class termed 
as foreign portfolio investor (FPI). 

 
As on March 31, 2016, there were 8,717 FPIs 
registered  as  compared  to  8,214  on  March  31, 
2015.  There  were  19  registered  custodians  and 
18  registered  designated  depository  participants 
(DDPs) as on March 31, 2016. Based on the country 
of  incorporation,  the  number  of  FPIs  registered 
were  the  highest  from  USA  (2,993),  followed  by 
Luxembourg  (971),  Canada  (638)  and  Mauritius 
(608).  The  Countries  like  Philippines,  Bahamans, 
Israel and Brazil each had only one registered FPI. 
(Chart 2.21) In terms of AUC as well, FPIs from the 
USA  had  the  maximum  assets  under  custody  (` 
6,87,853 crore), followed by Mauritius at ` 4,31,729 
crore, Singapore at ` 2,50,903 crore and Luxembourg 
at ` 1,91,218 crore.

Table 2.67: Investments by FPIs

Chart 2.21: Country-wise number of registered 

FPIs

 
During 2015-16, FPI investments in India saw 
a  great  decline  as  compared  to  the  previous  year 
with  the  net  investments  being  negative  for  the 
first  time  since  2008-09.  India  witnessed  negative 
FPI net investments of ` 18,175 crore during 2015-
16  as  compared  to  positive  net  investments  of  ` 
2,77,460 crore in 2014-15. In US$ terms, the negative 
net investments amounted to US$ 2,523 million in 
2015-16  compared  to  positive  net  investments  of 
US$ 45,698 million in 2014-15. The combined gross 
purchases  of  debt  and  equity  by  FPIs  decreased 
by  14.9  per  cent  to  `  13,24,418  crore  in  2015-16 
from ` 15,21,346 crore in 2014-15 (Table 2.67). The 
combined gross sales by FPIs increased by 7.4 per 
cent to ` 13,42,593 crore in 2015-16 from ` 12,43,886 
crore during the previous year.

An analysis of FPI net investments reveals that 
there were negative net investments in both equity 
and debt segments during 2015-16. FPI negative net 
investments  in  debt  were  also  observed  in  2013-
14. During 2015-16, the announcement of increase 
in FPI limits in debt securities increased buoyancy 
in  the  market.  The  market  however,  continued  to 
lose some of its gains after October 2015, owing to 
fresh concerns about global cues, as well as some 
domestic  concerns.  Before  2015-16,  the  last  time 
when  FPI  net  investments  in  equity  was  negative 
was in 2008-09, at the time of a global melt-down 
on account of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. 2015-
16 was the first instance since 1992 where FPI net 
investments in equity and debt were both negative. 
(Table 2.68)

 
During  2015-16,  the  highest  net  investments 
were  registered  during  October  2015  (`  22,350 
crore)  followed  by  March  2016  (`  19,667  crore). 
Net  investments  in  the  equity  segment  were 
highest  during  March  2016  (`  21,142  crore)  while 
net investments in the debt segment were highest 
during October 2015 (` 15,701 crore). 
 
Details  regarding  the  debt  investment  limits 
allocated  to  FPIs  through  the  auction  mechanism 
during 2015-16 are given in Table 2.69.

Pursuant to the announcement of the medium-
term  framework  for  FPI  limits  in  government 
securities  announced  by  RBI  in  its  fourth  bi-
monthly policy statement for FY 2015-16, the limits 
for  FPI  investments  in  debt  securities  are  being 
announced / fixed in rupee terms. A separate limit 
for investments by FPIs in state development loans 
(SDLs) has also been introduced. Further, as per the 

framework, the debt limits will be increased every 
half  year  in  March  and  September  and  released 
every quarter. 
 
Tables  2.70a-2.70c  provide  a  glimpse  of  FPI 
investment  limits  in  government  securities  and 
corporate  bonds  as  well  as  the  re-investment  of  
coupons in government securities as on March 31,

 OTHER  ACTIVITIES  HAVING  A  BEARING  ON  THE  WORKING  OF  THE 
SECURITIES MARKET

I. 

Corporate Bond Markets

Well-developed  corporate  bond  markets 
 
which provide support to economic developments 
are  crucial  for  a  developing  country  like  India  to 
augment  long  term  fund  requirements  for  firms 
and for facilitating the much needed infrastructure 
financing. This market is perceived as an alternative 
source  of  finance  that  supplements  the  other 
available  sources  of  fund  raising  for  corporates. 
In the recent years, significant policy attention has 
been directed towards reviving and nurturing the 
growth of the corporate bond markets in India. The 
Government of India has initiated several measures 
for the deepening of the corporate bond market in 
India.

 
It  has  been  observed  that  the  industry  has 
gradually expanded its reach towards the corporate 
bond market thereby reducing its reliance on bank 
credit.  The  percentage  share  of  the  outstanding 
amount of corporate bonds has increased from 17 
per cent in the financial year 2011-12 to 20 per cent 
in  2015-16,  whereas  the  percentage  share  of  the 
amount outstanding with respect to the bank credit 
has gradually declined from 73 per cent in 2011-12 
to 65 per cent in the 2015-16. In line with previous 
years,  in  2015-16,  too,  the  private  placement  of 

debt issues out-scored that of public issues. Private 
placement  continued  to  be  the  preferred  route  by 
investors for its perceived advantages of operational 
ease, minimal disclosures and lower costs. Finding 
ways to make public offerings more attractive will 
help  to  bring  in  the  retail  investors,  and  address 
the  liquidity  problem  in  this  segment’s  secondary 
market. 
Reporting platforms for corporate bonds are 
 
maintained  by  BSE,  NSE  and  MSEI.  Reporting  of 
secondary market transactions in corporate bonds 
was  discontinued  at  FIMMDA  with  effect  from 
April  1,  2014.  MSEI  started  the  reporting  in  July 
2013, but the volumes reported at the platform have 
been  insignificant.  In  2015-16,  NSE  continued  to 
be the largest reporting platform for OTC deals in 
corporate bond markets. The share of NSE in total 
reporting witnessed a decrease from 81.3 per cent 
in 2014-15 to 79.7 per cent in 2015-16. The number 
of trades reported at NSE decreased in 2015-16 to 
53,223; as did the value of trades, to ` 8,14,756 crore 
over  the  previous  financial  year.  During  2015-16, 
the  total  value  of  corporate  bond  trades  reported 
at BSE increased by 1.5 per cent to ` 2,07,652 crore 
from ` 2,04,506 crore in 2014-15, while the number 
of trades decreased by 4.6 per cent over the previous 
financial year (Table 2.73).

II.   The Wholesale Debt Market 
During  2015-16,  turnover  in  the  wholesale 
 
debt  market  (WDM)  segment  at  NSE  decreased 
from ` 7,72,369 crore in 2014-15 to ` 5,69,495 crore, 
showing a decline of 26.3 per cent in the financial 
year.  The  net  traded  value  of  `  66,104  crore  was 
the  highest  in  2015-16,  recorded  in  April  2015. 
The  number  of  trades  at  1,400  was  the  highest  in 
September 2015. The second highest turnover was 
recorded in October 2015 (` 54,664 crore) followed 

by  September  2015  (`  54,269  crore).  Like  the  net 
traded value, the number of trades at NSE’s WDM 
segment  witnessed  a  decline  in  2015-16  to  14,676 
from  18,789  in  2014-15.  At  BSE,  the  turnover  for 
2015-16 increased by 26.9 per cent to ` 4,83,887 crore 
from ` 3,81,328 crore in 2014-15, with the number of 
trades increasing 19 times to 2,49,394 from 13,132 in 
2014-15. Both the net traded value (` 54,971 crore) 
and the number of trades (37,222) were the highest 
in March 2016 (Table 2.75).

Functions of the Securities and Exchange board
 of India with respect to matters specified in 
Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

1. 

 REGULATION OF BUSINESS IN STOCK EXCHANGES

A stock exchange is a platform for facilitating 

price  discovery  of  various  instruments 
available for trading. Stock exchanges play 
an important role in efficient allocation of resources 
in any economy as the prices discovered provide a 
signal  for  efficient  allocation  of  financial  resources 
across corporations. Apart from providing platforms 
for 
trading,  stock  exchanges  have  also  been 
entrusted  with  various  regulatory  responsibilities 
for ensuring market integrity and for protecting the 
interests  of  investors.  The  regulatory  functions  of 
stock exchanges include issuer regulation, member 
regulation,  trading  regulation,  investor  protection, 
maintaining the investor protection funds (IPFs) and 
product  design.  They  also  undertake  a  wide  array 
of  support  functions  like  training  and  education, 
information/data services and technology solutions.

I. 

RECOGNITION OF STOCK EXCHANGES

 
Stock  exchanges  are  granted  recognition  for 
their operations in the securities market by SEBI under 
Section  4  of  the  SCRA,  1956. As  on  March  31,  2016 

there were seven stock exchanges in India, of which 
four  have  been  granted  permanent  recognition,  the 
Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India Ltd. has been 
granted renewal of recognition while the remaining 
two  stock  exchanges,  Magadh  Stock  Exchange  and 
the  Delhi  Stock  Exchange,  have  been  de-recognised 
and  are  in  the  process  of  exiting.  Out  of  the  four 
permanent  exchanges,  Ahmedabad  Stock  Exchange 
and Calcutta Stock Exchange are also in the process 
of exit. Pursuant to the exit policy for de-recognised/
non-operational  stock  exchange  notified  by  SEBI  in 
2012, 17 stock exchanges have exited so far. Of these, 
12  exited  during  2012-13,  2013-14  and  2014-15  and 
five  more  stock  exchanges  exited  during  2015-16  
(Tables 3.1-3.3).

 
Among the seven stock exchanges, the Bombay 
Stock Exchange (BSE), the National Stock Exchange 
(NSE)  and  the  Metropolitan  Stock  Exchange  of 
India  (MSEI)  have  been  granted  permission  for 
carrying out trade in four segments -- equity, equity 
derivatives,  currency  derivatives  and  interest  rate 
derivatives.

 GRANT OF RENEWAL OF RECOGNITION 
TO CLEARING CORPORATIONS

 
By exercising the powers conferred by Section 
4  read  with  Sub-section  (4)  of  Section  8A  of  the

notified in the Gazette of India.

III. 

 REGULATION 
CORPORATIONS

OF 

CLEARING 

 
In  order  to  regulate  clearing  corporations 
more  effectively  and  with  a  view  to  bring  about 
uniformity  in  the  matter  of  obtaining  information 
from  clearing  corporations  in  the  areas  of,  inter-

alia, administration, clearing and settlement related 
activities,  net  worth  and  shareholding,  SEBI  has 
advised  the  clearing  corporations  to  submit  a 
monthly report in the prescribed format providing 
details  with  respect  to  daily  settlement  values, 
settlement  shortages,  penalties  imposed,  corpus  of 
core  SGF  and  the  composition  of  their  governing 
board and shareholding patterns.

IV. 

 MEMORANDUM  OF  UNDERSTANDING 
(MOU) BETWEEN STOCK EXCHANGES
 
As  per  Section  13A  of  the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation) Act, 1956, a stock exchange may establish 
an  additional  trading  floor  offered  by  a  recognised 
stock  exchange  outside  its  area  of  operation  to 
enable  investors  to  buy  and  sell  securities  through 
the trading floor under the regulatory framework of 
that stock exchange with the prior approval of SEBI. 
Under  this  provision,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Stock 
Exchange entered into an MoU with BSE and NSE and 
the  Madras  Stock  Exchange  and  the  Calcutta  Stock 
Exchange entered into MoUs with NSE and BSE.

SEBI Annual Report

However,  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  exit 
policy,  the  MoU  mechanism,  if  any,  between  a 
stock  exchange  (not  having  a  nation-wide  trading 
terminal)  and  a  stock  exchange  (having  a  nation-
wide trading terminal) will be discontinued.
 
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the  voluntary  exit 
applications  by  the  Madras  Stock  Exchange  and 
the  Madhya  Pradesh  Stock  Exchange,  the  MoU 
arrangement  between  the  Madras  Stock  Exchange 
and NSE was discontinued with effect from January 
31, 2015 and the MoU between the Madhya Pradesh 
Stock Exchange and BSE and the Madhya Pradesh 
Stock  Exchange  and  NSE  were  discontinued  with 
effect from March 26, 2015.

V. 

EXIT OF STOCK EXCHANGES

SEBI  formulated  the  exit  policy  for  de-
 
recognised/non-operational  stock  exchanges 
in 
2012.  Subsequent  to  this,  SEBI  was  in  receipt  of 
from  de-recognised/non-operational 
applications 

stock  exchanges  seeking  voluntary  exit  as  stock 
exchanges. In order to facilitate the exit process for 
such exchanges, SEBI took several policy initiatives.

 
SEBI  has  also  advised  exchanges  which  have 
nation-wide  trading  terminals  to  facilitate  shifting 
of  such  companies  to  the  dissemination  board  for 
a  one-time  fee  of  ` 5,000  per  company.  Further,  in 
order  to  facilitate  the  listing  of  companies  which 
have already moved to the dissemination board and 
in the interest of the investors in such companies, the 
SEBI Board in its meeting held on January 22, 2015 
decided  to  allow  a  timeline  of  18  months,  within 
which  such  companies  will  have  to  obtain  listings 
upon  compliance  with  the  listing  requirements  of 
the nation-wide stock exchange.

 
Pursuant to these measures, 17 de-recognised/
non-operational  stock  exchanges  had  exited  as  on 
March 31, 2016 (Table 3.4).

 NATION-WIDE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN 
FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES 
(SMES)

 
SEBI  has  initiated  awareness  programmes 
in  coordination  with  SIDBI  and  stock  exchanges 
to  interact  with  SMEs  from  different  clusters 
and  familiarise  them  with  the  facilities  that  are 
being  offered  by  stock  exchanges  for  their  benefit. 
During  the  year,  various  SMEs  meets  were  held 
in  Vishakhapatnam,  Patna,  Vijayawada,  Indore, 
Nagpur,  Raipur  and  Durg.  SMEs  events  were 
also  held  along  with  the  local  office  inauguration 
programme  in  Raipur  and  Patna  where  state 
industrial bodies were invited and in which the state 
machinery also participated.

 
Technical  sessions  were  a  part  of  these 
programmes  wherein  stock  exchanges  interacted 
with SMEs in small groups, apprised them about the 
regulatory parameters for SMEs and addressed their 
queries  and  apprehensions.  The  technical  sessions 
were  followed  by  the  main  event  in  which  SEBI’s 
senior management, SIDBI and the stock exchanges 
addressed SME representatives.

Considering 

 
the  concerns  expressed  by 
exclusively  listed  companies  and  in  the  interest  of 
the  market,  SEBI  has  allowed  a  further  timeline  of 
18  months  within  which  such  companies  have  to 
obtain  a  listing  upon  compliance  with  the  listing 
requirements of a nation-wide stock exchange. Until 
such  a  listing,  these  companies  will  continue  to 
remain in the dissemination board.

 
It  has  been  directed  that  all  the  promoters 
and  directors  of  such  companies  who  have  failed 
to  provide  to  their  shareholders  trading  platforms 
or  exit  even  after  the  extended  time  of  18  months 
will have to undergo stricter scrutiny for any future 
association with the securities market. Any company/
entity/person that has/is a promoter or director whose 
company is in the dissemination board and proposes

in  any  capacity  has  to  demonstrate  that  they  have 
made  adequate  efforts  for  providing  exit  to  their 
shareholders  and  that  upon  failure  of  such  efforts, 
such companies have remained on the dissemination 
board. This is notwithstanding any other action that 
may  be  taken  against  such  promoters/directors/
companies by SEBI.

B. 

 ENSURING  COMPLIANCE  BY  LISTED 
STOCK EXCHANGES

• 

 
SEBI  has  prescribed  the  following  modalities 
to ensure compliance by listed stock exchanges with 
the provisions of SECC Regulations:

• 

• 

 A listed stock exchange to ensure holding of 51 
per cent by the public at all times: In order to 
ensure that this limit prescribed by Regulation 
17(1)  is  held  by  the  public  at  all  times  and 
the  holding  of  trading  members/associates/
agents does not exceed 49 per cent, when the 
total such holding reaches a 45 per cent limit, 
further acquisition of shares will only be after 
approval of the listed stock exchange. In any 
event  of  breach  of  the  49  per  cent  threshold, 
the voting rights and all corporate actions will 
be frozen with respect to such excess holding 
and this will have to be disposed of through a 
special window within a stipulated period. The 
details of the shareholding will be disclosed on 
a continuous basis on the website of the listed 
stock exchange and the stock exchange where 
its shares are listed.

 Ensuring  that  all  shareholders  are  fit  and 
proper: In the pre-listing scenario, the exchange 
coming out with a public offering shall include 
a  declaration  in  the  application  form  stating 
that  the  applicant  is  fit  and  proper  in  terms 
of Regulation 19 and 20 of SECC Regulations, 
2012. In the post listing scenario, the text of the 
applicable  regulation  with  regard  to  fit  and 
proper shall be made part of the contract note. 
If  a  person  not  being  fit  and  proper  acquires 

• 

C. 

shares of the listed stock exchange, it will be 
directed to sell the shares within a stipulated 
time  period,  failing  which  the  voting  rights 
and  other  corporate  actions  would  be  frozen 
till  the  time  such  holding  is  divested.  The 
listed stock exchange shall submit to SEBI on a 
quarterly basis an exceptional report regarding 
the  shareholders  who  are  not  fit  and  proper 
and action taken thereof.

 Ensuring  that  shareholders  holding  shares 
above two per cent are fit and proper: Those 
acquiring more than two per cent have to seek 
SEBI’s approval within 15 days of acquisition 
as  per  Regulation  19(2)  and  those  intending 
to acquire shares beyond five per cent as per 
Regulation  19(3)  have  to  seek  prior  approval 
from SEBI.

 Ensuring  shareholding  threshold  of  five  per 
cent or 15 per cent as the case may be in terms 
of SECC Regulations: The depository will put 
in place a necessary mechanism to ensure that 
no shareholder of a listed stock exchange gets 
credit of shares beyond five per cent or 15 per 
cent  as  applicable.  The  depository  will  also 
generate  an  alert  in  case  anybody’s  holding 
exceeds  two  per  cent  to  ensure  compliance 
with  Regulation  19  of  the  SECC  Regulations. 
In  case  the  applicable  threshold  is  breached, 
the  depository  will  inform  the  listed  stock 
exchange  for  consequential  action  such  as 
freezing voting rights and all corporate actions 
with respect to such excess holdings till they 
are divested.

 REGISTRATION AND REGULATION OF WORKING OF INTERMEDIARIES 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIES MARKET

 
Regulation of market intermediaries has three 
objectives -- to protect client assets from insolvency 
of  the  intermediaries  and  guard  against  defaults 
and sudden disruption to the market; to ensure that 
intermediaries are fair and diligent in dealing with 
their clients; and to reduce conflict of interest. The 
regulation  sets  qualifying  standards,  prudential 
standards,  internal  controls  and  risk  management 
standards  and  enforces  a  code  of  conduct.  In 
order  to  enhance  the  confidence  of  investors,  it  is 
necessary that all the intermediaries maintain high 
standards of integrity and fairness and also act with 
due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of their 
business with high levels of compliance. The various 
intermediaries’ regulations have been framed under 
the  SEBI  Act,  1992  and  the  Depositories  Act,  1996 
for  the  registration  and  regulation  of  all  market 
intermediaries.  Under  these  acts,  the  government

(Table  3.10).  Pursuant  to  amendments  to  the  SEBI 
(Stock  Brokers  and  Sub-brokers)  Regulations,  1992, 

segment-wise  and  category-wise  registration  for 
stock  brokers  has  been  done  away  with.  Instead,  a 
single registration is granted to stock brokers/clearing 
members, that is, a single registration across all stock 
exchanges irrespective of any particular segment.

II.  REGISTRATION OF SUB-BROKERS

 
During 2015-16, 50 sub-brokers were granted 
registration.  The  number  of  registered  sub-brokers 
declined by 16.8 per cent from 42,351 as on March 31, 
2015 to 35,246 as on March 31, 2016.This is on top of a 
18.7 per cent decline in registered brokers in 2014-15.
However,  the  number  of  authorised  persons  (APs) 
as  approved  by  the  stock  exchanges  in  accordance 
with the SEBI guidelines increased during the year 

from 1,84,553 as on March 31, 2015 to 1,86,148 as on 
March 31, 2016, showing an increase of 0.86 per cent 
from the previous year. Stock brokers were allowed 
to provide market access to clients through APs in 
addition to sub-brokers, with a view to expanding the 
reach of the markets for exchange traded products. 
Thus, while the number of sub-brokers declined, the 
increased presence of APs ensured the reach of the 
markets for exchange traded products (Table 3.14).

 REGISTRATION OF FOREIGN PORTFOLIO 
INVESTORS AND CUSTODIANS

SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (Foreign  Portfolio 
 
Investors)  Regulations,  2014  on  January  7,  2014. 
Accordingly,  the  foreign  portfolio  investor  regime 
commenced  from  June  1,  2014,  revamping  the 
existing  FII  and  sub-account  structure.  As  per  the 
new  regime,  all  existing  FIIs,  sub-accounts  and 
qualified foreign investors (QFIs) have been merged 
into new single category, ‘foreign portfolio investors’ 
(FPIs).

 
The  FPI  Regulations  define  the  term  ‘foreign 
portfolio  investor’  (FPI)  as  a  person  who  satisfies 
the eligibility criteria prescribed under Regulation 4 
of the FPI Regulations, 2014 and has been registered 

under  Chapter  II  of  the  FPI  Regulations,  2014. Any 
foreign institutional investor (FII), sub-account or QFI 
who holds a valid certificate of registration shall be 
deemed to be an FPI until the expiry of the block of 
three years for which fees have been paid as per the 
SEBI  (Foreign  Institutional  Investors)  Regulations, 
1995.

As  on  March  31,  2016  there  were  8,717  FPIs 
 
registered  with  SEBI.  These  included  4,311  FPIs 
registered as per the new SEBI FPI Regulations, 2014 
and 4,406 deemed FPIs (952 erstwhile registered FIIs 
and 3,454 erstwhile registered sub-accounts, whose 
registration validity period had not expired). As per 
the FPI regime, SEBI-approved designated depository 
participants  (DDPs)  will  grant  registration  to  FPIs 
on  behalf  of  SEBI  and  also  carry  out  other  allied 
activities. FPIs should engage a DDP before making 
investments  in  the  Indian  securities  market. As  on 
March 31, 2016, 18 DDPs had been registered with 
SEBI (Table 3.17).

(whether  as  a  discretionary  portfolio  manager  or 
otherwise)  the  management  or  administration  of  a 
portfolio of securities or the funds of the client as the 
case may be. As on March 31, 2016, there were 202 
portfolio managers registered with SEBI as compared 
to  188  on  March  31,  2015. An  ‘investment  adviser’

engaged  in  the  business  of  providing  investment 
advice  to  clients  or  other  persons  or  a  group  of 
persons,  and  also  refers  to  persons  who  hold  out

V. 

 AGGREGATION OF AMOUNT SET ASIDE 
FOR 
INVESTOR  EDUCATION  AND 
AWARENESS

 
In  accordance  with  the  SEBI  policy,  mutual 
funds (MFs) are mandated to set aside (annually) at 
least 2 bps on daily net assets for investor education 
and  awareness  initiatives.  The  feedback  of  SEBI’s 
officials on the utilisation of this fund during their 
on-site  visits  to  investor  awareness  programmes 
(IAPs) conducted by asset management companies 
(AMCs) was not very encouraging. Therefore, SEBI, 
in  consultation  with  the  Mutual  Fund  Advisory

 PROMOTION AND REGULATION OF SELF-REGULATORY ORGANISATIONS

 
SEBI  (Self-Regulatory  Organisations),  2004 
were  notified  with  the  objective  of  promoting 
the  organisation  of  intermediaries  representing  a 
particular segment of the securities market as a self-
regulated entity/organisation.

 
During 2013-14, SEBI decided to have a single 
self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for distributors of 
mutual fund products and a two stage procedure for 
grant of recognition as SRO for distributors of mutual 

fund products, that is, grant of in-principle approval 
and  grant  of  recognition.  SEBI  received  three 
applications  for  recognition  as  SRO.  Subsequently, 
in the matter regarding selection of SRO, a case was 
filed before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). 
The  SAT  disposed  the  case  through  its  final  order 
dated September 30, 2015. An appeal has been filed 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the order 
of SAT by one of the applicants.

 FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES

 
To  protect  the  interests  of  investors  and  to 
promote  a  fair  and  orderly  securities  market,  SEBI 
ensures the integrity of markets by detecting market 
frauds  on  a  proactive  basis,  investigating  abusive, 
manipulative  or  illegal  trading  practices  in  the 
securities market and taking punitive steps to punish 
the manipulators. Surveillance helps in ensuring the 
integrity of the markets by enabling a safe and sound 
environment where buyers and sellers are willing to 
participate confidently.

 TYPES  OF  FRAUDULENT  AND  UNFAIR 
TRADE PRACTICES

 A promoter and a major shareholder discussed 
the  proposed  delisting  of 
the  company 
without  any  active  participation  from  retail 
shareholders  before  making  announcement 
thereof.  Such  an  act  was  committed  by  the 
promoter  and  the  major  shareholder  with 
an  intent  to  circumvent  the  normal  price 
discovery of reverse book building process as 
the delisting price would be influenced by the 
major shareholder.

 With  relation  to  an  IPO  the  issuer  company, 
contrary  to  statements/  disclosures  in  the 
prospectus,  used  IPO  proceeds  to  fund  net 
buyers who supported the price on listing day 
and  to  fund  group  companies  in  the  form  of 
Inter Corporate Deposits (ICDs). Money from 
IPO proceeds was not utilized as per object of 
the issue. Some money was siphoned off and 
company also diverted the issue proceeds.

 A  company  circulated  text  messages  in  the 
market  regarding  its  dividend  declaration. 
A  group  of  certain  company  related  entities 
were  observed  to  be  buying  shares  before 
the  messages  were  circulated  in  the  market 
regarding  dividend  declaration  by 
the 
company and subsequently selling the shares 
in the market after the circulation of messages.

These  entities  entered  into  manipulative  and 
unfair trading practices such as synchronised 
trades/reversal  of  trades  within  the  group 
and self- trades which resulted in an artificial 
volume being created.

 A company and its related entities committed 
fraud  by  planting  false/misleading  news  of  a 
proposed buy-back and payment of dividend 
which  influenced  the  price  of  the  company’s 
scrip.

 Non-disclosure of loans taken by a company in 
the IPO prospectus.

loans, 

interest  and 

 A company and its directors reported false and 
misleading  financial  results  by  understating 
outstanding 
finance 
charges,  resulting  in  overstatement  of  profits 
and  reserves.  The  company  carried  out  buy-
back of its own shares on the overstated profit/ 
reserves.  The  actual  reserves  of  the  company 
were not sufficient to carry out the buy-back. 
Further,  the  buy-back  price  was  announced 
at 234% of the prevailing market price which 
misled  the  investors/  shareholders  regarding 
the  perceived  valuation/  strong  financials  of 
the  company  and  induced  them  to  take  part 
in buy-back, particularly when the price of the 
scrip was declining over a period of time.

 The  directors  of  a  company  failed  to  make 
disclosures with respect to encumbered shares 
and also invocation of shares.

 An equity dealer employed by an AMC which 
manages  a  mutual  fund  and  also  provides 
portfolio  management  services,  had 
the 
discretion to execute orders for the mutual fund 
and  PMS  clients  at  any  time,  depending  on 
the  traded  volumes/prices  etc.  Investigations 
revealed  that  the  equity  dealer  passed  on 
information  of  impending  orders  (exchange, 
scrip name, order price and order quantity) and

instructions to his wife and another person. On 
the basis of such information and instructions 
received from the dealer, his wife and another 
person were observed to be front-running the 
trades of the mutual fund and PMS clients in 
their trading accounts and trading accounts of 
other entities connected to them, from which 
they made a substantial profit.

 A  company  issued  preferential  allotments 
to  certain  entities  without  receiving  the 
consideration  amounts.  These  preferential 
allottees, after expiry of the lock-in period, sold 
the shares in the market and made profits.

 Entering 
into  synchronised  trades/reversal 
of  trades/circular  trades  within  a  group 
resulting in creating artificial volumes and also 
contributing to an increase in price of the scrip 
by contributing to a positive LTP.

 A  certain  group  of  entities  purchased  shares 
in  the  market  from  a  certain  other  group  of 
entities  and  transferred  them  (off  market)  to 
the  same  set  of  entities,  thereby  creating  an 
artificial  trading  volume  in  the  scrip  without 
change in ownership.

 Certain  connected  entities  entered 
into 
synchronised  trades  resulting  in  the  creation 
of  artificial  volumes  in  the  scrip.  Further, 
the  company  and  its  directors  aided  certain 
entities  entering  into  synchronised  trades  by 
providing funds.

 An issuer, in collusion with a merchant banker, 
siphoned  off  IPO  proceeds  and  also  routed 
funds to certain allottees by creating fictitious 
obligations meant to siphon off IPO proceeds. 
Further,  the  issuer  made  mis-statements  and 
non-disclosures in the prospectus. Also, there 
were  mis-statements  in  the  annual  report 
with  regard  to  utilisation  of  IPO  proceeds. 
The  auditor  abetted  the  issuer  to  cover-up 
siphoning  off  of  IPO  proceeds  in  the  annual 
report.

 INVESTOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF INTERMEDIARIES

 
Section 11(2) (f) of the SEBI Act empowers it 
to promote investors’ education and foster training 
for  intermediaries  in  the  securities  market.  Along 
with investor education and training, SEBI has also 
actively pursued investor grievance redressal with a 
view to protecting investor interests and enhancing 
the confidence of and increasing the participation of 
investors.

I. 

AND 

EDUCATION 

 INVESTOR 
AWARENESS
 
Towards  the  mandate  of  investor  protection, 
during 2015-16, SEBI’s major thrust was on enhanced 
investor  awareness  and  education  and  expanding 
reach to investors. Education and awareness (along 
with  grievance  redressal)  were  also  thrust  areas 
for  capacity  building  and  for  increasing  investors’ 
confidence  and  awareness  while  investing  in  the 
securities market.

A. 

 INVESTOR  AWARENESS  PROGRAMMES/
WORKSHOPS
 
SEBI  continues  its  association  with  investors’ 
associations  (IAs)  for  conducting  programmes  to 
synergise  and  ensure  that  more  areas,  particularly 
tier II and tier III cities/towns, are covered. SEBI also 
conducts programs in association with other entities. 
Since  the  beginning  of  this  initiative,  over  1,350 
programmes have been conducted (Table 3.22).

B.  MASS MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In  order  to  reach  out  to  people,  SEBI  has 
 
embarked on a mass media campaign disseminating 

relevant  messages  to  investors  through  popular 
media. So far campaigns have been carried in mass 
media  (TV/Radio/Print/bulk  SMSes)  for  spreading 
awareness about SEBI’s grievance redress mechanism 
(highlighting  SCORES  and  the  toll  free  helpline) 
and  cautioning  investors  against  unregistered  CIS/
ponzi  schemes  by  spreading  key  messages:  ‘not  to 
rely on schemes offering unrealistic returns’ and ‘not 
to go by hearsay while investing and do proper due 
diligence’. The campaign was carried out in Hindi, 
English  and  11  major  regional  languages.  These 
messages were shown in all financial education and 
investor awareness programmes conducted by SEBI 
and also sent to AMFI, investors’ associations, ICAI, 
ICSI,  ICAI  (cost  accountants),  etc.  to  be  shown  in 
their programmes.

More  than  50,000  TV  commercials,  1,50,000 
 
radio spots and over 3,100 insertions in various print 
editions were covered under the campaign. Further, 
around  28  crore  bulk  SMSes  in  various  languages 
were  sent  cautioning 
investors  against  ponzi 
schemes/unregistered CIS.

C.  REGIONAL SEMINARS
 
SEBI,  in  association  with  various  exchanges, 
depositories  and  trade  bodies  like AMFI,  conducts 
regional seminars across the country mainly focusing 
on  tier  II  and  tier  III  cities.  These  programmes  are 
attended  by  SEBI  officials  and  officials  from  trade 
bodies at various levels; and they provide investors 
with  useful  information  related  to  the  securities 
market. Over 260 programmes have been conducted 
since the beginning of this initiative (Table 3.23).

III.  FINANCIAL EDUCATION

 
With  a  developing  financial  market  in  India, 
there  is  an  urgent  need  for  more  involvement 
of  investors  in  the  financial  market.  Hence,  it  is 
important to enable them, depending on their needs, 
to understand the role of money, the need and use of 
savings, the advantages of using the formal financial 
sector  and  the  various  options  to  convert  their 

SEBI Annual Report

savings into investments, the protection available to 
them through insurance and a realistic recognition 
of the attributes of these options.

 
With  the  aim  of  spreading  financial  literacy, 
SEBI  has  been  conducting  following  programmes 
across the country.

A. 

 ACTIVITIES OF SEBI TRAINED RESOURCE 
PERSONS
 
SEBI  has  been  reaching  the  masses  through 
an  innovative  model  of  resource  persons  (RPs)  to 
spread  financial  education  across  the  country  by 
targeting  various  groups  such  as  school  children, 
college  students  (young  investors),  middle  income 
groups,  executives,  homemakers 
(housewives), 
retired people and self-help groups.

 
SEBI  certified  resource  persons  organise 
workshops  for  these  target  segments  on  various 
aspects like savings, investments, financial planning, 
banking, insurance and retirement planning.

More than 1,400 resource persons are currently 
  
empanelled  covering  more  than  494  districts  in  28 
states  and  six  union  territories  across  the  country 
(Chart  3.2).  These  RPs  conduct  programmes  in 
the  local  language  of  the  particular  area.  Financial 
education  booklets  are  distributed  free  of  cost  to 
participants  attending  the  programmes.  Since  the 
beginning of this initiative, over 35,000 programmes 
have  been  conducted.  During  2015-16,  over  8,700 
programmes were conducted (Table 3.24).

SEBI  started  the  initiative  ‘Visit  to  SEBI’ 
where  groups  of  students  from  schools,  colleges 
and  professional  institutes  who  are  interested  in 
learning about SEBI and its role as a regulator of the 
securities market visit its head office, regional offices 
and  local  offices.  Since  beginning  of  this  initiative, 
over  600  such  programmes  have  been  conducted. 
During  2015-16,  273  programmes  were  conducted.

As  envisaged  in  the  National  Strategy  for 
 
for 
Financial  Education, 
Financial  Education  (NCFE)  is  incubated  in  the 
National  Institute  of  Securities  Markets  (NISM). 
NCFE’s  activities  are  monitored  by  a  technical 
group for financial inclusion and literacy under the 
Financial Stability and Development Council. NCFE 
undertakes various activities for financial education, 
including:

 Training  of  teachers  (money  smart 
teachers): As part of preparing teachers 
for  imparting  financial  education  to 
students, once the syllabus was in place 
financial education training programmes 
(FETPs)  were  conducted  across  the 
country. Around 100 teachers have been 
certified as money smart teachers in the 
20 programmes.

 Financial  literacy  for  newly  included 
people:  A  booklet  with  10  modules 
on  basic  financial  literacy  has  been 
developed  and  is  available  in  both 
English  and  Hindi.  In  line  with  the 
conversion  of  the  NCFE  website,  this 
booklet  will  be  translated  into  regional 
languages.

IV. 

INVESTOR GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL

 
SEBI has been taking various steps including 
regulatory  measures  to  facilitate  the  redressal  of 
investor  grievances.  The  grievances  lodged  by 
investors  are  taken  up  with  the  respective  listed 
company or intermediary and monitored on a regular 
basis.  Grievances  pertaining  to  stock  brokers  and 
depository participants are taken up with concerned 
stock exchanges and depositories for redressal and 
monitored  by  the  concerned  department  through 
periodic  reports  obtained  from  them.  Grievances 
pertaining to other intermediaries are taken up with 
them  directly  for  redressal  and  monitored  by  the 
concerned SEBI department.

 
A company/intermediary is required to respond 
in a prescribed format (in the form of an action taken 
report  (ATR)).  Upon  the  receipt  of  the  ATR,  the 
status of grievances is updated. If the response of the 
company/intermediary 
insufficient/inadequate, 
follow up action is initiated. SEBI takes appropriate 
enforcement actions (adjudication, directions under 
Section  11B  of  the  SEBI  Act  and  prosecution)  as 
provided under the law where redressal of investor 
grievances is not satisfactory.

is 

 
SCORES  has  helped  investors  with  real  time 
information  about  the  status  of  their  grievances  as 
investors can log onto SCORES at any time and from 
anywhere and check the status of the grievance with 
the  help  of  a  username  and  password  provided  at 
the  time  of  lodging  the  complaint.  Alternatively, 
investors can also call the SEBI toll-free helpline to 
check the status of the grievance. Since SCORES has 
made  it  possible  to  receive  grievances  online,  this 
helps SEBI to take up issues quickly, including those 
that may require a policy change.

SEBI COMPLAINTS REDRESS SYSTEM
A. 
 
The number of investor complaints received by 
SEBI on cumulative basis increased from 29,24,516 as

SCORES  enables  investors  to  directly  lodge 
complaints online (such complaints are categorised 
as e-complaints). During 2015-16, 22,969 e-complaints 
were  received  compared  to  23,035  received  during 
the previous financial year. While investors can lodge 
e-complaints  on  SCORES,  any  physical  complaint 
received against any of the entities in the SCORES 
database is also uploaded on SCORES and thereby 
converted into an e-complaint and action similar to 

 
The  SCORES  system  has  been  working 
satisfactorily and has helped in making the complaint 
handling and redress mechanism more efficient.

TYPES OF INSIDER TRADING PRACTICES
 One  insider,  an  employee  of  a  merchant 
banker, passed on unpublished price sensitive 
information  (UPSI)  related  to  an  open  offer 
that  he  was  working  on  to  his  sister  and  her 
husband.  The  sister  then  traded  in  her  own 
account in the scrip. Her husband and father-
in-law carried out trades in her mother-in-law’s 
account. Bother  the  sister  and  her  mother-in-
law made unlawful gains.
 Senior employees of a pharmaceutical company 
traded  in  the  scrip  while  in  possession  of 
UPSI  related  to  adverse  inference  on  its 
manufacturing plant by an external regulatory 
agency  after  inspection.  These  employees 
avoided possible losses by trading in the scrip.
 The  director  of  a  company  entered  into 
opposite  transactions  within  a  period  of  six 
months  thereby  failing  to  ensure  compliance 
with the model code of conduct for prevention 
of insider trading.
 The  director  of  a  company  executed  trades 
in  the  scrip  of  the  company  during  closure 
of trading window which violated the model 
code  of  conduct  for  prevention  of  insider 
trading.
 The  executive  director  and  deputy  CEO  of  a 
company,  who  was  privy  to  UPSI  passed  on 
the  information  to  a  research  analyst,  who 
then published a research report based on the 
information and gave recommendations on the 
scrip to his clients. Further, the officials of the 
company also passed on UPSI to intermediaries 
through  conference  calls  organised  by  the 
company with the research analyst. Thereafter, 
some of the intermediaries traded in the scrip 
while  in  the  possession  of  UPSI  and  made 
unlawful gains.
 Insiders  of  Company  A  were  negotiating  its 
merger  with  Company  B  and  an  agreement 
for merging the two companies was reached. 

Thereafter,  insiders  of  Company  A  funded 
one  of  their  relatives  through  Company 
C,  a  company  controlled  by  the  insiders  of 
Company A.  From  the  funding,  the  relatives 
of insiders of Company A purchased shares of 
Company A at a time when the said agreement 
was not disclosed to the public, that is, when 
the news was UPSI.
 The  managing  director  of  a  company  traded 
in  the  shares  of  his  own  company  while  in 
possession of UPSI and made unlawful gains.
 The directors/other entities failed to close the 
trading  window  during  the  period  of  UPSI 
and  also  failed  to  disclose  price  sensitive 
information 
to  stock  exchanges  on  an 
immediate basis. Further, these entities traded 
while in possession of UPSI.

 SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF SHARES AND TAKEOVERS

 
Existence of an efficient and well-administered 
set of takeover regulations ensures that the takeover 
market  operates  in  a  fair,  equitable  and  transparent 
manner.  The  SEBI  Act,  1992  expressly  mandates 
SEBI to regulate substantial acquisition of shares and 
takeovers  by  taking  suitable  measures.  Accordingly, 
SEBI  first  provided  a  legal  framework  by  notifying 
the  Takeover  Regulations 
in  1994,  which  were 
subsequently  replaced  by  the  Takeover  Regulations 
in 1997. These regulations were also repealed and the 
current regulations on takeovers were notified in 2011.

I.  OPEN OFFERS
During 2015-16, 91 draft letters of open offers 
 
were  processed  by  SEBI,  of  which  72  draft  letters 
of  offer  were  filed  during  2015-16  (four  under  old 
takeover regulations). Final observations were issued 
with respect to 79 letters of offer during 2015-16 as 
against  68  letters  of  offer  during  2014-15.  Twelve 
draft letters were pending with SEBI for issuance of 
final observations as on March 31, 2016 (Table 3.28).

PART THREE A: Functions of SEBI  with respect to matters specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

 
During 2015-16, 73 open offers with open offer 
size  of  `11,766  crore  were  opened  compared  to  60 
open offers with offer size of ` 17,241 crore during 
2014-15. There was an increase of 21.67 per cent in 
the  number  of  offers  opened  during  the  year.  Out 
of  the  73  open  offers,  61  with  offer  size  of  `  6,868 
crore  were  made  with  the  objective  of  changing 
management control, six open offers of size ` 2,847 
crore were made with the objective of consolidating 
holdings, and six open offers with offer size of ` 2,050 
crore  were  made  with  the  objective  of  substantial 
acquisition of shares (Table 3.30).

II.  BUY-BACK

Buy-back  is  one  of  the  ways  in  which  a 
 
company can return money to its shareholders. SEBI 
started regulating this activity with respect to listed 
entities from 1998 and accordingly framed the SEBI 
(Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 1998.

 
During  2015-16,  16  buy-back  offers  were 
received of which five were through the open market 
purchase  method  and  11  were  through  the  tender 
offer;  compared  to  nine  buy-back  applications  in 
2014-15  (five  through  the  open  market  purchase 
method and four through tender offer). Out of the 
five  offers  for  buy-back  through  the  open  market 
purchase  method,  three  offers  have  been  closed 
while two offers are still open. Further, all 11 offers 
for  buy-back  through  tender  offer  were  closed 
during 2015-16; 14 buy-back offers (including both 
open market offers and tender offers) were received 
and closed during 2015-16 as compared to eight buy-
back offers during 2014-15. The total buy-back offer 
size during 2015-16 was ` 1,834 crore as compared to 
` 373 crore during 2014-15. It is also observed from 
the buy-back offers which were opened and closed 
during  2015-16  that  the  average  utilisation  was  97 
per cent of the total offer size compared to 54.1 per 
cent in 2014-15 (Table 3.31).

 INFORMATION CALLED FROM, INSPECTIONS UNDERTAKEN, INQUIRIES 
AND AUDIT OF STOCK EXCHANGES AND INTERMEDIARIES AND SELF- 
REGULATING ORGANISATIONS CONDUCTED BY SEBI

 
Regulation  of  ‘intermediaries’  is  an  essential 
part of the framework for regulation of the securities 
market. The basic objective of prudential supervision 
of market intermediaries is to safeguard the stability 
of  the  financial  system,  to  protect  client  interests 
from  undue  risks  of  losses  that  may  arise  from 
failure, fraud or any opportunist behaviour on the 
part  of  the  intermediaries,  promoting  the  efficient 
performance  of  intermediaries  and  markets  and 
ensuring  compliance  by  market  intermediaries. 
Supervision  of  intermediaries  through  on-site  and 
off-site  inspections,  enquiries  and  adjudications 
in  case  of  violation  of  rules  and  regulations  and 
administrative  and  statutory  actions  are  essential 
features of effective enforcement by SEBI.

Selection  of 
for  carrying  out 
inspections  is  based  on  a  risk  assessment  of  each 
and every intermediary.

intermediaries 

 
Based  on  the  findings  of  the  inspections  and 
after  considering  comments  by  the  intermediaries, 
the latter were specifically advised about the areas 
where  they  required  to  improve.  Intermediaries 
were also required to report to SEBI the corrective 
steps taken by them and also place the same before 
their boards/partners/proprietors, as the case may be. 
These steps taken by SEBI have improved the level of 
compliance  among  intermediaries.  Administrative 
and  quasi-judicial  action  was  initiated  based  on 
the  deficiencies  and  seriousness  of  the  violations 
committed by the intermediaries.

A. 

 INSPECTION  OF  STOCK  BROKERS  AND 
SUB-BROKERS
 
During  2015-16,  176  stock  brokers  and  sub-
brokers  were  inspected  as  against  202  in  2014-15. 
The  focus  of  the  inspections  was  on  compliance 
of  norms  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  the 
investor  redressal  mechanism,  handling  of  funds 
and  securities  of  clients,  settlement  of  accounts 
of  clients  on  a  timely  basis,  segregation  of  clients 
and  proprietary  funds/securities,  KYC  norms  and 
clearing  operations.  Along  with  specific  purpose, 
single-theme 
comprehensive 
inspections of stock brokers were carried out during

The  stock  exchanges  carried  out  risk  based 
inspections as per a new policy adopted by them in 
consultation with SEBI. Additionally, stock brokers/
clearing  members  are  required  to  get  independent 
auditors  to  carry  out  complete  internal  audits  on 
a  half-yearly  basis.  Stock  exchanges  are  levying 
penalties for delay in filing internal audit reports by 
stock brokers.

 
The system of internal audits of stock brokers 
by  outside  professionals  and  inspections  by  stock 
exchanges and by SEBI has improved the compliance 
level of stock brokers.

III.  PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING

Globally,  money  laundering  is  recognised  as 
 
one of the largest threats to the financial system of 
a  country.  The  fight  against  terrorist  financing  is 
another  emerging  threat  with  grave  consequences 
for  both  the  political  and  economic  standing  of  a 
financial 
jurisdiction.  Rapid  developments  and 
greater integration of financial markets, together with 
improvements  in  technology  and  communication 
channels also continue to pose serious challenges to 
authorities and institutions dealing with anti-money 
laundering  and  combating  financing  of  terrorism 
(AML/CFT).

 
The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 
(PMLA)  and  the  rules  framed  thereunder,  (which 
were brought into force with effect from July 1, 2005) 

126

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

PART THREE A: Functions of SEBI  with respect to matters specified in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992

is a significant step taken by India in the global war 
against money laundering and financing of terrorism. 
PMLA was amended in December 2012 so that the 
legislative  and  administrative  framework  of  the 
country  becomes  more  effective  and  more  capable 
of handling new and evolving threats in the area of 
money laundering and financing of terror. Further, 
the Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance 
of Records) Rules, 2005 were also amended in August 
2013 to reflect these new changes. SEBI has already 
incorporated the new amendments in its AML/CFT 
framework.

 
As  in  the  past,  during  2015-16  also  SEBI 
continued  its  focused  efforts  to  strengthen  the 
regulatory  framework  and  minimise  the  risks 
emanating  from  money  laundering  and  terrorist 
financing  in  the  securities  market.  The  following 
steps were taken in this regard:

A. 

 INSPECTIONS  OF  AML/CFT  RELATED 
ISSUES

 
SEBI  has  appropriately  included  AML/CFT 
risks as a part of its inspection of intermediaries, such 
as stock brokers, depository participants and mutual 
funds. SEBI has also carried out specific theme based 
inspections of intermediaries focusing on compliance 
with KYC norms (including client due diligence) and 
AML/CFT guidelines. In 2015-16, SEBI carried out 39 

special purpose inspections to check stock brokers’ 
compliance with the AML/CFT and KYC norms; for 
depository participants, 24 inspections were carried 
out  to  verify  compliance  with AML/CFT  and  KYC 
norms.  With  respect  to  PMS,  ten  inspections  were 
carried out wherein compliance with AML/CFT and 
KYC related norms was reviewed.

 
In  addition  to  special  purpose  inspections 
conducted  by  SEBI,  compliance  with  AML/CFT 
norms  is  also  verified  by  stock  exchanges  and 
depositories  during  their 
inspections  of  stock 
brokers and depository participants and also at the 
time  of  half  yearly  internal  audits  by  independent 
professionals.  Depository  participants  are  also 
required to undergo concurrent audits with respect 
to  their  operations,  including  KYC/AML  norms. 
Appropriate sanctions are applied where AML/CFT 
violations/discrepancies are observed.

 
Table  3.35  provides  data  on  the  number  of 
members/participants  against  whom  action  for 
AML/CFT discrepancies was taken by the exchanges 
and  depositories  in  2015-16.  Stock  exchanges  and 
depositories  also  conducted 
trainings/seminars 
for  their  members  to  sensitise  them  towards  the 
significance  of  the  AML/CFT  framework  and  the 
need to ensure continuous compliance with it.

 RISK ASSESSMENT FOR THE SECURITIES 
MARKET TO IDENTIFY ML/TF RISKS

 
The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  set  up  different 
working  groups  to  carry  out  risk  assessments  of 
every financial sector in India to identify the varied 
money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing  risks 
faced by them and to suggest measures to mitigate 
these  risks.  A  group  for  the  securities  sector  has 
also been set up comprising of representation from 
SEBI,  stock  exchanges,  depositories,  associations 
of 
In  view  of 
Recommendation 1 of the Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) recommendations, each country is required to 
assess the money laundering and terrorist financing

with  the  recommendations,  SEBI  is  carrying  out  a 
risk assessment exercise for the securities sector.

C. 

 INTERNATIONAL  COOPERATION  ON 
AML/CFT RELATED ISSUES

SEBI has consistently been in touch with global 
 
bodies and other Indian regulators in its attempt to 
keep  the  regulatory  framework  for AML  robust  in 
the  Indian  securities  market.  As  part  of  an  Indian 
government  delegation,  SEBI  officials  participated 
in  the  plenary  and  working  group  meetings  of 
FATF  and  the  Eurasian  Group  on  Combating 

Money  Laundering  and  Financing  of  Terrorism 
(EAG), which is a FATF-style regional body (FSRB), 
for  setting  standards  and  promoting  effective 
implementation of legal, regulatory and operational 
measures  to  combat  money  laundering,  terrorist 
financing and other related threats to the integrity of 
the international financial system.

jurisdictions  that  have  strategic  deficiencies  and 
works  with  them  to  address  the  deficiencies  that 
pose  a  risk  to  the  international  financial  system. 
The  names  of  these  jurisdictions  are  made  public 
as  part  of  the  FATF  public  statement.  As  required 
by  the  FATF  recommendations,  the  Ministry  of 
Finance,  Government  of  India  circulates  FATF 
public  statements  to  all  regulators  with  an  advice 
to  disseminate  them  to  all  financial  institutions 
under their supervision in order to apply enhanced 
due  diligence  measures  when  dealing  with  clients 
from  these  high-risk  jurisdictions.  In  2015-16,  SEBI 
circulated three such FATF public statements dated 
June 26, 2015, October 23, 2015 and February 19, 2016 
to registered intermediaries for their compliance.

10.  DELEGATED POWERS AND FUNCTIONS

 
The  Finance  Act,  2015  made  amendments 
to  certain  central  legislations  to  enable  the  SEBI- 
FMC  merger,  including  amendment  and  repeal 
of  the  Forward  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1952 
(FCRA) and amendment of certain provisions of the 
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA). 
As per Section 28A (5) of the amended FCRA, SEBI 
can  exercise  the  powers  of  FMC  under  FCRA  for 
a  period  of  one  year  after  repeal.  However,  most 

powers exercisable by the central government under 
FCRA have not been delegated to SEBI; they continue 
to be vested with the central government even after 
repeal of FCRA and the SEBI- FMC merger.
In  order  to  enable  smooth  transition  of 
 
recognised  associations 
into  stock  exchanges, 
however,  certain  powers  under  FCRA  vested  with 
the central government were delegated to SEBI, vide

evolved  manifold  in  terms  of  size,  reach,  diversity 
of  investors  and  product  complexity.  SEBI  has 
conducted three investor surveys so far- in 1998-99, 
2001-02 (quick survey) and 2008-09.

During  2015-16,  SEBI  carried  out  an  exercise 
 
to  conduct  a  comprehensive  investor  survey  and 
a  survey  of  market  participants  for  the  base  year 
2015. The survey was carried out in all 29 states and 
seven  union  territories  through  a  comprehensive 
questionnaire.  The  sample  size  was  approximately 
50,000 investors and 1,000 market participants. The 
objectives of the survey were:

 EFFECTIVENESS OF SEBI’S COMPLAINTS 
REDRESSAL SYSTEM (SCORES) IN INDIA

By Professor Ajit Dayanandan, Dr Sarat Malik 

 
and Ms Sneha Nautiyal

About the Study

 
A  dynamic  and  efficient  capital  market  is  a 
vital  and  indispensable  part  of  a  nation’s  financial 
infrastructure. The Indian stock market is the fourth 
best-performing market in the world. Resolution of 
securities market’s disputes could result in lowering 
the cost of equity/capital in the country. It is in this 
context that the study examined the role and efficacy 
of  SEBI’s  SCORES  securities  dispute  resolution 
system  using  the  widely  used  three  attributes  of 
a  good  dispute  resolution  system:  accessibility, 
efficiency and fairness.

About the Study

The  economic  and  financial 

 
liberalisation 
since the early 1990s has transformed India’s stock 
markets. SEBI has built and strengthened its market 
monitoring and regulatory apparatus and has looked 
for ways of incentivising retail investor participation 
in the markets. Yet, the prevailing perception is that 
an  individual,  a  small,  ‘retail’  investor  has  been 
less  important  in  the  market.  The  study  examined 
the actual trends in and possible influences on the 
allocation  of  household  and  individual  savings  to 
investments  in  financial  instruments;  the  factors 
underlying the perceived inter-temporal volatility in 
retail investor presence in the equity market and the 
implications of the same on investor behaviour.

 
Additionally,  three  studies  are  being  carried 
out  under  the  guidance  of  external  experts  from 
premier  educational  institutions  along  with  the 
internal SEBI research team:

V. 

SYSTEMIC STABILITY UNIT

 
During  2015-16,  inputs  were  provided  for 
the  Financial  Stability  Report  (FSR)  published  by 
RBI under the aegis of the FSDC Sub-committee on 
Potential Systemic Risk Issues as well as important 
measures  taken  by  SEBI  to  further  strengthen  the 
systemic  stability  of  the  securities  market  in  India. 
SEBI  provided  inputs  on  -  movements  in  Indian 

stock markets, trends in Algo-trading and regulatory 
steps; domestic institutional investments vs. foreign 
portfolio  investment;  exposure  of  mutual  funds  to 
corporate bonds; and re-hypothecation of shares as 
collateral.

 
On  important  measures  taken  by  SEBI  to 
further  strengthen  the  systemic  stability  of  the 
securities  market  in  India  measures  such  as  action 
against  illegal  money  raising  funds,  revised  index 
based market-wide circuit breaker mechanism; new 
regulation to counter insider trading; move towards 
risk-based  supervision  of  market  intermediaries; 
corporate  governance  by  listed  companies;  risk 
management  policy  at  the  depositories  for  the 
securities  market;  product  labelling  in  mutual 
funds; the risk management framework for national 
commodity  derivatives  exchanges;  framework  for 
fund  raising  by  start-ups;  stress  testing  of  liquid 
fund  and  money  market  mutual  fund  schemes; 
stress testing by clearing corporations in the capital 
market; and the cyber security framework of equity 
market FMIs were published in FSR.
 
SEBI provides inputs for the Network Analysis 
by RBI on a periodic basis and also provides inputs 
to  the  IMF  Data  Gap  Analysis  being  undertaken 
by  RBI.  SEBI  has  developed  an  in-house  Systemic 
Risk  Monitoring  Template  (SRMT)  and  started 
monitoring the movements of some of the securities 
market  indicators  so  as  to  assess  signs  of  systemic 
vulnerabilities 
in  the  Indian  securities  market 
on  a  monthly  basis.  Apart  from  SRMT,  SEBI  also 
examines  and  analyses  the  likely  risks  emanating 
from emerging developments on a case to case basis. 
Additionally, SEBI also undertook regulatory impact 
assessment of the SEBI Alternative Investment Fund 
(AIF)  Regulations,  2012  and  the  SEBI  (Investment 
Advisers) Regulations, 2013.

Box 3.1: The Systemic Risk Monitoring Template

 
SEBI’s Systemic Stability Unit (SSU) has developed a Systemic Risk Monitoring Template (SRMT) for 
periodic reviews of systemic risk information to identify, assess and mitigate emerging systemic risks in the 
securities market. SRMT, inter-alia, monitors trends in market movements (average monthly percentage 
return  of  the  benchmark  index),  interconnectivity  (percentage  of  AUM  of  mutual  funds  invested  in 
securities issued by banks), concentration (percentage share of top 5 brokers in turnover), risk management 
(stress testing results of clearing corporations, percentage of promoters’ shares pledged), volatility (average 
monthly volatility of the index), high frequency trading (percentage share of HFT turnover), and liquidity 
(impact cost of the index) so as to identify any abnormal developments in the market which may potentially 
pose systemic risks.

 
Around  45  variables  indicators  (relating  to  various  segments  of  the  securities  market  as  well  as 
the economy) have been identified for monitoring on a monthly (some on half yearly) basis which are 
systemically important for the securities market.

 
For each indicator and for each segment, time-series data have been collected from relevant sources 
for a long period of time to examine and identify hidden patterns and unknown correlations, if any. A trend 
analysis is followed by creating thresholds based on percentile cut-offs or confidence intervals, wherever 
applicable, in order to generate alerts.

VI.  RESEARCH PAPERS/NOTES

During  2015-16,  research  papers/notes  were 
 
prepared  and  presented  on  a  wide  array  of  topics 
including:  a)  Unfolding  the  Greece  Crisis,  b)  Gulf 
Countries:  Economic  Update,  c)  Downgrade  in 
Corporate  Bonds  and  Impact  on  Mutual  Funds  d) 
Effects  of  the  Renminbi  Devaluation,  e)  Stress  in 
the  Banking  Sector,  f)  Indian  Financial  Markets  -- 
Where Opportunities Abound, g) Financial Markets 
Under One Umbrella: Future Insights, h) Securities 
and  Derivatives  Market  Reform  in  Asian  Markets 
– Is Harmonisation Set to Occur?, i) The Great Fall 
of the Chinese Stock Market, j) Influence of Foreign 
Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and Domestic Institutional 
Investors (DIIs) on the Indian Stock Market, k) Role of 
Derivatives in Channelising Investments, Mobilizing 
Capital or as a Hedging Tool, l) Issues in Taxation

Study  on  Forecasting  Possible  Applicants 
for  Debt  Restructuring:  As  a  part  of  monitoring 
of  financial  statements  of  listed  entities,  SEBI 
conducted  a  detailed  study  in  association  with 
RBI  on  the  topic  of  ‘identifying  vulnerabilities  of 
companies  approaching  banks  for  restructuring’. 
The  commonalities  amongst  the  companies  which 
have  already  applied  for  debt  restructuring  were 
examined and the same parameters were applied to 
other companies. The study will help banks identify 
those companies which are likely to apply for debt 
restructuring in the future.

13.  SURVEILLANCE

 
A strong and robust surveillance mechanism is 
one of the prime requirements of a well-functioning 
securities market in order to safeguard the integrity 
of  the  market  and  to  ensure  that  it  performs  in 
accordance  with  stipulated  norms  and  practices. 
Surveillance is a vital link in the chain of activities 
performed by the regulator to protect investors and 
for developing the markets. The stock exchanges are 
entrusted to act as the first level source for detecting 
market  frauds  and  suspicious  activities  and  any 
aberration in the market movement is then reported 
to SEBI for further examination.

SEBI, 

the 

At 

Integrated 

Surveillance 
 
Department (ISD) monitors market activity through 
its market alert systems and is in charge of overall 
market  surveillance.  The  various  processes  and 
systems implemented to help in detecting FUTP are 
now discussed.

A. 

 INTEGRATED  MARKET  SURVEILLANCE 
SYSTEM (IMSS)

 
The  Integrated  Market  Surveillance  System 
(IMSS)  keeps  track  of  market  aberrations  and 
generates  alerts  on  a  daily  basis.  The  alerts  are 
analysed  periodically  to  identify  any  manipulative 
trading  in  the  market.  During  the  year,  SEBI 
redesigned the IMSS system software to handle more 
than  2  billion  messages  in  a  day  by  implementing 
the  market  splitting  and  streaming  mechanism. 
To  further  enhance  the  system’s  capabilities  and 
performance 
the  alert  generation  process, 
implementing of alerting on multiple market streams 
is underway.

DWBIS  comprises  of  data  warehouse,  data 
mining  and  business  intelligence  tools.  Presently, 
DWBIS consists of three phases:

 

 

 

a. 

b. 

c. 

 Phase-I: A  single  source  of  market  data 
which  enables  users  to  generate  multi-
dimensional  reports  dynamically  (fully 
operational).

 Phase-II:  Several  pattern  recognition 
modules  and  predictive  modelling 
scenarios (fully operational).

 Phase-III: Consists of various reports to 
help  research  initiatives  (released  for 
User Acceptance Test (UAT)).

SURVEILLANCE MEASURES
C. 
 
As  an  on-going  mechanism,  SEBI  conducts 
meetings at regular intervals with stock exchanges/
depositories  to  keep  track  of  surveillance  activities 
and  market  movements.  The  following  measures 
have  been  taken  in  consultation  with  the  stock

Regulation, 2015.

 In order to enhance market integrity and 
to  prevent  excessive  price  movements 
in  the  securities  listed  on  its  trading 
platform, BSE vide notice dated August 
06,  2015  has  introduced  an  additional 
framework  of  periodic  price  bands, 
that  is,  weekly,  monthly,  quarterly  and 
yearly  in  addition  to  the  daily  price 
band framework for stocks which do not 
have derivative products based on them. 
These  additional  periodic  price  bands 
are effective from October 01, 2015 and 
applicable to securities exclusively listed 
and  traded  on  the  BSE  Equity  Trading 
Platform  including  securities  listed  on 
SME and SME ITP platforms.

Circuit  filters  sets  the  limit  on  fluctuations 
 
of  stock  prices.  Exchanges  employ  circuit  filters  in 
various scrips and indices in order to curb the daily 
excess movement of share prices. The exchanges may 
impose 2, 5, 10 or 20 per cent circuit filters to scrips 
depending on the volatility, liquidity and risk of the 
scrips. During 2015-16, BSE reduced price bands in 
3,000 instances while NSE and MSEI imposed stricter 
price bands in 1,292 and 670 instances respectively.

 Where there was a significant high 
to  low  variation  in  the  scrip  price 
post-listing on exchanges with the

band was lowered.

D.  SURVEILLANCE ACTIONS

During  2015-16,  NSE  and  BSE 

 
initiated 
preliminary examination and investigation in 31and 
1,009 cases respectively. With a view to dampening 
the  amplitude  of  prices,  some  illiquid  scrips  were 
shifted  to  the  trade-to-trade  (T  to  T)  segment.  The 
settlement  of  scrips  available  in  this  segment  is 
done  on  a  trade  for  trade  basis  and  no  netting  off 
is  allowed,  that  is,  every  trade  results  in  delivery 
of  shares.  These  criteria  for  shifting  scrips  to/from 
the  trade-to-trade  segment  are  decided  jointly  by 
the  stock  exchanges  in  consultation  with  SEBI  and 
reviewed periodically. BSE shifted 642 scrips to the 
T to T segment while NSE and MSEI shifted 132 and 
49 scrips respectively to the T and T segment during 
2015-16 (Table 3.37).

suspended 159 scrips from trading for reasons such 
as  non-compliance  of  listing  agreements  and  non-
payment  of  annual  fees.  Pursuant  to  surveillance 
monitoring  and  detection,  interim  orders  were 
passed.

 SURVEILLANCE 
COMMODITIES
 
During  2015-16,  the  prices  of  coriander,  RM 
seed, chana, cardamom, turmeric, kapas, cottonseed, 
sugar,  soy  oil,  cottonseed  oil  cake,  turmeric,  and 
cardamom  and  castor  seed  were  found  to  be 
volatile  in  line  with  spot  prices  of  the  respective 
commodities.  With  an  objective  of  tempering  the 
possible  exuberance  of  these  commodities  in  the 
futures  market  the  Surveillance  Department  took 
regulatory measures such as imposition of additional 
margins  and  special  margins  on  these  commodity 
futures  contracts.  The  other  regulatory  measures 
taken were:
 

a) 

 Pre-expiry  margin  of  3  per  cent  which 
was  earlier  applicable  five  days  prior 
to  the  expiry  month  of  contract  made 
applicable  from  the  11th  of  the  expiry 
month  in  case  of  dhania  and  from  the

 As  per  SEBI’s  directions  exchanges 
revised  rate  of  pre-expiry  margin  from 
3  per  cent  to  1.5  per  cent  for  contracts 
expiring on April 20, 2016 and thereafter.
 Staggered 
period  made 
applicable from 11th of the month in case 
of dhania contracts and from the 1st of the 
expiry month in case of chana contracts.
 Participants  paying  early  in  goods  are 
exempted  from  payment  of  margins 
except mark-to-market margins.
 Out of these commodity futures contracts, 
prices  of 
contracts 
remained  volatile  and  therefore,  the 
highest margins were imposed on chana 
futures  contracts.  There  was  a  special 
margin of 50 per cent on the long side on 
the  January  2016  contract  and  the  total 
margin was 97 per cent (initial margin 4 
per cent, extreme loss margin 1 per cent, 
pre-expiry 42 per cent and special margin 
50  per  cent).  There  was  a  margin  of  52 
per cent on the short side. On January 20, 
2016, the other contracts traded in chana 
were the April, May and June contracts, 
which were subject to 10 per cent of the 
margins on the long side (Table 3.39).

14. 

INVESTIGATION

Timely  completion  of 

 
investigations  and 
effective, proportionate and dissuasive action in case 
of violations of securities laws is important for the 
protection of investors’ interests and ensuring a fair, 
transparent and orderly functioning of the market. 
It  is  also  vital  for  improving  confidence  in  the 
integrity of the securities market. SEBI is therefore 
constantly  striving  to  upgrade  its  investigative 
skills by making use of information technology (IT) 
and  other  latest  investigative  tools.  Importance  of 
effective and credible use of investigations has also 
been underscored by IOSCO in its ‘Principles for the 
Enforcement of Securities Regulation’.

Keeping 

 
these  objectives  and  principles 
of  securities  regulations  in  view,  SEBI  initiates 
investigations  to  examine  alleged  or  suspected 
violations  of  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  the 
securities  market.  The  possible  violations  may 
include  price  manipulation,  creating  an  artificial 
market, 
issue  related 
irregularities,  takeover  related  violations,  non-
compliance  of  disclosure  requirements  and  any 
other misconduct.

A. 
There  are  various  sources  of  information 
 
initiating  an 
initiates 
for 
investigations  based  on  references  received  from 
sources  such  as  stock  exchanges;  SEBI’s  integrated 
Surveillance  Department,

departments,  information  submitted  by  market 
participants and complainants. In appropriate cases, 
investigations may also be initiated suo-moto, where 
there  are  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the 
investors’  interests  are  being  adversely  affected  or 
there  are  suspected  violations  of  the  provisions  of 
securities laws.

other 

PROCESS OF INVESTIGATION
B. 
 
The  steps  involved  during  an  investigation 
process include an analysis of market data (order and 
trade log, transaction statements, etc.) and static data 

(KYC documents obtained from brokers, depository 
participants,  etc.,  bank  records,  financial  results, 
events around major corporate developments, etc.). 
The  purpose  of  such  investigations  is  to  gather 
evidence  and  to  identify  persons/entities  behind 
irregularities and violations so that appropriate and 
suitable  regulatory  action  can  be  taken  wherever 
required. The outcome of investigations in the form 
of  enforcement  action  is  a  clear  signal  to  market 
players to comply with legal provisions and expected 
standards of conduct in the market.

C.  TRENDS IN INVESTIGATION CASES
 
During  2015-16,  133  new  cases  were  taken 
up for investigation and 123 cases were completed 
compared  to  70  new  cases  taken  up  and  122  cases 
completed  in  2014-15  (Table  3.40).  Apart  from 
enforcement action, an important attendant benefit 
resulting from such investigations is contribution to 
policy changes with a view to further strengthening 
the regulatory and enforcement environment.

market  manipulations  and  price  rigging  compared 
to  59  per  cent  (41  out  of  70)  cases  in  2014-15. 
While  insider  trading  and  takeover  violation  cases 
accounted for 9 per cent (12 cases) and 2 per cent (2 
cases) respectively, ‘issue’ related manipulation and 
other violations of securities laws accounted for 7 per 
cent (9 cases) and 20 per cent (26 cases) respectively 
(Table 3.41 and Chart 3.5).

ENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS

 
Effective  enforcement  lies  at  the  heart  of 
ensuring  integrity,  transparency  and  fairness  in 
the market. It not only leads to a better compliance 
culture, but also underscores the point that market 
misconduct  and  abuse  will  not  go  unpunished. 
A  credible  enforcement  strategy  underpins  the 
importance  of  consistent,  timely  and  transparent 
regulatory  outcomes,  which  are  proportionate, 
dissuasive  and  effective.  Under  the  SEBI  Act, 
1992;  SCRA,  1956;  and  the  Depositories  Act,  1996 
SEBI  broadly  pursues  two  streams  of  enforcement 
action,  that  is,  administrative/civil  or  criminal. 
Administrative/civil 
issuing 
directions such as remedial orders, cease and desist 
orders,  suspension  or  cancellation  of  certificate  of 
registration  and  imposition  of  monetary  penalty 
under the respective statutes. Proceedings of criminal 
nature  involve  initiating  prosecution  proceedings 
against violators by filing criminal complaints before 
a competent court.

A. 

ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

 
There  are  five  enforcement  mechanisms  that 
SEBI  uses  in  case  of  any  violation(s)  pertaining  to 
laws regulating the securities market.

Section  11/11B  Proceedings:  Under  these 
 
proceedings,  SEBI  may 
issue  directions  or 
prohibitive  orders  in  the  interest  of  investors  or 
the securities market, either pending investigation/
inquiry  or  on  completion  of  such  investigation/
inquiry.  Under  Section  11B  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992, 
SEBI  may  suspend  trading  of  any  security  in  a 
recognised  stock  exchange;  restrain  persons  from 
accessing the securities market; prohibit any person 
associated with the securities market to buy, sell or 
deal in securities; and direct any intermediary or any 
person associated with the securities market not to 
dispose of or alienate an asset forming part of any 
transaction which is under investigation

 
Enquiry  Proceedings:  SEBI  may  suspend 
or  cancel  the  certificate  of  registration  of  an 
intermediary through the enquiry regulations on the 
recommendation  of  the  enquiry  officer/designated 
authority appointed for that purpose.

Proceedings: 

Adjudication 

SEBI  may 
 
appoint  an  adjudicating  officer  for  conducting  an 
enquiry  and  imposing  penalties  after  completing 
the  investigation/inquiry  for  contravention  of  any 
provision  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  or  any  rules  or 
regulations made thereunder.

Prosecution 

Proceedings: 

SEBI  may 
 
initiate  legal  proceedings  against  any  person  for 
contravention of any provision of the SEBI Act, 1992 
or any rules or regulations made thereunder.

 
Summary  Proceedings:  SEBI  may  initiate 
an  enquiry  or  adjudication  against  SEBI  registered 
intermediaries or may issue a warning and deficiency 
letter  for  violation  of  rules  and  regulations  for 
intermediaries.

a. 

Section 11/11B Proceedings

  
Under  Section  11/11B/11D  of  the  SEBI  Act, 
1992, SEBI may issue directions or prohibitive orders 
such  as  debarment  from  accessing  the  securities 
market or not to deal in securities. While exercising 
powers  under  Section  11,11B/11D  of  the  SEBI Act, 
1992,  SEBI  directs  entities  restraining/prohibiting 
them  from  doing  certain  activities  or  direct  the 
entities to act in a particular manner in the interest of 
investors and the securities market. During 2015-16, 
SEBI initiated enforcement action in 223 cases under 
Section 11/11B, while it disposed of 257 cases under 
Section 11,11B and 11D. At the end of March, 2016, 
422 cases, involving 3,052 entities were pending for 
action (Table 3.43).

Box 3.2: Recovery Actions

 
After  initiation  of  recovery  proceedings  against  M/s  PACL  Ltd.  and  its  promoters/directors  in 
November, 2015, SEBI has recovered ` 211.60 crore.  Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 
February 02, 2016 directed SEBI to constitute a Committee under the Chairmanship of Former Chief Justice 
of India Justice Shri R.M. Lodha to sell the assets of PACL Ltd. and distribute money to the investors. The 
constitution of the Committee has been notified by SEBI on February 17, 2016. As per the directions of 
the Committee, the entire amount of ` 211.60 crore has been transferred to the separate designated bank 
account opened by the Committee.
 
 
During 2015-16, SEBI has initiated second tranche of distribution of reallocation amount to 4.63 lakh 
investors from the amount disgorged in the matter of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) irregularities.  An 
amount of ` 18.06 crore has been distributed by SEBI to the investors which include the money recovered 
by SEBI in exercise of the newly conferred recovery powers under the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 
2014. 

 
In exercise of recovery powers SEBI has sold the shares attached in recovery proceedings against 
various defaulters in 744 trading sessions and realised an amount of ` 11.45 crore. An immovable property 
of one CIS entity has been auctioned and was sold for ` 2.09 crore.

VI.  SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT CELL

 
SEBI  constituted  the  Special  Enforcement 
Cell  to  specifically  handle  work  relating  to  the 
verification of documents submitted in terms of the 
directions of the Supreme Court and also to handle 
matters  connected  therewith.  Developments  in  the 
matter of M/s Sahara India Real Estate Corporation 
Ltd.,  (SIRECL)  and  M/s  Sahara  India  Housing 
Corporation Ltd. (SHICL) are given below:

 
SEBI is implementing the order of the Supreme 
Court  dated  August  31,2012  which  upheld  SEBI’s 
directions to both the companies to forthwith refund 
the money collected by them through RHPs with a 
15 per cent interest from the date of receipt of money 
till the date of payment.

 
SEBI  has  been  acting  in  accordance  with  the 
directions  contained  in  the  order  of  the  Supreme 
Court and its actions are overseen by Justice (retd.) 
B. N. Agrawal. SEBI has filed 15 status reports before 
the  Supreme  Court  in  this  respect  which  has  also 
been furnished to Sahara.

A.  Developments in the Matter during 2015-16
 
The Supreme Court vide order dated 26.03.2014 
granted interim bail to the three detenues (promoter/
directors of Saharas) who had been detained by an 
order  dated  04.03.2014,  on  the  condition  that  they 
would pay an amount of ` 10,000 crore, out of which 
` 5,000 crore was to be deposited before the Supreme 
Court and for the balance, a bank guarantee from a 
nationalised  bank  had  to  be  furnished  in  favour 
of SEBI. The Saharas did not comply with the bail 
conditions  in  full.  During  subsequent  hearings, 
the  Saharas  mentioned  before  the  Supreme  Court, 
inter-alia,  that  they  had  certain  buyers  for  some 
of  the  properties  and  the  sale  proceeds  there  from 
would  meet  the  deficit.  The  Saharas  also  stated 
that they were able to negotiate with a nationalised 
bank  through  two  of  their  group  companies  and 
the  said  bank  had  agreed  to  furnish  the  required 
bank  guarantee.  A  format  of  the  bank  guarantee 
was also produced for approval by the court so that 
the guarantee could be obtained in the said format. 
The format of the bank guarantee did not mention 

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

the trigger effect for the bank guarantee. However, 
the said format was accepted by the court subject to 
the following conditions imposed vide order dated 
19.06.2015:

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

 Saharas shall deposit the balance outstanding 
amount  within  a  period  of  18  months 
commencing from the date of their release from 
custody  in  nine  instalments.  The  first  eight 
instalments had to be of `3,000 crore payable 
every two months from the date of their release 
from custody and the last instalment would be 
of the remaining amount.

necessarily 

 In  the  event  of  default  in  payment  of  two 
instalments(not 
consecutive), 
the  bank  guarantee  furnished  by  the  Saharas 
will be encashed by SEBI and the amount so 
received  counted  towards  part  compliance 
with the earlier directions given by the court.

 The bank guarantee shall also be encashable in 
the event of failure of the contemnors to deposit 
the  full  amount  outstanding  against  them 
within  a  period  of  18  months  commencing 
from the date of their release.

 In the event of failure of the Saharas to deposit 
three instalments (not necessarily consecutive), 
the contemnors shall surrender back to custody 
and  in  case  they  fail  to  do  so,  they  shall  be 
taken into custody and committed to jail.

 As the court has released some of the properties 
for  sale  by  the  contemnors,  the  contemnors 
shall  be  free  to  apply  for  permission  to  sell 
any further property within 15 days from their 
release in order to enable them to raise funds 
for deposit of the requirement amount in terms 
of the order of the Supreme Court.

 The contemnors shall deposit their passports in 
the Supreme Court within 15 days from the date 
of this order or before their release, whichever 
is  earlier.  They  shall  not  leave  the  country 
without  prior  permission  of  the  Supreme 
Court. Further, they shall keep the Tilak Marg 

Police  Station,  New  Delhi,  informed  of  their 
movements  within  the  country  and  updated 
about their whereabouts every fortnight.
 
Further, most of the cheques deposited by the 
purchasers  of  properties  situated  in  Gurgaon  and 
Vasai could not be realised, resulting in initiation of 
contempt  proceedings  against  the  said  purchasers 
for  their  failure  to  comply  with  the  undertaking 
to  honour  the  cheques  furnished  by  them  to  the 
Supreme  Court.  However,  the  purchasers  of  the 
Gurgaon  property  deposited  357  cheques  for  the 
balance consideration before the court on 29.03.2016, 
which have since been realised.
 
The  Saharas  have  sought  permission  of 
the  Supreme  Court  for  selling  their  hotel  asset 
in  Mumbai,  aircraft  and  their  shareholding  in  a 
Formula 1 racing company, which is pending before 
the Supreme Court.
 
As  the  Saharas  have  not  complied  with  the 
directions  of  the  Supreme  Court,  SEBI  filed  an  IA 
before  the  Supreme  Court  seeking  its  directions  in 
appointing a receiver with respect to all the assets, 
movable and immovable (including financial assets), 
of  the  Sahara  Group  of  Entities  (referred  to  as 
Sahara  India  Pariwar)  and  the  promoter/directors 
irrespective  of  the  fact  whether  such  assets  are 
situated in India or outside and be directed to attach 
and sell them and deposit the sale proceeds in SEBI’s 
designated  bank  account.  The  Saharas  have  filed 
their  reply  to  the  SEBI’s  petition  and  the  matter  is 
pending before the Supreme Court.
 
The Supreme Court vide order dated March 29, 
2016, directed SEBI to devise a suitable mechanism 
for sale of properties the title deeds of which have 
already  been  deposited  with  it  by  the  Saharas  in 
consultation  and  under  the  supervision  of  Justice 
B.N. Agrawal, and to keep the Saharas duly informed 
about the steps being taken by it in which event the 
Saharas shall be free to provide such inputs as may 
be considered necessary so that the properties fetch 
a fair price towards the sale consideration. It has also 
been directed that SEBI shall not sell any property

owned by the Saharas for a price less than 90 per cent 
of the circle rates for the area in question without the 
permission of the court.

VII.  REGULATORY CHANGES

A.  AMENDMENTS TO ACTS

a. 

 

 
Section  30  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  empowers 
SEBI  to  make  regulations  consistent  with  the  act 
by  issuing  notifications.  Every  rule  and  every 
regulation made under this act is to be laid before 
each House of Parliament. During 2015-16, the SEBI 
Board  took  various  regulatory  measures  to  protect 
the  interests  of  investors  in  the  securities  market, 
for the development of the securities market and for 
regulating the securities market. In this regard, the 
SEBI  Board  notified  various  new  regulations  and 
various  amendments  to  existing  regulations  were 
also  notified.  The  summary  of  regulatory  changes 
made is now given.

The  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation) 
Act,  1956  (SCRA)  was  amended  vide  the 
Finance Act, 2015 in the context of the merger of 
the Forward Markets Commission with SEBI. 
The act was amended primarily to incorporate 
substantive  provisions 
the 
regulation of commodity derivatives markets, 
which  were  earlier  in  the  Forward  Contracts 
(Regulation) Act, 1952 which was repealed vide 
the  Finance Act.  The  amendment  introduced 
a  definition  of  ‘commodity  derivative’  and 
included  the  term  within  the  definition  of 
‘derivative’ 
thereby  bringing  commodity 
derivatives within the ambit of ‘securities’. By

Prevention of Violations by Entities

 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

It  has  been  observed  that  many  times 
  
the corporate sector and other entities commit 
violations of SEBI regulations unintentionally 
and  this  happens  mainly  because  of  lack  of 
understanding  of  the  regulatory  provisions. 
Such  violations  lead  to  initiation  of  quasi-
judicial  proceedings  and 
imposition  of 
penalties  by  SEBI.  Therefore,  with  a  view  to 
clarifying the true intent behind the regulations 
and to ensure better compliance in letter and 
spirit,  SEBI  issued  a  set  of  frequently  asked 
questions (FAQs) from time to time during the 
year on regulations pertaining to the following 
issues:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Takeovers
Buy-back
Delisting

As 

  
the  Listing  Regulations  were 
notified for the first time during 2015-16, SEBI 
organised a number of workshops in different 
cities in association with stock exchanges and 
professional  bodies  to  clarify  various  issues 
related to the Regulations. SEBI also issued 25 
FAQs on these Regulations.

Clarifications on these were also issued 

  
under SEBI’s Informal Guidance Scheme.

of  the  total  equity  shares.  Further,  the  exit 
price  offered  to  the  public  shareholders  shall

under the provisions of the RTI Act and refer them to 
the CPIO.

 
Section  4  of  the  RTI Act  casts  obligations  on 
every public authority to make certain disclosures on 
a proactive basis. SEBI has been proactively making 
such  disclosures.  The  focus  of  the  disclosures  is 
providing  transparency  in  SEBI’s  working  and 
functioning.  In  this  direction,  policy  decisions  and 
reform  measures  taken  by  SEBI  generally  emanate 
after  extensive  consultative  processes 
through 
various advisory committees. While evolving policy 
changes, SEBI endeavours to seek valuable comments 
from the investing public and stakeholders at large 
through the public comments process.

 
The SEBI website - www.sebi.gov.in-- is a mine 
of information for the investing public, stakeholders 
and researchers alike. Various sections of the website 
strive to serve specific interests. Investor education 
and awareness materials in various local languages 
and FAQs on the SEBI website pertaining to different 
areas  of  the  securities  market  enable  investors 
and  stakeholders  to  understand  and  acclimatise 
themselves with the nuances of the procedures and 
terminologies  of  the  securities  market  for  taking 
well-informed decisions.

 
All  the  relevant  acts,  SEBI  regulations  and 
various  amendments  are  available  on  the  SEBI 
website  and  are  updated  from  time  to  time.  The 
various  orders  passed  by  SEBI  in  its  quasi-judicial 
role  and  the  orders  of  the  Securities  Appellate 
Tribunal (SAT) and various courts as well as orders 

of the SEBI Appellate Authority (AA) under RTI are 
available on the SEBI website.

 
Further,  information/statistics/reports/discussion 
papers are also made available in the public domain 
to  assist  investors  and  researchers  working  in  the 
area of the securities market to provide their inputs 
to  further  the  SEBI’s  preamble  of  promoting  and 
developing the securities market.

 
SEBI  has  also  been  taking  various  steps  for 
ensuring  transparency  in  the  functioning  of  the 
exchanges  and  other  market  participants.  Through 
various regulations, such as the ICDR Regulations, 
Insider  Trading  Regulations 
and  Takeovers 
Regulations  SEBI  has  ensured  that  it  provides 
optimum  and  timely  disclosures  to  the  investing 
public so that they can take well informed investment 
decisions.  Accordingly,  SEBI’s  disclosure  policy 
requires  even  non-public  entities,  although  not 
falling under the purview of the RTI Act, to disclose 
important  details  and  updated  information  on 
material  developments  and  day-to-day  operations 
including details of redressal of investor grievances 
in the public domain.

With  respect  to  RTI  applications  received 
 
by  SEBI  which  are  in  the  nature  of  complaints/
seeking redressal of complaints, the office of CPIO 
voluntarily  provides  guidance

seekers.  SEBI  endeavours  to  provide  timely  and 
useful information to investors/prospective investors 
for  which  a  separate  designated  website  --  http://
investor.sebi.gov.in  --  has  been  set  up.  Further, 
SEBI has also launched SCORES (SEBI Complaints

redress system for investors in the securities market 
where an investor can make a complaint/grievances 
in electronic mode on the SCORES website (http://
scores.gov.in) with facility for online tracking of the 
complaint status. Further, SEBI has also launched a 
toll free helpline service to facilitate replies to various 
queries from the general public on matters relating 
to the securities market.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

With  the  ever-evolving  and  dynamic  nature 
 
of  capital  markets,  it  is  imperative  to  be  abreast 
of  global  developments  while  introducing  and 
implementing  regulatory  measures  domestically. 
At  the  same  time,  cooperation  with  securities 
regulators  in  other  countries  is  also  essential  for 
the smooth functioning of and development of the 
securities market. In this context, and in furtherance 
of  its  regulatory  objectives,  SEBI  engages  with  a 
range  of  international  standard  setting  bodies, 
foreign regulators and law enforcement agencies. In  
2015-16 also SEBI continued to actively engage and 
contribute to the on-going work in the international 
arena.

SEBI’s  primary 

 
international  engagement 
continues to be with the International Organisation 
of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO),  a  globally 
recognised 
for 
securities markets. SEBI played a key role at IOSCO’s 
various  meetings  and  policy  committees  IOSCO 
and  further  strengthened  its  position  in  the  global 
arena. SEBI also actively cooperated in investigation/
enforcement/supervisory  matters  with 
other 
overseas regulators under the framework of mutual 
collaboration provided under the IOSCO Multilateral 
Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU).

In addition to its engagement with IOSCO, SEBI 
 
continued to make meaningful contributions to the 
on-going work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), 
the international standard setting body that has been 
mandated by the G20 to promote implementation of 
financial sector regulatory reforms in the world.

 
As a part of its other varying commitments as 
the securities market regulator, SEBI provided inputs 
to the Government of India on several occasions on 
international  issues/and  financial  sector  dialogues, 
hosted  and  organised  visits  of  foreign  delegates 
and conducted international seminars and training 
programmes.

On  the  bilateral  engagement  front,  SEBI 
 
entered  into  several  bilateral  MoUs  with  other 
securities regulators to promote mutual cooperation 
and technical assistance.

Box 3.3:  Thematic Review of Money Market Funds (MMFs)

 
Pursuant to the request from FSB, IOSCO conducted a Thematic Review (TR) on the implementation 
of money market reforms published by IOSCO in October, 2012. The objective of the review was to identify 
progress in adopting legislation, regulation and other policies in relation to MMFs in the reform areas.  

The TR report on MMFs was published on September 02, 2015. Thirty-one jurisdictions participated 

 
in the review, of which 24 were FSB members. SEBI, India also participated in this review. 

 
The global MMF market is dominated by five jurisdictions (the US, France, Luxembourg, Ireland 
and China) (largest jurisdictions) which together account for just under 90 percent of global assets under 
management in MMFs.

The key findings of the thematic review are:
i. 

 Overall, the review found that as at the reporting date, participating jurisdictions had made progress 
in  introducing  implementation  measures  across  the  eight  reform  areas.  Implementation  progress 
varied between jurisdictions and reform areas.
 For the largest jurisdictions, only the US reported having final implementation measures in all reform 
areas, with China and EU members still in the process of developing and finalising relevant reforms.
 For  jurisdictions  with  smaller  MMF  markets,  implementation  progress  was  less  advanced,  with 
only four other participating jurisdictions (Brazil, India, Italy and Thailand, the first three being FSB 
members) reported having final implementation measures in all reform areas.

in  mid-2013. 
The  results  of  the  assessments  were  published  in 
August  2013.  The  first  update  of  the  initial  Level 
1  assessments  was  conducted  in  early  2014  and 
the  report  was  published  in  May  2014.The  second 
update  of  the  initial  Level  1  assessments  has  been 
completed and the report was published on June 11, 
2015. India has been assigned ‘4’ rating, that is,

 ‘4’ (Rating 4 indicates - final implemen-
tation  measures  in  force)  against  the 
Principles for all types of FMIs; and
 ‘4’ rating against the Responsibilities for 
all types of FMIs.

CPMI-IOSCO  has  also  conducted  a  Level  2 
and Level 3 assessment against the implementation 
of  the  Responsibilities.  Twenty-eight  jurisdictions 
(including  India)  participated  in  this  assessment.

Box 3.4: CPMI – IOSCO assessment of Responsibilities with regard to Principles for  

Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMIs)

CPMI  –  IOSCO  published  the  ‘Implementation  Monitoring  of  PFMI:  Assessment  and  Review  of 

 
Application of Responsibilities for Authorities’ in November 2015. 
 
This report presents the findings of the CPMI-IOSCO assessment of the completeness and consistency 
of frameworks and outcomes arising from jurisdictions’ implementation of the Responsibilities for authorities 
in the PFMI. The assessments covered implementation of the Responsibilities across all financial market 
infrastructure (FMI) types in 28 participating jurisdictions (including India). The work on the Responsibilities 
was carried out as a peer review during 2015 and the assessment ratings for each jurisdiction reflect the 
implementation measures in place as on January 09, 2015; other measures implemented after this date, or 
other material developments, are noted where relevant but were not considered when assigning ratings of 
observance.
 
Overall,  the  assessment  revealed  that  a  majority  of  the  jurisdictions  had  achieved  a  high  level  of 
observance of the Responsibilities. Of the 28 jurisdictions assessed, 16 fully observed the five Responsibilities 
for  all  FMI  types;  an  additional  two  jurisdictions  either  fully  or  broadly  observed  each  of  the  five 
Responsibilities for all FMI types. The fully compliant jurisdictions are – Australia, Brazil, China, EU, France, 
Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and UK
Observations on India 
 
RBI  and  SEBI  (‘Indian  authorities’)  are  assessed  to  observe  all  Responsibilities  for  the  identified 
systemically  important  PSs,  CSDs/SSSs,  CCPs  and  TR.  Indian  authorities  have  clearly  defined  and 
publicly disclosed the criteria used to identify FMIs that should be to authorities’ regulation, supervision 
and oversight. RBI and SEBI have appropriate powers, consistent with their regulatory, supervisory and 
oversight  responsibilities  with  respect  to  FMIs.  Both  authorities  also  indicate  that  they  have  sufficient 
resources to fulfil their responsibilities. Indian authorities RBI and SEBI’s policies with respect to FMIs have 
been clearly defined and are publicly disclosed. The RBI policy document on ‘Regulation and Supervision of 
Financial Market Infrastructures’ and SEBI vide circular CIR/MDR/DRMNP/26/2013 outline that FMIs under 
their  respective  jurisdictions  need  to  comply  with  PFMI.  RBI  and  SEBI  cooperate  domestically  between 
them  and  with  other  financial  sector  authorities  under  the  aegis  of  the  Financial  Stability  Development 
Council (FSDC), which was established to allow more effective regulatory coordination, crisis prevention 
and management and ultimately help maintain financial stability. As for international cooperation, RBI has 
information sharing arrangements in place with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with regard to CCIL 
operations in the USD-INR segment.

d.  Asia- Pacific Regional Committee (APRC)

 
APRC is one of the four regional committees 
constituted  by  IOSCO  to  focus  on  regional  issues 
relating to securities regulation. APRC comprises of 
29 members representing securities regulators from 
Asia-Pacific jurisdictions.

 
APRC has developed a roadmap that provides 
its members with a strategic framework for making a 
meaningful contribution to the region’s development. 

This will continue to be reviewed and developed by 
APRC  members  over  time,  reflecting  discussions 
and  agreements  at  APRC  meetings.  The  roadmap 
has  outlined  the  following  four  areas  of  focus  for

 Growth  and  Emerging  Markets  Committee 
(GEM Committee)
 
IOSCO’s Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) 
Committee comprises of 87 members (representing 
75 per cent of IOSCO’s ordinary membership) and 12 
non-voting associate members including the world’s 
fastest growing economies and ten G20 members. The 
committee  seeks  to  promote  the  development  and 
greater efficiency of emerging securities and futures 
markets  by  establishing  principles  and  minimum 
standards,  providing  training  programmes  and 
technical assistance for members and facilitating the 
exchange of information and transfer of technology 
and  expertise.  SEBI  is  a  member  of  the  GEM 
Committee.

 
During  2015-16,  the  GEM  Committee  met 
three  times.  The  first  meeting  was  held  in  Cairo, 
Egypt on April 27-29, 2015. The members of the GEM 
Committee had a market development workshop on 
‘Crisis  Management’  and  a  roundtable  discussion 
on  ‘Emerging  Risks’.  The  GEM  Public  Conference 
was  held  on  the  topic  ‘Accelerating  growth  and 
development  of  emerging  capital  markets’  where 
several  participants  shared 
insights  and  their 
experiences.

 
The  second  meeting  of  the  GEM  Committee

 ASSOCIATION  WITH  G20/FINANCIAL 
STABILITY BOARD

 
The  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  is  an 
international  body  established  to  address  financial 
system vulnerabilities and to drive the development 
and implementation of strong regulatory, supervisory 
and other policies in the interest of financial stability. 
One of the main mandates of FSB is to implement 
G20 policy announcements on financial regulation.
SEBI is a member of FSB’s Plenary and Regional 
 
Committee Group (RCG)-Asia. During 2015-16, the 

FSB  Plenary  met  two  times.  It  met  in  London  on 
September  25,  2015  and  in  Tokyo  on  March  30-31, 
2016. At its meetings, FSB discussed vulnerabilities 
affecting the global financial system, implementation 
and effects of reforms and also discussed important 
issues  such  as  (a)  financial  system  implications 
of  technological  innovations;  (b)  climate  related 
financial  disclosures;  (c)  asset  management  and 
market  liquidity;  (d)  shadow  banking;  (e)  macro 
prudential  policy  framework  and  tools;  and  (f) 
misconduct risks.

FSB RCG-Asia held its meeting on October 20, 
2015  in  Hong  Kong  and  reviewed  the  FSB’s  policy 
priorities and work plan. At its meeting, FSB RCG-
Asia discussed vulnerabilities and financial stability 
issues affecting Asia and other important issues such 
as  market-based  finance  and  asset  management 
activities, misconduct-risk and deposit insurance.

Since the onset of the global financial crisis, the 
 
G20 has established core elements of a new global 
financial  regulatory  framework  that  will  make 
the  financial  system  more  resilient  and  better  able 
to  serve  the  needs  of  the  real  economy.  National 
authorities  and  international  bodies  with  the  FSB 
as  a  central  locus  of  coordination  have  further 
advanced this financial reform programme based on 
clear principles and timetables for implementation. 
FSB’s  major  international  policy  reforms  have  now 
globally  been  agreed  to  for  addressing  risks  and 
strengthening regulations across the financial sector.

SEBI  contributes  to  FSB’s  work  by  way  of 
 
attending its meetings and by providing responses 
to  FSB  surveys/questionnaires/reviews.  SEBI  also 
provides  comments  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on 
various FSB issues/agenda topics, since MoF is also 
a member to the FSB plenary from India, alongwith 
RBI and SEBI.

FSB peer review of India

 
FSB peer reviews focus on the implementation 
of  financial  sector  standards  and  policies  agreed 
within FSB, as well as their effectiveness in achieving 
the  desired  outcomes.  As  part  of  its  commitment 
towards global financial stability, India underwent a 
FSB peer review in 2015. FSB appointed a peer review 
team to carry out the peer review. The peer review 
covered the two topics: (1) Macro-prudential Policy 
Framework  and  (2)  Regulation  and  Supervision  of 
Non-Banking Finance Companies. MoF and financial 

regulators (SEBI, RBI, IRDA and PFRDA) responded 
to the various questionnaires circulated by the FSB 
peer  review  team.  The  FSB  peer  review  team  also 
made  an  onsite  visit  to  India  during  March  07-11, 
2016 as a part of its peer review exercise. The report 
of the FSB peer review is scheduled to be published 
in the second half of 2016.

 REGULATORY 
INITIATIVES 
PURSUANT TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

POLICY 

 
On numerous occasions the vast and varying 
international  experience  gathered  by  SEBI  through 
its international engagements with global bodies has 
been  carefully  applied  in  formulating  its  domestic 
policy.  The  deliberations  and  valuable  knowledge 
sharing efforts at the international level translate into 
the  formulation  and  adoption  of  global  standards. 
Such  standards  are,  time  and  again,  adopted  by 
SEBI in its domestic rule-making. While on the one 
hand, this demonstrates SEBI’s commitment towards 
the  international  community,  on  the  other  hand,  it 
enhances and lends the necessary breadth and depth 
to SEBI’s own policy formation.
 
SEBI has been proactive in developing policies 
based  on  issues  discussed  at  the  global  level.  For 
instance, international discussions and deliberations 
in  key  areas  such  as  Market  Conduct,  Corporate 
Governance,  Cyber  Security,  Regulation  of  Central 
Counter  Parties  (CCPs)  and  Digitalisation  have 
provided  very  useful  inputs,  and  have  been  used 
by  SEBI  in  its  domestic  regulation.  During  2015-
16,  SEBI  stipulated  a  Cyber  Security  and  Cyber 
Resilience Framework for stock exchanges, clearing 
corporations and depositories.
 
In addition to policy formation, SEBI continues 
to aim at improving the regulatory framework based 
on  feedback  at  the  international  level  received 
pursuant 
to  assessments  and  reviews.  Some 
instances  of  such  evaluations  are  the  IMF-World 
Bank’s  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Programme 
(FSAP), IOSCO’s thematic reviews and FSB’s reviews 
and surveys.

SEBI  has  signed  bilateral  MoUs  with  various 
securities regulators for enhancing cooperation and 
exchange of information for regulatory enforcement 
purposes and bilateral cooperation. The objective of 
such  bilateral  MoUs  is  to  strengthen  cross-border

bilateral MoUs facilitate mutual assistance, contribute 
towards  efficient  performance  of  the  supervisory 
functions  and  enable  effective  enforcement  of  the 
laws and regulations governing securities markets.

intent for mutual assistance and cooperation.
During  2015-16,  SEBI  entered  into  the  following

bilateral  cooperation  and  technical  assistance  at 
Dhaka, Bangladesh on November 22, 2015.

 Engagement  with 
regulators
Engagement with ESMA on EMIR
1. 
 
The European Parliament and Council adopted 
the  European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulations 
(EMIR)  effective  from August  2012. As  per Article 

25(1)  of  EMIR,  ‘a  Central  Counter  Party  (CCP) 
established  in  third  country  may  provide  services 
to  clearing  members  or  trading  venues  established 
in  the  Union  only  where  the  CCP  is  recognised 
by  ESMA.’  Therefore,  the  securities  market  CCPs 
established  and  operating  in  India  have  to  seek 
recognition from ESMA for clearing trades of entities 
which  are  originating  in  the  European  Union(EU). 
Before recognition is granted by ESMA, EU has to 
adopt an ‘implementing act’ with regard to India.

 
SEBI  provided  information  to  ESMA  about 
its  regulatory  laws  and  rules  which  helped  ESMA 
to  issue  a  Technical  Advice  to  EC  that  “CCPs  are 
subject  to  effective  supervision  and  enforcement 
in  India”  (October  2013).  Subsequently,  in  2014, 
SEBI  received  a  draft  MoU,  from  ESMA,  which  is 
a  prerequisite  of  recognition  under  EMIR  for  all 
future supervisory activities. Both SEBI and ESMA 
have further revised the MoU, and the same is at an 
advanced stage of discussion between the authorities, 
as  on  year  ending  March  2016.  Further  SEBI  and 
RBI  have  jointly  engaged  with  EC  to  complete  the 
provisions of EMIR, in order to enable EC to adopt

 Engagement  with  Autorité  des  marchés 
financiers 
(AMF), 
(Securities 
Regulator of France)

France 

On  the  side-lines  of  various  international 
 
meetings,  SEBI  and  AMF  had  discussed 
the 
possibility of engaging with each other with a view 
to learning from each other’s respective experiences 
and  also  for  identifying  areas  of  collaboration  and 
identifying  topics  in  which  technical  assistance 
could be facilitated.

After 

several 

closer  discussions, 

 
topics 
including  asset  management,  market  surveillance, 
SME  financing,  private  placements  and  crowd-
funding  were  identified  and  it  was  agreed  that 
these topics will be prioritised and interactions will 
initially  be  done  through  video-conference  calls 
followed by visits of experts.

 
Accordingly,  four  calls  took  place  between 
July 2015 and March 2016 between SEBI and AMF. 
Two  topics 
‘Asset  Management  Industry’  and 
‘Market Surveillance’ were deliberated upon during 
these  calls.  Officials  on  both  the  sides  felt  that  the 
discussions  were  informative  and  provided  an 
excellent  overview  of  how  the  respective  areas  are 
regulated and governed. Both parties will continue 
holding discussion in 2016-17.

3. 

Engagement between SEBI and US CFTC

 
During 2015-16, SEBI and CFTC discussed the 
possibility of engaging with each other with a view 
to  learning  from  each  other’s  experiences  and  also 
for identifying areas of collaboration. In the wake of 
the merger of Forwards Market Commission (FMC) 
with  SEBI,  it  was  agreed  that  CFTC  will  provide 
technical  assistance  to  SEBI  officials  in  the  area  of 
regulation of commodity derivatives.

 
It was agreed that technology will be leveraged 
to impart the training. SEBI officials will be provided 
with a unique URL, which will provide time-limited 

access to lectures on You Tube. This will allow SEBI 
officials to view the lectures in their time zone and 
at their convenience. The topics of the lectures will 
include Contract Design, Surveillance of Commodity 
Derivatives  Markets,  Addressing  Disorderly 
Markets, Elements of a Comprehensive Enforcement 
Programme,  Regulation  and  Supervision  of 
Intermediaries,  Regulation 
Supervision 
of Clearing Houses and 
and 
Contemporary  Challenges.  This  will  be  followed 
by  a  live  tele-conference  session  to  respond  to  the 
questions by SEBI officials. The first recorded lecture 
is scheduled to be provided by CFTC in April 2016.

thousand for the respondent (M/s Roofit Industries 
Ltd.) and ` 15 thousand in other cases respectively.

 
On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court,  vide  its  order  dated  November  26,  2015, 
allowed  the  appeals  while  setting  aside  the  orders 
passed by SAT on following grounds:

•	

The word ‘namely’ used in Section 15J of the 
SEBI Act, 1992 (SEBI Act, 1992) indicates that 
these factors alone are to be considered by the 
AO  while  deciding  the  quantum  of  penalty. 
The court, therefore, held that SAT was wrong 
in taking into account factors like the paying 
capacity  of  the  respondents  for  reducing  the 
penalty.

Prior to an amendment in 2002, non-furnishing 
of information was not treated as a continuing 
offence whereas after the amendment in 2002, 
non-furnishing  of  information  was  made  a 
continuing offence. Since in the present appeals 
the  last  reminder  sent  to  the  respondents  for 
furnishing  the  information  required  them 
to  provide  information  by  September  16, 
2002  which  was  not  provided,  therefore, 
violation took place prior to October 29, 2002. 
Accordingly, penalty under Section 15A (a) as 
it existed prior to 2002 could be imposed.
After  the  amendment  in  2002,  Section  15J 
which confers discretion to the AO for deciding 
the quantum of penalty, has application only in 
cases of Section15F (a) and 15HB. For all other 
violations the penalty has to be in accordance 
with  respective  charging  sections  in  Chapter 
VIA.
Amendments  made  to  SEBI  Act,  1992  in 
2014  bring  back  the  discretion  to  the AO  for 
imposing monetary penalties.

The issue of law before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court was whether stock brokers who have converted

their  individual/partnership  membership  into  a 
corporate entity prior to April 01, 1997 are entitled 
to  the  fee  continuity  benefit  in  terms  of  paragraph 
4 of Schedule III to the SEBI (Stock Brokers & Sub 
brokers) (SBSB) Regulations, 1992.

 
M/s Alliance Finstock Ltd. (Appellant No. 1) 
was  a  member  broker  of  BSE.  Mr.  Sunil  P.  Mantri 
(Appellant No. 2 and the Whole Time Director and 
shareholder  of  Appellant  No.  1)  was  registered  as 
a  broker  on  November  26,  1992  in  his  individual 
capacity  and  thereafter  formed  the  company  in 
1996 in the name of M/s Alliance Finstock Ltd. for 
carrying on the broker’s business. BSE approved the 
conversion of membership of the second appellant 
to corporate membership on July 09, 1996 and SEBI 
registered the first appellant as a corporate member 
of BSE on October 10, 1996. According to SEBI, since 
the corporatization was done prior to April 01, 1997, 
the appellants were not entitled to the fee continuity 
benefit. SAT allowed the appeal and held that SEBI 
was in error in restricting the benefits of paragraph 4 
to brokers who became corporate entities on or after 
April 01, 1997.

 
On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court dismissed the appeal and upheld SAT’s order. 
The  Supreme  Court  observed  that  paragraph  4  of 
Schedule  III  to  the  Regulations,  inserted  through 
an  amendment  with  effect  from  January  21,  1998, 
does  not  disclose,  either  explicitly  or  by  necessary 
implication,  that  a  corporate  entity  formed  earlier 
to  January  21,  1998  would  not  be  exempted  from 
payment of fee for the period for which the erstwhile 
individual  or  partnership  members  had  already 
paid the fees. Further, the explanation to paragraph 
4 introduced with effect from February 20, 2002 also 
does not restrict the benefits of conversion to entities 
converted on or after any particular date.

(respondent) was entitled to fee continuity benefit as 
was available to stock brokers before the NSE decided 
to permit segmental surrender of membership to its 
members.

 
The  fee  continuity  benefit  was  denied  by 
SEBI  since  the  basic  premise  on  which  this  benefit 
was  granted  was  no  more  valid  since  the  earlier 
conditions  specifically  imposed  by  NSE  while 
granting  assignment  of  the  wholesale  debt  market 
(WDM) segment from M/s Oracle Stocks and Shares 
Ltd. to the respondent stood revoked or cancelled. 
This decision was challenged by M/s Prebon Yamane 
India Ltd. before SAT which allowed the appeal on 
the ground that the subsequent enabling provision 
whereby segmental surrender was made permissible 
did not alter the fact that under direction from NSE, 
both Oracle and the respondent continued to have a 
concomitant existence. So long as this concomitant 
relationship  remained  undisturbed  and  was  not 
changed, the fee continuity should continue. In case 
the appellant  or Oracle ever failed to comply with 
the conditions imposed by NSE for this concomitant 
relationship  or  wished  to  change  this  position,  the 
fee continuity benefit should not be made available 
to them. Until that happened there was no ground 
for withdrawing the facility granted to them.

 
On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Supreme  Court  set 
aside  SAT’s  order  and  allowed  the  appeal  filed  by 
SEBI.  It  further  observed  that  as  per  Clause  4  of 
Schedule III of the SEBI (SBSB) Regulations, 1992, the 
respondent  was  not  an  ‘entity’  as  envisaged  in  the 
Regulations as would be entitled to ‘fee continuity’ 
or  exemption  from  payment  of  fees.  Regulation 
4  clearly  refers  to  a  newly  formed  entity  through 
conversion  from  either  a  sole  proprietorship  or  a 
partnership to a limited company, which alone has 
been bestowed the benefit of continuity.

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

‘annual turnover’ in Schedule III of the SEBI (SBSB) 
Regulations, 1992 for the purpose of calculating the 
broker fee.

 
SAT, by placing reliance on a circular issued 
by  RBI  in  1992  to  banks,  held  that  in  view  of  the 
limited role while dealing in the WDM segment, a 
broker does not receive the price of sale and purchase 
of  securities  nor  is  it  receivable  by  him.  Therefore, 
the price of the securities dealt by the broker in the 
WDM  segment  of  a  stock  exchange  does  not  form 
part of the annual turnover and cannot be used for 
computing registration fee of the broker.

 
On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Supreme  Court, 
vide  order  dated  November  24,  2015,  allowed  the 
appeal filed by the SEBI and held that the price of 
sale and purchase of securities dealt by the broker 
was  ‘receivable’  by  the  broker  for  his  clients  and 
therefore, it is a part of the ‘annual turnover’. It was 
further  observed  that  the  broker’s  annual  turnover 
must  include  the  value  of  the  entire  transaction 
for  computing  the  broker  fee  as  per  the  Broker 
Regulations  in  the  WDM  segment  and  can  in  no 
case be interpreted to mean only the amount earned 
by the broker by way of brokerage. After deciding 
the  question  of  law,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 
remanded the matter back to SAT for deciding other 
issues  raised  by  the  respondent  but  not  decided 
earlier  by  SAT  as  it  had  allowed  the  respondents’ 
appeal only on the issue of interpretation of ‘annual 
turnover’.

 SEBI vs. M/s Pan Asia Advisors Limited and 
others

 
The issue of law before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court was with respect to the jurisdiction of  SEBI  
under  the  SEBI   Act,  1992,    to  initiate  proceedings 
against  the  respondents  as  Lead    Managers  to  the 
Global  Depository  Receipts  (“GDRs”)    in    relation 
to  a  fraudulent  transaction    of    sale/purchase  of  
underlying shares released on redemption of  GDRs 
in  the securities market in  India.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

 
SEBI  had  received  alerts  about  large  scale 
off-market  transactions  in  its  surveillance  system 
regarding  certain  Foreign  Institutional  Investors 
(FIIs),  converting  the  GDRs  held  by  them  in  those 
companies  into  equity  shares  to  sell  in  the  Indian 
market.  From  investigation,  certain  manipulation/
fraud was noticed.

•	

•	

•	

•	

An arrangement was observed which involved 
the  subscriber  (which  was  also  controlled  by 
the  lead  manager  to  the  issue)  of  the  GDR 
issue  having  entered  into  a  loan  agreement 
with a foreign bank in order to avail of a loan 
to subscribe to the GDR issues.

The loan agreement executed by the subscriber 
was in turn supported by the issuer companies 
of the GDR themselves.  According to the loan 
agreement, the amount may only be transferred 
to the account of the issuer company maintained 
with the bank from which the loan was taken. 
To provide security for the loan availed by the 
subscriber, the subscription proceeds of GDRs 
were pledged by issuer companies. The pledge 
agreements  were  part  of  the  loan  agreement 
and vice versa.

As a result of the loan and pledge agreements, 
the subscription loan provided to the subscriber 
by the bank was used to acquire GDRs of the 
issuer company by the subscribers. The loan so 
granted by the bank was deposited in the form 
of a subscription fund in the GDR account of 
the issuer company, which in turn pledged the 
amount as security against the loan taken by 
the subscriber.

The  GDRs  so  acquired  were  transferred  to 
FIIs, who in turn converted them into shares 
of  issuer  companies  and  the  shares  were 
sold  in  the  Indian  market.  The  sale  of  such 
shares in the Indian market was the only step 
where  funds  were  provided  by  the  entities 
which were not under the control of Mr Arun

Panchariya.  Ultimately,  the  Indian  investors, 
and  not  the  foreign  investors,  paid  for  the 
issuance  of  GDRs  and  it  was  noticed  that  by 
such  a  fraudulent  and  manipulative  scheme, 
only a few book entries led to a large surge in 
the  capital  of  issuer  companies,  without  any 
actual fund inflow at the stage of issuance of 
GDRs.

In view of this, SEBI debarred M/s Pan Asia 
 
Advisors  Limited  and  Mr  Arun  Panchariya  from 
rendering  services  in  connection  with  instruments 
that are defined as securities under Section 2(h) of 
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956,  in  the 
Indian  market  or  in  any  way  dealing  with  them, 
directly  or  indirectly,  for  a  period  of  10  years.  Pan 
Asia  Advisors  Limited  and  Mr  Arun  Panchariya 
were  also  debarred  from  accessing  the  securities 
market, directly or indirectly, for a period of 10 years.

 
SAT,  by  a  majority  decision  of  2:1  set  aside 
SEBI’s order while observing that SEBI did not have 
jurisdiction over the creation and issuance of GDRs 
abroad.

 
On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court,  vide  its  order  dated  July  6,  2015  remanded  
the  matter  to    SAT  by  upholding  that  SEBI  has 
jurisdiction  over  issuance  of  GDRs  by  Indian 
companies and that it could also take action against 
lead managers of such issues if they had an adverse 
impact on the Indian securities market.

SEBI vs. Mr Devichand Hansraj Oswal

terms 

in  monetary 

 
The  question  of  law  involved  in  the  matter 
was  whether  SAT  possesses  the  power  to  impose 
a  punishment 
instead  of 
punishment  for  suspension  of  the  certificate  of 
registration for a term of a month.  Mr Devichand 
Hansraj Oswal (respondent) was a sub-broker who 
had  violated  provisions  of  SEBI  (Stock  Broker  and 
Sub-Broker)  Regulations,  1992  and  therefore,  the 
entity’s certificate of registration was suspended for 
two  months  by  SEBI  vide  its  order  dated  January 

12, 2006. SAT, vide its order dated February 08, 2006 
in  original  appeal  and  the  order  of  June  26,  2006 
in  review  petition,  held  the  respondent  liable  but 
changed  the  nature  of  penalty  from  a  two  month 
suspension to a monetary penalty of ` 50 thousand.

On appeal by SEBI, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
 
observed that the issue raised in the appeal had been 
settled in SEBI vs. M/s Saikala Associates Ltd. wherein it 
was held that where the contravention of a provision 
provides for either suspension or cancellation of the 
certificate of registration, a monetary penalty cannot 
be substituted in its stead. In view of the law being 
settled in this judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
set  aside  the  Impugned  Order  in  Review  Petition 
filed  before  SAT  and  remanded  the  appeal  filed 
before the Supreme Court  back  to  SAT  for  fresh  
consideration  of  the  penalty that  it  thought was 
appropriate  to  be  passed  against the respondent  
so  far  as  culpability was concerned,  as  had already 
been  found  to  exist  keeping  in  view  the  law  laid 
down in the case of M/s Saikala Associates Ltd.

The issue for consideration before the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court was whether the Hitachi Group and 
the M/s Lalbhai Group ‘acted in concert’ at the time 
of  purchase  of  shares  by  M/s  Lalbhai  Group  from 
ICICI Bank, so as to term the subsequent acquisition 
made  by  Hitachi  Group  from  M/s  Lalbhai  Group, 
eligible for exemption under Regulation 3(1) (e) (iii) 
(a) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997.

 
M/s  Lalbhai  Group  and  Hitachi  Group

dated January 22, 1999 wherein M/s Lalbhai group 
held 35.2 per cent and M/s Hitachi India Pvt. Ltd. & 
M/s  Hitachi  Ltd.  held  35.2  per  cent  whereas  the 
rest  was  held  by  the  public.  M/s  Lalbhai  Group 
entered  into  a  pledge  agreement  with  ICICI  Bank

the repurchase of shares from ICICI Bank wherein 
it  was  observed  that  the  application  was  made  by 
M/s Lalbhai Group only and not with M/s Hitachi

In  the  meanwhile,  the  M/s  Lalbhai  Group 
acquired  9.94  per  cent  shares  from  ICICI  Bank  at  
` 33.53  per 
the  entire 
shareholding held by M/s Lalbhai Group (19.37 per 
cent)  was  acquired  by  M/s  Hitachi  Group  which 
was  stated  to  be  done  at  `  41.63  per  share.  For 
this  acquisition  of  19.37  per  cent  by  Hitachi  from  
M/s Lalbhai Group, a report in terms of Regulation 
3(4) of the SAST Regulations was filed by M/s Hitachi 
Group wherein it was stated that the acquisition price 
was in accordance with Explanation 1 to Regulation 
3(1)  (e)  of  the  SAST  Regulations  as  it  was  within  
25 per cent of the highest price in terms of Regulation 
20 of the SAST Regulations.

 
SEBI came to the conclusion that these parties 
were not acting in concert so far as the target company 
was concerned. However, SAT, vide its order dated 
July 6, 2005, overturned SEBI’s decision.

 
On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court  held  that  the  interpretation  and  meaning 
of  the  words  ‘persons  acting  in  concert’  had  been 
thoroughly explained by it in the matter of M/s Daiichi 
Sankyo Company Limited vs. Mr Jayaram Chigurupati, 
and concurred with it.

 
It  was  further  observed  that  at  the  relevant 
time  the  purchase  price  of  the  shareholding  of  

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

M/s Lalbhai Group by M/s Hitachi Group was about 
` 41 per share. It transpired that these shares were 
of ` 1,468. If SEBI’s decision were to be upheld, the 
consequences  would  be  that  Hitachi  Group  would 
have to make a public offer to purchase the shares 
of any of the shareholders of the target company at 
` 41 together with interest at the rate of 10 per cent 
per annum from May 01, 2003. Since the shares were 
being traded at ` 1,468 per share, which was much 
higher than the said rate of ` 41 per share together 
with  interest  thereon,  the  dispute  became  purely 
academic in nature.

However, it was made clear that if SAT’s order was 
not  in  conformity  with  the  M/s  Daiichi  Sankyo 
judgment then it would not be treated as precedent.

The 

respondent, 

 
as  
M/s  Malanpur  Steels  Ltd.,  was  a  sick  company 
which had been referred to the Board for Industrial 
and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in terms of the 
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 
1985 (SICA). As the company had failed to redress 
the complaints from its investors, SEBI had imposed 
a  penalty  on  the  company  in  terms  of  Section  15C 
of the SEBI Act, 1992 which provides for imposing 
penalty for failure to redress investors’ grievances.

 
SAT  set  aside  the  penalty  imposed  by  SEBI, 
while observing that in terms of Section 22 of SICA, 
no proceedings can be undertaken to recover money 
from  such  sick  companies  till  the  matter  is  under 
consideration by BIFR.

On  appeal  by  SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
 
Court, vide its order dated September 24, 2015, held 
that  if  a  direction  under  Section  15C  of  the  SEBI 
Act  does  not  have  the  effect  of  requiring  the  sick 
company to pay to its creditors, then such a direction 
would not be covered by the embargo envisaged in

its membership to a new entity in terms of relevant 
provisions  of  the  Securities  Contracts  Regulation 
Rules, 1957.

 
On  appeal  by  the  appellant,  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  observed  that  the  original  trading 
membership  of  the  NSE  had  been  obtained  by  
M/s  Onida  Finance  Ltd.  (OFL)  on  September  16, 
1994  but  when  NSE  raised  objections  about  its 
fund-based activities, the license was transferred to  
M/s  OFL  Securities  Ltd.  on  February  07,  1995. 
Thereafter, 
in  1999-2000,  M/s  OFL  Securities 
Ltd.  transferred  its  trading  license  to  M/s  Gulita  
Securities  Ltd.  Thus,  the  trading  membership  was 
transferred  twice  but  only  the  first  transfer  was 
under  compulsion  of  law.  Therefore,  it  was  held  
that  the  appellant  was  not  entitled  to  a  fee  
continuity benefit.

SEBI vs. Mr A.R. Dahiya

 
Mr V.P. Garg, an individual, had entered into 
an  agreement  with  the  Haryana  State  Industrial 
Development  Corporation  Limited  (HSIDC)  on 
January  04,  1993  for  setting  up  a  hotel  and  the 
parties agreed to collaborate for the implementation 
of  the  project  through  Polo  Hotels  Ltd.  (the  target 
company), a company set up by Mr Garg. Further, 
HSIDC  extended  a  term  loan  to  Mr  Garg  and 
subscribed to three lakh shares of Polo Hotels Ltd. 
with  an  agreement  wherein  Mr  Garg  was  bound 
to  buy  the  shares  from  HSIDC  after  a  period  of 
time.  Around  March  1999,  Mr  Garg  entered  into 
an agreement with the Mr A. R. Dahiya (appellant) 
for  the  sale  of  his  entire  shareholding  of  28.09  per 
cent  in  the  target  company.  The  appellant  wrote 
a  letter  dated  April  15,  1999  to  HSIDC  informing 
it of the decision and for complete takeover of the 
management  of  the  target  company.  The  appellant 
confirmed    that    he    was    prepared    to    buy-back  

HSIDC’s  equity    holding    but  requested  that  since 
he  was  facing  a  stringent  liquidity  problem,  the 
payment for the buy-back which was due in April 
1999 be instead made in monthly instalments of ` 20 
lakh each with effect from September 1999. Enclosed 
with  the  letter  were  four  post-dated  cheques  with 
respect to the said buy-back obligations, amounting 
to a total of ` 71.3 lakh.

On April 20, 1999, Mr Garg and the appellant 
 
entered  into  an  agreement  whereby  the  appellant 
agreed  to  purchase  the  entire  share  capital  of  
28.09 per cent held by Mr Garg at the rate of ` 8.50 
per fully paid up equity share. Since this acquisition 
was in excess of 15 per cent of the total shareholding 
of  the  target  company,  the  regulations  under  the 
SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  1997,  were  attracted.  In 
order to comply with the regulations, the appellant 
made  a    public    announcement    on   April  24,1999  
making  an  offer  to  the  remaining shareholders 
of  the  target  company  to  purchase  a  minimum  of 
20 per cent shares of the company at an offer price 
of  `  8.75  per  equity  share.  However,  the  appellant 
did not mention buying back the shares of HSIDC 
in its public announcement and in the letter sent to 
SEBI.  Subsequently,  a  complaint  was  received  by 
SEBI alleging that the appellant had acquired three 
lakh equity shares from HSIDC for ` 71.3 lakh at the 
rate of ` 23.75 per share, whereas the shares were not 
offered at the same price to the existing shareholders. 
Accordingly,  after  taking  into  consideration  the 
submissions  of  the  appellant,  SEBI  directed  the 
appellant to make an offer at the rate of ` 23.75 per 
share which was upheld by SAT.

The issues raised before the Hon’ble Supreme 

 
Court were:

(i)  Whether the transaction of buy-back of shares 
which  transpired  between  the  appellant  and 
HSIDC  was  required  to  be  disclosed  in  the 
public announcement dated April 24, 1999?

(ii)  Whether the post-dated cheques given by the 
appellant to HSIDC were by way of guarantee?

184

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

(iii)  Whether  the  dishonouring  of  cheques  which 
resulted in non-culmination of the transaction 
between the appellant and HSIDC and thus the 
price  should  not  be  taken  into  consideration 
for determining the offer price?

court,  on  interpreting  the  definition  of  acquisition 
provided  under  Regulation  2(1)  (a)  of  the  SAST 
Regulations held that the actual transfer need not be 
contemporaneous with the intended transfer and it 
could be in the future.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

On the first issue, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
 
observed that the  buy-back  transaction  between  the 
appellant  and  HSIDC  was  incapable  of  triggering  
Regulation  10 of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997, as 
the transaction was protected by Regulation 3 of the 
SAST Regulations. The court held that Regulation 3 
only  protects  a  transaction  between  a  co-promoter 
and  a  state  financial  institution  to  the  extent  that, 
as  a  consequence  of  such  a    transaction    a    public  
announcement  will  not  be  required  to  be  made  as 
provided under Regulations 10, 11 and 12. However, 
it does not imply that the transaction is to be protected 
from  the  rigours  of  other  regulations  provided  for 
under  the  act.  Thus,  the  transaction  between  the 
appellant  and  HSIDC  will  have  to  be  subject  to 
Regulations 16 and 20 of the SAST Regulations and 
the  rate  at  which  the  appellant  bought  back  the 
shares from HSIDC had to be disclosed in the public 
announcement.

 
On  the  second  issue,  the  court  rejected  the 
argument  of  the  appellant  in  light  of  the  fact  that 
it was denied by HSIDC in its letter to SEBI dated 
January 11, 2001 wherein HSIDC had stated that the 
post-dated cheques had been issued in consideration 
of the buy-back of shares.

 
On  the  third  issue,  the  court  observed  that 
post-dated cheques issued by the appellant in favour 
of HSIDC were in  consideration  of  the  buy-back  of  
the  shares  held  by  HSIDC  in  the target company. 
It was further observed that the post-dated cheques 
amounted  to  a  promise  to  pay  and  that  promise 
would  be  fulfilled  on  the  date  mentioned  on  the 
cheque.    Thus,  this  promise  to  pay  amounted  to  a 
sale of shares/equity. The subsequent dishonouring 
of the post-dated cheques would have no bearing on 
the  case.  With  regard  to  the  term  ‘acquisition’,  the 

The appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed and 
the order dated March 01, 2003 passed by SEBI was 
upheld.

k.  M/s Kosha Investments Ltd. vs. SEBI

 
SEBI passed an order dated January 27, 2004 
wherein  it  observed  that  M/s  Kosha  Investment 
Ltd. (KIL) was already holding between 15 to 75 per 
cent  shares  of  M/s  Snowcem  India  Ltd.  (SIL)  and 
it  could  acquire  additional  shares  of  SIL  through 
creeping acquisition mode, that is, without a public 
announcement,  only  upto  5  per  cent  of  its  paid 
up  capital  during  the  period  of  12  months  ending 
on  31st  March  2000.  However,  by  acquiring  11, 
36,700 SIL shares during June 1999 to August 1999, 
KIL  had  acquired  shares  constituting  more  than  
5 per cent of the paid up capital of SIL. For making 
such an acquisition, KIL was liable to make a public 
announcement  as  required  by  Regulation  11(1)  of 
the  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  1997.  The  order  was 
challenged  before  SAT.  However,  the  appeal  was 
dismissed by SAT. Aggrieved by this, the appeal was 
filed under Section 15Z of the SEBI Act, 1992.

 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court, while dismissing 
the appeal vide its order dated September 18, 2015 
held that if the aggregate percentage of acquisitions 
at any point of time during the financial year exceeds 
five per cent, the provision of Regulation 11 of the 
SAST Regulations mandating a public announcement 
will kick in at any stage whence the shareholding of 
the entity in the target company would exceed 25 per 
cent.

It  was  further  held  that  the  concept  of 
 
permitting  creeping  acquisitions  by  permitting  not 
more than five per cent of the shares or voting rights 
in a company limited the period for such acquisition

to  a  financial  year  ending  31st  March.  But  such  a 
concept did not dilute the requirement of making a 
public announcement within the time mentioned in 
Regulation 14(1), if the acquisition, even if only once 
made and divested is of more than five per cent of 
shares or voting rights in the target company. In other 
words, even if such an acquisition is followed by sale 
in the same financial year, the liability of making the 
public announcement would remain unaffected and 
would attract action, as in this case.

The  Calcutta High Court vide order dated May 11, 2015, inter-alia held that:
 ‘There  is  no  dispute  about  the  fact  that  thousands  of  people  have  invested  money  in  the  petitioner  company  and/or  its  associate 
companies. Some of such people have invested their life time savings with the expectation of earning good returns as they were assured by these  
companies. Now all such investors are facing the risk of losing their money. It is public knowledge that these companies including the 
petitioner, are facing legal proceedings before various law enforcement agencies including SEBI and CBI. However, this Court sees nothing 
wrong with the intention of the petitioner of disposing of its properties solely for the purpose of repaying the investors. In fact, such  
suggestion is laudable. Nobody can possibly dispute that the interest of the investors is paramount and disposal of the assets of the petitioner 
would create a fund that would secure the interest of the investors at least to some extent.
	This	Court	suggested	that	an	Assets	Disposal	Committee	be	constituted	for	supervising	the	sale	of	assets	of	the	petitioner.	On	principle,	
both	the	petitioner	and	the	State	had	agreed	to	such	suggestion.	Since	the	petitioner	has	offered	to	dispose	of	its	assets	for	the	purpose	of	
repaying	the	investors,	this	Court	feels	that	such	offer	should	be	accepted	in	the	interest	of	the	investors.
	Accordingly,	this	Court	constitutes	an	Assets	Disposal	Committee	which	will	have	the	following	members:
i)	 The	Hon’ble	Justice	Dilip	Kumar	Seth	[Retd.],	a	former	Judge	of	this	Court,	who	shall	be	the	Chairman	of	the	Committee;
ii)	 The	Inspector	General	–	Registration,	Government	of	West	Bengal	or	his	nominee;	and
iii)  The Managing Director of the petitioner company.
The	Committee	shall	initially	sell	the	assets	of	the	petitioner	which	are	situated	in	West	Bengal	as	mentioned	at	page	45	of	the	writ	petition.
 The assets will be sold by public auction so that the best possible price is fetched. The assets may be sold by private treaty, if the intending 
purchaser can match the highest price obtained in the public auction. The auction should be well-publicised in the newspapers. The expenses 
incidental	to	such	public	auction	shall	be	borne	by	the	petitioner.	Initially	a	sum	of	rupees	five	lakh)	shall	be	deposited	by	the	petitioner	with	
the	Committee	which	will	form	the	corpus	out	of	which	the	expenses	relating	to	the	auction	will	be	met.	The	detailed	modalities	of	carrying

acting  as  an  unauthorised  CIS  amongst  other 
directions.

 Vide the said order, the  Guwahati High Court while dismissing the writ petition, observed:
i. 

 ‘There is no credible material placed by the petitioner to convince the court that all the members who have subscribed had the dominant 
intention of enjoying the stay at the hotels.’
 ‘On the basis of incoherent material produced by the petitioner like format of the membership it is not possible to agree with the 
contention that the scheme is only a holiday management scheme and does not come under the purview of the collective investment 
scheme more so because of the fact that there is a term in the contract of refund of money with a lucrative rate of interest. If the interest 
on deposit was the alluring factor on the part of the investors then the case would squarely fall under sub-clause (ii) of sub-Section 2 
of Section 11AA of the SEBI Act. These facts constitute a mixed question of law and fact and has to be decided by SEBI.’
 ‘We	find	that	there	was	no	difficulty	for	the	petitioner	to	have	submitted	to	this	jurisdiction	of	the	SEBI	and	produced	all	the	records	to	
convince the SEBI that the scheme is genuinely a holiday management scheme and does not constitute a collective investment scheme 
and thus could have excluded themselves from the jurisdiction of SEBI.’
 ‘With regard to the delegation of powers to the Board incorporated under sub-Section 2A of Section 11AA to frame regulations cannot 
be considered as excessive delegation because in any statute or rule framed by the legislature the framers cannot anticipate and foresee 
every kind of situation that may arise in the operation of the provisions of the enactment. Therefore it is always the legislative policy 
to give a delegated power in every enactment to the authorities to operate the provisions of the Act. Such a provision in itself cannot 
be	considered	illegal	unless	any	regulation	or	rule	is	made	by	the	delegated	authority	is	in	conflict	with	the	main	provision	then	such	
regulation can be held bad. The power to lay down the conditions regarding the scheme or arrangement in the context of the provisions 
of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the subjects it deals with cannot be considered as uncanalised and excessive delegation.’

 M/s  Kalyan  Janta  Sahakari  Bank  Ltd.  vs. 
State	of	Gujarat	and	Others(in	the	matter	of	
M/s Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited 
[SSNNL])

The  petitioners, 

 
inter-alia  challenged  the 
constitutional  validity  of  M/s  Sardar  Sarovar 
Narmada Nigam Limited (Conferment of Power to 
Redeem  Bonds) Act,  2008  in  a  writ  petition  before 
the Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat (the High Court).

 
M/s Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited, 
respondent No. 2 (SSNL) came out with an issue of 
Deep Discount Bonds (DDBs) by issuing a prospectus 
on September 29, 1993. The bonds were issued in 1994 
at a discounted price for tenure of 20 years and were 
redeemable  at  the  option  of  the  bond-holder.  On 
March 29, 2008, the State of Gujarat promulgated the 
impugned  act  whereby,  notwithstanding  anything 
contained in the prospectus, SSNL was conferred the 
power to redeem the bonds prior to the end of the 
original  period  contemplated.  Accordingly,  SSNL 
issued  notice  of  redemption  to  the  bond-holders 
and  fixed  the  date  of  redemption  as  January  10, 
2009.  Subsequently,  the  bond-holders  vide  various 
petitions challenged the constitutional validity of the 
impugned act passed by the Gujarat state legislature.

 
The  High  Court  in  this  regard  held  the 
impugned  M/s  Sardar  Sarovar  Narmada  Nigam 
Limited  (Conferment  of  Power  to  Redeem  Bonds) 
Act, 2008 to be unconstitutional and upheld SEBI’s 
jurisdiction.  It  was  further  observed  that  the 
operation  of  the  two  laws  --Securities  Contracts 

(Regulation) Act and the SEBI Act -- was in the very 
subject-matter  area  dealt  with  by  the  impugned 
legislation. The impugned law suffers from the vice 
of  irreconcilable  operationally  vis-a-vis  referred  to 
parliamentary legislations.

 SECURITIES  APPELLATE  TRIBUNAL 
(SAT)

a. 

Inland Printers Limited vs. SEBI

 
SAT  held  that  obligation  cast  on  the  listed 
company to make disclosures to the stock exchange 
under  Regulation  8(3)  of  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations, 
1997  was:  firstly,  the  yearly  disclosure  to  be  made 
within 30 days of each financial year ended on 31st 
March; and secondly, disclosure to be made at each 
record date fixed by the company for the purposes 
of dividend. The very fact that multiple disclosures 
are  required  to  be  made  especially  by  dividend 
paying  listed  companies  under  Regulation  8(3) 
clearly shows that the obligation to make disclosures 
under  Regulation  8(3)  is  not  dependent  on  the 
yearly disclosures to be made by the shareholders/
promoters  under  Regulations  8(1)  and  8(2)  to  the 
company.  In  other  words,  while  the  shareholders/
promoters of the company are obliged to make annual 
disclosures to the company under Regulations 8(1) 
and  8(2),  the  company  is  obliged  to  make  annual 
disclosures to the stock exchanges under Regulation 
8(3). To put it simply, if the shareholders/promoters 
fail  to  make  annual  disclosures  under  Regulations 
8(1) and 8(2) they are liable for penal action under 
Section15A (b) of SEBI Act and if the company fails 
to  make  annual  disclosures  to  stock  exchanges 
within the time stipulated under Regulation 8(3), the 
company is liable for penal action under Section15A 
(b) of the SEBI Act. Further, the obligation to make 
yearly disclosures is a continual obligation and not a 
conditional obligation. Regulation 8(3) provides that 
every listed company has to make yearly disclosures 
to all the stock exchanges on which the shares of the 
company  are  listed  and  thereafter  uses  the  words 
‘the  changes,  if  any’  which  obviously  means  that

Reliance Petro investments Limited vs. SEBI

 
The  appeal  challenged  the  order  of  the 
Adjudicating  Officer  (AO)  dated  May  02,  2013 
imposing  a  penalty  of  `  11  crore  on  Reliance 
Petroinvestments  Limited  (RPIL).  The  AO  found 
that during February 27, 2007 to March 2, 2007, RPIL 
had  traded  in  the  scrip  of  Indian  Petrochemicals 
Corporation Ltd. (IPCL) on the basis of unpublished 
price sensitive information (UPSI) in the form of a 
declaration  of  interim  dividend  on  equity  shares 
of  IPCL  and  amalgamation  of  IPCL  with  Reliance 
Industries  Limited  (RIL).  In  view  of  this,  the  AO 
concluded  that  RPIL  was  in  possession  of  UPSI 
while  trading  in  the  scrip  of  IPCL  prior  to  an 
announcement  of  declaration  of  interim  dividend 
and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL which resulted 
in violation of Regulation 3 of SEBI (Prohibition of 
Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992.

In appeal, SAT vide order dated December 07, 2015 
observed that apart from denying that the appellant 
was  an  insider,  it  had  placed  on  record  various 
documents  to  rebut  the  presumption  of  being  in 
possession of UPSI at the time of purchasing shares 
of IPCL and the appellant also made a submission to 
the  effect  that  the  price  sensitive  information  itself 
came into existence after the shares were purchased 
by it. SAT held that since the impugned order was 
passed merely on the basis of presumption without 
considering the arguments advanced on behalf of the 
appellant  to  rebut  the  presumption,  the  impugned 
order was quashed and set aside and the matter was 
restored  to  the  file  SEBI’s  Adjudicating  Officer  for 
passing  a  fresh  order  on  merit  and  in  accordance 
with the law.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

c. 

PACL Ltd.

 
SAT  held  in  the  matter  that  protection  of 
investors’  interests  is  of  paramount  consideration 
under  the  SEBI  Act  and  once  it  is  found  that  any 
CIS is operating in any manner which is detrimental 
to  the  interests  of  the  investors,  then  SEBI  instead 
of  following  the  procedure  prescribed  under  CIS 
Regulations,  is  duty  bound  to  take  immediate 
steps to protect the interests of investors by issuing 
appropriate  directions  under  Section  11/11B  of  the 
SEBI Act. 

On the issue of deemed CIS, SAT was of the 
 
view that Regulation 74A inserted in the SEBI (CIS 
Regulations),  1999  is  applicable  only  to  deemed 
CIS  covered  under  the  proviso  to  Section  11AA(1) 
inserted with retrospective effect from July 18,2013. 
Regulation 74A provides that such deemed CIS shall 
comply with Chapter IX of the CIS Regulations by 
seeking registration under Regulation 5 within two 
months  of  Regulation  74A  coming  into  force. Any 
CIS  which  satisfies  the  conditions  set  out  under 
Section11AA  (2)  will  be  outside  the  purview  of 
deeming  fiction  introduced  under  the  proviso  to 
Section11AA  (1).  Regulation  74A  is  thus  restricted 
to only CIS which are deemed to be CIS under the 
proviso  to  Section  11AA(1)  and  it  is  not  intended 
to offer amnesty to CIS which were covered under 
Section 11AA(1) prior to the insertion of proviso to 
Section 11AA(1) of the SEBI Act. 

 
SAT also held on the issue of existing CIS that 
Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act had made it mandatory 
for any person to obtain a certificate of registration 
for operating  CIS with  effect from January  25,1995 
and  existing  CIS  may  continue  till  SEBI  forms  the 
regulations.  As  per  CIS  Regulations,  which  came 
into  force  with  effect  from  October  15,1999,  any 
person operating a CIS prior to the commencement 
of the CIS Regulations has to make an application to 
SEBI for grant of a certificate within a period of two 
months  from  October  15,1999  in  accordance  with 
Chapter IX of the CIS Regulations. Thus, operating 
CIS  without  obtaining  a  certificate  of  registration

Mr.  Omprakash  Basantlal  Goenka,  Mr.  Prakash 
Ganpat Utekar, Mr. Venkataraman Natrajan and Mr. 
Narayan Shivram Kotnis.  It was held by SAT that 
CIS schemes running in guise of time share business 
without seeking registration were in violation of CIS 
Regulations cannot be faulted. 

 
It  was  also  held  that  while  deciding  cases 
pertaining  to  CIS,  SEBI  should  indicate  whether 
the  schemes  were  detrimental  to  the  interests 
of  the  investors  apart  from  the  fact  that  the  CIS 
schemes were floated and operated without seeking 
registration  under  the  CIS  Regulations.  In  these 
circumstances, while upholding the decision of SEBI 
that  RTSCP  had  floated  and  operated  CIS  without 
registering with SEBI and hence in violation of CIS 
Regulations,  since  the  schemes  are  closed  by  them 
voluntarily and substantial amount was refunded to 
the  investors,  SAT  granted  extension  of  two  years’ 
time  from  the  date  of  order  to  the  Appellants  to 
enable them to pay the balance amount refundable 
to the investors.

Citrus	Check	Inns	Ltd.	

 
The  appeal  was  filed  by  Citrus  Check  Inns 
Ltd, Mr. Omprakash Basantlal Goenka, Mr. Prakash 
Ganpat Utekar, Mr. Venkataraman Natrajan and Mr. 
Narayan  Shivram  Kotnis.  It  was  held  by  SAT  that 
the  fundamental  legislative  purpose  in  entrusting 
SEBI with the affairs of various collective investment 
schemes companies is to register and regulate them 
under the Regulations so that the interest of crores 
and  crores  of  gullible  investors  could  be  duly 
protected.  Further,  SEBI  should  grant  registration 
to a willing company, which is currently operating a 
CIS without obtaining registration.

 
SEBI  passed  a  common  adjudication  order 
dated  August  27,  2014  against  Shri  Jai  Kishan 
Lakhmani  (client)  and  Religare  Securities  Limited 
(Religare) in the matter of Veritas India Ltd.  (VIL) 
that the trades in the shares of VIL executed by the 
client  through  Religare  during  January  19,  2010  to 
March  02,  2010  were  fictitious  transactions  carried 
out in violation of PFUTP Regulations. Accordingly, 
penalty of ` 10 lakh was imposed against the client 
under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for violating the 
provisions contained in the PFUTP Regulations. By 
the impugned order it was also held that Religare by 
assisting the client in executing fictitious trades has 
violated  Regulation  3(a),(b),(c),(d)  and  Regulation 
4(1), 4(2)(a) of the PFUTP Regulations and Clauses 
A(1),A(3),A(4) and A(5) of the Code of Conduct as 
specified  in  Schedule  II  under  Regulation  7  of  the 
SBSB Regulations. Accordingly, a penalty of ` 8 lakh 
and  `  2  lakh  was  imposed  against  Religare  under 
Section 15HA and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 
respectively  for  violating  the  PFUTP  Regulations 
and Brokers Regulations. Religare appealed against 
the order before SAT.

 
Religare  submitted  that  it  had  provided 
internet based trading facility to its client and that 
in the online trading mechanism the order is placed 
by  the  client  on  the  website  of  the  broker  and  the 
website of the broker routes the trade to the exchange 
platform for execution. Thus, in the internet based 
trading system, the question of the involvement of 
the  broker  did  not  arise.    SAT  held  that  providing 
an  internet  based  trading  platform  was  not  akin 
to providing a STD booth facility to a customer. In 
the  STD  booth  facility,  the  service  provider  is  not 
expected  to  know  the  purpose  for  which  the  STD 
facility is being used by a customer. However, in the 
case of an internet based trading platform, in spite 
of the fact that the trades are executed by the client 
directly, the stock broker is required to monitor the 
trades  and  ensure  that  they  are  executed  by  the

a  penalty  is  imposable  when  the  regulations  are 
violated even if such violations do not result in any 
loss to the investors.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

 
It  was  further  held  that  there  is  nothing  in 
the  impugned  order  to  suggest  that  apart  from 
providing  the  trading  platform  to  trade  in  the 
ordinary course of business, the appellant was party 
to  the  manipulative,  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade 
practices  executed  by  the  client.  The  fact  that  the 
appellant was not vigilant in monitoring the trades 
executed by the client through the trading platform 
provided by the appellant could not ipso-facto be a 
ground  to  hold  that  the  appellant  was  aiding  and 
abetting  the  client  in  executing  fictitious  trades  in 
violation of PFUTP Regulations.

 
Therefore,  the  appeal  was  partly  allowed 
by deleting the penalty of `  8 lakh imposed under 
Section 15HA of the SEBI Act and by sustaining the 
penalty of ` 2 lakh imposed under Section 15HB of 
the SEBI Act.

Luharuka	Commotrade	Pvt.	Ltd.	vs.	SEBI	

 
SAT held that as the shares were not acquired 
by  the  appellant  as  a  person  acting  in  concert,  it 
was  obvious  that  the  appellant  had  acquired  the 
shares  in  question  in  its  individual  capacity  and 
since the acquisition was in excess of 15 per cent of 
the share capital of CFL, under Regulation 10 read 
with Regulation 14(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 
1997,  the  appellant  was  required  to  make  a  public 
offer within four days from the acquisition. In these 
circumstances, where the shares of CFL were acquired 
by the appellant in its individual capacity, the fact that 
the promoters of CFL had diluted their shareholding 
in CFL would have no bearing on the fact of present 
case.    Further,  the  argument  of  the  appellant  that 
delayed compliance of the open offer has occurred 
inadvertently  and  since  delayed  compliance  had 
not caused any loss to the shareholders no penalty 
could be imposed was without any merit. Under the 
Takeover Regulations, 1997 imposition of penalty is 
not dependent on the loss caused to the shareholders 
on account of the delay in making an open offer and

Gopalakrishnan Raman vs. SEBI 

 
SAT  held  that  the  obligation  to  make  yearly 
disclosures  under  Regulation  8(2)  and  Regulation 
30(2)  of  the  Takeover  Regulations  framed  by  SEBI 
in 1997 and 2011 respectively was on the promoter/
promoter group. If the promoters of a listed company 
were individual promoters then the obligation was 
on the individual promoters and in case there was 
a  ‘promoter  group’  then  the  promoter  group  was 
required to make yearly disclosure. If the promoter 
group failed to disclose the shares or voting rights 
held  by  the  promoters  in  the  promoter  group  as 
also their PACs within the time stipulated under the 
Takeover  Regulations,  then  penalty  was  imposable 
on the promoter group which would be recoverable 
jointly  and  severally  from  the  promoters  in  the 
promoter group who held shares or voting rights in 
the target company with their PACs.

i. 

Ravi Mohan & Others vs. SEBI 

SAT  held  that  the  expression 

 
‘acquirer’ 
defined  under  Regulation  2(1)  (e)  of  the  Takeover 
Regulations framed by SEBI in 1997 stipulates that 
wherever  the  expression  ‘acquirer’  is  used  in  the 
Takeover Regulations, 1997 it shall refer to a person 
who  acquires  shares  or  voting  rights  in  the  target 
company either by himself or with any person acting 
in concert with the acquirer. Therefore, purchase or 
sale  of  shares  by  ‘any  acquirer’  under  Regulation 
7(1A) refers to purchase or sale of shares effected by 
the acquirer either by himself or with persons acting 
in concert with the acquirer and will not be relatable 
to purchase or sale of shares by the acquirer alone as 
contended by the appellants. 

 
Under  Regulation  7(1A)  of  the  Takeover 
Regulations,  1997  an  acquirer  who,  together  with 
persons acting in concert with him has acquired 15 
per cent or more but less than 55 per cent shares of 
a  target  company  purchases  or  sells  shares  of  the 

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

191

target company together with the persons acting in 
concert with the acquirer, aggregating 2 per cent or 
more of the share capital of the target company, then 
the acquirer is required to make a disclosure of the 
purchase or sale within two days of purchase or sale 
under Regulation 7(1A) read with Regulation 7(2) of 
the Takeover Regulations, 1997.

 
It  was  thus  held  that  the  obligation  to  make 
disclosures under Regulation 7(1A) of the Takeover 
Computation, 1997 arises when an acquirer covered 
under Regulation 11(1) purchases or sells shares of 
the target company together with persons acting in 
concert with that acquirer, aggregating to 2 per cent 
or more of the share capital of the target company. 

 
Since a disclosure obligation under Regulation 
7(1A)  has  to  be  discharged  in  accordance  with 
Regulation  7(1A)  read  with  Regulation  7(2).  Since 
Regulation  7(2)  does  not  contemplate  disclosure 
relating to sale of shares in excess of the limits set 
out  under  Regulation  7(1A),  appellants  cannot  be 
said to have failed to comply with regulation 7(1A) 
within  the  time  stipulated  under  Regulation  7(1A) 
read with Regulation 7(2).

impugning 

An  appeal  was  filed 

 
the 
adjudication  order  dated  February  06,  2015, 
whereby a penalty of rupees two lakh was imposed 
on the appellant under the provisions of Section 15C 
of  the  SEBI Act,  1992  for  non-redressal  of  investor 
grievances within the prescribed time period under 
the  SEBI  Complaints  Redress  System  (SCORES). 
As  per  the  impugned  order,  the  appellant  had  not 
redressed  two  investor  grievances  pending  against 
it out of which one complaint had been pending for 
more than two years as per SCORES. 

 
With respect to the complaint of Ms Monisha 
Jeet, the appellant filed an action taken report (ATR) 
on  August  20,  2013  after  redressing  the  grievance 
and enclosed a letter dated August 16, 2013 seeking 
clarification from the complainant as to whether the 
complainant was in fact a shareholder of the appellant 

company. SEBI contended that the appellant should 
have filed a final ATR after receipt of reminder sent 
by  SEBI  on  September  05,  2013,  even  though  the 
complainant was not a shareholder of the appellant 
company.

SAT  observed  from  the  records  that  Ms 
 
Monisha  Jeet  had  never  been  a  shareholder  of  the 
appellant company. Therefore, it was observed that 
such  a  bogus  complaint  by  an  outsider/alien  to 
the appellant company could not form the basis of 
punishment. A person not holding any shares in a 
company could not have a locus to seek redressal of 
non-existent grievances.

 
With  respect  to  the  complaint  of  Mr  Harjit 
Singh,  the  appellant  company  filed  an  ATR  on 
August 07, 2013 and enclosed a copy of the e-mail 
dated August 06, 2013 sent to the complainant. The 
appellant company sent a reminder to the mail on 
August 14, 2013. SEBI contended that the appellant 
should have filed a final separate ATR with respect 
to the reminder received by it from SEBI. 

SAT  observed  that  the  requirement  of  two 
 
reminders as stated in the SEBI circular dated June 
25,  2009  has  been  rescinded  vide  paragraph  5  of 
the  subsequent  SEBI  circular  dated  June  03,  2011. 
The  circular  dated  June  03,  2011  simply  advises 
listed  companies  to  follow  SCORES  with  respect 
to complaints received after May 20, 2011 and ATR 
with respect to complaints which might have been 
received by the complainants prior thereto required 
to be submitted to SEBI in a physical form. Therefore, 
the requirement of double reminder and two ATRs 
mentioned in the circular dated November 25, 2009 
had  since  been  superseded  by  the  circular  dated 
June  03,  2011.  Therefore,  the  impugned  order  was 
quashed and set aside, and the appeal was allowed.

The  Port  Shipping  Company  Ltd.  had  not 
obtained  SCORES  authentication  within  the  time 
stipulated  vide  circular  dated  April  17,  2013. 
Therefore,  SEBI  issued  letter  dated  December  02, 

192

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

2013 advising it to submit the requisite information 
regarding SCORES authentication by December 18, 
2013. Since the company failed to do so, a show cause 
notice dated May 27, 2014 was issued to the company 
asking it to show as to why adjudication proceedings 
should not be initiated against it and why penalty 
should not be imposed on it under Section 15HB of 
the SEBI Act, 1992. The appellant obtained SCORES 
authentication on June 03, 2014. 

The tribunal held that as in case of Appeal No. 
 
386	 of	 2014	 (M/s	 Vidarbha	 Industries	 Ltd.	 vs.	 SEBI)	
decided	 on	 December	 01,	 2014  and  Appeal  No.  379 
of	 2014	 (Rakan	 Steels	 Ltd.	 vs.	 SEBI)	 decided	 on	 April	
04,	 2015,  where  a  listed  company  failing  to  obtain 
SCORES  authentication  within  the  time  stipulated 
by  SEBI  amounted  to  disobeying  SEBI’s  directions 
and  in  such  a  case  penalty  was  imposable  under 
Section 15HB of the SEBI Act. Failing to comply with 
SEBI’s directions contained in the circular dated April 
17,  2013  and  thereafter  failing  to  comply  with  the 
directions contained in the letter dated December 02, 
2013 amounted to repeatedly violating the directions 
given by SEBI. The appellant’s argument that there 
was no operating income, no permanent employee, 
no pending investor grievance, no prejudice caused 
to any investor and that the shares of the appellant 
company were not traded for more than six years, 
could  not  be  a  ground  to  disobey  the  directions 
given  by  SEBI.  The  obligation  to  obtain  SCORES 
authentication  was  not  dependent  on  there  being 
operating income or pending investor grievances or 
trading of shares on the stock exchanges. Admittedly, 
the  appellant  company  continued  to  be  a  listed 
company and, therefore, it was obligatory on its part 
to  obtain  SCORES  authentication  within  the  time 
stipulated by SEBI. 

 
However,  the  appellant  consistently  failed 
and  neglected  to  comply  with  SEBI’s  directions 
and  it  was  only  when  SEBI  initiated  penalty 
proceedings that the appellant chose to comply with 
its directions. Therefore, in the facts of the case, the 
appellant  deserved  higher  penalty.  However,  after 
taking  all  the  factors  set  out  by  the  appellant  as 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

mitigating  factors,  the  adjudicating  officer  of  SEBI 
imposed  nominal  penalty  of    `  1.5  lakh  as  against 
the imposable penalty of  `  1 crore. In such a case, 
it  cannot  be  said  that  the  penalty  imposed  was 
excessive or unreasonable.

	Financial	Planning	Supervisory	Foundation	
vs	 SEBI	 and	 Institution	 of	 Mutual	 Fund	
Intermediaries

 
The issue in the case revolved around eligibility 
criteria before the cut-off date set by SEBI to consider 
applications  for  setting  up  of  a  self-regulatory 
organisation (SRO) for distributors of mutual fund 
products. Through a selection process, Institution of 
Mutual Fund Intermediaries (Respondent No. 2) was 
chosen by SEBI as the most appropriate applicant for 
grant of in-principle approval by SEBI. The Financial 
Planning and Supervisory Foundation (Appellant), 
which was one of the applicants, challenged the same. 
On the cut-off date, the Respondent No. 2 possessed 
a license under Section 25(1) of the Companies Act, 
1956 but was yet to be incorporated. The appeal is 
mainly based on the contention of the Appellant that 
the Respondent No. 2 was not eligible for selection 
as it did not have a certificate of incorporation on the 
date of its application for being considered as SRO by 
SEBI and further that, the Appellant was not given 
a hearing before being rejected, as provided under 
Regulation 10 of SEBI (SRO) Regulations. SAT partly 
dismissed  the  appeal  while  observing  that  since 
Respondent No. 2 held license under Section 25(1) of 
the 1956 Act on the date of submitting the application 
under regulation 3 of the SRO Regulations, SEBI was 
justified  in  entertaining  the  application  submitted 
by  Respondent  No.  2.Therefore  SAT  has  accepted 
the  argument  of  SEBI  that  respondent  was  eligible 
to  apply  despite  the  fact  that  respondent  did  not 
possess  a  certificate  of  incorporation  on  the  date 
the  application  was  made.  However,  SAT  did  not 
entertain  SEBI’s  stand  with  respect  to  compliance 
with  Regulation  10  and  directed  that  a  hearing  be 
given  to  the  applicants  before  the  final  order  for 
grant of certificate of registration is made.

 FRAUDULENT  AND  UNFAIR  TRADE 
PRACTICES

 Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	M/s	Mishka	
Finance and Trading Limited

I. 

A. 

a. 

 
SEBI    passed  an  ad-interim  ex-parte  order 
dated    April  17,  2015  restraining  Mishka  Finance 
and Trading Limited,  its six promoters -- Wave Inter 
Trades  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Embassy  Finance  &  Consultants 
Ltd.,  Tohee  Trading  &  Agencies  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Sulabh 
Impex  Ltd.,  Pearl  Arcade  Trading  Private  Limited 
and  Vijay  Kumar  Jain  --  four  directors  (Ankit 
Garodia,  Jugalkishore  Pralhadrai  Sharma,  Amit 
Kumar Vasishtha and Rameshwar Manohar Wagh) 
and 118 other entities  from accessing the securities 
market and prohibited them from buying, selling or 
dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever till 
further directions in the matter of dealing in the scrip 
of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited.

 
SEBI had suo-moto carried out an examination 
pursuant to detection of an exorbitant increase in the 
traded  volume  and  price  of  Mishka’s  shares.  The 
examination, prima-facie, showed that the company 
along with its promoters/directors had issued new 
shares  through  preferential  allotment  to  certain 
entities. Further, the promoters of the company also 
transferred their holdings in physical form to their 
related  entities.  Thereafter,  the  price  of  the  scrip 
was  increased  astronomically  through  a  very  low 
trading volume. One month after the share split, the 
preferential  allottees  and  promoter  related  entities 
started  selling  the  shares  to  entities  connected/
related,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  Mishka,  thereby 
making  huge  profits.  It  appeared  that  the  stock 
market  mechanism  was  used  by  the  company,  its 
promoters and related entities for booking long term 
capital gains (LTCGs) of ` 254 crore approximately 
(realised) and converting their unaccounted income 

into  accounted  income.  These  connected  entities 
were offloading these shares by indulging in trading 
in an artificial, manipulative and unfair manner.

 
Thus,  the  entities  had,  prima-facie,  violated 
Section 12A of the SEBI Act, 1992 and regulations 3 
and 4 of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.

b.	

	Interim	 Order	
in	
Animation Limited

the	 matter	 of	 Pine	

SEBI  passed  an  ad-interim  ex-parte  order 
 
dated May 08, 2015 restraining the Pine Animation 
Group, its promoters and related entities, directors 
along with preferential allottees and exit providers 
(178  entities)  from  accessing  the  securities  market 
and prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing 
in  securities  in  any  manner  whatsoever  till  further 
directions  .  The  order  also  suspended  trading  in 
the securities of Pine Animation Limited till further 
directions.

 
Pursuant  to  detection  of  a  huge  increase  in 
the traded volumes and price of the shares of Pine 
Animation Limited during May 22, 2013 to January 
30,  2015,  SEBI  conducted  a  preliminary  inquiry  in 
the  dealings  of  Pine’s  scrip.  It  was  observed  that 
Pine and its promoters had transferred the shares to 
related entities either directly/indirectly and through 
preferential allotment. This was followed by active 
trading  in  the  scrip,  an  exponential  price  increase 
and stock split in the shares of Pine Animation Ltd. 
Further, once the lock-in period ended, that is, from 
December 17, 2013, the preferential allottees started 
selling  the  shares  to  entities  connected/related, 
directly or indirectly to Pine, thereby making huge 
profits.  In  the  meanwhile  the  promoter  related 
entities, also started selling their shares, after holding 
them for one year.

 
From these facts, it could be safely be assumed 
that  the  entire  modus  operandi  of  allotting  shares 
on  a  preferential  basis,  announcing  a  stock  split 

194

SEBI Annual Report

and  then  bringing  in  connected  entities  to  provide 
exit was a scheme devised to make ill-gotten gains. 
Further, the modus operandi of pumping the share 
price artificially and then dumping the price so that 
the  same  cycle  could  be  repeated,  demonstrated 
malafide 
the 
mechanism  was  presumably  used  to  deceive  the 
authorities by laundering black money and making

Therefore,  the  acts  and  omissions  of  exit 
 
providers,  preferential  allottees  and  promoter 
related entities  were ‘fraudulent’ as defined under 
Regulation 2(1)(c) of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 
2003 and were in contravention of the provisions of 
Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a), (b), (e) and 
(g) thereof and Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI 
Act, 1992.

Bio  Organic  Food  Processing  Limited 
(Esteem),	 HPC	 Bio	 Sciences	 limited	 (HPC)	
and  Channel  Nine  Entertainment  Limited 
(CNE).

 
SEBI passed an interim order dated June 29, 
2015 in the matter of dealing in the shares of these 
four  companies  traded  at  the  BSE  SME  platform 
and  thereby  restrained  the  entities  which  included 
the  companies,  their  promoters  at  the  time  of  the 
IPO allotment, preferential allottees, exit providers, 
etc.,  who  were  prima-facie  found  to  be  involved 
in  suspicious  transactions  in  these  scrips  from 
accessing the securities market and buying, selling 
or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, 
in any manner.

Based  on  alerts  received  from  the  DWBIS 
 
system  with  respect  to  suspected  price/volume 
manipulation, SEBI initiated the examination in the 
scrips of Eco, Esteem, HPC and CNE. It was found 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

that these companies had a very small share capital 
prior to 2011 and they increased their share capital 
through  a  series  of  preferential  allotments  during 
2010-11  and  2012-13  followed  by  issue  of  bonus 
shares. Certain preferential allottees transferred their 
shares in the respective companies to some entities 
(pre-IPO  transferees).    These  companies  came  out 
with an IPO in 2013 in BSE’s SME segment.

Upon  perusal  of  bank  statements  of  top 
 
IPO allottees, a set of nine entities was found to be 
funding the IPO of all the companies either through 
directly transferring amounts in the escrow accounts 
of  the  companies  on  behalf  of  IPO  allottees  or  by 
transferring the amounts to the IPO allottees’ bank 
accounts, who, in turn, applied for shares in the IPO. 
Further,  these  companies  immediately  transferred 
back a substantial portion of the total IPO proceeds 
to nine entities either directly or through layering.

 
Once  the  shares  were  listed  on  the  SME 
platform  of  the  exchange,  it  was  observed  that  
27  entities  connected  to  a  set  of  nine  entities  were 
involved  in  increasing  the  price  of  the  scrips 
astronomically  through  manipulative  trades  just 
before the release of lock-in of pre-IPO shares. These 
27 entities received funds from various sources and 
the  money  received  was  immediately  transferred 
to  their  trading  members  towards  purchase  of 
shares  of  different  scrips  which  provided  an  exit 
to  the  allottees/pre-IPO  transferees.  Further,  it  was 
observed  that  the  collective  LTCGs  booked  by 
allottees and pre-IPO transferees in all the four scrips 
upto December 31, 2014 was ` 614.9 crore.

funding  entities, 

Therefore,  the  acts  and  omissions  of  the 
 
companies, 
trading  entities, 
preferential  allottees  and  pre-IPO  transferees  were 
‘fraudulent’  as  defined  under  regulation  2(1)(c)  of 
the  SEBI  (PFUTP)  Regulations,  2003  and  were  in 
contravention of the provisions of Regulations 3(a), 
(b), (c) and (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) 
thereof and of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI

SEBI vide an ad-interim ex-parte order dated 
June  29,  2015  in  the  matter  of  Eco  Friendly  Food 
Processing Parks Limited, Esteem Bio Organic Food 
Processing  Limited,  Channel  Nine  Entertainment 
Limited and HPC Bio Sciences Limited had issued 
directions against 238 entities. In the order, all those 
entities who had made a profit of rupees one crore or 
more in a scrip of Eco, Esteem, CNE and HPC were 
shortlisted.  Accordingly,  a  set  of  186  such  entities 
(shortlisted Group) were identified.

 
After  the  order,  it  was  observed  that  due  to 
the wrong PANs provided by the respective registrar 
and transfer agents of CNE and HPC, seven entities 
in  CNE  and  nine  entities  in  HPC  were  left  out  in 
the interim order, though they met the short listing 
criteria laid down in the order. However, the names 
of these entities were reflected in an annexure to the 
order.

 
Hence,  on  January  04,  2016,  a  corrigendum 
to the order dated June 29, 2015 was issued against 
those 16 entities.

	Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	Illiquid	Stock	
Options

 
SEBI  passed  an  ad-interim  ex-parte  order 
dated August  20,  2015  restraining  59  entities  from 
accessing the Indian securities market on the basis 
of  their  suspicious  trading  in  stock  options  in  the 
equity derivatives segment.

 
Based  on  a  surveillance  alert  generated 
by  SEBI’s  key  surveillance  system  DWBIS  it  was 
gathered  that  a  set  of  entities  repeatedly  and 
consistently  made  only  trading  losses  and  another 
set of entities repeatedly and consistently made only 
trading  profits  by  their  trades  in  the  stock  options 
segment.

 
Further  scrutiny  revealed  that  the  entities 
making  losses  were  able  to  do  so  by  selling  stock 
options to a set of entities at a price much lower than 
their intrinsic value and subsequently reversing the 
trade at a much higher price within a short span of 
time.

 
The examination, prima-facie, showed that the 
execution  of  reversal  trades  at  arbitrary/irrational 
prices  by  the  loss-making  and  the  profit–making 
entities was non-genuine and defied basic economic 
sense  with  the  possible  intent  of  tax  evasion  or 
portraying  an  artificial  increase  in  net  worth  of  a 
private company/individual.

SEBI  passed  an  ad-interim  ex-parte  order 
 
dated  February  17,  2016  restraining  22  trading 
members  (TMs)  from  buying,  selling  or  dealing  in 
the  securities  market,  either  directly  or  indirectly, 
in  any  manner.  This  action  was  further  to  the  ad-
interim ex-parte directions issued by SEBI on August 
20,  2015  restraining  59  entities  from  dealing  in  the 
securities market because of their suspicious trades 
in the stock options segment. In the current matter, 
it  was  observed  that  a  significant  proportion  of 
the turnover by the TMs was attributed to reversal 
transactions  in  the  stock  options  segment  and  a 
majority of their clients had executed such trades. It 
was further observed that:

for  one  set  of  clients  and  consistent 
trading losses (in terms of net amount) 
for another set of clients.
 A  majority  of  the  TMs  reversed  a 
significant  proportion  of  the  turnover 
within minutes of entering the first leg 
of the reversal transaction.
 A  majority  of  the  TMs  reversed  a 
significant  proportion  of  the  trades 
within  minutes  of  entering  the  first 
leg of the reversal transaction. Further, 
since  these  very  trades  resulted  in 
significant profits for one set of entities 
and significant lossesfor another, it was 
inferred  that  the  two  legs  of  the  trade 
happened  at  substantially  different 
prices.
 In a majority of the instances, the client 
and  the  counter-party  orders  forming 
a  part  of  reversal  trades  were  entered 
within few seconds of each other.
 Outside  of  such  trades,  there  was  not 
much activity by these TMs in the stock 
options segment implying that the TMs 
prima-facie carried out the business of 
registered stock brokers in this segment 
mainly to facilitate such trades, that is 
,dummy  book  entries/artificial  profit-
loss generation for various entities.
 The trading members through reversal 
trades for their clients, generated a loss 
to the tune of ` 1,272.8 crore and a profit 
to the tune of ` 1,303.1 crore.
 A  prima-facie  examination  revealed 
that the exchange platform was abused 
to generate such artificial profit/loss by 
executing reversal trades to the tune of  
` 8,100 crore.
 The  order  examined  the  activities  of 
stock brokers spanning from April 2014 
to September 2015.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

 
While  the  TMs  are  restrained  from  buying,

 Interim  Order  In  Respect  Of  Mr  B.  P. 
Jhunjhunwala	In	the	Matter	of	First	Financial	
Services Ltd.

 
SEBI, vide an ad-interim ex-parte order dated 
December  19,  2014  (interim  order),  restrained  151 
entities, including First Financial and its promoters 
and  directors  from  accessing  the  securities  market 
and further prohibited them from buying, selling or 
dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, till 
further directions.

from 

 
Further  enquiry  revealed  that  Mr  B.  P. 
Jhunjhunwala  who  had  acquired 
shares  of 
First  Financial 
the  erstwhile  promoters 
constituting 58.08 per cent of shareholding including 
management  control  of  the  company,  plotted  the 
scheme  of  preferential  allotment  along  with  the 
directors of First Financial at a relevant time with the 
end  objective  to  enable  the  preferential  allottees  to 
avail LTCG benefits.

 
Mr  B.P.  Jhunjhunwala  was  also,  prima-facie, 
found to be playing a major role in manipulating the 
price of the scrip during the relevant period. He and 
his  family  members  who  had  substantial  tradable 
shares (2,17,665 shares- representing 58.08 per cent 
of tradable shares) in First Financial chose to sell 620 
shares, released through 89 orders/instances (that is, 
72  per  cent  of  the  124  sale  orders  executed  during 
that  period)  with  each  sale  order  ranging  05-25 
shares leading to an abnormal increase in the price 
of the scrip that resulted in a hugely profitable exit 
for  preferential  allottees  while  misusing  the  stock 
exchange system.

 
Based  on  these  facts  and  circumstances,  
the  acts  and  deeds  of  Mr  B.  P.  Jhunjhunwala  were 

SEBI Annual Report

‘fraudulent’  as  defined  under  Regulation  2(1)(c) 
of  the  SEBI    (PFUTP)  Regulations,  2003  and  were 
in  contravention  of  the  provisions  of  Regulations 
3(a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a), (b), (e) and (g) 
thereof and of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI 
Act, 1992.

 
Thus  in  view  of  these  findings,  Mr  B.  P. 
Jhunjhunwala  was  restrained  from  accessing  the 
securities market and buying, selling or dealing in 
securities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner, 
till further directions.

	Interim	order	in	the	matter	of	Radford	Global	
Ltd.

 
SEBI  vide  ad-interim  ex-parte  order  dated 
December  19,  2014,  restrained  108  entities  in  the 
matter of Radford Global Ltd. from buying, selling 
or dealing in securities and accessing the securities 
market, either directly or in indirectly, in any manner 
whatsoever, till further directions.

 
On further analysis of the order-log and trade-
log,  it  was  observed  that  prima-facie  the  selling 
behaviour/pattern  of  certain  sellers  appeared  to  be 
suspicious. The price of the scrip was influenced by 
these  sellers  while  trading  in  the  Radford  scrip  by 
selling either a miniscule number of shares per day 
with very less quantity vis-à-vis their shareholding 
or by controlling the trade volume of the scrip. These 
sellers played a crucial role in increasing the price of 
the scrip. Further, from the facts and circumstances, 
it  prima-facie  appeared  that  the  share  certificates 
held by the sellers were not genuine.

 
Hence, prima-facie, the acts of the sellers were 
‘fraudulent’ under SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. 
Therefore, SEBI passed an ad-interim ex-parte order 
dated November 09, 2015 restraining 15 entities from 
accessing the securities market and buying, selling 
or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, 
in any manner, till further directions in the matter of 
dealing in the scrip of M/s Radford Global Ltd.

	Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	Kailash	Auto	
Finance Limited

 
SEBI,  passed  an  ad-interim  ex-parte  order 
dated  March  29,  2016  in  the  matter  of  Kailash 
Auto  Finance  Ltd.  (Kailash  Auto)  and  restrained 
246  entities  from  accessing  the  securities  market 
and buying, selling or dealing in securities,  either 
directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, till 
further directions.

 
In the matter of Kailash Auto Finance Limited 
it was observed that the scheme of reduction of share 
capital  and  amalgamation  were  the  mechanisms 
adopted  by  the  company  to  dubiously  increase  its 
value of market capital significantly. Careful Projects 
Advisory  Ltd.  (CPAL)  and  Panchshul  Marketing 
Ltd. (PML), promoters of Kailash Auto prior to the 
amalgamation,  were  incorporated  with  a  dubious 
plan  and  premeditated  arrangement  and  artifice 
to  increase  the  number  of  equity  shares  therein 
through  sham  and  non-genuine  transactions  with 
regard  to  issuance  of  their  shares  which  resulted 
in fetching exorbitant and unrealistic consideration 
in  the  scheme  of  amalgamation.  Pursuant  to  the 
amalgamation  2,058  shareholders  of  PML  and 
1,972 shareholders of CPAL (beneficiaries) received 
58,59,10,800  shares  of  Kailash Auto  in  the  form  of 
consideration.

Trading  in  the  scrip  of  Kailash  Auto  was 
 
manipulated  by  the  connected  parties  who  traded 
under a premeditated plan and rigged the price of the 
scrip by 230 per cent in 36 trading days. Further, the 
average trading volume in the scrip was increased 
5,577 times. It was noted that during this period, the 
beneficiaries were net sellers and connected/related 
entities  were  net  buyers,  providing  exit  to  these 
beneficiaries. In the process, beneficiaries made huge 
profits of approximately 3,400 per cent  amounting to 
approximately ` 1,600 crore on their investments in 
a period of 12 months or more and thereon claimed 
the exemption of long term capital gains (LTCGs) on 
such profits.

Apart from market manipulation and grossly 
misusing the stock exchange system in the scrip of 
Kailash Auto, the entire plan, device and artifice of 
private  placement,  fabrication  of  share  premium, 
issuance of bonus shares, subsequent transfers and 
re-transfers of shares and funds to connected/related 
entities  were  designed  and  structured  to  beguile 
the  same  as  transactions  with  commercial  sense  to 
generate bogus LTCGs which are exempt from tax 
under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

	Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	Castor	Seed	
Contracts

 
SEBI initiated a detailed examination of Castor 
Seed  Contracts  at  NCDEX  and  observed  that  the 
prices of Castor Seed in the February 2016 contract 
at NCDEX fell by around 20 per cent during January 
01,  2016  to  January  27,  2016  as  against  around  a  
14  per  cent  fall  in  spot  prices  (polled  by  NCDEX) 
during the same period. It was observed that futures 
prices  of  Castor  Seed  Contracts  touched  a  lower 
circuit  of  4  per  cent  on  January  25,  2016  and  a  hit 
lower circuit of 6 per cent on January 27, 2016.

 
During examination, it was noticed that a few 
clients had taken huge long positions beyond their 
abilities to fulfil their commitment; there was huge 
concentration and lack of liquidity; there was failure 
on the part of the clients as well as trading members 
to  assess  and  anticipate  the  risks;  and  defaulting 
clients  had  taken  exposure  beyond  their  financial 
means causing systemic risks.

Therefore, in order to protect the interests of 
 
investors and the integrity of the securities market, 
SEBI passed an ad-interim ex-parte order on March 
02,  2016  restraining  16  entities  (including  four 
trading members) from buying, selling or dealing in 
the securities market, either directly or indirectly, in 
any manner whatsoever, till further directions.

Services	Ltd.	(IFSL)

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

2010 to February 23, 2011), certain company related 
entities had bought shares before the circulation of 
SMSes in the market regarding dividend declaration 
by the company. They subsequently sold the shares 
in  the  market  after  the  circulation  of  the  SMSes. 
These entities entered into manipulative and unfair 
trading practices such as heavy synchronised trades 
among themselves, self-trades and reversal of trades 
which resulted in the creation of artificial volumes 
in  the  IFSL  scrip.  These  trades  executed  by  these 
individuals  for  undue  gains  through  avoidance 
of  loss  (when  the  price  of  the  scrip  was  actually 
falling) were manipulative in nature in violation of 
relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations. Thus, 
SEBI passed an order, dated October 20, 2015 under 
Sections 11(1), 11(4)(d) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, 
to impound alleged unlawful gains of a sum of `5.87 
crore, jointly and severally from three entities.

l.	

	Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	Polytex	India	
Ltd.	(PIL)

 
The  debarred  Parikh-Pabari  Group  had 
funded  money  to  certain  entities  which  was 
subsequently used for trading. These entities entered 
into manipulative and unfair trading practices such 
as heavy trading among themselves through which 
they  created  an  artificial  volume  in  the  market. 
Further, these entities repetitively placed orders at a 
price higher than the last traded price and thereby 
contributed to an increase in PIL’s share prices which 
was  manipulative  in  nature  and  in  violation  of 
relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations.

These entities made alleged illegal profits of ` 4.18 
crore  in  aggregate  through  trading  in  the  scrip.   
SEBI passed an order dated August 20, 2015 under 
Sections 11(1), 11(4)(d) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 
to  impound  unlawful  gains  of  `  4.18  crore  jointly 
and severally from 16 entities.

of	 trades	 by	 Mr	 Manish	 Chaturvedi	 and	
others and Sharekhan Limited and its dealers

 

During the investigation period (December 01, 

 

SEBI carried out an examination of suspected

front-running  by  certain  entities.  It  was  observed 
that  one  Mr  Manish  Chaturvedi,  an  employee  of 
the  Sterling  Group  was  responsible  inter-alia  for 
carrying  out  technical  and  fundamental  research 
for  investments  by  the  Sterling  Group  and  also 
communicating  the  orders  to  Sterling  Group’s 
brokers.

 
The investigation collated evidence including 
audio recordings for orders placed in the accounts 
of  Sterling  Group,  Manish’s  itemised  mobile  bills, 
itemised  mobile  bills  of  the  dealer  of  Sharekhan 
Limited (broker through whom Manish carried out 
front-running)  and  certain  e-mail  correspondence. 
A combined analysis of the available evidence along 
with the trading patterns of certain entities showed 
that  seven  entities  were  front-running  Sterling 
Group’s trades.

 
Further,  investigations  also  revealed  that 
Sharekhan  Limited  and  its  dealers  were  front-
running  the  trades  of  the  seven  entities  who 
were  front-running  the  trades  of  Sterling  Group 
predominantly through Sharekhan Limited.

 
Considering that the seven entities were front-
running  Sterling  Group  and  these  seven  entities 
were in-turn front-run by Sharekhan and its dealers, 
as an interim measure, an ad-interim ex-parte order 
for impounding under Section 11(4) (d) of the SEBI 
Act,  1992  was  passed  on  July  31,  2015  against  the 
concerned  entities  for  impounding  the  amount  of 
alleged  unfair  profit  made  (along  with  interest) 
aggregating ` 14.70 crore.

INSIDER TRADING

	Interim	 Order	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 trading	 by	
suspected	 entities	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 M/s	
Gammon	Infrastructure	Projects	Ltd.

SEBI 

conducted  an 

investigation 

 
into 
possible  insider  trading  in  the  scrip  of  Gammon 
Infrastructure  Projects  Limited  (GIPL)  prior  to  the 
company’s  announcement  regarding  ‘Termination 
of 
Simplex 

Shareholders  Agreement  with 

Shareholders  Agreement  with 

Infrastructures  Limited’  to  the  stock  exchange. 
Investigations  observed  that  Mr  Abhijit  Rajan, 
then  chairman  and  managing  director  (GIPL)  had 
traded in GIPL shares on NSE and BSE during the 
period when information pertaining to termination 
of 
Simplex 
Infrastructures Ltd. was unpublished (UPSI period). 
The  Consolidated  Infrastructure  Company  Private 
Limited  (CICPL)  was  another  entity  which  had 
traded in the scrip of GIPL on NSE and BSE during 
the UPSI period. Investigations showed that CICPL 
had purchased properties from Mr Abhijit Rajan and 
had sparsely traded in the GIPL scrip and a majority 
of the shares sold by it were during the UPSI period. 
By indulging in ‘insider trading’ and selling shares 
while  in  possession  of  UPSI,  Mr Abhijit  Rajan  and 
CICPL  had  averted  losses  amounting  to  `  1.10 
crore. With the initiation of investigation and quasi-
judicial  proceedings,  it  is  possible  that  Mr  Abhijit 
Rajan, CICPL and its directors Mr Kiran Hingorani 
and  Mr  Indru  Hingorani  may  divert  the  unlawful 
gains  (subject  to  the  adjudication  of  the  allegation 
on the merits in the final order), which may result 
in  defeating  the  effective  implementation  of  the 
direction of disgorgement, if any, to be passed after 
adjudication on merit.

 
Therefore,  SEBI  took  steps  to  impound  and 
retain the proceeds (unlawful gains) allegedly made 
by  the  entities  by  way  of  an  interim  measure.  The 
amount of gain as mentioned earlier is ` 1.10 crore 
and the simple interest at the rate of 12 per cent per 
annum  from August  23,  2013  to  March  21,  2016  is  
` 34 lakh. Therefore, through an ad-interim ex-parte 
order dated March 21, 2016, an amount aggregating 
` 1.44 crore was impounded.

SEBI  conducted  an  investigation  into  the 
matter  of  front-running  by  certain  entities  during 
June 2000 to June 2010.

SEBI Annual Report

2015-2016

HDFC  AMC  manages 

 
the  assets  of 
HDFC  Mutual  Fund  and  also  provides  portfolio 
management  services  to 
its  clients.  The  fund 
managers  and  portfolio  managers  of  HDFC  AMC 
executed  the  trades  through  its  dealer  Nilesh 
Kapadia who had the discretion to execute the orders 
at any time during the day, depending on the traded 
volumes/prices  etc.  Nilesh  was  its  equities  dealer 
from June 2000 till 2010.

 
Investigation  revealed  that  Nilesh  passed 
on  information  of  impending  orders  (exchange, 
scrip  name,  order  price  and  order  quantity)  and 
instructions to his wife Kalpana Kapadia and Rajiv 
Sanghvi before placing the orders for HDFC AMC. 
On the basis of this information and instructions from 
Nilesh, Rajiv Sanghvi indulged in front-running the 
trades of HDFC AMC and traded in the accounts of 
Rajiv Sanghvi, Rajiv Sanghvi-HUF, Sanjay Sanghvi, 
Sonal  Sanghvi  and  Dipti  Mehta  (Sanghvi  Group). 
Besides,  similar 
front-running  activities  were 
observed in the trading account of Kalpana Kapadia.

 
Because  of  such  a  trading  pattern,  Rajiv 
Sanghvi, Rajiv Sanghvi-HUF, Sanjay Sanghvi, Sonal 
Sanghvi and Dipti Mehta made a substantial profit 
of  `  1.05  crore  and  Kalpana  Kapadia  also  made  a 
substantial profit of ` 1.52 crore. This profit would 
not have resulted if Nilesh Kapadia had not passed 
information  about  the  HDFC’s  impending  large 
orders and instructing them accordingly.

The  conduct  of 

these  persons  was 

 
in 
contravention of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the 
SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3 and 4(1) of 
the  SEBI  (PFUTP)  Regulations,  2003.  Accordingly, 
as an interim measure, an ad-interim ex-parte order 
under Sections 11(1), 11(4)(d) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 
1992 was passed on January 15, 2016 to impound the 
alleged unlawful gains of a sum of ` 2.17 crore  (gain 
of ` 1.05 crore + simple interest at 12 per cent p.a. of 
`  1.12  crore)  jointly  and  severally  from  Nilesh 
Kapadia  and  the  entities  of  Sanghvi  Group  and  
the unlawful gains of a sum of `1.18 crore (gain of

`  47.24  lakh  +  simple  interest  at  12  per  cent  per

	Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	insider	trading	
by	suspected	entities	in	the	scrip	of	Bank	of	
Rajasthan	Limited	(now	merged	with	ICICI	
Bank Limited)

 
Investigations  were  carried  out  into  possible 
insider  trading  in  the  scrip  of  Bank  of  Rajasthan 
Limited  (BoR)  prior  to  the  announcement  of  an 
agreement  executed  on  May  18,  2010  between  the 
dominant  shareholders  of  BoR  with  ICICI  Bank 
Limited (ICICI) for agreeing to merge the two banks. 
The  price  of  the  BoR  scrip  increased  substantially 
prior to the announcement of the agreement.

 
One  Mr  Rohit  Premkumar  Gupta  purchased 
shares  of  BoR  prior  to  dissemination  of  the  price 
sensitive  information  to  the  public.    Investigations 
revealed that Rohit is a brother of Ms Jyotika Sanjay 
Tayal  (wife  of  Mr  Sanjay  Kumar  Tayal)  and  that  
Mr Sanjay Kumar Tayal was one of the signatories 
to  the  agreement  on  behalf  of  the  dominant 
shareholders  of  BoR.  Further,  it  was  observed  that 
the purchase of BoR shares by Rohit was funded by 
M/s Advik Textiles and Realpro Pvt. Ltd. a company 
whose affairs were managed by Navin Kumar Tayal, 
Jyotika Tayal and Sanjay Kumar Tayal (on the basis of 
directorship, shareholding and subsequent changes 
thereto).

 
Rohit who carried out the insider trading was 
facilitated  by  Mr  Sanjay  Tayal,  Ms  Jyotika  Sanjay 
Tayal,  Mr  Navin  Tayal, Advik  and  the  directors  of 
Advik (Kulwinder and Azam). Therefore, the acts of 
the seven entities were in furtherance of the common 
intention  of  indulging  in  the  scheme  of  insider 
trading in contravention of the provisions of Section 
12A (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and 
Regulations 3 and 4 of the PIT Regulations.

 
Considering this,  as an interim measure, an 
ad-interim ex-parte order under Section 11(4)(d) of 
the SEBI Act, 1992 was passed on January 04, 2016

	Interim	Order	in	the	matter	of	trading	in	the	
shares of Palred Technologies Ltd.

 
SEBI on receipt of a report from NSE conducted 
an investigation into the scrip of Palred Technologies 
Limited  (PTL)  for  the  period  of  September  18, 
2012  to  November  30,  2013,  to  ascertain  possible 
violations of the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and 
the SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. The investigation 
alleged that Mr Palem Srikanth Reddy, who is also 
the Chairman and Managing Director of PTL, Ms P. 
Soujanya Reddy, Mr Ameen Khwaja, Ms Noorjahan 
Khwaja,  Mr  Ashik  Ali  Khwaja,  Ms  Rozina  Hirani

Aziz, Mr Karnaramanjula Reddy, Mr Umashankar S, 
Ms  Raja  Lakshmi  Srivaiguntam,  Mr  Prakash  Lohia 
and Mr Mohan Krishna Reddy Aryabumi had traded 
in  the  PTL  scrip  during  the  investigation  period, 
while  in  possession  of  ‘price  sensitive  information’ 
(PSI).  The  following  announcements  made  by  PTL 
were considered as PSI:
	

•	

	On  August  10,  2013  -  Slump  sale  of 
software  solutions  business  to  the 
Kewill Group.
	On  October  14,  2013  -  Declaration  of 
interim dividend of ` 29 per share and 
reducing  50  per  cent  of  the  capital  by 
paying a value of ` 29 per share.

	

•	

 
Based  on  the  trading  details,  SEBI  observed 
that the persons/entities mentioned earlier had made 
unlawful gains to the tune of  `  1.66 crore through 
trading in the PTL scrip.  Accordingly, as an interim 
measure, under Section 11(4)(d) of the SEBI Act, 1992 
SEBI ordered the impounding of  the alleged unlawful 
gains of a sum of ` 2.22 crore (alleged gain of ` 1.65 
crore + interest of `  56.55 lakh from the individual 
date of buy transaction to January 31, 2016), jointly 
and  severally  from  the  persons  mentioned  earlier. 

If the funds are found to be insufficient to meet the 
figure of unlawful gains, as directed earlier, then the 
securities lying in the demat account of these persons 
will be frozen to the extent of the remaining value.

shares of Jagran Prakashan Limited

 
SEBI  conducted  an  investigation  into  the 
matter of trading activities of certain entities in the 
scrip  of  Jagran  Prakashan  Limited  for  the  period 
August 01, 2009 to October 31, 2009. The investigation 
alleged  that  Mr  Amit  Jaiswal  (company  secretary/
compliance  officer  of  Jagran)  and  his  wife  Mansi 
traded in the Jagranscrip on NSE while in possession 
of  price  sensitive  information  (PSI)  and  allegedly

ADJUDICATION ORDERS

 FRAUDULENT  AND  UNFAIR  TRADE 
PRACTICES

	Adjudication	 Order	 against	 M/s	 Todi	
Securities	Pvt.	Ltd.	(in	the	matter	of	United	
Stock	Exchange	of	India	Ltd.)

Adjudication  proceedings  were 

initiated 
 
against Todi Securities Pvt. Ltd.  for executing large 
self-trades  (trades where the seller and the buyer in 
a trade/contract remain the same person and in such 
types of transactions, no actual beneficial ownership 
of  security  is  changed)  in  its  proprietary  account 
contributing around 58 per cent to its total turnover 
during April 2011 to October 2011 with an intention 
to artificially raise the volume in USD-INR contracts 
and to create a misleading appearance of trading in 
the  currency  derivatives  segment  at  United  Stock 
Exchange of India Ltd. (USE).

 
Todi  Securities  Pvt.  Ltd.  being  a  registered 
stock  broker  besides  indulging  in  manipulative 
trades,  also  failed  to  exercise  due  skill,  care  and 
diligence in the conduct of its business as mandated 
under  the  Code  of  Conduct  under  Stock  Brokers 
Regulations. Therefore, a penalty of rupees one crore 
under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act and `  10 lakh 
under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act (a total penalty 
of rupees one crore and ten lakh) was imposed on it 
for violation of Regulations 3, 4 (1) & 4 (2) (a) of the 
SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 and Clause A(2), (3) 
& (4) of the Code of Conduct under Schedule II  of 
the SEBI (SBSB) Regulations, 1992.

 
It  was  the  first  time  when  an  adjudication 
action  for  contract  of  self-trades  in  the  currency 
derivatives segment was initiated and resulted in a 
monetary  penalty  which  remains  as  sustained  till 
date.

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

b.	

	Adjudication	 Order	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 R	 M	
Shares Trading Private Limited

 
SEBI  examined  the  trading  activities  in  the 
scrip of Onelife Capital Advisors Limited. Pursuant 
to  the  IPO  it  was  observed  the  noticee  allegedly 
indulged in self-trades in the scrip for a total quantity 
of  1,65,278  shares  on  BSE  (89,901  shares)  and  NSE 
(75,377  shares).  Thus  the  noticee  had    violated  the 
provisions  of  Regulations  3(a),(b),(c),(d),  4(1),  4(2) 
(a),(b) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations.

 
The  main  allegation  against  the  noticee  was 
that he had indulged in self-trades on BSE and NSE in 
the scrip of the company. Self-trades are trades where 
there is no transfer of actual beneficial ownership of 
shares and because the buyer and the seller are the 
same person. However, the noticee contended that 
the self-trades done on October 17, 18 and 19, 2011 
were  through  the  mechanism  of  the  Algo  Trading 
Software Platform approved by the stock exchanges 
where there is no human or manual control to avoid 
such trades. It was found that in terms of Regulations 
3 and 4 of the PFUTP Regulations there is no such 
exemptions such as online trading or Algo Trading 
Software wherein there is no human/manual control 
to avoid such trade once the buy order/sell order are 
entered in the system.

 
The  adjudicating  officer  passed  an  order 
dated  December  30,2015  imposing  a  penalty  of 
rupees five  lakh under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 
1992 for violation of Regulations 3(a),(b),(c),(d), 4(1), 
4(2) (a),(b) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations under 
Section 15 HA of SEBI Act, 1992.

	Adjudication	 Order	 against	 Bala	 Reddy	
Gopu	 and	 13	 others	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 ICSA	
(India)	Ltd.

 
SEBI  observed  that  certain  entities  had 
purchased shares of ICSA (India) Ltd (ICSAI) just a 
few days prior to the corporate announcement made 
by  the  company  stating  that  it  had  secured  work 
orders to the tune of ` 464.17 crore. It was found that 
Bala  Reddy  Gopu,  Promoter  as  well  as  Chairman

and Managing Director of ICSAI had funded these 
purchases through his companies. It was also found 
that Bala Reddy Gopu and his wife were recipients 
of the funds arising out of the sale of the shares. Bala 
Reddy was found to be an Insider, and in possession 
of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  at  the 
time of funding purchase of shares of ICSAI. Hence, 
Bala Reddy, his wife, the companies through which 
he had funded the purchase, the persons who bought 
the shares of ICSAI / acted as conduits were held to 
be in violation of Regulation 3 and/or 3A and 4 of 
the  PIT  Regulations,  1992  and  /or  Regulations  3(c) 
and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations. A penalty of ` 40 
crore was imposed under Section 15G and 15HA of 
the SEBI Act, 1992, to be paid jointly and severally by 
them.

 
Further,  Bala  Reddy,  along  with  certain 
other  entities  submitted  misleading  information 
to  SEBI  regarding  their  relationship  with  certain 
entities and for the same a penalty of ` 20 lakh was 
imposed on each, under Section 15A (a) of the SEBI 
Act.  Shri  G.  Bala  Reddy  and  his  wife  G  Velangini 
Mary also violated Regulation 8A(1) and (2) of the 
Takeover  Regulations,  1997,  which  attracts  penalty 
under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act. For the same, a 
penalty of ` 26 lakh on Bala Reddy and ` 12 lakh on 
G Velangini Mary was imposed.

 
Certain entities, who were only alleged to be 
recipients of funds arising out of sale of the shares 
and thus beneficiaries of insider trading, submitted 
that  they  had  taken  a  loan  from  G  Bala  Reddy  as 
they  required  financial  assistance,  and  were  not 
beneficiaries  of  any  insider  trading.  In  the  absence 
of evidence on record to contradict this submission, 
the charge of violation of Regulations 3(c) and (d) of 
the PFUTP Regulations read with Section 12A(b) and 
(c) of the SEBI Act was held to not stand established 
against them.

INSIDER TRADING

	Adjudication	 Order	 against	 M/s	 Presha	
Metallurgical	Ltd.	&	Others

Adjudication  proceedings  were 

 
initiated 
against  Presha  Metallurgical  Ltd.  (PML/company) 
for  non-disclosure  under  Regulation  13  (6)  of  the 
SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992 and against preferential 
allottees  Pankhuri  Technowave  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Compass 
Technologies  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Parixit  Gas  Company  Ltd. 
(Pratik  Gas  Company  Pvt.  Ltd),  Ashok  Propon 
Pvt.  Ltd,  Darshit  Hydro  Power  Projects  Pvt.  Ltd., 
Shankeshwar  Metals  Pvt.  Ltd.    and  Hiralal  P  Shah 
HUF,  for  non-disclosures  under  Regulation  29  (1) 
read  with  Regulation  29  (3)  of  the  SEBI  (SAST) 
Regulations,  2011  due  to  change/increase  in  the 
shareholding of preferential allottees in the shares of 
the PML consequent to allotment of shares on May 
04, 2012.

 
During  the  course  of  examination  under 
adjudication,  it  was  established  that  a  photocopy 
of disclosures made to BSE and the so-called seal of 
the  BSE  thereon  as  relied  on  Presha  Metallurgical 
Ltd. and the preferential allottees was not genuine, 
but  it  appeared  to  have  been  generated  by  them 
afterwards just to cover up their delayed disclosures 
as  explained/evidenced  by  the  BSE  during  the 
adjudication  proceedings.  It  was  established  that 
there  was  delay  of  around  two  and  a  half  years 
in  making  the  required  disclosures  to  BSE  as  the 
disclosures  were  actually  received  by  BSE  only  on 
December  01,  2014  which  were  required  to  have 
been made till May 08, 2012.

 
Therefore,  keeping  in  view  the  facts  and 
circumstance  of  the  case  and  the  judgment  of  the 
Supreme Court of India in case of SEBI through its 
Chairman  vs.  Roofit  Industries  Ltd  &  others  (Civil 
Appeal No. 1366 – 1379 of 2005 decided on November 
26, 2015), a penalty of rupees one crore on each of the 
noticees (a total penalty of rupees eight crore) was 
imposed under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act.

 
It was indicated in the order that since PML 
had deliberately failed to comply with the directions 
of  the  quasi-judicial  authority  in  providing  details 
of contact of its promoters/in submitting the service

to  its  promoters,  SEBI  may  initiate  suitable  action, 
if any, against PML for non-compliance during the 
quasi-judicial proceeding.

 
Also, it was indicated in the adjudication order 
that SEBI may initiate action, if any, for establishing 
the  fact  that  all  the  noticees  (Presha  Metallurgical 
Ltd.  and  preferential  allottees)  had  afterwards 
generated the letters dated May 05, 2012 and falsely 
used a forged BSE seal dated May 08, 2012 on these 
letters to cover up their delayed disclosures.

b.	

	Adjudication	 Order	 against	 Pawan	 Kumar	
Sharma	in	the	matter	of	Nivyah	Infrastructure	
Ltd.

It was observed that Mr Pawan Kumar Sharma 
 
(noticee),  who  is  one  of  the  promoters  of  Nivyah 
Infrastructure  Ltd.  (target  company),  had  failed  to 
make timely disclosures pertaining to his acquisition 
and  sale  of  shares  in  the  target  company  in  2012.
The  noticee  had  acquired  and  sold  shares  during 
2012,  which  resulted  in  a  change  in  the  noticee’s 
shareholding or voting rights exceeding rupees five 
lakh in value and 25,000 shares in terms of quantity 
of shares traded. The noticee was required to make 
the necessary disclosures with regard to the change 
in his shareholding to the target company and also 
to the stock exchanges in terms of the provisions of 
Regulations 13 (4A) and 13 (5) of the PIT Regulations, 
1992  and  Regulation  29  (1)  read  with  29  (3)  of  the 
SAST Regulations, 2011. However, the notice failed 
to  comply  with  the  relevant  provisions  under  the 
SAST Regulations, 2011 and PIT Regulations, 1992.  
Consequently,  a  penalty  of  rupees  three  lakh  was 
imposed  on  Mr  Pawan  Kumar  Agarwal  for  the 
violations vide AO order dated October 30, 2015.

c.	

	Adjudication	 Order	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 Shree

5.31 per cent and Swaran Financial Private Limited 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

from 3.94 per cent to 6.13 per cent-- and a decrease in 
the shareholding of York Financial Services Private 
Limited from 6.40 per cent to 2.19 per cent in the scrip 
of  Shree  Om  Trades  Ltd.  (target  company)  during 
the  period  January  2013  to  March  2013.  The  three 
entities were required to make necessary disclosures 
under  the  relevant  provisions  of  PIT  Regulations, 
1992 and SAST Regulations, 2011. However, it was 
observed  that  Anushikha,  Swaran  and  York  failed 
to  make  disclosures  as  required  and  therefore 
Anushikha  and  Swaran  violated  Regulation  29(1) 
read with Regulation 29(3) of the SAST Regulations, 
2011 and Regulation 13(1) of the PIT Regulations and 
York  violated  provisions  of  Regulation  29(2)  read 
with Regulation 29(3) of the SAST Regulations and 
Regulation  13(3)  read  with  Regulation  13(5)  of  the 
PIT Regulations.

 
Consequently, a total penalty of   `  6.50 lakh 
was  imposed  on  Anushikha  Investments  Private 
Limited, Swaran Financial Private Limited and York 
Financial Services Private Limited for violations vide 
AO order dated December 28, 2015.

	Adjudication	 Order	
M/s Mangal Keshav Capital Limited

in	

the	 matter	 of	 

Mangal  Keshav  Capital  Limited  (noticee) 
 
received 6,91,848 shares of Arms Paper Limited(APL) 
(representing  12.54  per  cent  of  the  total  paid-up 
capital  of  APL)  from  Devkant  Synthetics  (India) 
Private  Limited  on August  19,  2011.  On  December 
28, 2013, the noticee disposed of the entire 6,91,848 
shares  of  APL  back  to  Devkant.  Since  the  noticee 
was  holding  12.54  per  cent  of  the  total  paid-up 
capital  of APL  and  the  disposal  of  these  shares  on 
December 28, 2013 was in excess of 2 per cent of the 
total paid-up share capital of APL, the noticee was 
required to make necessary disclosures to the stock 
exchange and to the company under the provisions 
of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of 
the SAST Regulations, 2011, which the noticee failed 
to do. Further, since the noticee was holding more 
than 5 per cent shares of the company, disclosures 
were  required  to  be  made  by  him  to  the  company

again he failed to do.

 
The  adjudicating  officer  impose  a  penalty  of 
rupees five lakh on Mangal Keshav Capital Limited 
under the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with

	Adjudication	 Order	 against	 Mr	 A	 R	
Sankarnarayan	
the	 matter	 of	 M/s	
Manappuram	Finance	Limited

in	

Adjudication  proceedings  was 

 
initiated 
against Mr A R Sankarnarayan who was a Director 
on the Board of Mannapuram Finance Limited (MFL) 
for his failure to obtain pre-clearance of trades from 
MFL for the trades executed by his wife in the share 
of MFL as required under the provisions of Clause 
3.3-1 of the Code of Conduct specified under Part A 
of Schedule I read with Regulation 12(1) of the PIT 
Regulations, 1992.

 
The  AO  observed  that  the  purpose  of  the 
Model Code for prevention of insider trading is to 
monitor  and  regulate  the  transactions  of  persons 
close to the management of a company and insiders 
to  avoid  unauthorised  communication  of  price 
sensitive information. Merely because the company 
had  not  defined  the  term  ‘dependent’  in  terms  of 
financial limits, it cannot be said that a spouse with 
independent  income  can  trade  without  the  other 
spouse who is on the Board obtaining a pre-clearance. 
Since,  both  the  directors  and  his/her  spouse  are 
covered under PIT Regulations, and having regard 
to the object of pre-clearance of trades which is to see 
that neither the Director nor his/her family members 
and deemed connected persons trade in securities of 
the company based on price sensitive information, it 
is essential that pre-clearance for trades is obtained.

 
Holding  that  the  noticee,  by  not  taking  pre-
clearance for his wife’s transactions in the shares of 

the listed company in which he was a director at the 
relevant time, violated the provisions of Clause 3.3-1  
of the Code of Conduct specified under Part A of the 
Scheduled  I  read  with  Regulation  12(1)  of  the  PIT 
Regulations, the AO imposed a penalty of ` 10 lakh 
on the noticee in terms of Section 15HB of the SEBI 
Act.

f.	

	Adjudication	Order	against	Mr	Vipul	Shah	
in	the	matter	of	M/s	Safal	Herbs	Ltd.

Adjudication  proceedings  were 

 
initiated 
against Mr Vipul Shah for non-disclosure of change 
in  his  shareholding  due  to  sale  of  `  52,30,000 
shares    constituting  5.23  per  cent  in  the  company, 
during September 2012 and December 2012, under 
Regulations  13(3),  13(4A)  read  with  13(5)  of  SEBI 
(PIT)  Regulations,  1992  and  Regulation  29(2)  read 
with  29(3)  of  the  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  2011 
and  Regulation  30(2)  read  with  30(3)  of  the  SAST 
Regulations, 2011.

 
The noticee, Mr Vipul Shah submitted that his 
share  certificates  were  lost  and  were  not  traceable. 
He also submitted that another promoter of SHL had 
fraudulently transferred the shares as the signatures 
on the transfer deeds did not match with the noticee’s 
signatures.  Mr  Vipul  Shah  submitted  a  Signature 
Comparison Report and a Handwriting Comparison 
Report  stating  that  his  signature  was  forged  on 
the  transfer  deeds.  In  this  regard  the  order  of  the 
Allahabad High Court in the matter of Mr Balkrishna 
Das vs. Ms Radha Devi, AIR 1989 All 133 was relied 
upon which observed the following:

 
‘The expert’s evidence is only a piece of evidence 
and the weight to be given to it has to be judged along 
with other evidence as evidence of this nature is ordinarily 
not conclusive. Such evidence, therefore, cannot be taken 
as substantive piece of evidence but is there to corroborate 
the other evidence’

 
During  the  course  of  the  examination  under 
adjudication,  it  was  established  Mr  Vipul  Shah 
did  not  write  to  RTA  regarding  loss  of  shares  and 

206

to  stop  further  transfer  of  the  shares  although  the 
shares were lost in 1997 until he received SEBI’s SCN 
dated September 08, 2014. He filed a copy of a police 
complaint dated January 31, 2015 with respect to loss 
of share certificates which was made after the receipt 
of SCN by the noticee.

 
While imposing the penalty the order of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of M/s	Roofit	
Industries Ltd. vs. SEBI was relied upon and a penalty 
of ` 4 crore was imposed on Mr Vipul Shah for the 
violation  of  Regulations  13(3),  13(4A)  read  with 
13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992 and Regulation 
29(2)  read  with  29(3)  of  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,

	Adjudication	 Order	 against	 Mr	 Brijmohan	
Rathi	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 M/s	 Maharashtra	
Polybutenes	Ltd.

Adjudication  proceedings  were 

 
initiated 
against Mr Brijmohan Rathi, promoter and managing 
director of MPL, who had made wrong disclosures 
on  pledging  of  shares  and  wrong  reporting  of  the 
shareholding  pattern    to  BSE  and  also  indulged 
in  the  creation  of  an  artificial  volume  and  price 
manipulation in the violation of Section 12A(a), (b) 
and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Section 27 of 
the SEBI Act, 1992, Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) 
and 4(2) (a), (d), (e), (f), (g), (r) of  the SEBI (PFUTP) 
Regulations,  2003  and  Regulation  13(4)  read  with 
13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992.

On  examination  of  the  demat  statements 
 
of  the  noticee,  Mr  Brijmohan  Rathi  and  other 
promoter  group  entities  and  the  shareholding 
pattern submitted by MPL to BSE, it was observed 
that there was a gross mismatch between the actual 
shareholding of the promoters of the company and 
as disclosed in  the mandatory quarterly disclosures 
of  shareholding  to  the  public  through  BSE.  It  was 
admitted  by  the  noticee  in  his  submission  that  the 
shareholding  pattern  received  from  R&TA  was 
‘edited’ to give effect to the ‘pledge’ of shareholding 

PART THREE B: Regulatory Actions

by the promoters. However, no allegation of creation 
of  artificial  volume  and  price  manipulation  was 
established because of the following reasons:
 

I. 

 No  synchronised  trades  between  the 
parties wherein price/time/quantity are 
matched.
 The  so-called  sale  back  or  reverse 
transactions had taken place six months 
thereafter and that too in four tranches.
 Usually  in  circular  trades,  more  than 
two parties are involved with the same 
shares  being  transferred  amongst  the 
group to create an illusion of volumes 
traded. In the present case, there were 
only two parties to the transaction and 
the reverse transaction was spread over 
six months.
   There  was  no  material  like  nearness 
of  relationship,  no  other  party  to  the 
transactions.

The AO observed that whether or not two or 
more persons were acting in concert was a question 
of  fact  and  had  to  be  answered  on  the  facts  and 
circumstances of each case. As it was difficult to prove 
acting in concert by direct evidence, circumstantial 
evidence  had  to  be  taken 
into  consideration 
including nearness of relationship etc. while proving 
the  concert.  Further,  the  circumstantial  evidence 
should  be  sufficient  to  raise  a  presumption  in  its 
favour with regard to the existence of a fact sought 
to be proved. Since it is exceedingly difficult to prove 
facts which are especially within the knowledge of 
parties concerned, legal proof in such circumstances 
takes on the character of a prudent man’s estimate as 
to the probabilities of the case.

 
Having considered the facts and circumstances 
of  the  case,  the AO  held  that  the  noticees  violated 
Regulation  7(1)  read  with  Regulation  7(2)  of  the 
SAST Regulations, 1997 and referring to the order of 
the Supreme Court in SEBI	vs.	M/s	Roofit	Industries	
Limited imposed a composite penalty of rupees one 
crore under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992.

	Adjudication	 Order	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 M/s	
Sushil	Financial	Services	Private	Limited

 
SEBI conducted a limited purpose inspection 
of books of accounts and other records of M/s Sushil 
Financial  Services  Private  Limited  (noticee)  for  the 
period  from  April  01,2012  to  September  04,2014 
(hereinafter ‘inspection period’) to examine whether 
the noticee had complied with the provisions of SEBI 
policy.

Inter-alia, 

 
deficiencies were observed:

the 

following 

irregularities/

 

 

i. 

ii. 

 Inter-mingling  of 
funds  between 
securities  client  bank  account  and 
commodities client bank account.

 Using the credit fund balances of clients 
for purposes other than specified in the 
circulars.

 

iii. 

 Not  incorporating/mentioning  ‘client 
account’  in  the  bank  account  name 
which is required as per a SEBI policy.

 
Therefore,  it  was  alleged  that  by  these  acts,

5.  LOCAL OFFICES

   
The SEBI Board (in its meeting held on March 
25,  2011)  had  suggested  that  SEBI  should  explore 
the  scope  of  strengthening  its  regional  offices  and 
open  local  offices  in  various  state  capitals  for  the 
development  of  a  pan-India  securities  market.  It 
was  felt  that  physical  proximity  of  a  SEBI  office 
to  investors  and  intermediaries  would  promote 
deepening and broadening of the securities market. 
The  proposal  was  approved  by  the  Board  on  July 
28, 2011 and the decision to open local offices was 
implemented  in  phases,  with  Phase  I  starting  in 
2011-12.

 I. 

SEBI acquired office premises on a lease basis 
for  a  local  office  in  Raipur.  The  Raipur  local 
office was inaugurated by the Chief Minister of 
Chhattisgarh on December 19, 2015 and is now 
functioning to cater to the needs of investors in 
the state.

 II. 

SEBI  acquired  and  furnished  office  premises 
on  a  lease  basis  for  a  local  office  in  Patna. 
The Patna local office was inaugurated by the 
Chief  Minister  of  Bihar  on  January  18,  2016 
and is now functioning to cater to the needs of 
investors in the state.

 III.  SEBI has acquired additional office premises 
in  Bandra  Kurla  Complex,  Mumbai,  on 
ownership  basis  to  cater  to  the  immediate 
requirement  of  office  premises  at  the  HO  in 
Mumbai.

   
As  on  March  31,  2016,  SEBI  had  15  local 
offices in Dehradun, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Shimla, 
Bengaluru,  Cochin,  Hyderabad,  Bhubaneswar, 
Guwahati, Patna, Ranchi, Jaipur, Panaji, Raipur and 
Indore.

as a tool of good governance’. The observance of the 
week commenced with a pledge administered by a 
whole-time Member to the Executive Directors and

four  regional  offices  –  Northern  Regional  Office, 
Eastern  Regional  Office,  Southern  Regional  Office 
and  Western  Regional  Office  --  also  administered 
the  pledge  to  their  staff.  A  banner  on  ‘Vigilance 

PART FOUR: Organisational Matters

Awareness Week’ was prominently displayed outside 
the  office  premises  in  Mumbai  and  at  all  regional 
and  local  offices  during  the  vigilance  awareness

the employees.
