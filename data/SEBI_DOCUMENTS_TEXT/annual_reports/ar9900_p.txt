POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

This  Annual  Report  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  presents  a
review of the policies and programmes of the SEBI, its working and operations during
the financial year, 1999-2000. The Report gives an account of the operations of the SEBI
and  describes  the  manner  in  which  the  SEBI  has  been  discharging  its  functions  and
exercising its powers in terms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992;
the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956; the Depositories Act, 1996; as well as in
terms of the delegated powers under the Companies Act, 1956.  The Report also provides
details of the developments in Indian securities market and their bearing on and relation
with the work of the SEBI.  The Report has been prepared in accordance with the format
prescribed in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Annual Report) Rules, 1994,
notified in the Official Gazette on April 7, 1994.

The  SEBI  envisions  a  market,  which  is  modern  in  infrastructure  and  international  best
practices, efficient, safe, investor friendly and globally competitive.  The SEBI has been
continuously  directing  its  efforts  to  achieve  this  vision  in  fulfillment  of  the  twin
objectives of investor protection and market development as mandated by the SEBI Act,
1992.  The  SEBI  as  a  statutory  body,  throughout  its  eight-year  existence  has  sought  to
balance  these  two  objectives  by  constantly  reviewing  and  assessing  its  policies  and
programmes,  initiating  new  guidelines  and  crafting  new  regulations  to  nurture  areas
hitherto  unregulated  and  underdeveloped  and  to  ensure  growth,  integration  and
consolidation of market so that they can contribute to the process of capital formation in
the economy.

During 1999-2000, the focus of SEBI’s activities has been on:

(cid:216)  increasing market transparency through further improvement of disclosure standards
(cid:216)  raising the standards of corporate governance
(cid:216)  improving  market  efficiency  by  speeding  up  the  process  of  dematerialisation  and

introducing rolling settlement in a phased manner

(cid:216)  reducing transaction cost by refining the margin system
(cid:216)  enhancing  the  market  safety  through  an  efficient  margin  system  and  stepping  up

surveillance

in
India.

The measures enumerated above and also those elaborated later in the report enabled the
SEBI to accomplish and achieve the targets set by it to fulfill its statutory obligations to
develop  and  regulate  the  securities  market  and  protect  the  investors.  Besides,  with  the
maturity of the regulatory framework and stepped up market surveillance, the market has
also become safer and the investor is better protected.  While  volatility  has  become  an
endemic feature of all the markets in the world because of increased volumes within the
markets and cross border, complexities, impact of other financial markets like currency,
commodities  and  property,  existence  of  common  players  in  different  markets  fleeing

from one market to the other, thus transmitting the risk, the Indian market has remained
comparatively  less  volatile.    This  has  been  possible  because  of  the  prudential  macro-
economic policies of the country, proper management of change and effective regulatory
system.

REVIEW  OF  THE  GENERAL  ECONOMIC  ENVIRONMENT

A]
AND THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE

General Economic Environment

The real GDP growth based on 1993-94 prices, was estimated at 6.4 per cent in 1999-
2000.  In  1998-99  it  was  6.8  percent.  Deterioration  in  the  performance  of  agriculture
sector largely accounted for the decline in the growth rate of the economy. However the
industrial  output  emerged  out  the  sluggish  trend  of  the  preceding  year  and  recovery
appeared  to  be  underway.  An  important  aspect  of  the  industrial  growth,  which  would
have  an  impact  on  the  capital  market,  was  the  increase  in  the  output  of  manufacturing
sector by 9.3 per cent which was more than double the growth achieved in the previous
year  (4.3  per  cent).    A  further  analysis  shows  that  intermediate  and  consumer  goods
industries accelerated their growth to 15.2 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, from
that of 5.9 per cent and 2.4 per cent during 1998-99.  The decline in growth of production
of capital goods and lower increase in the imports of the capital goods indicate existence
of investment pessimism in the real sector.  A striking feature of growth of GDP is the
continuous increase in the share of services sector which contributed nearly 52 per cent to
it leading to recognition that India has been moving to a services based growth.

In  1998-99  domestic  savings  deteriorated  to  22.3  per  cent  from  24.7  per  cent  in  the
previous  year.  This  raises  concern  about  the  availability  of  financial  resources  for
maintaining the investment prospects in the economy. The decline in saving rate has been
on  account  of  deceleration  in  the  saving  rate  of  almost  all  the  sectors  viz.  households,
private corporate and government. The saving rate of government sector was almost zero.
This has contributed to fall in gross domestic investment from 26.2 per cent in 1997-98 to
23.4 per cent in 1998-99 (Table 1.2).

The  distribution  of  households’  financial  savings  among  various  financial  instruments
brings  out  the  relative  importance  of  securities  market  as  an  investment  option  for  the
households( Table 1.3). The instrument-wise distribution of households financial savings
depicts that the share of households saving in the form of shares and debentures in their
total  financial  savings,  had  increased  from  2.1  per  cent  in  1997-98  to  2.4  per  cent  in
1998-99.  On the other hand, the share of bank deposits decreased from 44.5 per cent to
36.9 per cent.  Investment in the units of UTI did not show any improvement from 0.3 per
cent  in  1997-98.    It  is  interesting  to  note  that  there  has  been  a  spurt  in  deposits  of
households with non-banking companies’  from 4.4 per cent in 1997-98 to 7.4 per cent in
1998-99.  The  high  growth  of  funds  mobilised  by  the  mutual  funds  has  generated
possibility of increase in investment in shares and debentures pushing up the  their share
in households financial savings in 1999-2000 (Table 1.3).

Developments  on  external  front  are  very  important  as  far  as  the  capital  market  is
concerned.  According to provisional data, net FIIs inflows showed an increase of US$2.1
billion whereas FDIs inflows stood at US$2.17 billion during 1999-2000.  The balance of
payment data reflected an overall balance surplus of US$ 6.4 billion during 1999-2000.

On the other hand inflows on account of FIIs showed positive increases of Rs.1,187 crore
as  against  decline  of  Rs.390  crore  during  the  entire  year  of  1998-99.    The  better
performance on account of FIIs inflows was supported by the stability of exchange rate
policy of country and improvement in prospects of capital appreciation in the investment
in Indian stocks. FIIs investment in equity and debt amounted to more than $ 2 billion
during April-March 1999-2000  compared to a negative inflow of $386.1 million during
1998-99.    The  healthy  outlook  for  FIIs  investment  in  the  Indian  stocks  is  expected  to
grow. Some improvement in stability and credibility of East Asian countries and other
financial  markets  in  Asia,  relaxation  by  Government  of  India  in  the  limit  of  FIIs
investment to 40 per cent in the Union Budget 2000-01, has created more prospects for
FIIs  investment.    The  picking  up  of  exports  growth  and  rise  in  the  level  of  foreign
exchange reserve to US $ 33 billion as on alongwith higher GDP growth during 2000-
2001 is expected to build up and improve the FIIs investment sentiments.

Page 13 of 17165

The decline in external Debt-GDP ratio and debt service ratio from 23.8 per cent and 19.1
per cent in 1998 respectively to 23.7 per cent and 18.1 per cent in 1999 augur well for
prospective FIIs investments in India.

Investment activity in the primary market increased during 1999-2000. The total resource
mobilisation by the primary market which stood at only Rs.5,586 crore during 1998-99
through  58  issues,  sharply  increased  to  Rs.7,817  crore  through  93  issues  during  1999-
2000, thus recording a growth of 40 per cent.  During the previous year, the growth was
22  per  cent.    This  increased  growth  in  1999-2000  was  contributed  by  the  increases  in
public  and  rights  issues,  which  recorded  a  growth  of  25  per  cent  and  175  per  cent,
respectively.    In  absolute  terms,  the  rights  issues  and  public  issues  contributed  an
incremental amount of Rs.1,248 crore and Rs.933 crore respectively each during the year.
It is important to note that there has been a decline in the share of financial institutions
and  banks  in  total  resource  mobilisation  from  the  primary  market,  from  85  per  cent
during 1998-99 to about 52 per cent in 1999-2000 and an increase in participation by the
manufacturing and other companies. This is an evidence of growing dis-intermediation in
the capital market.  Another important development was floatation of larger number of
issues by new companies (IPOs) increasing their share to 35.0 per cent during 1999-2000
from  a  meagre  share  of  7.8  per  cent  during  1998-99.  The  issues  by  information
technology  and  other  knowledge-based  companies  were  on  the  rise  during  the  year,  in
keeping with the worldwide trend. Thus new economy companies mobilised close to 20
per  cent  of  total  resources  raised  during  the  financial  year  under  review.  Health  and
entertainment companies also raised resources offering the opportunity of diversification
of investment for investors.

The bullish trend in the secondary market during the year under review was accompanied
by a rise in the market capitalisation. As such, the market capitalisation at NSE increased
from  Rs.4,91,175  crore  as  at  end  March  1999  to  Rs.10,20,426  crore  as  at  end  March
2000,  a  rise  of  107.8  per  cent.  The  market  capitalisation  at  BSE  increased  from
Rs.5,45,361  crore  as  at  end-March  1999  to  Rs.9,12,842  crore  as  at  end-  March  2000
recording  a growth of 67.4 percent.

FII investments during the year remained positive with  the net investment at US$ 2.4
billion compared to a net outflow of US$ 386.1 million during 1998-99. The cumulative
net investment rose to US$11,253 million at end March 2000 from US$8897 million at
end March 1999.

The performance of mutual funds significantly improved during the year. The aggregate
net mobilisation increased to Rs.18,970 crore during 1999-2000 as against net outflow of
the  order  of  Rs.950  crore  during  1998-99.  While  mutual  funds  under  public  sector
continued to perform poorly with a net outflow of the order of Rs.745 crore in the current
financial year, the private sector mutual funds added a net amount of Rs.15,166.48 crore
and UTI another Rs.4548.3 crore.  The spurt in mutual funds resources has been the result
of tax incentives provided by the Union Budget 1999-2000.  Efforts of RBI in lowering
the interest rates structure is also resulting in shift of bank deposits to mutual funds. The
regulatory framework of the mutual funds was also responsible for the improvement in
the performance of this sector.

B]  REVIEW OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

A review of the major policy developments and programmes of SEBI during 1999-2000
is given below:

i.   Primary Securities Market

Rationalisation of guidelines for public issues

Keeping in view the changes in the capital market  emanating from free pricing of shares
and  free  access  to  market  for  funds  by  the  issuers,  the  SEBI  with  the  objective  of
broadening the investors’  base, dispensed with the requirement of standard denomination
of Rs.10 and Rs.100 (in terms of government circulars) and gave freedom to companies
with dematerialised shares, to issue shares at any denomination but not below Re.1/- or
decimal of a Rupee to be determined by them.  This decision is also in conformity with
the  recommendation  made  by  the  Informal  Group  on  Primary  Market.  The  existing
companies, which have issued shares at Rs.10 and Rs.100, also can avail of this facility
by consolidating/splitting their existing shares.

In  order  to  enable  the  investors  to  take  informed  investment  decisions,  the  stock
exchanges  were  directed  to  indicate  the  denomination  value  of  shares  as  fixed  by  the
company  alongwith  the  market  quotation.    However,  the  companies  availing  of  this
facility are required to strictly adhere to disclosures and accounting norms.

As a further measure towards rationalization of existing guidelines, the SEBI decided that
there would be only one set of disclosures and entry norms for all the issues irrespective
of the issue price. Thus, the different requirements for making issues at par and premium
were merged to create a common set of requirements.

Marketing initial public offers through the secondary market

To  facilitate  the  process  of  public  offerings,  the  SEBI  introduced  the  new  system  viz.
‘Online Securities Offer System’  which seeks to extend the benefits of on-line trading in
the  secondary  market  to  the  primary  market.  The  system  not  only  uses  the  existing
infrastructure  of  the  exchanges  (viz..  terminals,  brokers  and  systems)  besides  making
necessary improvisations in software packages and improved means of connectivity.

•  The present primary issue process involves printing of a large number of application
forms and dispatching of refund orders and, therefore, leads to increase in cost and
time required for the public issues. The new system would reduce the cost and time
involved  in  a  public  issue  process  and  do  away  with  the  blocking  of  funds  of  the
investors.

Page 15 of 17165

Compulsory linking of issuer companies with a depository and compulsory trading by
new IPOs

All new IPOs will be compulsorily traded  in dematerilised form and guidelines of public
issues  were  modified  to  make  admission  to  a  depository  for  dematerialization  of
securities, a pre-requisite for making a public or rights issue or an offer for sale. But the
investors  have  been  allowed  to  exercise  option  of  either  subscribing  to  securities  in
physical form or dematerialised form.

Disclosure of credit rating

On the basis of recommendations of the Committee set up to frame regulations for Credit
Rating  Agencies,  the  following  additional  requirements  for  companies  issuing  debt
securities to public/ on rights basis, have been prescribed:

•  All companies making public or rights issue of debt instrument (including convertible
instrument) irrespective of their maturity/conversion period, shall obtain credit rating
by at least one approved credit rating agency and disclose it in the offer document.

•  Where credit rating is obtained from more than one approved credit rating agency, all

the credit ratings, including the unaccepted ratings, shall be disclosed.

•  The  issuer  shall  give  an  undertaking  in  the  offer  document  stating  that  they  would
give  necessary  co-operation  to  the  credit  rating  agency  (s)  in  providing  true  and
adequate  information  till  the  debt  obligations  in  respect  of  the  securities  are
outstanding

Association of stock exchange personnel in allotment

In  order  to  improve  the  sanctity  of  the  allotment  procedure  for  public  issues  it  was
decided that Executive Director/Managing Director of the regional stock exchange along
with  the  post  issue  lead  merchant  banker  and  the  registrar  to  the  issue,  shall  be
responsible to ensure that the basis of allotment is finalized in a fair and proper manner.

Lock in of pre-issue capital

The practice of issuing shares at a price below the public issue price prior to the public
issue, prima facie, gives a price advantage to such allottees.   In order to discourage such
practice,  especially  in  view  of  high  premiums  to  the  issue  price  at  which  information
technology stocks were being listed, it was decided to lock the entire pre- issue capital in
case an allotment was made in above manner.

Page 16 of 17165

Disclosure and investor protection guidelines

The Disclosure and Investor Protection Guidelines of SEBI were amended to provide for
enhanced investor protection.

•  The  appraising  agency  would  bring  in  the  required  contribution  at  least  one  day

before the opening of the issue.

•  The promoters contribution has been made uniform at 20 per cent  irrespective of the

issue size.

•  Only  such  securities  have  to  be  offered  for  promoters  contribution  for  which  a

specific written consent has been obtained from the shareholders for lock-in.

•  Mandatory provision made for appointment of registrar for  rights issues.

Malegam committee for disclosures in offer documents

A  Committee  was  set  up  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri.  YH  Malegam  to  review  the
prevailing disclosure requirements in offer documents for public and rights issues and to
recommend  additions  /  modifications  thereof  in  pursuance  of  SEBI’s  objectives  for
investor protection, promotion and development of transparent securities market.

Modifications in eligibility requirements for information technology companies

Companies  in  the  information  technology  sectors  submitted  that  in  view  of  the  factors
like high valuation enjoyed by these companies coupled with low capital requirements,
importance  of  employee  stock  options  (as  employees  are  the  main  asset  for  these
companies) and attractiveness of ADR route for listing on overseas stock exchange  with
capital dilution as low as 10 per cent , they may be granted relaxation from requirement
to offer to the public at least 25 per cent  of the securities issued for the purpose of listing.

In view of the fact that accumulation of excess capital by these companies would result in
unproductive  utilization  and  crowd  out  the  other  industries  in  need  of  capital,  it  was
decided to allow these companies to list their shares by making a public offer of 10 per
cent  of the post issue capital instead of 25 per cent , subject to requirements of issue of
minimum number of securities and a specified minimum issue size.

 A  concern  had  arisen  about  the  misuse  of  high  valuation  of  IT  industry  by  some
unscrupulous  promoters  who  may  charge  unreasonably  high  premiums  from  the
investors. It was, therefore, thought necessary to stop the access to public funds by such
promoters so that the interest of genuine promoters is protected.

Thus,  in  continuation  of  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  offer  document  contains  adequate
disclosures to enable the investors to make an informed investment decision, additional
disclosure requirements were stipulated for companies which changed their names in the
recent past to give an impression of being into information technology.

Page 17 of 17165

To  encourage  only  genuine  information  technology  companies  to  be  eligible  to  make
initial public offer and to raise capital from public and to protect the interest of investors,
it was stipulated that unlisted companies in the information technology industry should
have a track record of distributable profits in three out of five years from the information
technology activities.   If a company fails to fulfil this criterion, it can access the market
through the alternative route of appraisal and financing by a bank or financial institution.
The same conditions would apply to a listed company also which has changed its name to
reflect the activities in information technology.

Amendments of book building guidelines

Book building is a price discovery mechanism used by the corporates issuing securities,
to discover the price of their securities. The mechanism also helps the small investors to
subscribe  to  securities  at  a  price,  which  is  arrived  at  by  a  transparent  process.    The
importance of this mechanism was recognized by the SEBI and book-building guidelines
were introduced in 1995. However, while book building became an accepted practice in
the market for private placement of debt securities, it remained absent in the public issue
market despite the regulatory framework being in place.

This  year  saw  the  book  building  exercise  being  conducted  for  the  first  time  for  initial
public  offering  as  during  the  year  five  initial  public  offers  were  made  using  the  book
building route. The practice of book building is comparatively new to the Indian capital
market and  the procedure is still evolving.  On the basis of feed back from the market
intermediaries,  some  areas  of  existing  framework  were  identified  for  modification  in
order to improve the existing mechanism. The SEBI Board approved these modifications
in October 1999.  Under the modified guidelines an issuer has been given the option to
book build either 90 per cent  of the net offer to the public or 75  per cent  of the net offer
to  the  public.  The  balance  issue  is  offered  to  the  public  at  the  fixed  price  determined
through  book-building  exercise.  The  book-building  mechanism  is  designed  keeping  in
view the international practices and procedures for book building (Box 1.2).

Accounting standards committee

The Accounting Standards Committee, was set up by the SEBI as Standing Committee
under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  Y  H  Malegam,  to  inter-alia  review  the  continuous
disclosures requirements under the listing agreement for the listed companies and provide
inputs to Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (ICAI) for evolving new accounting

Page 18 of 17165

standards  and  review  the  existing  ones,  wherever  required  in  order  to  make  disclosure
standards and accounting practices at par with the international practices.

Major recommendations of the Committee that have been implemented by the SEBI are
given below :
•  With a view to make the unaudited financial quarterly results of the companies more
transparent and meaningful, certain additional disclosure norms have been prescribed
and  also  half  yearly  results  have  been  subjected  to  a  ‘Limited  Review’  by  the
Auditors with effect from half year ending March 31, 2000.

•  In order to harmonize the disclosure requirements under the Listing Agreement and
the  Accounting  Standards  issued  by  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India
(ICAI), it has been prescribed that the Cash Flow Statement being disclosed by the
companies  in  terms  of  Listing  Agreement,  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the
relevant Accounting Standard.

•  In  order  to  avoid  excessive  volatility  in  stock  prices  due  to  announcements  of
dividends, rights, bonus etc., during the market hour, it has been prescribed that such
announcements be made outside the market hours.

•  The Committee has emphasized the need for formulation of accounting standards on
Consolidation  of  Accounts,  Segmental  Reporting,  Deferred  Taxation  and  Related
Party  Disclosures  and  has  urged  the  ICAI  to  expedite  the  issue  of  Accounting
Standards on the above.

Employee stock options scheme

The SEBI had issued guidelines on employee stock options in 1992 and modified them
further in 1995.  In view of the phenomenal growth in the knowledge-based industries, it
was felt that there is a need to review the guidelines to suit the changed environment. As
such  a  Committee  was  set  up  under  the  chairmanship  of  J.R.  Varma  to  make
recommendations  and  to  frame  the  guidelines  for  Employee  Stock  Options  and  Stock
Purchase  Scheme.  The  guidelines  were  framed  on  the  basic  principles  of  complete
disclosure and shareholder approval. The framework for employees stock option has been
designed to give maximum flexibility to the corporates to formulate schemes keeping in
mind the objectives of such a scheme subject to their following these basic tenets.

ii.   Secondary Securities Market

 Modernization  of  market  infrastructure  improves  market  transparency  standard.  The
improvement  of  market  micro-structure  increases  trading  efficiency.  Risk  containment
measures  help  in  improving  market  integrity  and  safety.  Rolling  settlement  enhances
liquidity and also provides for faster settlement. These have been the main focus of the
SEBI’s  efforts  in  the  secondary  market.  The  SEBI  extends  its  oversight  to  23  stock
exchanges  in  the  country  and  directs  its  efforts  towards  encouraging  them  to  become
more  effective  and  efficient  self-regulatory  organisations.  The  measures  taken  by  the
SEBI in 1999-2000 in the secondary market are discussed below.

Depositories and paperless trading and other related issues

Page 20 of 17165

Dematerialisation of securities is one of the major steps for improving and modernizing
market  and  enhancing  the  level  of  investor  protection  through  elimination  of  bad
deliveries and forgery of shares, and expediting the transfer of shares.  Recognizing the
far  reaching  benefits  that  would  accrue  to  the  market  through  the  removal  of  physical
securities, the speeding up of dematerialisation process has been high on the agenda of
the  SEBI.  During  the  year  1999-2000,  the  SEBI  continued  its  policy  to  enhance  the
growth of paperless trading and electronic book entry transfer but in a phased manner so
as  to  allow  time  for  required  infrastructure  to  develop  and  to  gain  acceptance  of  the
investors and the market.  The following measures have been taken by the SEBI during
the year under review :

•  The  SEBI  issued  directive  to  the  companies  included  in  the  list  of  securities  for
dematerialisation  to  effect  compulsory  dematerialised  trading  for  all  investors  and
institutional investors on the scheduled dates announced and to sign  agreements and
complete all formalities with both the depositories and establish connectivity on time
so that dematerialisation could proceed on schedule.

•  Companies whose shares are being traded compulsorily in dematerialised form by all
investors, are required to compulsorily provide for transfer and dematerialisation of
securities simultaneously. This will help the investors in reducing the time taken for
transfer of shares.

•  The SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulation, 1996 was amended to include
registrars  to  an  issue  or  share  transfer  agents  in  the  eligible  category  to  become  a
depository participant.

• 

• 

Introduction  of  procedures  for  interconnectivity  between  the  various  segments  and
components involved in the process of dematerialisation and its smooth functioning at
various levels of participantion in dematerialised securities.

In respect of the value of portfolio of securities of the beneficiary accounts, the broker
DPs allowed to maintain client assets in custody to the extent of 100 times of broker’s
networth from  the earlier limit of 35 times upto a networth of Rs.750 lakhs and 50
times above the networth of Rs. 750 lakh .

•  The  branch  offices  of  DPs  that  are  handling  more  than  5000  accounts  shall  either
have  direct  electronic  connectivity  with  the  depository  or  with  office  of  depository
participant that is connected live to the depository.  This would adequately equip the
infrastructure  of  the  depository  participant  branches  so  that  the  reach  of  the  DPs
could be increased and the branches could serve the investors better, while ensuring
that the branches have adequate control systems.

•  Every company is required to appoint the same registrars and share transfer agents

for both the depositories.

Page 21 of 17165

•  The  registrars  and  share 

to  accept  partial
dematerialisation  requests  and  will  not  reject  or  send  back  the  complete  lot  of
dematerialisation request to the DPs in cases where only a part of the request was to
be rejected.

transfer  agents  are  required 

•  A Standing Committee co-chaired by the Managing Directors of NSDL and CDSL
was  formed  which  will  meet  at  least  once  a  month  to  resolve  issues  between  DPs,
registrars and depositories which may arise from time to time.  The other members of
the  committee  are  SHCIL,  HDFC  Bank,  Standard  Chartered  Bank,  Integrated
Enterprises (I) Ltd., Karvy Consultants, ICICI Ltd. and three persons from RAIN.

• 

If a DP has sent information about dematerialisation electronically to a Registrar but
physical shares are not received, the registrar will accept the dematerialisation request
and  carry  out  dematerialization  on  the  indemnity  given  by  the  DP  and  proof  of
dispatch of document given by DP.

•  CDSL and NSDL shall be required to persuade major DPs to open branches in cities

where DP services are not available.

•  The broker DPs who are also registered with SEBI as share transfer agents, shall be
allowed to change their broker DP status to that of share transfer agent/Registrar DP.

•  The  committee  on  dematerialisation  of  shares  was  also  seized  of  various  issues  as

mentioned below :

3  Standardization of various procedures related to trading in depository system:
3  Safety features and standards for depository operations:
3  Expansion of depository infrastructure and making the branch offices with 'live"

connectivity:

3  Systemic tracking of delays at the hands of the depository participants, share

transfer/issuer companies and depositories:

3  Adequacy/capability of the depository system and systemic changes necessary to

cope with the workload present as well as future:

3  One stage processing for transfer and dematerialisation:
3  Reductions in the size of batch processing from the present level of 1000 requests

per batch:

3  Good/bad delivery norms to be made mandatory on the registrars:

Strengthening the safety and integrity of the secondary securities market

Intra-day trading and exposure limits

Safety and integrity of the securities trading system is an integral part of a healthy market.
The  SEBI  has  been  continuously  striving  to  achieve  these  objectives.    The  SEBI  has
introduced capital adequacy norms.  As such both the gross exposure limit of 20 times the
base minimum capital and additional capital deposited by the member brokers and intra-day

Page 22 of 17165

trading  limits  of  33  1/3  times  the  base  minimum  capital  and  the  additional  capital  as
prescribed by the SEBI have already been implemented by all the stock exchanges. During
1999-2000, most of the major exchanges viz. National, Bombay, Calcutta and Uttar Pradesh
Stock Exchanges monitored the exposure and intra-day trading limits on a real time basis.
Setting up of trade/settlement guarantee fund by stock exchanges

To ensure timely completion of settlements the SEBI had advised all the stock exchanges
to set up a Trade/Settlement Guarantee Fund or Clearing Corporation. During the year
1999-2000, the Settlement Guarantee Fund schemes of Hyderabad, Cochin, Jaipur, Uttar
Pradesh and Pune Stock Exchanges were approved. As at the end of March 2000, 16 out
of  the  total  23  exchanges  (the  remaining  7  exchanges  have  nil/insignificant  turnover)
have already set up Trade/Settlement Guarantee Fund.

Rationalisation of margin system/ market safety

Specific margins introduced on March 13, 2000.

Market  volatility  is  a  matter of    concern    for  the  regulator  .    High  volatility  generates
confusion and uncertainty in the mind of investors whereas steady rise or steady fall in
equity prices helps the investors in perception formation for investment or disinvestment.
The  SEBI  therefore  is  always  keen  to  minimize  or  curb  the  volatility.    The  SEBI  has
therefore, taken several measures to curb the market volatility.

As such in June 1998, the volatility margins were prescribed to curb excess volatility in
the  market  and  to  act  as  a  deterrent  to  building  up  of  excessive  outstanding  positions.
This  step  had  a  salutary  impact  and  volatility  was  reduced.    In  March  1999  again,  the
SEBI introduced following measures to reduce the volatility:

Page 23 of 17165

The brokers-specific measure included:
•   Where the brokers had built up sizeable positions, they were asked to either make
reduction  in  positions  or  to  make  advance  pay-in  in  cases  where  they  had  built  up
high positions. Such brokers could also be subjected to ad-hoc margins by the stock
exchanges.

•  The  scrip-specific  measures  included  impositions  of  special  margins  on  volatile

scrips.

•  The SEBI also directed five major exchanges to take incremental additional capital
and margins from their top 25 brokers in the form of cash or FDRs only for next four
weeks, and withdraw the existing facility of accepting additional capital/ margins by
way  of  bank  guarantees  or  securities.  Exchanges  were  to  select  top  25  brokers  in
terms of the  marginable gross exposure at the close of the third day of their trading
cycle.  The  unutilized  portion  of  bank  guarantee  and  securities  deposited  by  these
brokers were not considered for margin and capital requirements from the next day
and all incremental margin and capital requirements were made payable in cash/FDR
only.

•  Again  in  June  1999,    some  decisions  were  taken  by  the  SEBI  .It  was  decided  that
credit  for  mark  to  market  gain  in  one  scrip  would  now  be  given  against  mark  to
market losses in other scrips after completion of the trading cycle, when settlement
dues get determined.

•  Margin and exposure limits exemptions were made available only on actual delivery

of securities.

•  The volatility in the market declined following the imposition of margins. However, it
was  felt  that  this  margin  addressed  volatility  over  a  very  short  period  of  one  week
only.

•  Volatility margins would be imposed if volatility computed as above exceeds 40 per
cent  and  will  be  chargeable  in  four  slabs  ranging  from  5  per  cent  to  20  per  cent
depending on the level of volatility.

•  Volatility margin would not be applicable to scrips priced below Rs.40.

•  To  bring  uniformity  in  the  composition  of  Base  Capital  and  Additional  Capital
amongst exchanges, it was decided that at least 25 per cent of Base Capital would be
maintained in cash and FDRs, out of which 12.5 per cent must be in cash. Not more
than 75 per cent can be in the form of FDR/ BG/ Securities. Additional capital would
be deposited in the form of cash/ BG/ FDR/ securities subject to the condition that
securities shall not exceed 75 per cent of the total additional capital.

Page 24 of 17165

•  Only those securities would be accepted as part of Base Capital which are part of the
BSE Sensex/ Nifty/ BSE 100/ Jr. Nifty, BSE 200/ CNX 200. The scrips, which are in
compulsory dematerialised  trading, would be accepted in dematerialised  form only.
Exchanges would be given 3 months time to ensure that no security other than those
specified is given to exchange as Base Capital.

• 

• 

It  was  also  decided  that  Additional  Capital  available  with  the  exchange  would  get
first  adjusted  towards  requirements  for  gross  exposure  limits/  intra-day  turnover
limits, and excess additional capital with the exchange in the form of cash/BG/FDR
was allowed to be utilised for meeting margin requirements.

Incremental  carry  forward  margin  was  modified  and  a  graded  scale  was  introduced
wherein the margin rate increases from 5 per cent to 30 per cent as against a flat rate
of 10 per cent for every 1 per cent increase of the carry forward position.

•  Based on the overall assessment of risk and the rationalized margin system proposed,

concentration margin and 90 day special margin were discontinued.

Rationalization of risk management system for the equity market

The  risk  containment  measures  from  time  to  time  prescribed  by  the  SEBI  served  the
market  well  by  ensuring  adequate  and  timely  collection  of  margins.  However,  as  the
margin system has evolved over time, there has been multiplicity of margins, which has
made the system complicated. There was a need to simplify the margin system without
sacrificing the objective of safety. Besides, there has been a view that under the rolling
settlement, the existing margin system would be expensive and may be deficient in the
phase of changing nature of emerging risks. As the market moves on to rolling settlement
progressively, the market would need to have a new risk containment system.

Thus, taking the objectives of simplifying the margining system and to make the structure
of  margins  the  unified  one  for  stock  exchanges,  the  SEBI  set  up  a  group  on  Risk
Management System with following terms of references:

1.  Reviewing  the  entire  risk  management  system  comprising  the  margin  system,
exposure  norms,  circuit  filter,  capital  adequacy,  etc.  and  also  to  study  the  risk
management  measure  in  place  in  the  cash  markets  in  the  developed  and  emerging
market countries.

2.  Rationalizing  and  simplifying  the  present  risk  management  system  for  the  account
period  settlement  without  compromising  the  present  levels  of  safety  and  further
strengthening the risk containment measures.

3.  Recommending  risk  containment  measures  for  the  securities  traded  in  the  rolling

settlement.

Enhancing efficiency and transparency in the stock exchanges

Weekly settlement cycle and auction

The stock exchanges were required to necessarily complete their settlement within seven
days  and  to  conduct  the  auction  immediately  i.e.  not  later  than  eight  days,  after  the
completion of the relevant trading period, in those cases where members have failed to
give the delivery, as on date, the exchanges have a weekly settlement cycle.

In  October  1997, 

Modified carry forward system
 
 The  SEBI  had  appointed  a  committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  Prof.  J  R  Verma  to
review the existing Revised Carry-Forward System recommended earlier by the G S Patel
Committee. 
(MCFS)
recommended by the J R Verma Committee was approved and all exchanges desirous of
implementing Modified Carry Forward System were advised to approach the SEBI for
prior approval.
 
Till  1998-99,  Bombay,  Delhi,  Ludhiana  and  Calcutta  Stock  Exchanges  introduced  the
facility  to  carry  forward  trades  under  the  Modified  Carry-Forward  System.  During  the
year 1999-00, Ahmedabad, Madras and Bangalore stock exchanges have introduced the
Modified Carry-Forward System.

the  Modified  Carry-Forward  System 

Uniform settlement cycle

Uniform settlement cycle for stock exchange can help in reducing the arbitrage across the
country.  The SEBI Committee on uniform settlement discussed the ways and means for
the implementation of one common settlement cycle for the smaller exchanges and one
for the  larger exchanges vis-a-vis the introduction of rolling settlement for all exchanges
in  the  shares  which  are  being  traded  in  dematerialised  form  for  all  investors.    The
Committee discussed the issues relating to one common settlement system and concluded
that introduction of uniform settlement cycle to other stock exchanges has implications in
terms of availability of infrastructure,  particularly with the custodians and the depository
participants.

Rolling settlement

In order to enhance liquidity and to shorten the carry forward cycle and to make feasible
the  availability  of  alternative  hedging  mechanism  in  the  form  of  derivatives,  the  SEBI
introduced  rolling  settlement  in  respect  of  shares  wherein  compulsory  dematerialised
trading for all the investors has been introduced.  Initially, only ten scrips were placed for
trading under rolling settlement system, based on the recommendations of the committee
on  Rolling  Settlement.  Trading  was  made  compulsory  in  rolling  settlement  for  all
investors  in  the  10  scrips  from    January  10  ,2000  and  an  addition    of  34  scrips  from
March 21, 2000 and in 119 scrips from May 8, 2000.

Page 26 of 17165

Inter-connectivity between NSDL and CDSL

In  order  to  establish  inter-connectivity  of  National  Securities  Depositories  Limited
(NSDL)  and  Central  Depositories  Services  Limited  (CDSL),  it  was  decided  that
settlement  of  market  transactions  should  begin  with  the  clearing  members  opening
accounts  in  both  depositories  and  the  clearing  house  or  corporations  for  effecting  the
same  pay-out  of  shares  of  each  depository  as  a  pay-in  of  shares  in  that  depository.
However,  CDSL  was  permitted  to  adopt  an  alternate  mode  suggested  by  the  BSE’s
clearing  house  which  envisaged  on-market  inter-depository  settlement.  This  model
envisages  on-market  inter-depository  transfer  of  securities  through  the  segregation  of
inter-depository  transfers  resulting  from  settlement,  at  the  level  of  the  clearing
corporation/clearing houses. To effect these transfers, each depository would be required
to  open  an  account  with  the  other  depository  and  this  account  would  be  debited  or
credited  based  on  the  net  inter-depository  transfer  instructions  from  the  clearing
houses/clearing corporation. It was agreed that both the depositories will introduce this
model for effecting inter-depository transfers, in addition to the model advised which is
currently  in  operational.  The  depositories  were  advised  to  speedily  make  the  necessary
software changes for adoption of the new model.  This mode was expected to entail some
changes in the software of NSDL as well. The software experts of the two depositories
were  asked  to  work  out  the  details  of  the  changes  to  be  made  and  determine  the
implementation  within  three  months.    The  inter-depository  transfer  is  essential  for  the
smooth  functioning  of  the  market  and  charges  if  any,  levied  by  a  depository  for  such
transactions,  would  have  to  take  into  account  the  interest  of  the  investors.  The  SEBI
opined that the charges for the services rendered will have to be determined objectively.

Revival of small stock exchanges

Over  the  recent  past  years,  it  has  been  observed  that  the  regional  stock  exchanges  are
recording very low/insignificant turnover and the majority of their members have become
inactive.  The  financial  health  of  these  exchanges  has  also  been  deteriorating.      With  a
view to revive these exchanges, a group comprising of NSE, BSE, CSE and some of the
smaller stock exchanges was formed, to discuss means and ways to reinvigorate the weak
exchanges.

The suggestions, which emerged at the meeting, could be grouped into two categories.
One,  which  deals  with  ensuring  the  financial  viability  of  the  exchanges  and  the  other
dealing  with  the  issue  of  increasing  the  business  opportunities  for  the  brokers  and
exchanges. For the first category, the suggestions were that the existing infrastructure of
the  exchanges  could  be    used  for  providing  investor  services,  the  exchanges  acting  as
depository  participants  for    holding  the  beneficiary  accounts,  using  the  exchange
infrastructure for monitoring and  surveillance on behalf of the larger exchanges, etc. For
the second category, suggestions included mergers or alliances of small exchanges with
larger exchanges or their subsidiaries  becoming members of other exchanges, transfer of
base minimum capital of the brokers  of the regional exchanges to the Inter Connected
Stock Exchange, reviewing of Trade  Guarantee Funds without compromising the safety
requirements.

Page 27 of 17165

After  considering  the  recommendations  of  the  group,  the  SEBI  permitted  the  stock
exchanges to promote/float a subsidiary company to acquire membership rights of other
stock exchanges to provide the members of the regional exchanges access to the wider
market for improving the trading volume.

As  on  date,  Bangalore,  Vadodara,  Saurashtra-Kutch,  Ludhiana,  OTCEI,  Cochin  and
Inter-connected Stock Exchanges have floated subsidiaries to acquire membership rights
of NSE/BSE.

Trade in securities by qualified participants

The SEBI has been    seized  of  the  issue  of  viability  of  OTCEI  and  small  size  of  trade
being  done  there.    The  Board  examined  OTCEI’s  proposal  to  provide  a  trading
mechanism and price discovery for securities of public limited companies which are not
listed or traded as permitted securities on any exchange.  The proposal was made with the
objective of business expansion of the exchange.  Through the discussions, it was decided
that  only  qualified  participants  (QPs)  such  as  corporates/companies,  banks  and
individuals with a net worth of Rs 2.5 crore, will be allowed to trade on the market. The
scrips and the QPs will be selected by the exchange. The exchange will not guarantee the
settlement  of  trade.  The  securities  of  the  companies  will  be  listed  with  suitable
exemptions for which regulatory changes will be made. The above system will provide a
transparent  trading  platform  and  exit  opportunity  for  small  capital  companies,  venture
capital and private equity funds.

Negotiated deals

According to earlier guidelines of SEBI, all negotiated deals had to be reported to stock
exchanges within 15 minutes of trade negotiated and information in respect of such trades
was  disseminated  by  the  stock  exchanges.    A  negotiated  deal  was  defined  as  any
transaction which either has a value of Rs.25 lakh or volume traded not less than 10,000
shares  at  one  price  not  formed  through  the  stock  exchange  and  order  matching
mechanism.

In  order  to  introduce  transparency  and  price  discovery  in  negotiated  deals,  the  SEBI
issued guidelines that such transactions will be permitted only if they are executed on the
screen of exchange following the price and order matching mechanism of the exchanges
just like any other deals on stock exchanges.

Market making

The extensive reforms by the SEBI over the last two years have enhanced the integrity,
transparency  and  efficiency  of  operations  of  the  securities  market.  The  introduction  of
electronic trading and order matching system on all the 23 stock exchanges in the country
have reduced transaction costs and have enhanced transparency and efficiency in respect
of price discovery.  However, there are still a large number of scrips that are not actively
traded despite the fact that many of them have some intrinsic value. The Committee on

Page 28 of 17165

‘Market Making’  under the Chairmanship of Shri G.P. Gupta studied the various facets of
market  making,  including  the  merits  and  demerits  of  the  two  trading  systems,  viz.  the
order-driven system and the quote-driven system. As market makers are  obliged to offer
continuously two-way quotes; they have to carry an inventory of stocks, which implies
commitment to capital and exposure  to market risks.

New products and procedures

The securities lending scheme, 1997

The  Securities  Lending  Scheme  was  introduced  by  the  SEBI  in  1997.    The  securities
lending scheme provides for lending of securities through an approved intermediary to a
borrower under an agreement for a specified period.  The scheme facilitates the timely
delivery of securities which improves the efficiency of the settlement system and corrects
the  temporary  imbalances  between  demand  and  supply.    It  also  provides  for  the
mobilization  of  idle  stocks  in  the  hands  of  FIs,  FIIs,  Mutual  Funds  and  other  large
investors leading to additional income to the holder of securities.  The SEBI has already
given approval to six intermediaries to act as Stock Lenders.  The activity is however yet
to  pick  up  and  the  SEBI  is  continuously  discussing  with  the  market  participants  to
encourage the use of stock lending.  At present National Securities Clearing Corporation
Limited (NSCCL), registered as Intermediary under Stock Lending Scheme is providing
this  facility  to  the  members  of  National  Stock  Exchange  to  reduce  auction.    The
securities’  lending is expected to pick-up following the more scrips coming under Rolling
Settlement.

Committee on corporate governance

A committee on corporate governance set up by the SEBI under the chairmanship of Shri
Kumar  Mangalam  Birla,  member  SEBI  Board  with  the  objective  of  strengthening  and
promoting the standard of corporate governance of listed companies, had made several
recommendations. Corporate governance is an important tool of investor protection. This
would be the first formal code of corporate governance in the country through the listing
agreement.  It is expected that the introduction of these measures will raise the awareness
and make a good beginning for raising standard of functioning of corporate.  The SEBI
board accepted the recommendations of the committee followed by a notification issued
to the concern agencies.  The major recommendations of the committee accepted by the
board are presented in the Box 1.4 below.

Internet based securities trading

A Committee on internet based securities trading and services was set up by the SEBI to
develop  regulatory  parameters  for  use  of  internet  in  securities  business  and  effective
enforcement  of  internet  trading.    The  report  of  the  Committee  was  approved  by  the
Board.

The Board decided that  internet trading can take place in India within the existing legal
framework through the use of order-routing systems, which will route orders from clients
to brokers, for trade execution on registered stock exchanges. The Board also took note of
the  recommended  minimum  technical  standards  for  ensuring  safety  and  security  of
transactions between clients and  brokers which will be enforced by the respective stock
exchanges.

iii. Mutual Funds and Other Schemes

Mutual funds

In  consultation  with  the  Association  of  Mutual  Funds  of  India,  a  number  of  policy
decisions  were  taken  during  the  year  and  regulations  were  amended  accordingly.    The
necessary guidelines and details issued to the mutual funds are given below:

Prudential investment norms

Prudential investment norms were prescribed to ensure that the investment portfolios of
the  mutual  funds  are  diversified  to  reduce  the  inherent  risk  associated  with  such
investments.   Investments in equity related instruments of a single company have been

Page 31 of 17165

restricted to 10 per cent  of the NAV of a scheme with an exception for index funds and
sector/ industry specific schemes

Investment in investment grade rated debt instruments issued by a single issuer, should
not exceed 15 per cent  of NAV of the scheme. This limit may be extended to 20 per cent
of the NAV of the scheme with the prior approval of the Boards of AMC and trustees. In
case of unrated debt instruments, the investment in a single issuer shall not exceed 10 per
cent  of the NAV of the scheme and in case of such  debt instruments of all the issuers in
a scheme shall not exceed  25 per cent  of NAV subject to approval of Boards of AMC
and  trustee  company.  However,  these  restrictions  for  debt  instruments  will  not  be
applicable to  government securities and money market instruments.

As investment in unlisted shares is less liquid, such investments have been restricted  to a
maximum of 10 per cent  of the NAV of a scheme in case of close ended scheme. In case
of open-ended schemes the limit is made more stringent to 5 per cent  of the NAV of the
scheme as there is continuous repurchase by investors in such schemes and there is need
of liquidity.

Investment for ADRs /GDRs

With  a  view  to  expand  the  spectrum  of  investment  opportunities  available  to  mutual
funds,  measures  have  been  taken  to  permit  mutual  funds  to  enter  the  global  securities
market.  In  consultation  with  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and  the  Government  of  India,  the
mutual  funds  have  now  been  permitted  to  invest  in  overseas  securities.  Initially  this
facility has been extended to ADRs/GDRs  issued  by  Indian  companies  with  an  overall
cap of US$ 500 million with a sub ceiling of 10 per cent  of the net assets managed by
individual mutual funds and a maximum limit of US$ 50 million for each mutual fund.
The proposals of three mutual funds who  showed  interest  in  making  such  investments,
have been cleared.

Permitting derivatives trading

Mutual funds have been allowed to enter into derivatives transactions for the purpose of
hedging  and  portfolio  balancing.  Detailed  guidelines  on  the  procedures  to  be  followed
while entering into derivatives trading, have been issued.

Exit option for unit holders

With  a  purpose  to  give  more  flexibility  to  the  mutual  funds  for  the  operation  of  their
schemes and to streamline the procedures, the present requirement of  consent of 3/4th  of
the unitholders for any change in controlling interest of AMC or fundamental attributes
of a scheme has been done away with. Instead, in such cases,  the unitholders shall be
informed by way of individual communication as well as through advertisements in the
newspapers  of  the  proposed  modifications  and  the  unitholders  shall  be  given  option  to
exit at the prevailing NAV without paying any exit load.

Page 32 of 17165

Advertisement code

With  a  purpose  to  ensure  that  the  advertisements  issued  by  the  mutual  funds  are  not
misleading,  the  advertisement  code  has  been  amended  so  that  the  advertisement  on
performance is supported by relevant figures and such figures of NAV, yields or returns
are  given  for  the  past  three  years  wherever  applicable.  The  practice  of  selectively
reproducing  extracts  from  the  offer  document  which  could  be  misleading  in  the
advertisement is not allowed. Celebrities cannot be displayed in advertisements.

Portfolio management activities

As  the  Asset  management  companies  have  expertise  in  funds  management  and  as  they
represented  to  SEBI,  they  have  been  permitted  to  carry  out  portfolio  management
activities subject to certain conditions.

Improvement of disclosure standards

With a view to make unit holders aware of the securities in which the funds have been
invested  by  the  mutual  fund  and  to  enable  them  to  take  well  informed  investment
decisions,  it  has  been  made  mandatory  that  the  mutual  funds  should  send  to  all
unitholders a complete statement of the scheme portfolio before the expiry of one month
from the close of each half year.

For  easy  assessment  of  the  transactions  of  the  mutual  funds  with  the  associates  of  the
sponsor,  it  has  been  made  mandatory  for  the  mutual  funds  to  disclose  at  the  time  of
declaring half-yearly and yearly result (i) any underwriting obligations undertaken by the
schemes  of  the  mutual  funds  with  respect  to  issue  of  associate  companies,  (ii)
devolvement,  if  any,  (iii)  subscription  by  the  schemes  in  the  issues  lead  managed  by
associate companies (iv) subscription to any issue of equity or debt on  private placement
basis where the sponsor or its associate companies have acted as arranger/ manager.

Code of conduct

The code of conduct has been elaborated to include certain clauses pertaining to integrity,
due diligence, fairness in dealings etc which should be adhered to by the AMC and the
Trustees.

Implementation of P.K.Kaul committee recommendations

The committee recommended the manner of discharging responsibilities by the trustees.
The views of AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) and the trustees of mutual
funds were taken into consideration before implementing the same.  Board of Directors of
the  AMCs    will  now  have  to  play  more  important  role  in  the  compliance  process  and
reporting to trustees periodically in this regard. The manner in which due diligence shall
be carried out by the Trustees in fulfillment of the various obligations as required under
the  Regulations,  has  been  specified.  Trustees  can  appoint  independent  auditors  or  can

Page 33 of 17165

have separate full fledged administrative set up to give them support in discharging their
duties in accordance with the SEBI Regulations.

Trustees  shall  now  be  required  to  meet  more  frequently,  at  least  once  in  every  three
months and four such meetings to be held in a year. Also the quorum for such meetings
shall  require  the  presence  of  at  least  one  independent  trustee  /  director  who  is  not
associated with the sponsor.

Mutual funds advisory committee

During the year 1999-2000, a standing committee chaired by Shri B.G.Deshmukh was set
up  to  examine  the  emerging  trends  in  the  mutual  fund  industry  and  propose  suitable
amendments  to  the  Mutual  Funds  Regulations  for  promoting  healthy  growth  of  the
mutual fund industry. The committee met twice and made various recommendations.

Collective investment schemes (CIS)

The Government of India, vide its press release dated November 18, 1997, directed that
schemes  through  which  instruments  like  agro-bonds,  plantation  bonds  etc.  are  issued
would  be  treated  as  “Collective  Investment  Schemes”  coming  under  the  provisions  of
Sec.11 (2)c of the SEBI Act.

Pursuant to the Government directions, the SEBI vide its press release dated November
26, 1997 and its public notice dated December 18, 1997 directed under the provisions of
Sec. 11B read with Proviso to Section 12(1)(B) of the SEBI Act prohibited the entities
from  launching  any  fresh  schemes  till  such  time  as  the  regulations  for  collective
investment schemes are notified. The existing entities were also directed to file with the
SEBI the details of their schemes. The SEBI had received information from 642 entities
who had reportedly raised about Rs. 2681 crore.  Based on the information received from
investors and government agencies, it had come to the notice of the SEBI that 137 entities
may be operating Collective Investment Schemes without filing information with it.

In  order  to  frame  the  regulations  for  collective  investment  schemes,  a  committee  was
appointed  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Dr.  S.A.  Dave.  The  committee  comprised
representations  from  various  ministries  like  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of
Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Forestry,  Regulatory  bodies  like  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and
Department of Company Affairs, Professional representation from Institute of Chartered
Accountants  of  India,  Association  of  Merchant  Bankers  and  Mutual  Funds,  Investor
Association and representation from the Industry.

After  due  deliberations,  the  Committee  submitted  its  interim  report  and  the  draft
Regulations  of  Collective  Investment  Schemes  alongwith  the  recommendations  of  the
accounting sub committee to SEBI on December 31, 1998. These were made available
for  public  discussion  and  comments/suggestions  of  investors  and  the  entities  operating
collective  investment  schemes  were  invited.  The  Association  of  Agri  Plantation
Companies of India was also invited to make a presentation before the Committee on the

Page 34 of 17165

Industries’  views  on  the  draft  regulations.  The  Committee  considered  the  suggestions
received from all concerned and thereafter, submitted its final report to SEBI on April 5,
1999.

The  SEBI  Board  approved  the  Regulations  for  Collective  Investment  Schemes  in  its
meeting held on August 17, 1999.

The SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 were notified on October
15,  1999.    Henceforth,  no  person  other  than  a  Collective  Investment  Management
Company  which  has  obtained  a  certificate  of  registration  under  the  SEBI  (Collective
Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999, can carry on or sponsor or launch a collective
investment scheme.  Also, no existing collective investment scheme can launch any new
scheme  or  raise  money  from  the  investors  even  under  the  existing  schemes,  unless  a
certificate of registration is granted to it under the said regulations.

The Securities Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1999 had defined “Collective Investment
Scheme”  by inserting a new section 11AA in the SEBI Act, 1992.  On January 25, 2000
the  SEBI  Board  approved  amendment  to  the  SEBI  (Collective  Investment  Schemes)
Regulations,  1999  by  adopting  the  definition  of  collective  investment  scheme  as
introduced  by  the  said  Securities  Amendment  Act.    Further,  to  remove  doubt  or
technicalities,  if  any,  the  Board  also  adopted  the  CIS  Regulations  as  the  Regulations
made under the Amended Act.  On February 14, 2000 the SEBI (Collective Investment
Schemes) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 were notified in the Gazette of India.

Venture capital funds

Keeping in view the crucial role played by the venture capital in promoting innovation
research, scientific ideas and knowledge based enterprises, proper focus was given to the
area of venture capital regulation. The SEBI convened a meeting of the key persons and
professionals  associated  with  venture  capital  industry  in  India  on  May  19,  1999.  The
deliberation  of  the  meeting  was  to  identify  regulatory  and  other  issues  hampering  the
venture capital industry in India. It was  decided   that a Committee would be set up to
study    in  detail  all  the  issues  concerning  venture  capital  industry  and  suggest    policy
formation at the level of Government.

The  SEBI  set  up  a  committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  Shri  K  B  Chandrasekhar  of
Exodus  communication  Inc.,  USA.  The  committee  comprised  of  industry  participants,
professionals,  representatives from financial institutions and RBI. Four working groups
were formed  to look into the following areas :

1.  Articulation  of  vision  for  venture  capital  industry  in  India  including  creating  the

environment, research and industry linkage, support services and awareness.

2.  Structuring  of  venture  capital  fund  and  fund  raising  including  regulatory  and  legal

aspects

3.  Investment process and related issues and

4.  Exit  related  issues  including  possibility  of  trading  in  Unlisted  securities,  IPO  route

and valuation aspects.

committee 

through 

The  working  groups    deliberated  the  issues    and  submitted  their  recommendations  for
consideration  of  the  committee.  Overseas  participants  interacted  in  the  deliberations  of
the 
exchange  of  E-mails.  Draft
recommendations of the committee were submitted to SEBI on December 8, 1999 and
were immediately published for public comments. Based on the feedback received, the
report of the committee was finalised in the meeting held on January 8, 2000.

tele-conferencing  and 

The recommendations of the committee were widely appreciated and found acceptance
by the Government also. A high level meeting consisting of officials from MoF, DCA,
RBI,  SEBI  was  held  on  January  21,2000  at  the  Ministry  in  New  Delhi    to  discuss  the
recommendations of the committee  particularly regarding the   harmonisation of   the
regulatory framework for  the venture capital funds and  the taxation issues.

The Board  of SEBI,  on January 25, 2000, approved in principle the recommendations of
the committee. The main recommendations of the committee are as under:

1.  Multiplicity of regulations – need for harmonisation and single regulator:

Presently there are three set of  Regulations dealing with venture capital activity i.e. SEBI
(Venture  Capital  Regulations)  1996,  Guidelines 
for  Overseas  Venture  Capital
Investments issued by Department of Economic Affairs in the MOF in the year 1995 and
CBDT Guidelines for Venture Capital Companies in 1995 which were modified in 1999.
The need is to consolidate and substitute all these with one single regulation of SEBI to
provide for uniform, hassle free single window clearance.

2.  Tax pass through for venture capital funds:

Once registered with SEBI, Venture Capital Funds should be entitled to automatic tax
pass through at the pool level while maintaining taxation at the investor level without any
other requirement under Income Tax Act.

3.  Mobilisation of global and domestic resources:

(A)  Foreign venture capital investors (FVCIs):

FVCIs should be allowed to register with SEBI and having once registered, they
should have the  facility of hassle free investments and disinvestments without
any requirement for approval from FIPB / RBI.

(B)   Augmenting the domestic pool of resources:

Banks,  mutual  funds  and  insurance  companies  should  also  be  permitted  to
invest in Venture Capital Funds upto a prudential limit.

Page 36 of 17165

4.  Flexibility in investment and exit:

(A)  Allowing multiple flexible structures:

Eligibility  for  registration  as  venture  capital  funds  should  be  neutral  to  firm
structure.  The  government  should  consider  creating  new  structures,  such  as
limited  partnerships, 
liability
corporations.

liability  partnerships  and 

limited 

limited 

(B)  Flexibility in the matter of investment ceiling and sectoral restrictions:

According to the committee recommendations, 75 per cent of a venture capital
fund’s investible  funds  must  be  invested  in  unlisted  equity  or  equity-linked
instruments,  while  the  rest  may  be  invested  in  other  instruments.    Sectoral
restrictions for investment by VCFs could be put by specifying a negative list
which could include areas such as finance companies, real estate, gold-finance,
activities not legally permitted and any other sectors which could be notified by
the  SEBI  in  consultation  with  the  Government.    Investments  by  VCFs  in
associated companies should also not be permitted.  Further, not more than 25
per cent  of a fund’s corpus may be invested in a single firm.

(C)  Changes in buy-back requirements for unlisted securities:

A venture capital fund incorporated as a company/ venture capital undertaking
should  be allowed to buyback upto 100 per cent  of its paid up capital out of
sale proceeds investments and  assets and not necessarily  out of its free reserves
and share premium account or proceed of fresh issue. Such purchases will be
exempt from the SEBI takeover code.   A venture-financed undertaking will be
allowed  to  make  an  issue  of  capital  within  6  months  of  buying  back  its  own
shares  instead  of  24  months  as  at  present.  Further,  negotiated  deals  may  be
permitted  in  Unlisted  securities  where  one  of  the  party  to  the  transaction  is
VCF.

(D)  Relaxation in IPO norms:

The requirement of a 3 year track record should be relaxed provided the issuer
company  has  received  at  least  10  per  cent    of  its  capital  as  funding  from  a
registered venture capital fund similar to existing provision of funding by banks
or financial institutions.

(E)  QIB market for unlisted securities:
         A market for trading in unlisted securities by QIBs be developed.

(F)  NOC requirement :

In  the  case  of  transfer  of  securities  by  VCF  to  any  other  person,  the
requirement of obtaining NOC from joint venture partner or other shareholders
should be dispensed with.

Page 37 of 17165

(G)  RBI pricing norms:

At present, investment/disinvestment by FVCI is subject to approval of pricing
by RBI  which curtails operational flexibility and needs to be dispensed with.

5.  Global integration and opportunities:

(A)  Incentives for employees:

The limits for overseas investment  under the Employee Stock Option Scheme
of a foreign company should be raised from present ceilings of  US$10,000 over
5 years, and US$50,000 over 5 years for ADRs/GDRs, to a common ceiling of
US$100,000  over  5  years.        Foreign  employees  of  an  Indian  company  may
invest in the Indian company to a ceiling of US$100,000 over 5 years.

(B)  Incentives for shareholders:

The shareholders of an Indian company that has venture capital funding and is
desirous  of  swapping  its  shares  with  that  of  a  foreign  company  should  be
permitted to do so.

(C)  Global 

investment  opportunity 

for  domestic  venture  capital 

funds

(DVCF):
DVCFs  should    be  permitted  to  invest  higher  of  25  per  cent    of  the  fund’s
corpus or US $10 million or to the extent of foreign contribution in the fund’s
corpus  in  unlisted  equity    or  equity-linked  investments  of  a  foreign  company.
Such investments will fall within the overall ceiling of 70 per cent  of the fund’s
corpus.  This  will  allow  DVCFs  to  invest  in  synergistic  startups  offshore  and
also provide them with global management exposure.

In the meeting of  High Level Committee  on Capital Markets held at RBI on January 31,
2000 recommendations related to RBI were discussed.

The Hon’ble  Finance  Minister  in  his  budget  speech  for  the  year  2000-2001  announced
that SEBI would be single point nodal regulator for registration and regulation of both
domestic and overseas venture capital fund/company. He also stated that no approval of
Venture Capital Funds by tax authorities would be required and that the principle of “pass
through”  would be applied in tax treatment of Venture Capital Funds.

The SEBI is now in the process of amending the Venture Capital Fund regulations in the
light of  K B Chandrasekhar Committee report and also the budget announcements where
some important recommendations have been accepted by the government.

Derivative trading

The  Securities  Law  (Amendment)  Act  1999,  was  passed  by  the  Parliament  and
notification  was  issued  on  December  16,  1999,  'derivatives'  are  now  included  in  the
definition of "securities" under SC(R) Act. "Derivatives" has been defined as contracts
which derives value form prices, or index of prices of underlying securities.

Page 38 of 17165

In-principle approval was granted on January 17, 2000 to the Futures & Options segment
of NSE, its clearing house i.e. Futures & Options Segment of NSCCL and the Derivative
Segment  of  BSE.  The  in-principle  approval  was  subject  to  compliance  with  the
conditions of eligibility recommended by Dr. L.C Gupta Committee.

On February 1, 2000 SEBI issued guidelines for participation by Mutual Funds in trading

Primary market

Merchant bankers, underwriters  and portfolio managers

In December 1997 Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) registered with RBI were
debarred  from  seeking  registration  as  merchant  bankers.    However  merchant  bankers
were  permitted  to  carry  on  activities  of  primary  dealers  in  government  securities.
Accordingly,  SEBI  Merchant  Bankers  Regulations  were  also  amended  to  treat  NBFCs
registered  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  for  the  specific  purpose  of  carrying  on
activities  of  primary  dealers  as  eligible  for  registration  as  merchant  bankers  with  the

framework  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  regulation  described  above.  The  SEBI  has
always  endeavoured  to  harmonise  the  SEBI  regulations  and  guidelines  with  these
principles  in  order  to  conform  to  global  standards.  These  principles  are  grouped  into
eight  categories,  which  along  with  their  respective  implementation  status  are  given  in

vii.  Assessment and Prospects

The capital market in India has undergone a rapid transformation.  The introduction of
internet trading, rolling settlement, abolition of par value system and entry of information
technology  companies  would  further  help  the  expansion  of  securities  market.    The
reforms  already  introduced  by  the  SEBI  encompass  a  wide  range  of  issues  in  the
securities  market.    But  there  is  a  need  for  continuous  efforts  to  bring  about  further
transformation  and  improvement  in  its  infrastructure  and  microstructure  so  that  the
market becomes safer, fair, efficient, competitive and attractive for investors, issuers and
institutions.

PART II

REVIEW OF THE TRENDS AND WORKING OF THE SECURITIES
MARKETS

A] PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

Capital raised during 1999-2000

During the financial year 1999-2000, investment activity in the primary market acquired
fresh momentum as the total funds mobilised increased by about 40 per cent during this
year  as  compared  to  a  rise  of  22  per  cent  during  1998-99.  In  absolute  terms,  the  total
funds  mobilised  through  93  issues  rose  to  Rs.7,817  crore  during  1999-2000  from
Rs.5,586 crore through 58 issues during the previous year.  There was a significant rise of
the share of rights isssues compared with the previous year. While during 1998-99, rights
issues  reported  a  decline  over  the  previous  year  by  67  per  cent,  in  1999-2000,  they
recorded an exponential growth nearly 175 per cent over the previous year. The public
and rights issues contributed 80 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, of the total capital
raised  as  against  90  per  cent  and  10  per  cent,  respectively  in  1998-99.    There  was
therefore  a  higher  resource  mobilisation  by  the  companies  from  their  existing
shareholders  largely  on  the  basis  of  their  quality  of  results  and  profit  performance  and
market capitalisation.  There has been a decline in average size of an issue in the year
under  review  due  to  issues  of  small  size  by  engineering,  textiles,  food  processing  and
information technology companies.  The share of banks and financial institutions in total
resources  raised  declined  to  about  52  per  cent  during  1999-2000  from  84.8  per  cent
during the previous year, indicating an increase in direct intermediation between the users
and  savers  and  fall  in  intermediation  of  banks  and  financial  institutions.  An  equally
important  development  was  the  mobilisation  of  resources  by  the  new  economy  stocks,
especially by the information technology sector, which alone had a share of more than 20
per cent in the total funds mobilised.  Several factors enumerated below have contributed
and accelerated the growth of primary investment.

1.  Real  economic  variables  have  impact  on  the  investment  activity  in  the  primary
market.    The  recovery  in  industrial  growth  during  1999-2000  and  exhausting
production  capacities  in  the  industry  have  been  necessitating  further  expansion  of
industrial capacities thereby inducing the companies to mobilise resources for further
investment in future.  Thus, the year of 2000-01 may see the impact of this trend on
demand for capital goods.

2.  The  buoyancy  of  the  secondary  market  leading  to  all-round  rise    in  share  prices,
induced  the  investors  to  put  higher  amount  of  their  saving  in  investment  in  the
primary market.

3.  The fiscal incentives given to investors in schemes of mutual funds and reduction in
capital gains tax attracted investors in the primary market.  The mutual funds have

Page 65 of 17165

been  the  bulk  investor  in  equity  shares  during  1999-2000.    Relaxation  in  the
requirement  of  25  per  cent  of  issue  of  a  company  to  the  public  to  10  per  cent  for
knowledge based companies, fiscal incentives by the Government resulted in spurt in
issue activity of these companies sharing more than 20 per cent of capital compared
to just 3 per cent during the previous year.

4.  On-going process of improving the quality of issues and tightening of norms relating

to merchant bankers and CRAs probably created more confidence in the investors.

Of the 93 issues during 1999-2000, 28 were rights issues which entered the market for
raising Rs.1,560 crore while during 1998-99, 26 issues out of 58 issues were rights issues
for  Rs.567crore.    In  all,  65  public  issues  entered  the  market  for  raising  Rs.6,256  crore
during 1999-2000 while during 1998-99, 32 public issues raised Rs.5,019 crore.  In terms
of  percentage  increase,  public  issues  were  higher  by  about  25  per  cent  whereas  rights
issues nearly tripled from Rs.567 crore during 1998-99 to Rs.1560 crore (an increase of
175 per cent)  during  the  year  under  review.    Exponential  growth  in  the  amount  raised
through rights issues thus resulted in a rise of the share of rights issues from 10per cent to
20  per  cent  reflecting  that  the  issuers  are  increasingly  relying  on  their  existing
shareholders  to  meet  requirement  of  additional  capital  for  growth  or  diversification  of
their business activities (Table 2.1).

Month-wise trends in capital mobilisation

Analysis of monthly data on capital mobilisation through offer documents filed with the
SEBI, during 1999-2000 reveals that more than half of the capital was raised during the
second half of the year.  The bulk of the capital was raised during July, September and
October-1999 and February-2000 (Table 2.2).

While  offer  documents  indicate  the  intentions  for  future  investment  and  outlook  for
growth, the actual amount and number of issues cleared by the SEBI would reveal the
likelihood  and  possibility  of  actual  investment  in  future  by  the  corporates.    Even  the
mobilisation  of  resources  by  the  financial  institutions,  though  not  direct  users  of
resources,  indicate  future  prospects  of  investment  demand  projected  by  them.      Thus
during 1999-2000, 165 offer documents were received for raising Rs.8,967 crore and 125
documents were cleared for Rs.12,025 crore as compared to 60 documents received for
Rs.4,802 crore and 55 offer documents cleared for Rs.1,803 crore, respectively, during
1998-99. The high increase in the amount cleared by the SEBI for issues indicates that
investment activity in the primary market would further improve during the year 2000-
2001 (Table 2.3)

Trends in size and composition of issues

The year of 1999-2000 showed divergent trends in size of issues entering the market as
compared  to  the  last  year.    The  number  of  large  issues  during  the  current  year  under
review was higher at 19 for mobilising Rs.6,034 crore as compared to 11 issues during
the previous year for Rs.4,611crore.  The FI’s which were major issuers in this segment
accounted for 65 per cent during the current financial year as compared to a higher share
of  96  per  cent  during  the  previous  year.    This  decline  was  possible  due  to  entry  of  7
corporate issues mobilising nearly 35 per cent of the total capital during 1999-2000. Of
the  19  mega  issues,  8  were  equity  issues  for  Rs.2,884 crore or 48 per cent of the total
amount raised during the year under review as compared to 1 equity issue of Rs.161 crore
or just 3.5 per cent during the previous year.  It is noticed that on an average, the size of
amount per issue declined from Rs.419 crore during 1998-99 to Rs.317 crore during the
current year under review due to issues of relatively lower size by corporates than those
by the financial institutions.

Of  the  FIs,  ICICI  collected  Rs.2,375  crore  followed  by  the  IDBI  at  Rs.1,050  crore.

Trends in listed and IPO issues

During 1999-2000, the listed companies mobilised Rs.5,098 crore through 42 issues as
compared with Rs.5,182 crore  mobilised through 40 issues during 1998-99 registering a
marginal  decline  of  nearly  2  per  cent.  However,  there  was  a  marked  increase  in  the
number of IPOs during 1999-2000 to 51 from 18 IPOs issues during 1998-99.  In terms
of amount, IPOs mobilised Rs.2,719 crore during 1999-2000 as compared to an amount
of Rs.404 crore during 1998-99.

The  rapid  increase  in  IPOs  and  their  successful  subscription  indicate  the  restored
willingness  and  confidence  of  investors  to  invest  in  new  companies  especially  in  the
knowledge  based  industries  particularly  in  information  technology  and  healthcare
companies which came to the market in a big way. This is also a world wide trend. As
expected, the average size of an issue of IPO was Rs.53 crore, smaller than the average
size of Rs.121 crore for listed companies during 1999-2000 because of a larger number of
small size new companies entering the market. In terms of percentage, IPOs accounted
for 35 per cent during 1999-2000 as compared to a share of 7 per cent during 1998-99.
Rise in the share of IPOs is a testimony to the fact that investment pattern is changing
towards young entrepreneurs with new concepts and latest technology.  The entry of new
companies with IPOs on an accelerated rate would provide fresh equity for trading in the
secondary market (Table 2.7).

Sector-wise analysis of capital mobilisation

IPOs

Listed

As observed in the last year’s Report, during 1999-2000 also, private sector companies
were  on  top  in  mobilising  the  resources.  A  total  amount  of  Rs.7,603  crore  through  90
issues  was  mobilised  by  the  companies  in  the  private  sector  during  1990-2000  which
formed 97 per cent of total capital mobilised as compared to Rs.5,483 crore through 55
issues accounting for 98 per cent during 1998-99.  Joint sector floated only one issue of
Rs.14 crore, whereas public sector raised Rs.200 crore through 2 issues during 1999-2000
as against 2 issues for Rs.33 crore by the joint sector and 1 issue for Rs.70 crore by the
public sector during 1998-99. The resource mobilisation was primarily dominated by the
private sector (Table 2.8).

Appraisal of issues and their trends

Issue appraising business has shown declining trend over the recent years.  During 1997-
98, 34 out of 111 issues forming 30 per cent of total issues were appraised and 77 were
not appraised.  In 1998-99, the share of number of appraised issues declined to 26 per
cent.  In terms of numbers only 15 issues were appraised out of 58 issues and 43 issues
were not appraised.  During 1999-2000, in terms of numbers of issues only 16.1 per cent
of issues were appraised and 84 percent issues were unappraised or they did not require
any  appraisal.    Thus  less  and  less  number  of  issues  need  appraisal  possibly  due  to
improvement  in  their  disclosures,  transparency  and  performance.    The  lesser  need  for
appraisal  is  the  result  of  efforts,  which  have  been  taken  by  the  SEBI  in  continuously
introducing  disclosure  norms.    It  is  expected  that  application  of  corporate  governance
guidelines issued by the SEBI and accounting norms prescribed by the SEBI as per the
international standard, will further improve the quality of issues (Table 2.9).

Firm allotment of institutional investors

The  amounts  allotted  on  the  basis  of  firm  allotment  /  reservation  totaled  Rs.202  crore
during  1999-2000  compared  with  Rs.142  crore  during  the  previous  year.    Of  the  total
capital raised through firm allotment, during 1999-2000, NRIs got the highest share of
Rs.75 crore followed by promoters with Rs.48 crore, employees with Rs.34 crore, others
with  Rs.16  crore,  FIs  with  Rs.16  crore  and  mutual  funds  with  Rs.11  crore.    The  FIIs
raised  only  about  Rs.1crore,  whereas  money  market  funds  could  not  mobilise  any
amount.  During 1998-99, on the other hand, the highest share went to promoters with
Rs.58  crore,  followed  by  the  NRIs  with  Rs.33.83  crore  and  FIIs  with  Rs.22.86  crore

Industry-wise analysis of resource mobilisation

Industry-wise  breakup  of  capital  raised  in  1999-2000  reveals  directional  change  in  the
industrial  diversification  and  its  growth  in  the  country  and  perceptions  of  the
entrepreneurs  of  future  challenges.  It  is  of  utmost  importance  to  see  that  global
development has impacted the structure of industry.  Global demand for Indian software
technology has brought change in investment pattern in the country.   It also indicates the
priorities  and  allocation  of  resources  on  the  basis  of  market  forces  and  efficiency
consideration. As during the past few years and during 1999-2000 also, the banks and FIs
continued to lead in resource mobilisation at Rs.4,038 crore through 15 issues or 52 per
cent of the total capital raised compared to a share of 84.8 per cent during the previous
year. It is further observed that the top five industries namely banking/FIs, information
technology,  health  care,  cement  and  construction  and  electronics  together  mobilised
Rs.6,710 crore during 1999-2000.  A feature of resource mobilisation among them is that
share of banks and FIs declined and that of companies relating to real sector increased in
comparison  to  the  position  in  1998-99.    This  change  reflects  higher  level  of
disintermediation  in  financing  the  industry,  which  in  turn  implies  reduction  in  cost  of
finance and better performance of industry to qualify for higher level of resources from

Page 74 of 17165

the  market  based  on  assessment  of  investors  and  market  forces.    Industry-wise  details
provide  that  following  banks/FI,  information  and  technology  industry  was  on  top
mobilising Rs.1,547crore (20 per cent) followed by health care with Rs.575 crore (7per
cent), cement and construction Rs.337 crore (4per cent), electronics Rs.213 crore (3 per
cent),  chemicals  Rs.181crore  (2  per  cent),  entertainment  industry  Rs.129  crore  (2  per
cent) and packaging Rs164 crore (2 per cent).  Telecom and power also entered market
each with 1 issue of Rs.15 crore and Rs.75 crore, respectively.  Other industries shared
less  than  1  per  cent.  The  knowledge  based  industries  have  made  their  presence  felt
effectively  and  could  dominate  the  primary  market  during  the  forthcoming  years.    The
mushrooming  growth  of  issues  by  new  economy  companies  however,  warrants
continuous  watch  on  their  transactions  and  functions.    Similarly,  venture  capital
companies which are likely to enter the market in future, will need to be closely watched
by the SEBI (Table 2.11).

4  banks  namely  Centurion  Bank  Ltd.,  Bank  of  Rajasthan,  Syndicate  Bank  and  Times
Bank  came  out  with  equity  issues  probably  to  meet  their  equity  capital  requirement,
ICICI came out with 6 bond issue and one equity issue.  The IFCI made one rights issue
(Table 2.12).

Region-wise analysis of capital mobilisation

As  regards  region-wise  mobilisation  of  capital,  the  Western  region  raised  the  highest
amount (Rs.5,234 crore or 67 per cent) followed by Northern region (Rs.1,900 crore or
24 per cent), Southern region (Rs.577 crore or 7 per cent) and the Eastern region (Rs.105
crore or 1per cent).   The region-wise distribution is determined by the extent of industrial
development (Table 2.13).

Instrument-wise analysis of capital raised

Instrument-wise  breakup  shows  investors’  preference  for  different  types  of  instruments
available  in  the  primary  market.    During  1999-2000,  the  equity  issues  were  on  top  at
Rs.4,566 crore  (58 per cent) as compared to Rs.857 crore (15 per cent) during 1998-99.
Details  of  equity  issues  reveal  that  premium  issues  have  been  receiving  attention  of
investors accounting for nearly half (48 per cent) of the total amount as compared to par
issues  amounting  to  Rs.786  crore  (about  10  per  cent)  during  the  year  under  review.
During  1998-99,  while  equity  premium  was  Rs.  660  crore  (12  per  cent),  the  equity
without premium at Rs. 197.04 crore contributed only 4 per cent.  Meanwhile bonds too
contributed  a  substantial  share  at  41  per  cent  during  1999-2000  as  against  a  share  of
around 80 per cent in 1998-99.  There was only one fully convertible debenture and one
partially  convertible  debenture  issued  for  Rs.21  crore,  and  Rs.30  crore,  respectively
during 1999-2000.  During 1998-99, the corporate issued 5 fully convertible debentures
for Rs 187 crore.  The analysis thus suggests that corporate financing is going through
structural change.  Financing through debt is substituting the equity financing probably
encouraged by the comparative cost advantage (Table 2.14).

Underwriting of issues

During the year under review, underwriting activity increased substantially probably due
to large number of issues of IPOs.   Thus in 1999-2000, 18 issues were underwritten for
Rs.2,257crore and 47 issues for Rs.4,000 crore were not underwritten as compared to 7
issues  underwritten  for  Rs.227  crore  and  25  issues  not  underwritten  for  Rs.4,791crore,
respectively,  during  1998-99.    Of  the  total  amount  of  Rs.6,257  crore,  the  underwritten
amount constituted 36 per cent in 1999-2000 as compared to a meagre 5 per cent in the
previous financial year (Table 2.15).

Subscription of primary issues

During 1999-2000 of 65 public issues for which data are available, 12 issues were
subscribed less than twice and 12 issues were subscribed more than twice and less
than 5 times.  It is interesting to note that 7 issues were subscribed more than 100
times  and  10  issues  were  subscribed  more  than  50  times  and  less  than  100  times.
Thus over subscription was on the high side during 1999-2000 than that during 1998-
99 (Table 2.16).

B] SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

Price behaviour in the secondary securities market during 1999-2000

The year 1999-2000 was marked by a smart recovery and strong spurt in equity prices.
During the larger part of the year, the equity market registered upward movement.  The
BSE Sensex on point to point basis recorded a growth of 34 per cent from 3739 as on
March 31, 1999 to 5001 as on March 31, 2000.  The BSE-100 (Natex) also shot up by 76
per cent from 1651 to 2902 during the same period.  On the other hand, S&PCNX Nifty
increased by 42 per cent. During 1997-98 and 1998-99 BSE Sensex, BSE 100 and NSE
50 all had shown downward trend for most of the part of these two years.  The rise in the
equity prices did not confine only to blue chip companies but the scrips in Group B also
participated  in  the  rally  on  number  of  occasions.  The  industries,  which  were  the  top
performer included information technology and pharmaceuticals (Table 2.17).

The  performance  of  stocks  prices  was  not  linear  during  the  year  as  shown  by  the
movement of daily indices.  In the beginning of year under review, the BSE Sensex was
in the grip of bearish phase following the presentation of the Union Budget 1999-2000
presented at the end of February 1999.  The BSE Sensex which stood at 3686 as on April
1,  1999  gradually  dipped  to  3272  by  April  28,  1999  on  account  of  massive  selling
pressure by the market operators due to the neutrality of Union Budget to stock market,
followed  by  a  pickup  which  continued  till  May  1999  and  closed  at    4123  on  May  19,
2000.  The market came under pressure, which was reflected in deceleration of the share

Page 79 of 17165

prices and somewhat erratic movement.  It was only from the middle of June 1999 the
stocks market regained appreciation. The BSE Sensex moved northward from 4125 as on
June  17,  1999  to  4728  on  July  22,  1999  possibly  due  to  increase  in  net  investment  by
FIIs.  The stock prices though reflected firming up trends thereafter but were in the high
phase of bullishness only from January 2000 when the BSE Sensex touched 5375 as on
January 3, 2000.   The Sensex continued to push upwards and touched the highest level of
the year at 5933 as on February 11, 2000 and thereafter it started sliding down slowly and
reached    5000  as  on  March  31,  2000.    The  spurt  in  stock  prices  was  to  some  extent
assisted by massive inflow of funds by FIIs and mutual funds.  FIIs’  net investment in
January and February, 2000 was of the order of US $ 750 million. Downward movement
of  Sensex  which  ruled  through  the  month  of  March  was  because  of  poor  market
sentiments  following  the  Union  Budget  2000-01  bearing  a  neutrality  to  market.    The
S&PCNX Nifty movement also reflected the same pattern during the year.

Analysis  of  shares  indices  on  monthly  average  basis  shows  gains  in  the  first  seven
months of the year rising from 3449 in April 1999 to 4835in October 1999 at the rate of
40  per  cent  and  a  dip  in  November  2000  to  4588.    The  fall  in  November  1999  was
reversed with robust growth to 4802 in December 1999.  The equity market since then
did not look back for the remaining part of the financial year and continued to gain new
heights till it reached 5650 by February 2000 before sliding to 5261.77 in March 2000.
The  monthly  index  movement  of  the  S&P  CNX  Nifty  almost  presented  the  same
behaviour.  During the month of November 1999, the fall in Sensex as well as S&P CNX
Nifty  and  other  indices  occurred  inspite  of  large  net  purchases  by  FIIs.    The  net
investment of FIIs during November was US$ 299 million as against a  disinvestment of
US$ 140 million in October 1999.  In March 2000, also there was a deceleration in the
equity prices as Sensex fell from 5650 in February 2000 to 5261in March 2000. Similarly
S&PCNX  Nifty  also  dipped  from  1686  to  1605.    The  analysis  of  monthly  averages  of
indices reveals that during the month of November and March inspite of bulk investment
of  FIIs  and  mutual  funds,  equity  prices  suffered  decline  indicating  that  there  are  other

Page 80 of 17165

players who also influence the trend in the equity prices.  It would be interesting to note
that  often  stock  prices  exhibit  unpredictable  movement  due  to  entry  and  exit  of  new
individual  investors  and  small  institutions  in  the  market.    The  population  of  small
investors has shown marked increase during the recent past.  These investors after having
reversal during 1996-97 to 1998-99, are again returning to the market to invest on short-
term  basis  most  probably  to  book  profits  and  avoid  risk  on  medium  term  investment
(Table 2.18).

Relative strength index

The  analysis  of  movement  of  share  index  can  also  be  made  on  the  basis  of  Relative
Strength  Index  (RSI)  which  studies  the  relative  strength  of  stocks  prices  in  relation  to
their previous positions.  RSI of Sensex for the period 1999-2000 (April-March) mostly
hovered  within  the  equilibrium  territory  of    30  to  70.  The  standard  parameters  in  RSI
analysis are:
overbought territory = above 70
equilibrium territory = 30 to 70 and
oversold territory = below 30

Over  the  financial  year  1999-2000,  the  RSI  of  both  the  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty
witnessed sharp upturns as well as downward movements but remained largely inside the
equilibrium territory (  range  30  –  70).  A  case  in  point  is  the  movement  of  RSI  during
March  2000  for  Sensex  and  Nifty  as  well.  During  this  month  RSI  for  both  the  indices
continuously  manifested  to  and  fro  movements  mostly  forming  new  tops  and  bottoms.
Despite  such  swings  the  RSI  remained  contained  within  the  equilibrium  territory.
Extreme  movements  during  the  period  into  overbought  /oversold  territories  have  been
few and far between. This portends well for the Indian markets as it possibly indicates
more of secular trends ruling the market in the long run allaying fears of any persisting
excessive volatility. (Annexures 3 & 4)

A  number  of  factors  have  influenced  the  stock  prices.  The  robust  trend  in  stock  prices
during 1999-2000 interalia includes various incentives given in the Union Budget 1999-
2000, large investment by FIIs of the order of US$ 2.34 billion and heavy net purchases
by  mutual  funds  following  their  massive  resource  mobilisation.    The  downward
movement  of  interest  rate  structure  on  bank  deposits  and  low  returns  on  short-term
government securities also shifted investment resources towards equity market. In other
countries  also  fall  in  deposit  rates  has  diverted  funds  towards  equity  investment.  As  a
result, the proportion of household savings invested in equities particularly has risen to

Page 82 of 17165

£
around  2.4  percent  in  1998-99  from  2.0  percent  in  1997-98.  The  sentiments  of  the
investors and traders were also boosted by information technology industry.  The boom
on  NASDAQ  also,  has  been  on  a  number  of  occasion  instrumental  through  the  Indian
companies listed on it, to boost the sentiments of Indian domestic players in the market.
As regards macro economic fundamentals, exchange rate stability, high level of foreign
exchange reserves and increase in growth of exports have strengthened the confidence of
FIIs in the Indian domestic market. On top of all factors, increased in liquidity (M3 or
Broad Money Supply) in 1998-99 might have also contributed to overall firming up trend
in stocks prices through time lag.  It has been established in various studies that broad
money (M3) has impact on economic variables up-to 1 year (Table 2.20).

traded,  is  an  important  component  in  the  measurement  of  the  stock  market  size  and
liquidity.  The liquidity allows investors to alter their portfolios quickly and cheaply and
make investment less risky.  The secondary market continued to grow vigorously as the
average daily turnover at BSE and NSE rose from Rs.2,071 crore and Rs.2,606 crore in
March 1999 to Rs.4,050 crore and Rs.5,028 crore in March 2000.  In terms of percentage,
the  rise  was  195  per  cent  and  193  per  cent,  respectively.  On  the  BSE  percentage  of
turnover to market capitalisation was 7.2 per cent at end-March 1999 which, increased to
9.3  per  cent  at  end-March  2000.  However,  the  turnover  as  a  percentage  of  market
capitalisation at NSE declined from 11.7 per cent at end-March 1999 to 10.3 per cent at
end-March 2000.

Trends in market capitalisation

The market capitalisation which is an indicator of generation of wealth of the investors,
sharply  increased  at  both  the  major  stock  exchanges  namely  NSE  and  BSE  from  Rs.
4,45,380  crore  and  Rs.  4,88,229  crore  in  April  1999  to  Rs.10,20,426  crore  and
Rs.9,12,842 crore in March 2000 respectively showing a growth of more than 100 per
cent.  The market capitalisation as a ratio of GDP worked out to 73 per cent for NSE and
65 per cent for BSE.  However it would be seen that market capitalisation shows high
concentration.  For instance market capitalisation of Sensex scrips was about 49 per cent
of total market capitalisation at BSE whereas for S&P CNX Nifty scrips the ratio was
about 38 per cent.  The high concentration of the turnover as well as market capitalisation
shows that there are large number of companies which are traded or not traded for less
than 10 days in a year.

Market capitalisation and turnover of new economy stocks

The  new  economy  stocks  have  shown  rapid  increase  in  their  market  capitalisation  and
turnover  during  the  recent  past.  The  contribution  of  new  economy  sector  to  market
capitalisation of Sensex increased from 8 per cent in January 1998 (through one stock-
MTNL) to 29 per cent in March 2000 (through 3 stocks-MTNL, Infosys Technologies,
NIIT).

Infosys and NIIT some of the actively traded new economy stocks were included in the
Sensex in November 1998.  The increase in relative importance of these stocks in market
capitalisation  has  been  seen  from  October  1999  when  technology  and  media  /
entertainment sectors were on a bullish trend.

Similarly in the BSE 500 which is more broadbased, new economy stocks contributed to
as high as 49 percentage share of the market capitalisation of BSE 500 in March 2000 as
compared to 18 – 21 per cent during the first few months after construction of the BSE
500 in February 1999.

Page 84 of 17165

The effect of the recent bullish trend for the technology sector stocks is more pronounced
on BSE 500 than the Sensex.  On an average this sector contributes 50 per cent of the
average daily turnover of the BSE 500; as its peak this had reached 75 per cent in March
2000.  For the Sensex the contribution of turnover of this sector to total Sensex turnover
meandered from 2 per cent with only one stock MTNL to 18 in October 1999 and then to
a high of 27 per cent in January 2000.

Trading pattern of listed companies

Though, market capitalisation of listed companies in India has shown exponential growth
during  the  current  year  under  review,  very  few  companies  are  traded  on  the  stock
exchanges.  Alternatively, trading in stocks in India concentrate on a limited number of
companies.    Trading  pattern  of  companies  listed  at  BSE  provides  interesting  reading
(Table 2.21).

The percentage of companies traded on the stock exchange, Mumbai was very low at 37
per cent in April 1999.  It is observed that of 7383 listed companies only 2719 companies
were traded. Though the number of traded companies increased to 3318 but it amounted
to only 41 per cent of the total listed companies in March 2000.  The detailed analysis is
more  still  revealing.    Trading  is  only  on  nominal  basis  in  quite  a  large  number  of
companies which is reflected from the fact that companies in which trading took place for
1 to 10 trade days during 1999-2000, constituted nearly 56 per cent of 8020 companies or
nearly  65  per  cent  of  companies  were  traded  for  1  to  40  days.  Only  23  per  cent  were
traded for 100 days and above. Thus, it would be seen that during the year under review a
major portion of the companies was hardly traded. The SEBI had appointed a Committee
on  Market  Making  with  the  objective  to  revive  the  less  traded  companies.  The

Page 85 of 17165

recommendation  of  the  Committee  have  been  accepted  and  the  guidelines  have  been
issued to that effect (Table 2.22).

Movement in volatility

SEBI  continued  to  minimise  and  contain  the  volatility  in  the  prices  of  equity  shares
during the year under review.  It took number of measures by imposing volatility margins
and applying circuit filters to keep the market in orderly movement.  These measures had
salutary  impact  on  the  volatile  behaviour  of  the  shares  prices.  The  BSE  Sensex  which
exhibited a volatile movement in April 1999 with a volatility of 3 per cent improved its
performance  as  its  volatility  declined  over  the  year  to  1.72  per  cent  in  March  2000.
Natex more or less reflected the downward trend as the volatility in this case slid down
from 3.09 per cent in April 1999 to 2.23 per cent in March 2000.  It is interesting to note
that  Sensex  volatility  during  1999-2000  was  lower  than  that  observed  during  1998-99.
Whereas,  Natex  volatility  showed  rising  trend  during  February  2000  but  declined  in
March 2000.  Table 2.24 also presents volatility movement of S&P CNX Nifty and CNX
Junior Nifty indices which though exhibited falling trend in their volatility from 3.35 per
cent  in  April  1999  to  1.8  per  cent  in  March  2000  their  level  was  much  lower  in  the
current  year  than  that  in  the  past  year.    CNX  Junior  Nifty  also  depicted  the  same
behaviour (Table 2.23 and 2.24).

Delivery pattern in stock exchanges

Stock exchange wise data on delivery ratio and turnover in physical form as well as in
value terms are provided in the Table No. 2.27.  At aggregate level, the delivery ratio in
terms  of  value  of  shares  declined  to  11.0per  cent  in  1999-2000  from  13.0  per  cent  in
1998-99.  However, the delivery ratio in terms of number of shares also increased to 19.0
per cent from 21.0 per cent during the same period. Stock exchange-wise delivery ratio
showed a divergent trend and it declined considerably both in terms of value and number
of  shares  during  the  year  as  compared  to  1998-99.    In  case  of  both  the  major  stock
exchanges, BSE and NSEIL, the delivery ratio in value terms declined to 16 per cent and
10 per cent in 1999-2000 from 20 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, in 1998-99.  The
small stock exchanges faired well in terms of delivery ratio both in respect of value as
well as in physical terms during the year 1999-2000 as compared to the previous year.
Specifically, the stock exchanges like Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Delhi, and Madras showed
remarkable  improvement  in  achieving  higher  delivery  ratio  during  the  year.    Madras
Stock Exchange reported a higher delivery ratio of 42 per cent in 1999-2000 in physical
terms  than  21  per  cent  in  1998-99.    Similarly,  the  Calcutta  Stock  Exchange  and  Delhi
Stock Exchange improved delivery ratio to 7.0 per cent and 17.0 per cent, respectively, in
1999-2000 from a level of 4.0 per cent and 7.0 per cent in 1998-99.  The delivery ratio
remained at a low level for Vadodara, Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore and Uttar Pradesh Stock
Exchanges (Table 2.27).

Bad Deliveries on Indian Stock Exchanges

The  percentage  of  bad  deliveries  to  net  deliveries  in  case  of  BSE  and  NSE  fluctuated
widely during the year of 1999-2000 as shown in the Table 2.28.  The bad delivery ratio
declined from a level of 0.57 per cent in May 1999 to 0.11 per cent in March 2000 in case
of  BSE,  whereas,  the  same  remained  quite  stable  for  NSE  from  April  1999  to  January
2000 thereafter declining to 0.15 per cent in March 2000.  This was the result of increase
in the share of dematerilised stock in the delivery of the stock exchanges (Table 2.28).

Performance of dematerialisation

Dematerialisation of shares has been becoming popular with the investors as well as the
companies as technological progress has become a part of stocks market in India.  Based
on the recommendation of SEBI’s Working Group on dematerialisation, the number of
scrips  for  compulsory  settlement  of  trades  in  dematerialised  form  for  institutional
investors has been increased in phases to 462 as at the end of the financial year under
review.    This  number  would  be  increased  to  985  by  June  26,  2000.    These  scrips
comprise of all shares forming the part of A Group scrips of BSE sensitive index, CNX
S&P Nifty, BSE 500 and CNX S&P 500 and most of the highly traded B1 Group scrips
of BSE.  The number of scrips for compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form
for all investors was also increased in phases to 260 as at end of the financial year under
review.  This number would be increased to 579 by June 26, 2000.

Number of dematerialised shares increased from 1,763 million as on end March 1998 to
6,970 million as on end March 1999 and further to 15,500 million shares as at end March
2000.    The  increase  in  number  of  dematerialised  scrips  reflects  fast  pace  in
institutionalisation  of  paperless  trading  in  equities.  Total  market  capitalisation  of
companies  at  NSDL  amounted  to  Rs.4,006  billion  at  end  March  1999  as  compared  to
Rs.2,883 billion as at end March 1998. It increased further to Rs.7,658 billion as at end
March  2000.  Depositary  participants  also  increased  from  49  to  124  and  a  total  of  621
companies were trading in dematerialised form as on end March  2000.

According  to  the  data  furnished  by  National  Securities  Depository  Ltd.  and  Central
Depository  Services  (I)  Limited,  dematerialised  securities  and  volume  substantially
increased during the year 1999-2000.    As on March 31, 2000, 1013 companies with a
market  capitalisation  of  over  Rs.  7,00,000  crore  had  signed  agreement  with  the
depositories.    The  number  of  depository  participant  offering  depository  services  have

Page 94 of 17165

grown  from  84  as  on  March  31,  1999  to  150  as  on  March  31,  2000.    The  depository
services  were  available  in  1000  centres  covering  200  cities  across  the  country  as  on
March 31, 2000.  The value of dematerialised shares increased from Rs. 1,10,600 crore as
on  March 31, 1999 to Rs. 4,00,000 crore as at end March 2000.  The number of shares
dematerialised  also  increased  from  697  crore  to  1500  crore.    There  has  been  a  steep
increase  in  the  beneficiary    accounts  opened  with  the  depository  participants  from
4,35,960 as on March 31, 1999 to 25,00,000 as on March 31, 2000.

The volume of dematerialised securities constitute around 80 to 90 percent of the total
delivery of securities at the NSE and BSE together. 10 Stock Exchanges viz. NSE, BSE,
CSE, DSE, MSE, OTCEI, BgSE, LSE, ASE and ICSEIL have established connectivity
with NSDL for settlement and clearing of dematerialised trading.

International comparison of developments in stock markets

Globalisation of stocks markets has its own merits and demerits. There appears to be a
relationship  between  the  movements  of  NASDAQ  and  the  Indian  share  price  indices
although only a few of information technology companies are listed at NASDAQ as well
as at National Stock Exchange and Mumbai Stock Exchange.

Stocks prices in different countries have demonstrated varying pattern. On point to point
basis, during 1999-2000 Malaysia, KLSE Index had the highest increase of 93.7 per cent
followed by NASDAQ Composite Index during 1999-2000 at 83.4 per cent, Hang Sang
with an increase of 59.7  per cent , China with an increase of 55.45 per cent.  India ranked
next to Taiwan as S&P CNX Nifty rose by 41.7  per cent and Sensex by 33.7 per cent
(Table 2.29).

Table  below  presents  data  on  correlation  co-efficient  between  NASDAQ  and  BSE
Sensex, Dowjones and BSE Sensex, on the one side and Nifty of NSE and NASDAQ and
Nifty and Dowjones on the other side.   The analysis provides interesting results.  The
correlation  between  Sensex  and  NASDAQ  has  shown  positive  relationship  for  the
months  of  June,  July,  September,  November  and  December  1999  and  negative
relationship for the remaining six months.  As regards Nifty, there has been a correlation
of larger magnitude for nearly seven months namely for May, June, October, November
and  December  1999,  February  and  March  2000.  The  negative  correlation,  at  times,
between  NASDAQ  and  Indian  indices  suggests  that  stocks  prices  in  India  have  taken
independent  movement  and  were  not  influenced  by  the  movement  in  NASDAQ.
Moreover, the magnitude of the coefficient of correlation except in March has been very
low (Table 2.31).

Market volatility in major securities markets in the Asian countries and USA

During  1999-2000  the  securities  market  across  the  world  witnessed  a  high  volatile
situation. The month-wise volatility ratios of major indices in percentage term are given
in the table below for the period 1999-2000.

During the month of April 1999, the volatility was on a higher side for NASDAQ, South
Korea, Thailand and India.  Thereafter it continued on a declining phase from May 1999
onwards  till  December  1999,  with  an  exception  to  some  indices  which  witnessed  the
highest volatility like 3.04 per cent in case of China and 3.51 per cent in South Korea in
the month of July 1999.  Since January 2000 upto March 2000, the intensity of volatility
increased in all the securities markets and especially the technology indices experienced
more volatility than the indices of economy stocks, e.g. Dow Jones index.  The securities
market of Asian countries moved in tandem with the market in the European countries
and  specially  the  trading  activities  on  NASDAQ  and  New  York  stock  exchange.
Similarly,  the  volatility  in  share  prices  traded  in  NASDAQ  and  NYSE  affected  the
trading in stocks of Asian countries, which shows integration of the stock markets across
the globe (Table 2.32).

Developments in government-debt market

Activity in the wholesale debt market

There  was  massive  increase  in  the  trading  activity  of  Wholesale  Debt  Market  (WDM)
during 1999-2000 as the net traded value was Rs.19,449.4 in March 2000 as compared to
Rs.18,524.6 crore in April 1999.  The net traded amount stood at Rs.15,206.2 in March
1999. The trend in net traded value has not been linear as the investors by and large, sell
these securities during the liquidity crunch period.  There was also increase in average
daily  value  traded  from  Rs.661  crore  in  March  1999  to  Rs.810  crore  in  March  2000.
Over  the  year  under  review  there  have  been  large  fluctuations.    The  average  daily
turnover was as high as Rs.1,799 crore in February 2000 (Table 2.33).

Instrument-wise  trading  has  shown  marked  changes.  The  share  of  Government  dated
securities which ranged between 65 per cent and 88 per cent during 1998-99, oscillated at
a high level namely 88.35 per cent and 96.67 per cent during 1999-2000.  treasury  bill
trade also registered some lower volume in 1999-2000.  The trading pattern thus reflected
that the investors are more favourable to trade in dated securities which carry higher rate
of return in the secondary market from 11 per cent to 20 per cent.  However, in between
there were fluctuation in their respective share (Table 2.34).

C] MUTUAL FUNDS

Resources mobilised by mutual funds

The mutual funds during 1998-99 suffered a serious set back by reporting a sharp decline
in net resource mobilisation.  There was a net outflow of Rs.950 crore during the entire
year. The concern for this situation got reflected in the incentives offered to mutual funds
scheme in the Union Budget for 1999-2000.

The  performance  has  been  extremely  good  during  1999-2000  as  the  gross  amount
mobilised by them increased to Rs. 61,241.23 from Rs. 22,710.73 crore during 1998-99
showing an increase of around 170 per cent in 1999-2000.  The Government exempted
the  income  of  unit  holders  received  from  UTI  or  from  mutual  fund.    The  Government
further  exempted  income  distributed  under  the  US-64  scheme  and  other  open-ended
equity oriented schemes of UTI and mutual funds from the 10 per cent flat rate of tax.
These fiscal incentives have favourably impacted the resource mobilisation by the mutual
funds industry.  However, redemption  had been very heavy which form nearly more than
100 per cent in 1998-99 and 69 per cent during the current financial year.

As  regards  the  net  resource  mobilisation,  there  has  been  a  massive  inflow  of
Rs.18,969.88 crore during the current financial year under review as against a net outflow
of Rs.949.67 crore during the entire financial year of 1998-99.

Details of funds mobilised, repurchase/redemption amount and the net inflow/outflow of
funds  for the financial year 1999–2000 are given in Table 2.36.

As regards sector-wise performance, there was a net inflow of Rs.15,426.77 crore in case
of private sector mutual funds (net inflow of Rs.1,452.70 crore during 1998-99) followed
by UTI with a net inflow of Rs.4,548.32 crore (net outflow of Rs.2,737.53 crore during

Page 103 of 17165

1998-99). On the contrary there was a net outflow of Rs.744.92 crore in case of public
sector  mutual  funds  (net  inflow  of  Rs.335.16  crore  during  1998-99)  due  to  massive
redemption  /  repurchase  of  close  ended  schemes.  Thus  it  is  found  that  probably
organisational and ownership structure have been influencing the performance of mutual
funds.

It is observed that in case of private and public sector mutual funds, the entire net inflow
of fund has been from open-ended schemes and there was net outflow in respect of close
ended schemes.  However, incase of UTI, 77.28 per cent of net inflow has been from the
close ended schemes.

Comparative performance of mutual funds and bank deposits

In  resource  mobilisation,  mutual  funds  outperformed  the  bank  deposits  during  the  year
under review.  While mutual funds on net basis increased their resources by Rs.18,516
crore, there was a decline in accretion to bank deposits from Rs.1,08,615 crore in 1998-
99  to  Rs.9,175  crore  in  1999-2000.    Thus  there  has  been  a  shift  of  savings  from  bank
deposits to mutual funds units (Table 2.37).

Offer documents received and cleared by SEBI

During  the  year  under  review,  there  was  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number  of  offer
documents  received  and  cleared  by  the  SEBI  for  launching  new  schemes  by  mutual
funds.  Thus the SEBI received 96 offer documents during 1999-2000 as against 60 offer
documents  during  1998-99.  SEBI  cleared  86  offer  documents  (18  offer  documents
cleared for conversion of close ended schemes into open ended schemes), as against 47
offer documents cleared in the entire year 1998-99.  All offer documents were cleared in
21  working  days  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations.  In  remaining  cases,  the  mutual
funds have been advised to incorporate the preliminary observations.

Pattern of offer documents received

In all 45 offer documents were received for launching income schemes, out of which 15
offer documents were  for launching gilt schemes investing in government securities, 29
offer documents were for launching schemes investing predominantly in corporate debt
securities,  1  offer  document  was  for  investing  in    money  market  instruments,  23  offer
documents  were  for  growth  schemes  investing  predominantly  in  equities  which  also
include sector specific schemes and tax saving schemes, 13 offer documents were  for
balanced  schemes  investing  in  equities  as  well  as  debt  securities,  13  offer  documents
were received for conversion of old close ended schemes into open ended schemes and 2

Assured return schemes of mutual funds

The SEBI pursuing its objective to protect the interest of the investors has been directing,
sponsors/AMCs of mutual funds to honour their commitment of assured returns. Several
investors have received income from their investment due to efforts of SEBI. According
to data available, 7 mutual funds have so far contributed Rs.1,979.35 crore to meet the
shortfalls in 19 assured return scheme. The details of these contributions are below in the
table 2.38.

During the year, SEBI directed Indian Bank and Indian Bank Mutual Fund u/s 11B of the
SEBI Act, 1992 to meet the shortfall in the returns committed in the offer documents of
Ind Prakash and Ind Jyothi  schemes.  It  may  be  mentioned  that  earlier  Indbank  Mutual
Fund had paid assured return to the unitholders of  Ind Jyothi scheme as directed by the
SEBI. However, some of the investors who had opted for redemption before the  SEBIs’
directive  could  not  get  assured  returns.  They  preferred  an  appeal  before  the  appellate
authority. The appellate authority upheld the stand taken by the SEBI and directed Indian
Bank and Indbank Mutual Fund to pay the returns to the investors as committed in the

Page 106 of 17165

offer document. Subsequently, an appeal against the decision of the appellate authority
has been filed with the Delhi High Court.

It  may  be  recalled  that  Canbank  Mutual  Fund  had  been  directed  to  honour  its
commitments  in  case  of  Canstar  scheme.  Though  most  of  the  investors  opted  for
redemption in the year 1997 some of the investors could do so in the subsequent years.
As a result, the amount contributed by Canara Bank has increased to Rs. 1,237 Crore.  In
case of Cantriple scheme, the matter pertaining to assured returns is sub-judice.

In case of Magnum Triple Scheme of SBI Mutual Fund, SEBI insisted that the investors
of the schemes must be paid three times the face value of units as indicated in the offer
document.  Accordingly,  SBI  Mutual  Fund  paid  Rs.300  to  the  investors  at  the  time  of
redemption  and  the  shortfall  was  met  by  the  sponsors  i.e  State  Bank  of  India,  who
contributed Rs. 125.97 Crores (Table 2.39).

Development with respect to collective investment schemes

The Board reviewed the current status of entities having Collective Investment Schemes.
It  was  noted  that  upto  January  24,  2000,  29  applications  for  grant  of  registration  were
received from entities which had reportedly mobilised about Rs.292.29 crores. Another
26 entities, which had reportedly mobilised about Rs.185.24 crores, have sought time for
submitting application for registration. The Board also noted that 43 entities which had
reportedly collected about Rs.332.42 crores have intimated SEBI about their intention to
repay and wind up their schemes in terms of provisions of SEBI (Collective Investment
Schemes) Regulations, 1999. Besides, in some cases proceedings are going on in various
Courts  wherein  the  companies,  which  had  launched  CIS,  have  proposed  to  make  the
payment to investors.

The  Board  took  note  of  various  steps  taken  by  the  SEBI,  such  as  individual  letters  to
entities asking them to apply for registration or wind up and repay the investors; public
notices  in  newspapers,  inter-alia,  cautioning  investors  about  risks  associated  with  the
investments of such nature; public notices in newspapers reminding entities who have not
applied for registration by December 14, 1999 to wind up their existing schemes to repay
the investors.

FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT

On December 8, 1999, the cumulative net investment made by the Foreign Institutional
Investors  (FIIs)  in  the  Indian  Capital  Market    since  September  1992,  crossed  the  10
billion-dollar  mark.  Though  there  was  an  outflow  of  funds  during  the  period  August-
October 1999, the underlying sentiment towards the Indian markets was  bullish. During
the  year  1999-2000,  FIIs  had  made  a  net    investment  of    Rs.  10,121.93  crore,  as
compared  to  the  outflow  of  Rs.  1,584.5  crore  during  1998-99.  Apart  from  market
considerations,  this  reversal  in  trend  is  also  reflective  of  the  confidence  of  FIIs  in  the
structural  reforms  introduced  by  the  SEBI  to  make  the  Indian  markets  more  investor
friendly, transparent and efficient. The net investment made by the FIIs as on March 31,
2000 stood at US $11.23 billion. The yearly cumulative net investment made by the FIIs
is given Table 2.40

Another  noteworthy  feature  is  the  increase  in  the  FII  turnover  at  the  exchanges  as
compared to previous years. The gross purchases and sales by the FIIs during the year
1999-2000  were  Rs.  56,855.46  crore  (Rs.16,115  crore)*   and  Rs.  46,733.52  crore  (Rs.
17,699.4 crore)*. This is reflective of the increasing depth of the Indian markets.

During the year (1999-2000) 56 FIIs were registered. As on March 31, 2000, 506 FIIs
were  registered  with  SEBI.The  Asian  financial  crisis  did  have  an  impact  in  the  FII
investment in 1998-99 but the low volatility of the Indian markets as compared to other
emerging market economies and an efficient market structure were some of the factors

The South East Asian crisis of 1997-98 had resulted in a review of investment strategy by
the  global  investors  in  respect  of  emerging  market  economies.  However,  the  Indian
markets bucked the trend and gained considerably from April 1, 1998 to March 31, 2000.
Low volatility, attractive valuations and a stable currency were some of the factors which
led to surge in the FIIs investment.

E] SUBSTANTIAL AQCUSITION OF SHARES AND TAKEOVERS

During the year 1999-2000, 83 Letters of Offer form making open offer were filed with
the SEBI. Under the SEBI (Substantial acquisition of shares and Takeovers), Regulations,
1997,  a  category  of  non  applicability  of  open  offer  obligations  was  introduced  to
automatically exempt certain transactions from open offer which may become necessary
in  the  overall  commercial  and  business  interest  of  the  company.  During  the  year,  246
reports were filed under this category. The transactions, which are not covered under the
said category, are to be submitted to the Takeover Panel for exemption from open offer.
During  the  year,  15  such  applications  were  submitted  out  of  which  exemption  from
making open offer was granted in respect of 11 cases (Table 2.42).

F]  INVESTIGATION, ENFORCEMENT AND SURVEILLANCE

Market Surveillance

Market  Surveillance  plays  a  key  role  in  ensuring  safety  and  integrity  of  the  markets.
Market Surveillance Division was set up in SEBI in July 1995,  with  a  view  to  keep  a
proactive oversight on the surveillance activities of the stock exchanges.

SEBI’s market surveillance essentially focuses on:

•  policy  formulation  for  introduction  of  surveillance  systems  and  risk  containment
measures at the stock exchanges to bring integrity, safety and stability in the Indian
securities markets;

•  overseeing the surveillance activities of the stock exchanges including the monitoring

of market movements by them;
inspection of the surveillance cells of the stock exchanges;
initiating investigations; and

• 
• 
•  preparation  of  reports  and  studies  on  market  movements,  which  SEBI  circulates,
periodically  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  the  Government  of  India  and  to  securities
markets regulators from other countries.

The  primary  responsibility  of  market  surveillance  has  been  entrusted  to  the  stock
exchanges.  However, SEBI keeps a proactive oversight on market movements and trends
and in exceptional circumstances it analyses the same. When appropriate, on the basis of
reports received from the stock exchanges or specific complaints or sometimes suo-moto
also (on exception basis only), preliminary enquiries are conducted to determine whether
the  trading  raises  suspicion  of  market  manipulation  and/or  insider  dealing.  In  case  an
analysis of the trading information for the stock exchanges leads to a suspicion of market
abuse,  then,  client  details  and  records  are  obtained  from  the  stock  brokers.  If  further
analysis of these records suggests the possibility of occurrence of market manipulation or
insider dealing or other misconduct, investigations are initiated.

The Market Surveillance systems are developed and consolidated on a continuous basis.
Some of the surveillance systems and risk containment measures that have been put in
place are briefly given below:

(cid:226)   Risk containment measures in the form of elaborate margining system and linking of

intra-day trading limits and exposure limits to capital adequacy;

Page 112 of 17165

(cid:226)   Daily price bands to curb abnormal price behaviour and volatility;
(cid:226)   Reporting by stock exchanges through periodic and event driven reports;
(cid:226)   Establishment of independent surveillance cells in stock exchanges;
(cid:226)   Inspection of intermediaries;
(cid:226)   Suspension of trading in scrips to prevent market manpulation;
(cid:226)   Formation of Inter Exchange Market Surveillance Group for prompt, interactive and
effective  decision  making  on  surveillance  issues  and  co-ordination  between  stock
exchanges;

(cid:226)   Suspension of trading in scrips to prevent market manipulation;
(cid:226)   Implementation of On-line automated surveillance system (Stock Watch System) at

stock exchanges.

  Mechanisms for risk containment

An essential tool for ensuring the safety of market is the risk containment system.  To
ensure safety of the market, all the stock exchanges have an elaborate margining system
including mark to market margins and daily margins and exposure and intra-day trading
limits.

Review of margining system
Different margins were prescribed by the SEBI in consultation with the stock exchanges
at  different  points  of  time  keeping  in  view  the  requirements  and  exigencies  of  the
prevailing  situations.  Though,  largely  the  existing  margining  system  had  worked  well.
However, it was felt that there was lack of uniformity in the implementation of various
margins by the exchanges. The SEBI has constituted a group to review, rationalize and
streamline the margining system. As per the recommendations  of the group the following
changes  were  made  in  the  margining  system  during  the  year  1999-2000  to  bring
uniformity  in  implementation  of  mark  to  market  margin    across  stock  exchanges  and
remove undue burden on investors who sell for delivery.

A.  Mark-to market margin

The mark to market margin is calculated by marking each transaction in a scrip to the
closing price of the scrip at the end of trading.  It has now been directed/clarified  that
1.  transactions for sale for delivery would be exempt from payment of this margin

after delivery  is  given to the clearing house / clearing corporation.

2.  the  margin    shall  be  calculated  separately  for  two  trading  cycles(the  current
trading cycle and the closed trading cycle whose settlement is yet to take place)
and credit for mark to market of the closed trading cycle may not be given against
mark to market losses of the current trading cycle

These  provisions  would  bring  uniformity  in  implementation  of  mark  to  market
margin across stock exchanges and remove undue burden on investors who sell for
delivery.

is  accepted 

C. Base capital and additional capital
The  base  capital  and  additional  capital 
/FDR/Bank
Guarantee/Securities  in  prescribed  proportion.    It  was  decided  that  for  the  securities
component, while accepting shares, only those scrips would be accepted which are part of
BSE Sensex/S&P CNX Nifty/BSE 100/ CNX Nifty Junior/BSE 200/ CNX  Midcap 200.
Further, the scrips which are in compulsory dematerialised trading for all investors are to
be accepted in dematerialised form only.  This would improve the quality of the securities
component held by the stock exchanges as capital and also guarantee the requisite level
of liquidity for these deposits.

in  cash 

It  was  also  decided  to  increase  the  frequency  of  valuation  of  securities  deposited  as
capital.    The  valuation  would  be  done  at  haircut  of  15  per  cent  when  it  is  done  more
frequently i.e. atleast once a week as compared to haircut of 30 per cent if the valuation is
done once a month.

It  was  also  decided  to  allow  the  excess  additional  capital,  i.e.  the  unused  capital  after
meeting the requirements of exposure, lying with the exchanges in the form of cash/bank
guarantee/FDR to be utilised for meeting margin requirements.

D. Incremental carry forward margin
The system    of  incremental  carry  forward  margin  was  implemented  in  1998  to  control
excessive  built  up  of  carry  forward  positions.    The  system  was  modified  and  it  was
provided that  instead of a flat rate of 10 per cent for every additional 1 per cent increase
in carry forward positions the incidence of this margin would be low  at  low levels of
carry forward position in a scrip and high at higher levels. For carry forward positions
exceeding 3 per cent a graded structure  of  rate of margin varying from 5 per cent to 30
per cent  was prescribed.

E. Payment of margin by clients
Collection  of  margins  by  brokers  from  their  clients  was  made  mandatory.    However,
exemption from this has been granted when the margin liability on the client is less than
Rs.1 lac.

Containing volatility
The system of volatility margin was introduced in June, 1998 to curb excessive volatility
in  the  markets.  However,  it  was  felt  that  this  margin  addressed  volatility  over  a  short
period of one week only.  Therefore, with a view to address volatility over short term as
well as longer period of six weeks, it was decided that the margin would be levied on the
basis of volatility computed on a rolling basis over a period of preceding six weeks.  For
volatility  {defined as (6 week high – 6 week low)/ 6 week low} more than 40 per cent
graded margin rates from 5 per cent to 20 per cent were prescribed.  This system was

Page 114 of 17165

further  modified  and  the  threshold  volatility  was  increased  from  40  per  cent  to  60  per
cent and the margin rates were increased to 5 per cent to 30  per cent.

Uniform scrip specific price bands
To contain abnormal price variations, the SEBI had introduced the system of scrip specific
daily price bands. In January, 2000 it was decided in principle to allow a further variation of
4 per cent in the scrip prices beyond the existing limit of 8 per cent after a cooling off period
of 30 minutes.  This is expected to provide additional exit route to investors. This modified
system would be implemented shortly after necessary software changes are carried out by
the  exchanges.  To  start  with,  this  modification  will  be  applicable  in  the  case  of  top  100
scrips.

Increase in cash component of total cover available with exchanges to 30 per cent
In order to enhance the safety of the markets, it was decided to increase the cash component
of additional capital and margins deposited by brokers with exchanges to 30 per cent of the
total deposits.

Margining of institutional trades
Institutional trades form a large part of the trading volumes on major exchanges. These
trades are at present not subjected to margin; it has bee decided to examine the issue of
margining these trades.

Risk containment – overall responsibility of exchanges
Though the minimum measures for risk containment have been specified by the SEBI,
the overall responsibility for risk containment lies with the exchanges. Exchanges have
been directed to take further measures as required. Some additional measures taken by
the  exchanges  for  risk  containment,  are  intra-settlement  and  inter-settlement  scrip-wise
limits  on  broker  positions  in  addition  to  the  overall  limits  specified  by  the  SEBI,
enforcement of early pay-ins by members with large positions and member-wise adhoc
margins.

  Mechanisms for a fair and transparent securities market

In  order  to  make  the  securities  markets  fair  and  transparent  and  for  enhanced  investor
protection, SEBI had taken initiatives, which are given below:

Dissemination of price sensitive information to public
It  is  necessary  to  have  a  proper  method  for  dissemination  of  price  sensitive  and  other
important information relating to companies and market to the public so that they can make
informed  investment  decisions.  The  stock  exchanges  have  been  advised  to  display  such
information on their terminals in the quickest possible manner.

Dealing with market rumours
Market rumours can do considerable damage to the normal functioning and behaviour of the
securities market. It is therefore essential to have quick verification of such rumours from
the  corporates  as  well  as  from  other  entities  whenever  necessary.  On  being  asked  by  the

Page 115 of 17165

¤
SEBI, companies have designated compliance officers who would be contacted by the stock
exchanges  whenever  such  verification  is  needed.  Exchanges  have  been  asked  to  take  up
quick verification of rumours and proper dissemination of the same. Exchanges have started
verifying rumours and since October ’99 the same are getting reported to SEBI also.

Public disclosure of information relating to actions taken against stockbrokers
The  stock  exchanges  are  required  to  make  public  the  actions  taken  by  the  Disciplinary
Action  Committee  of  the  stock  exchanges  against  their  member  brokers.  The  stock
exchanges  have  also  been  asked  to  issue  press  releases  when  such  actions  are  of  serious
nature.

Strengthening of insider trading regulations
While  insider-trading  regulations  were  framed  in  1992,  it  was  felt  that  there  was  no
framework for prevention of insider trading. A group was set up under the Chairmanship of
Shri  Kumar  Mangalam  Birla,  member,  SEBI,  to  suggest  measures  to  be  taken  for
strengthening the regulations as well as requirements of procedures, code of conduct and
reporting  about  the  entities  in  the  capital  market  which  may  have  access  to  non-public
information. The group is in the process of coming up with suitable recommendations in this
regard.

Surveillance in internet environment
Internet  based  securities  trading  was  permitted  in  Indian  capital  markets  in  Jan  2000.
Internet  is  a  versatile  medium  and  apart  from  proliferating  genuine  applications,  it  has
also provided new avenues for market manipulators and fraudsters. The SEBI Committee
on  Internet  based  trading  and  services  has  set  up  a  working  group  to  look  into
surveillance and monitoring related issues arising due to Internet based securities trading.

  Greater  responsibility  and  accountability  of  the  surveillance  cells  of  the  stock

exchanges

The  surveillance  cells  of  the  stock  exchanges  have  been  advised  to  devise  an  internal
system of documentation of their surveillance activities and follow-up actions, in order to
bring  about  greater  responsibility  and  accountability  in  discharging  the  surveillance
functions.

Inspection of surveillance cells of stock exchanges
The surveillance cells of stock exchanges have been strengthened in terms of manpower and
systems as directed by the SEBI. During 1999-2000, the SEBI inspected surveillance cells
of 7 stock exchanges and shortcomings and suggestions have been communicated to them
for improvement of the functioning of surveillance cells.

Reporting by stock exchanges
The SEBI had put in place a system of reporting by the stock exchanges on surveillance
related matters.  With a view to bring emphasis on oversight and exception reporting,  it
was decided to modify the reporting requirements on the lines as below:

Page 116 of 17165

¤
1.  The  daily  report  in  the  existing  format  has  been  done  away  with  and  it  has  been
prescribed that daily report will be sent only on exceptional basis if there has been
happening / event / trading pattern which have a bearing on the safety /integrity of the
market.

2.  The  settlement  report  includes  details  about  overall  safety  level  at  the  exchange,
member deactivations, scrip suspension, instances of rumor verifications and working
of stock watch system.

3.  The  monthly  report  gives  details  about  analysis/investigations  taken  up  by  the
exchanges following the reference from SEBI or otherwise, outcome of the same and
actions taken by the exchange against members/ issuers.

Indefinite suspension of scrips
Earlier,  the  exchanges  had  to  seek  prior  approval  from  SEBI  for  suspending  scrips  for
more  than  three  days.  As  all  the  information  required  for  taking  such  decisions  is
available with the exchanges, it was decided that the decision for suspension of trading of
scrips including for more than 3 days should be taken at the exchange level itself.

Surveillance staff strength at exchanges
To  improve  the  functioning  of  the  surveillance  cells  of  stock  exchanges,  it  has  been
decided  that  exchanges  will  take  steps  to  assess  manpower  requirements  and  deploy
adequate  staff  for  surveillance  and  monitoring.  Exchanges  are  also  required  to  provide
appropriate  training  and  certification  to  surveillance  staff  and  facilitate  process  of
certification.

Development of the stock exchanges as self-regulatory organisations
SEBI  has  been  trying  to  strengthen  the  role  of  exchanges  as  effective  self-regulatory
organisations.  Setting  up  of  independent  surveillance  cells  directly  reporting  to  the
exchange executive directors was a step in this direction. Development of exchange level
surveillance  capabilities  like  stock  watch  system,  directing  exchanges  to  augment  their
surveillance  staff  strength  and  devising  a  training  and  certification  module  for  the
exchange surveillance staff are further initiatives taken by SEBI in this direction. Self-
regulatory steps taken by exchanges under the oversight of SEBI have improved market
safety and integrity.

In line with their self-regulatory role, the primary responsibility of market surveillance
and  monitoring,  detection  of  abnormal  trading  patterns,  analysis  and  initiation  of
investigations has been entrusted to exchanges. Exchanges are required to make reference
to SEBI, in appropriate cases, for further investigations by the SEBI. In the year 1999-
2000, in 12 cases, further investigations were taken up by the SEBI on reference from
exchanges. Major exchanges conducted  suo-moto investigations in more than 100 other
cases.  As  part  of  its  oversight  of  surveillance  activity,  SEBI  also  takes  up  cases  for
investigations,  but  this  is  done  on  exceptional  basis  only.  In  the  year,  in  24  cases,
exchanges were asked by the SEBI to conduct investigations/ send details to the SEBI. In
some of these cases, exchanges had already initiated investigations on their own.

Page 117 of 17165

Inter exchange market surveillance group
There are 23 stock exchanges having different trading and settlement cycles and at the same
time scrips have multiple listing on these stock exchanges. For effective and meaningful co-
ordination  between  these  stock  exchanges  for  healthy  functioning  of  the  market,  an  Inter
Exchange Market Surveillance Group was set up by the SEBI.  The group meets at regular
intervals. Six meetings of the Group were convened by the SEBI during 1999-2000. In
these  meetings,  the  Group  reviewed  the  prevailing  market  conditions  and  several
measures, such as increase in the cash component of margin and additional capital to 30
per  cent,  imposition  of  special/ad-hoc  margins  in  scrips  with  low  floating  stock  and
specific  measures  such  as  exposure  reduction,  etc.  were  initiated  to  enhance  the  safety
and integrity of the market.

Development  and  implementation  of  stock  watch  system  –  an  on-line  automated
surveillance system

As  trading  in  the  Indian  securities  markets  has  become  on-line,  a  sophisticated  on-line
surveillance  system  was  called  for  to  have  effective  market  surveillance  in  line  with
international standards.  Development of the Stock Watch System at the exchange level
was initiated by the SEBI with this objective. All major exchanges have put in place the
basic structure of the stock watch system. The system is fully functional in NSE. In BSE,
the system was formally inaugurated in July 1999, and is operational. However, BSE and
some other exchanges are now in the process of prioritisation and benchmarking of the
alerts  generated  by  the  system.  Further  refinements  of  the  stock  watch  system  will  be
taken up after the basic system becomes fully functional in all major stock exchanges.

  Regulatory role in the context of market volatility

Excessive  volatility  in  the  securities  markets  is  a  cause  of  concern  for  regulators,
corporates and investors. When prices swing at extreme levels, they can have a number of
adverse consequences:
1.  such  volatility  increases  trading  risks  and  requires  market  intermediaries  to  charge
more  for  their  liquidity  services,  thereby  reducing  the  liquidity  of  the  market  as  a
whole.

2.  if such volatility persists, securities firms are less able to use their available capital
efficiently  because  of  the  need  to  reserve  a  larger  percentage  of  cash-equivalent
investments in order to reassure lenders and regulators.

3.  greater volatility can reduce investor confidence in investing in stocks.

As a result of these effects, increased price volatility could in the long run, impact the
securities  markets  adversely.  The  regulators  across  the  world  remain  concerned  about
excessive price volatility.

The  BSE  Sensex  had  bottomed  out  in  April  1999  and  closed  at  3245.27  on  April  26,
1999.  Thereafter the index has shown steady rise till October 1999. From October 27,
1999, the Sensex witnessed a correction and fell continuously from a level of 4756.2 to
4270.74 on November 1999.  The fall in the index was attributed to FII sales due to the
redemption pressure at the  year end. The Sensex rose substantially from then to reach a
level  of  5924.31  on  February  2000.    During  this  period,  sensex  crossed  6000  level  on
February 11, 2000 at 6005.85 and February 14, 2000 at 6150.69 which was also all time
high for the index.  This rally could not be sustained and Sensex closed at 5001.28 on 31st
March, 2000.  The fall was attributed to the profit taking in the software scrips after a
meteoric rise.

Excessive volatility has been observed in world markets as well, mainly on account of the
popularity of telecom, media and technology stocks. These stocks are inherently volatile
because of “uncertainty element”  associated with them, absence of any clear cut method
of  valuation  and  fast  pace  of  change  in  technology.  These  stocks  have  also  been
favourites in the Indian markets, and contributed a major portion of trading volumes in
this period.

A lot of activity was observed in the case of companies which have changed their names
to suggest software / Infotech activity. SEBI brought the phenomenon of change in names
by  companies  to  reflect  software  /  it  activity  to  the  notice  of  Department  of  Company
Affairs, Govt. of India. With a view to protect the interest of investors, SEBI has also
taken the following steps:-

1.  alerted the investors by issuing press release advising them to be cautious in trading

in such scrips.

shares of such companies.

2.  asked exchanges to closely monitor the trading and other developments in respect of

3.  made  it  mandatory  for  such  companies  to  separately  show  the  performance  and

results of software activity in quarterly / annual report.

4.  further tightened entry norms for public / rights issues by such companies by way of
requirement  of  profitability  track  record  of  3  years  in  the  sector  of  information
technology.

It was also observed that the activity in the area of restructuring of companies including
mergers, acquisitions, strategic stakes and brand acquisitions had increased in 1999-2000.
The  exchanges  were  advised  to  ensure  that  news  and  information  with  respect  to  such
corporate  developments  is  properly  disseminated  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner.
Exchanges were also asked to be watchful and alert and verify rumours to ensure fairness
in  the  securities  market.  In  the  wake  of  such  events,  reported  or  rumoured,  exchanges
were also advised to analyse trading patterns quickly.

In view of sharp and sudden variations in scrip prices of certain sectors, it was suggested
to exchanges in  December 1999 to take possible proactive actions such as
1.  putting the scrips on spot or 100 per cent margin.
2.  also warning the investors appropriately along with other actions.
3.  suspension  of  the  trading  in  the  scrip  for  shorter  or  longer  period  when  there  is

reasonable belief on the part of the exchange of manipulative activity.

SEBI  held  discussions  with  major  stock  exchanges  in  January  2000  on  increased
volatility  and  sharp  up  trend  in  the  market  and  on  further  measures  being  taken  /to  be
taken  for  ensuring  safety  and  stability  in  the  market.  Some  of  the  measures  taken  to
enhance market safety and described earlier also, are as follows:

•  Slabs of volatility margin were increased from 5 per cent to 20 per cent to a range of

5 per cent to 30 per cent

•  Cash component of margin and additional capital was increased to 30 per cent

Page 120 of 17165

• 

• 

Imposition  of  higher  special  /  ad-hoc  margins  in  respect  of  scrips  which  have
relatively low floating stock.
In  respect  of  brokers,  which  according  to  exchanges  have  taken  large  and
concentrated  positions,  specific  measures  by  way  of  exposure  reduction/  additional
margins/early pay-in etc.

In addition to these measures, press releases were issued on two occasions for the benefit
of  small  investors,  cautioning  investors  to  exercise  due  diligence  while  transacting  in
securities.

Implementation of the measures described above have resulted into margin cover to the
tune  of  around  45  per  cent  in  the  Indian  capital  markets.  This  along  with  SEBI’s
proactive  and  consultative  approach  has  helped  in  containing  volatility  and  ensuring
safety of the markets. This is borne out by the fact that despite sharp fluctuation in market
prices and several instances of high market volatility, the Indian markets have remained
safe and stable.

INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations  are  carried  out  with  a  view  to  gather  evidence  of  alleged  violations  of
securities  market  such  as  price  rigging,  creation  of  artificial  market,    insider  trading,
public  issue  related  irregularities  and  other  misconduct,  as  well  as  to  find  out
persons/entities  behind  these  irregularities  and  violations.  SEBI  has  been  strengthening
its  investigation  activities  over  the  years  and  these  activities  were  further  strengthened
during 1999-2000.

Investigations  carried  out  by  SEBI  during  the  last  few  years  have  produced  salutary
impact  the  capital  market.    The  investigations  coupled  with  proactive  surveillance
measures  have  resulted  in  reduction  in  number  of  instances  of  alleged  market
manipulations  and  price  rigging.    Pursuant  to  completion  of  investigation,  a  number  of
actions like administrative directions and penal actions under the SEBI Act and the various
SEBI  Rules  and  Regulations  were  effected.  These  actions  include  monetary  penalties,
warning, suspension of activities and cancellation of registration, refund of issue proceeds,
prohibiting dealing in securities and access to the capital market, asking trustees and key
persons of mutual fund to step down for their failure to protect the interest of the investors,
etc.

Investigation proceedings

During  1999-2000,  investigations  were  taken  up  in  several  cases  alleging  market
manipulations and price rigging, issues related to manipulations, insider trading and non-
compliance of regulations of mutual funds and take-over of companies. The details of these
are given in Table 2.43 and the corresponding Graph 2.27.

Summary of representative investigation cases

During  the  year  1999-2000,  56  cases  were  taken  up  for  investigation.    These  cases
pertained  to  allegations  of  market  manipulations  and  price  rigging,  issue  related
manipulations,  insider  trading,  non-compliance  with  Takeover  Regulations,  mis-
statement in the prospectus, etc.  Out of these 56 cases,  investigations were taken up in
47  cases  of  alleged  market  manipulation  and  price  rigging,  2  cases  of  issue  related
manipulations, 3 fresh cases of alleged insider trading, etc.  Such investigations coupled
with  effective  market  surveillance  under  the  oversight  of  SEBI  have  resulted  in
significant reduction in cases of market manipulation and price rigging.

Page 125 of 17165

During 1999-2000, investigations in 37 cases of market manipulation and price rigging, 8
cases of issue related manipulations, 5 cases of insider trading, 3 cases of takeover code
violations  were  completed.    The  investigations  into  market  manipulation  cases  have
brought  out  that  certain  persons  /  entities  created  artificial  market  and  manipulated  the
prices of certain scrips.  Likewise, investigations into issue related manipulations showed
that  there  was  mis-use  of  stock  invests,  arrangement  of  subscription  to  circumvent
requirement  of  minimum  subscription,  buy-back  of  shares  by  the  company  in
contravention  of  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act,  acceptance  of  applications  after  the
closure  of  the  issue,  grey  market  operations,  mis-statement  in  prospectus  etc.    After
completion of investigations, SEBI has ordered refund of the issue proceeds in one case.
Investigations  into  alleged  insider  trading  cases  revealed  that  in  one  instance  insider
trading had taken place.

Apart from price manipulations, issues related to irregularities, takeover code violations
and  insider  trading.    During  this  year  investigations  into  irregularities  by  Mutual  Fund
were also conducted for the first time. Further, investigations were also made into attempt
of  certain  entities  to  trigger  fall  in  the  market  and  defraud  the  settlement  guarantee
scheme of NSE.

The cases where investigations were completed during 1999-2000 are discussed below :-

Shriram Mutual Fund

In the wake of sudden payment crisis in the month of June 1998, on The Stock Exchange,
Mumbai (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) and allegations of manipulation in
the scrips of BPL Ltd., Videocon International Ltd. (Videocon) Sterlite Industries Ltd.,
investigations were undertaken by SEBI.  It was also alleged that  Shriram Mutual Fund
(SRMF)  had  helped  certain  brokers  of  BSE  who  were  having  payment  problems  and
purchased shares of Videocon in pursuance to buy-back arrangement.  Investigations by
SEBI revealed that a company belonging to Shriram group, purchased large quantities of
shares of Videocon to help out brokers of BSE who were having payment problems.  Out
of these purchases, part of the shares  were sold to SRMF as cross deal at a price which
was much higher than the market price prevailing on the date of purchase.  Investigations
also  revealed  that  the  purchase  of  these  shares  by  SRMF,  in  a  falling  market,  was  for
extraneous considerations rather than a normal investment decision and pursuant to buy-
back arrangement.  It was also seen that Shriram Group (who is the promoter of Shriram
Mutual  Fund)  and Videocon  Group  of  Companies  were  close  associates  of  each  other.
An attempt was made to create record to show that purchase price was not higher than the
market price by ante-dating the purchase i.e. showing that the purchase was made on a
date prior to the  actual date of purchase.

As  a  result  of  investigations,  enquiry  proceedings  were  initiated  against  the  brokers
involved  for  falsifying  the  records.    Adjudication  proceedings  were  initiated  against
Shriram  Asset  Management  Co.  Ltd.  (SAMC)  and  on  completion  of  the  proceedings  a
fine of Rs. 5  lacs was imposed on SAMC. Further, directions were given under Section
11B  of  the  SEBI  Act,  to  the  Sponsors  of  SRMF  to  pay  with  interest  towards  the  loss

Page 126 of 17165

caused  to the unit-holders for making purchases at a price higher than the market price.
Consequent to initiation of proceedings, the Managing Director of SAMC, resigned from
the office.  Directions have been issued making him ineligible to hold any public position
in any capital related public institution for a period of three years.  It was also directed
that 2 other key persons who assisted the Managing Director in these operations and were
still with SAMC should resign with immediate effect.  The trustees were also asked to
step down and Board of Trustees be reconstituted.

Kamal Overseas Limited

Investigations  were  conducted  by  SEBI  into  the  alleged  creation  of  a  false  market  and
price rigging in the scrip of Kamal Overseas Limited. Investigations brought out various
irregularities  in  the  preferential  issue  of  the  company  and  it  was  observed  that  money
shown  towards  application  /  allotment  was  not  actually  received  by  the  company  and
only a fraction of the amount received was circulated between various group entities time
and again for the purpose of showing payment towards allotment money.  The allotment
money was shown as brought in by means of fictitious book entries without infusion of
genuine funds and the shares were issued without receipt of consideration.  It was also
seen  that  preferential  shares  were  issued  much  after  the  expiry  of  validity  of
shareholders’ 
lock-in  period.
Investigations further revealed that certain entities tried to create a false market for the
shares through circular trading i.e. by making simultaneous sales and purchases, through
the counters of various brokers.  Investigations brought out that there was an attempt to
defraud  the  Clearing  Corporation  of  National  Stock  Exchange  (settlement  guarantee
scheme),  as  sellers  connived  with  the  buyers  and  created  large  buy  positions,  when
purchasers had no intention to honour the purchase obligation. Pursuant to the findings of
the investigations, enquiry proceedings were initiated against the brokers and sub-brokers
and actions are being undertaken against the promoters and their abettors.  Trades were
annulled by the stock exchange

resolution  and  without  marking 

these  shares  for 

Maruti Organics Ltd

SEBI initiated investigation on the receipt of a reference from NSE alleging that there
was an attempt to defraud the clearing corporation of NSE by certain clients who built up
large  purchase  positions  and  then  vanished  without  paying  to  the  brokers  for  the
purchases  made  by  them.    It  was  also  alleged  that  sellers  and  buyers  connived  in  this
operation.    The  buying  position  was  built  up  across  the  country  i.e.  at  Ahmedabad,
Bangalore,  Mumbai,  Hyderabad,  Chennai,  etc.    Investigations  revealed  that  brokers  at
whose terminal buying positions were built up, were not acting diligently and failed to
obtain basic details such as address, reference, bank account of the client, etc.  It was also
seen  that  clients  were  allowed  to  trade  without  obtaining  margins  as  prescribed  by  the
SEBI  and  the  NSE.    Enquiry  proceedings  have  been  initiated  against  these  brokers.
Police authorities are looking for absconding clients and proceedings would be initiated
on tracing them.

ABS Industries Ltd.

Investigations were conducted by the SEBI into the alleged insider trading in the scrip of
ABS  Industries  Ltd.    It  was  seen  that  ABS  Industries  was  taken  over  by  the  Bayer
Industries  Ltd.  (BIL)  with  51  per  cent    holding.    In  order  to  achieve  this  objective,
preferential allotment was made to BIL and in addition, an open offer was given by BIL
to the shareholders of ABS Industries for acquiring 20 per  cent  holding.  Investigations
revealed that there were large purchases by a close relative of the Managing Director of
the company, prior to this public offer.  Investigations revealed that these purchases were
financed by the Managing Director.  The shares acquired from the open market were also
offered in the public offer by this relative alongwith companies of the Managing Director.
Investigations brought out that purchase of shares were made with the prior knowledge of
the  impending  tie-up/takeover  by  Bayer  Industries.    Show-cause  notice  was  issued  for
violation of the Insider Trading Regulations and proceedings are in progress.

Bestavision Electronics

Investigations  revealed  that  company  purchased  large  quantities  of  shares  through  its
front entities prior to coming out with the right issue at premium.  Investigations brought
out that these purchases were made with a view to create artificial market in the scrip of
the  company  and  to  increase  the  price  of  its  shares.    This  was  done  so  that  public  is
induced to invest in the rights issue, which was being brought out at premium.  Pursuant
to investigations, show cause notices were issued to the promoters and their front entities
asking  them  to  show  cause  why  suitable  directions  including  prohibiting  them  from
accessing  the  capital  market,  should  not  be  issued.    Enquiry  proceedings  have  been
initiated against the concerned brokers, merchant bankers, etc.
Baroda Agro  Industries Ltd.

Investigations  were  undertaken  by  the  SEBI  on  the  basis  of  complaints  alleging  that
shares allotted during the public issue on being sold, were declared by exchanges as bad
deliveries.  Investigations revealed that the company    had  allotted  shares  in  promoters’
quota which were actually under lock-in provision, without informing the investors and
without endorsing “subject to lock-in”  on the shares. These shares on being sold by the
allottees, were declared as bad deliveries.

Further, investigations revealed that the issue was not fully subscribed and the prices of
this  scrip  were  manipulated  by  some stock  brokers.  Pursuant  to  investigations,  enquiry
proceedings initiated against the brokers and merchant bankers to the issue involved in
the price rigging.  Prosecution proceedings initiated against the company and its directors
u/s 68 of the Companies Act, 1956.

Trident Steels Limited

Investigations  revealed  that  company  had  made  false  claims  of  dividend  payment  for
previous years in the prospectus to meet the requirement of dividend paying track record
for companies coming out with the public issue.  Further, there  were  other  material  of
misstatements  in  the  prospectus  such  as  pledge  of  large  quantity  of  shares  of  the
promoters  to  the  bank.    Action  was  initiated  against  merchant  banker  for  not  acting
diligently.  Suitable proceedings were initiated against the company / its directors etc.

Karwa Salt Refinery and Industries Ltd.

Investigations were undertaken by SEBI into the alleged irregularities in the public issue
and  price  manipulations  in  the  scrip  of  Karwa  Salt  Refinery  and  Industries  Ltd,
Hyderabad.  Investigations prima facie revealed that the issue did not receive the required
minimum  subscription  and  promoters  entered  into  a  financing  arrangement  for
circumventing this requirement.  The subscription was arranged with the understanding
that shares would be purchased back by the company from the allottees immediately after
completion of allotment process.  This also led to cornering of large quantity of shares in
the hand of promoters, which facilitated price rigging.

Investigations  also  brought  out  that  the  promoters  did  not  bring  the  contribution  as
required  under  the  SEBI  guidelines.  It  was  noticed  that  almost  the  entire  promoters’
contribution  was  shown  as  brought  in  by  means  of  “fictitious  book  entry”  without
genuine  infusion  of  funds.  Later,  on  listing  of  the  scrip  on  the  exchanges,  promoters
manipulated the prices of the scrip by continuous buying on the exchange.  Pursuant to
investigations, enquiry proceedings have been initiated against the registrars to the issue
and  also  the  stock  brokers  etc.    Show  cause  notices  have  also  been  issued  to  the
promoters and also other related entities.

Investigations brought out that promoters of Rajesh Exports, Elvis India Ltd., Ma-Leafin
&  Capital  Ltd.,  VR  Mathur  Mass  Communications  Ltd.  also  resorted  to  similar  issue
related  manipulations  i.e.  getting  the  issue  financed  through  ante-dated  stock  invests,
accepting applications after closure of the issue, buy-back of shares after the completion
of allotment process by the company with public issue funds.  Likewise, it was observed
that  prices  were  manipulated  in  the  case  of  Ideal  Hotels  &  Industries  Ltd.,  Hitek
Industries (Bihar) Ltd., Karwa Salt Refinery & Industries Ltd., Chabbra Land & Housing
Ltd., Barasia Holdings Ltd.

High Court of Gujarat - SEBI & Rich paints Ltd. vs. Kamlesh Jain & others

the Income Tax department attach the same.

High Court of Mumbai - The Stock Exchange, Mumbai vs. Vinay Bubna
The Supreme Court held that once a defaulting member ceases to be member, no interest
remains in the card and hence can not be considered as an asset. With regard to Rule 16
of BSE, the Supreme Court held that Rule 16 makes a provision for clearing the debts
etc., of erstwhile members which gives a hope to the credits. Hence Rule 16 of BSE is not
illegal or arbitrary.

The petitioner was not allotted shares in a public issue. The Court in this case held that
the SEBI does not have any such statutory duty to direct any company to issue shares.

PART III

FUNCTIONS OF SEBI IN RESPECT OF MATTERS SPECIFIED IN
SECTION  11  OF  THE  SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE  BOARD  OF
INDIA ACT, 1992

A]  REGULATION OF BUSINESS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGES

 Under  the  SEBI  Act,  1992,  SEBI  has  been  empowered  to  conduct  inspection  of  stock
exchanges. The SEBI has been inspecting all the stock exchanges once every year since
1995-96.  However,  in  view  of  the  low/insignificant  turnover  recorded  at  the  OTCEI,
Saurashtra-Kutch,  MadhyaPradesh,  Jaipur,  Mangalore,  Magadh,  Bhubaneswar  and
Gauhati Stock Exchanges, these exchanges were not inspected during 1999-2000.
 
 During these inspections, a review of the market operations, organisational structure and
administrative control of the exchange is made to ascertain whether:
 
•  the exchange provides a fair, equitable and growing market to investors
•  the  exchange’s  organisation,  systems  and  practices  are  in  accordance  with  the

Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SC(R) Act), 1956 and rules framed thereunder
•  the exchange has implemented the directions, guidelines and instructions issued by the

SEBI from time to time

•  the exchange has complied with the conditions, if any, imposed on it at the time of

renewal/ grant of its recognition under section 4 of the SC(R) Act, 1956.

 
 Based on the observations/suggestions made in the inspection reports, the exchanges are
advised to send a compliance report to the SEBI within one month of the receipt of the
inspection report by the exchange and thereafter quarterly reports indicating the progress
made  by  them  in  implementing  the  suggestions  contained  in  the  inspection  report.  The
SEBI  nominee  directors  and  public  representatives  on  the  governing  board/council  of
management  of  the  stock  exchanges  also  pursue  the  matters  in  the  meetings  of  the
governing  board/council  of  management.  If  the  performance  of  the  exchanges  whose
renewal of recognition is due, is not found satisfactory, SEBI grants further recognition
for  a  short  period  only,  subject  to  fulfillment  of  certain  conditions.  Further,  the
functioning of the exchanges are also being monitored through a Monthly Development
Report which the exchanges are required to submit to the SEBI every month.

 It was observed in the inspections conducted during 1998-99 and 1999-2000 that there
has been considerable improvement in the functioning of the exchanges relating to timely
settlement of trades, compulsory auction at the end of a settlement, adherence to Capital
Adequacy Norms, better monitoring of payment of margins by brokers, etc.

An important development in the  broking services is the diversified ownership structure
which has emerged recently.  It is observed that out of more than 9,192 brokers, 3,316
brokers  were  corporate  and  19  brokers  were  FIs.    Of  the  new  400  brokers  registered
during  1999-2000,  225  were  corporate,  10  brokers  were  composite  corporate  and  164
were  proprietors.    This  stratification  of  broker  services  can  be  expected  to  increase
healthier functioning of broker houses.  The corporatisation and institutionalisation of the
brokers should result in more organized and efficient services leading to healthier trading
and accounting standards (Table 3.4).

It  may  be  stated  that  brokers  in  many  cases  get  registered  at  more  than  one  stock
exchanges. It would be seen from table below that 493 brokers had membership at two
stock  exchanges  as  on  March  31,  2000  as  compared  to  444  brokers  with  double
memberships as on March 31, 1999.  It is seen that 61 members had membership at three
stock exchanges as on March 31, 2000 (Table 3.5 and 3.6).

9,192

There were 5675 sub-brokers registered as on March 31, 2000, as compared with 4589
sub-brokers in the previous year.  It would be seen from table below that 90 per cent of
the  total  sub-brokers  registered  with  the  SEBI  during  the  current  year  were  from  the
Stock Exchange, Mumbai and NSEIL.  The high concentration of sub-brokers at Mumbai
and NSEIL indicates skewed availability of brokers’  services at smaller stock exchanges
like  MadhyaPradesh,  Guwahati,  Managalore,  Magadh,  Coimbatore,  Ludhiana  etc.
probably due to non-availability of adequate business.  In these areas lack of sufficient
business  discourages  the  brokers  /  sub-brokers  to  take  up  thinly  available  broking
services. Sub-broker services are very crucial in educating the potential investors in the
primary as well as secondary market.

C]  REGISTRATION AND REGULATION OF MUTUAL FUNDS

Registration of mutual funds

During  the  year  under  review  registration  was  granted  to  3  new  mutual  funds  in  the
private sector out of which one is sponsored by a foreign entity. These mutual funds are -
KJMC Mutual Fund, ANZ Grindlays Mutual Fund and  ICICI Securities Fund. The GE
Mutual  Fund  (formerly  known  as  SRF  Mutual  Fund)  has  surrendered  the  certificate  of
registration on the advice of SEBI.  They have not launched any scheme and no funds
were collected from the public.

In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  the
SEBI has also cancelled the certificate of registration of 2 mutual funds viz. GFC Mutual
Fund  and  Asia  Pacific  Mutual  Fund  and  approval  granted  to  their  asset  management
companies have been withdrawn. These mutual funds  had not launched any schemes and
no funds were collected from the public.

During 1999-2000 the schemes of 3 mutual funds, viz.  ITC Threadneedle Mutual Fund,
Apple Mutual Fund and HB Mutual Fund migrated to Zurich India Mutual Fund, Birla
Mutual  Fund  and  Taurus  Mutual  Fund  respectively.  ITC  Threadneedle  Mutual  Fund,
Apple Mutual Fund and HB Mutual Fund surrendered their certificates of registration. In
case  of  HB  Mutual  Fund  and  Taurus  Mutual  Fund,  there  was  merger  of  their  asset
management companies and trustee companies

With  these  registrations  and  after  the  withdrawal/merger  of  some  mutual  funds,    there
were  a  total  of  37  mutual  funds,  (excluding  UTI)  operating  in  India  as  on  March  31,
2000.  Though  UTI  is  not  registered  with  SEBI,  there  is  an  arrangement  of  voluntary
compliance of regulations with the UTI. The details of mutual funds registered with SEBI
are given in Table 3.7.

Regulations, 1999

Upto  March  31,  2000,  which  was  the  extended  last  date  for  making  an  application  by
existing  collective  investment  entities,  the  SEBI  has  received  applications  for  grant  of
certificate of registration from 35 existing entities, who had earlier filed information with
the Board.  In addition, 2 entities who had earlier not filed information with the Board
have also applied for registration (Table 3.8).

D]  FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES

After enacting the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to
the  securities  market)  Regulations,  which  enabled  SEBI  to  investigate  into  market
manipulations and fraudulent and unfair trade practices, vigorous efforts were undertaken
to 
the
manipulators/violators.   During 1999-2000, 47 cases were taken up for alleged market
manipulation  and  price  rigging;  2  cases  were  taken  up  for  alleged  “issue”  related
manipulation, etc.  The details of the same have been elaborated in Part II of the report.

During 1999-2000, 3 new cases were taken up. Inquiries/Investigations were completed
in five cases of insider trading during the year under review.  Show cause notices were
issued to the insiders pursuant to successful investigations in one case.  On full working
of  the  Stock  Watch  System,  which  was  put  in  place,  surveillance  over  insider  trading
would be further strengthened.

F]  SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF SHARES AND

TAKE-OVERS

SEBI has taken up one case of alleged violation of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of
Shares and Take-overs)  Regulations,  1997.    Inquiries/Investigations  were  completed  in
four other cases and pursuant to investigations, adjudication proceedings were initiated in
16 cases and further proceedings under the regulations are in progress.

In addition to the draft offer document submitted to the SEBI, final prospectus filed with
Registrar of companies can also be accessed on the SEBI web site. This step was taken to
offer easier and faster dissemination of information regarding the issue to the investing
public all over the country.

H]  INSPECTION AND INQUIRIES

Merchant bankers:

Merchant bankers and underwriters

An inspection of Systematics Corporate Services Ltd.,  Chennai, was conducted in terms
of  Regulation  29  (1)  of  SEBI  (Merchant  Bankers  )  Regulations.,  1992  with  particular
reference to due diligence exercised in respect of the issues lead managed by them.  The
Report is under consideration of the Board.

Inspection and enquries – stock brokers and sub brokers

Section 11(2) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 provides that SEBI
shall register and regulate the working of stock brokers and sub brokers. In fulfillment of
the above objective, the SEBI carries out inspections of the books and records of stock
brokers to verify whether:

Page 146 of 17165

•  Books  of  accounts,  records  and  other  documents  are  being  maintained  in  a  manner
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957  and  SEBI

specified  by 
(StockBrokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992.
 The provisions of the SEBI Act, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act and the
provisions made thereunder are being complied with by the broker.

•  Adequate steps for redressal  of  grievances  of  the  investors  are  being  taken  and  the

• 

conditions of registration as a stock broker are complied with.

As 9192 brokers and 5283 sub-brokers are registered with SEBI, it is difficult for SEBI to
inspect  all  the  brokers  with  its  limited  resources.    Brokers  are  therefore  selected  for
inspection  on  sample  basis  by  the  SEBI.    Apart  from  SEBI,  stock  exchanges  as  self-
regulatory organizations are also expected to carry out inspection of 10 per cent  of their
respective active member-brokers.

During 1999-2000, 80 brokers from the 14 exchanges across the country were inspected
by the SEBI.   The SEBI inspected the brokers of fewer exchanges this year, as most of
the  smaller  exchanges  had  very  little  trading  activities  and  very  few  active  trading
members.  A sample of brokers was selected for the inspection from the medium to big
exchanges.

For inspection of brokers of BSE and NSE, the services of Chartered Accountants were
availed,  whereas  officers  of  SEBI  undertook  inspection  of  brokers  of  other  stock
exchanges.  During the inspection, following features were observed:

i. 

ii. 

Brokers  of  regional  stock  exchanges  were  hit  hard  by  sharp  slump  in  their
business.  Many of them were either out of business or working for the brokers of
bigger Stock Exchanges or have taken the terminals of BSE and NSE members.
Due to boom in the latter part of the year, clientele business in general had picked
up .
Brokers and investors were trading mainly to avail of the benefit of arbitrage.

iii. 
iv.  Most  of  the  brokers  computerised  their  books  of  accounts  and  other  relevant

records
Subsequent to dematerialisation of most actively traded scrips, the problem of bad
delivery faced by the brokers has gone down substantially.

v. 

vi.  Most of the large stock broking houses are providing the services as DP.
vii. 

Equity research has started to gain prominence again.

Common irregularities noticed in certain cases during inspection were the following:

i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
v. 

Non-issuance of Contract notes.
Non segregation of clients and own funds.
Client database and agreement with clients not maintained/entered.
Dealing with unregistered sub brokers.
Non reporting of ‘off the floor transactions’  to the Exchange.

Page 147 of 17165

Inspections of brokers conducted by the SEBI from time to time have resulted in better
compliance to SEBI Rules/Regulations/Circulars by them.

A comparative statement of inspection of brokers carried out during the year, enquiries
ordered and their outcomes for the year 1998-99 and 1999-2000 are given in the Table
3.9.

From the table it may be noticed that a number of enquiries ordered during 1999-2000
showed a significant fall over the previous year’s level.  This was mainly on account of
199 enquiry orders in the previous year initiated against brokers who had failed to fulfil
the underwriting devolvement in various issues.

The number of cases where no action has been taken stands at 43, out of which 35 relates
to  enquiry  against  brokers  who  had  failed  to  fulfil  the  underwriting  devolvement  in
various issues.

Inspection of mutual funds

Since mutual funds have become important mobilser of savings from the markte and they
invest  in  wide  range  of  instruments  in  the  securities,  their  continuous  monitoring  is
important for the protection of investors.  Hence the SEBI took disciplinary action against
a number of mutual funds in the year 1999-2000, the details of which are given in the
following table 3.10.

Inspections of 33 active mutual funds (including UTI) was ordered during the year to be
carried  out  by  independent  chartered  accountancy  firms  covering  the  period  till  March
1999.

Two separate adjudication proceedings were ordered against Taurus Mutual Fund. The
Fund’s  investments  in unrated fixed income securities were not in accordance with the
disclosures  made  in  the  offer  document  and  also  the  redemption/  repurchase  proceeds
were not dispatched within the statutory time limit and there were inadequate disclosures
in the abridged audited balanced sheet. Adjudication cases were referred against Canbank
Mutual  Fund  and  Kothari  Pioneer  Mutual  Fund  for  inadequate  disclosures  in  offer
documents  and  against  Shriram  Mutual  Fund  for  delay  in  despatch  of  repurchase
proceeds for which it was also advised to pay interest to the investors.

In the case relating to irregularities in the dealings of Shriram Mutual Fund in the scrip of
Videocon  International  Ltd.  during  June  1998,  the  Adjudicating  &  Enquiry  Officer
imposed  a  penalty  of  Rs.5  lakh  on  Shriram  Asset  Management  Company  Ltd.  under
section 15 I of the SEBI Act for having violated the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations.
The  SEBI  also  ordered  the  sponsors  of  Shriram  Mutual  Fund,  under  the  provisions  of
SEBI Act, 1992, to pay towards the corpus of the concerned schemes of mutual fund a
sum of Rs. 25,62,750 with 15 per cent interest per annum, being the loss caused to the
unitholders.  The  SEBI  also  directed  two  officials  of  the  Asset  Management  Company
(AMC) of the mutual fund to resign from the AMC. The SEBI further directed that its
managing director shall not be eligible to hold any public position in any capital market
related public institution for a period of 3 years w.e.f. February 1, 2000. The SEBI also
directed to change the composition of the board of trustees. According to which, at least
three trustees out of existing four trustees had to step down within a month of receipt of
the order. The remaining one trustee would continue to hold office for a year to ensure
smooth takeover by the new board and for the sake of continuity of operations and would
have to step down after the expiry of one year from the date of constitution of the new
board of trustees.

Warning/deficiency  letters  were  issued  to  26  mutual  funds  on  the  basis  of  findings  of
inspection  reports,  delay  in  submission  of  periodical  reports,  non-exercise  of  due
diligence in drafting the offer document, not providing factually correct information to
SEBI on the status of directors of trustee company – “independent”  or “associates, delay
in the despatch of redemption proceeds (i.e. beyond time stipulated in the Regulations),
misleading  advertisements,  exceeding  5  per  cent    limit  with  respect  to  transactions
through  associate  brokers  during  a  quarter  and  non-disclosure  of  amount  of  brokerage
paid to associate brokers in the annual accounts.

Page 149 of 17165

The  SEBI  had  prohibited  GFC  Mutual  Fund  and  Asia  Pacific  Mutual  Fund    from
launching  any  scheme  under  Section  11B  of  the  SEBI  Act    in  June  1997  and  October
1997 respectively after RBI prohibited their sponsors which were NBFCs from accepting
any  deposits  and  disposing  off  any  of  their  assets.  Both  the  mutual  funds  have  not
launched  any  scheme  since  registration.  In  accordance  with  the  Regulations,  their
certificates of registration were cancelled.

In all Four mutual funds viz. Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund, Sun F&C Mutual Fund, SBI
Mutual Fund and Alliance Capital Mutual Fund were advised to withdraw advertisements
as  these  were  misleading  or  the  disclosures  were  not  in  accordance  with  the
Advertisement Code.

The  SEBI  directed  the  AMCs  of  Taurus  Mutual  Fund,  IDBI  Mutual  Fund,  Reliance
Capital  Mutual  Fund  and  Shriram  Mutual  Fund  were  directed  to  pay  interest  to  the
unitholders at the rate of 15 per cent  for the delay in despatch of redemption/repurchase
proceeds. A total interest of Rs.17.24 lakh was paid to 14686 investors. The details of
amount paid and the number of investors who benefited are given in Table 3.11.

J]  RESEARCH AND OTHER STUDIES

The research department took a number of initiatives for completing studies / research
reports in 1999-2000. A tie-up was done with IIM, Ahmedabad and National Council of
Applied Economic Research (NCAER) for taking up research studies/projects in capital
market .

The SEBI had undertaken an Investors’  Survey in collaboration with the NCAER. The
report based on the results/data available from the survey, has already been prepared by
the research department of SEBI. The Department also completed a few studies which

‘Capital Market’  pertaining to the Economic Survey of Government of India and material
for  Annual  Report  of  Ministry  of  Finance,  Government  of  India  and  Reserve  Bank  of
India were prepared by the department. The Department provides research inputs to the
SEBI  Management  for  formulating  its  policies  besides  offering  faculty  assistance  to
outside  institutions.  The  SEBI  Monthly  Bulletin  is  being  prepared  regularly  which  is
available on SEBI website.

K]  OTHER FUNCTIONS

Rollover to year 2000

The SEBI had initiated steps in 1998 to co-ordinate and synchronize the efforts made by
the various agencies operating in the capital market to combat the Y2K problem in order
to ensure a smooth and unhampered transition into the next millennium. A time bound
schedule for implementation of a comprehensive plan to combat the Y2K problem was
drawn up by the SEBI and circulated to all the intermediaries functioning in the capital
market either directly or through SROs.  A detailed list of complaint and non-compliant
market intermediaries was also posted on SEBI's website.

The  SEBI  coordinated  the  Y2K  efforts  with  Government,  other  domestic  and
international  regulatory  agencies.  In  order  to  mitigate  global  concerns  over  capital
market's preparedness on the Year 2000 problem, the SEBI was also in touch with the
Joint Year 2000 Council and the IOSCO. The measures taken by the SEBI in this regard
were appreciated by the IOSCO.  Shri D.R. Mehta, Chairman, SEBI, was designated as
the representative of IOSCO to the Joint Year 2000 Council.

In order to mitigate the Y2K crisis, SEBI took the following pre-emptive measures:

•  All  the  stock  exchanges  were  asked  to  prepare  a  detailed  contingency  plans  for

themselves and the member brokers and forward it to SEBI .

• 

It was also decided that December 30, 1999 should be the last trading day of the last
trading cycle in the calendar year 1999 for all stock exchanges. This implied  that  all
outstanding  positions at the close of business on December 30, 1999, on all Stock

Page 152 of 17165

Exchanges    which  did    not  have  carry  forward  trading  facilities,  would  result  in
delivery. In the  Exchanges having  carry forward facilities;  outstanding positions,  as
determined  at the end of business on December 30, 1999, were allowed to be carried
forward to the next  settlement i.e. the first settlement in January 2000;

•  All the exchanges were directed to conduct mock trading sessions on January 1 and
January 2, 2000 to test all the systems including connectivity with depositories and
submit a report to the SEBI.

•  The exchanges were also asked to submit daily reports to the SEBI on actual trading
indicating  software problems if any, at the end of each day for the first trading cycle
commencing in the year 2000.

• 

• 

• 

• 

It was made mandatory for all intermediaries registered with the SEBI to keep hard
copies of all the current records pertaining to their own and their client's operations as
on December 30, 1999.

It  was  made  mandatory  for  all  the  listed  companies  to  disclose  their  Y2K
preparedness status in their quarterly reports.

In  order  to  ensure  a  smooth  rollover  to  the  year  2000,  the  SEBI  instructed  all  the
stock exchanges to conduct a mock trading session and test connectivity with clearing
houses and depositories.  Similarly other market players viz. mutual funds, registrars,
custodians etc. were also asked to test their systems and confirm smooth transition to
the year 2000.

In  the  light  of  these  instructions,  the  market  players  had  reported  a  smooth  and
disruption free roll over to the year 2000.  Brief details of the status of roll over to
year 2000 in respect of various capital market players are given below;

A. 

Stock exchanges

All the stock exchanges reported that Mock Trading and Settlement Session on January
1, 2000 covering trading system, settlement system, etc., was completed successfully.

The following stock exchanges viz. Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange, Coimbatore Stock
Exchange  which  are  Y2K  compliant  did  not  conduct  mock  trading  as  there  were  no
trading  activities  in  these  exchanges.  Gauhati  Stock  Exchange  did  not  conduct  mock
trading as the systems at the exchange had been reported as damaged due to fire.

B. 

 Depositories

Page 153 of 17165

Tests were undertaken by the two depositories- National Securities Depository Limited

potential Y2K related problems in the over all depository set-up. The roll over from year
1999 to year 2000 passed off smoothly for the depository system in India.

C. 

Custodians

After testing their internal system, all custodians reported that  the Year 2000 roll over
had  proceeded  satisfactorily  to  allow  the  normal  conduct  of  business.    The  external
linkages  and  connectivity  with  their  clients  and  global  custodians  was  found  to  be
functioning smoothly.

their core business.  They did not  come across any external factor affecting the ability to
conduct their business.

F. 

SEBI

All  the  Database  Servers,  Internet/Mail  Servers  and  the  Workstations  together  with
application  software  packages  installed  at  SEBI    made  a  smooth  transition  to  the
millennium  year  2000.    A  review  was  also  conducted  on  January  1,  2000  and  it  was
found that all the information technology related equipment functioned normally.

Trading  at  all  exchanges  was  conducted  normally  on  January  3,  2000  and  none  of  the
market intermediaries reported any disruption due to the Y2K problem.

Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India, IOSCO, Joint Year 2000 Council were

Grievances redressal – mutual funds

SEBI follows up the complaints of investors with mutual funds on a constant basis. Out
of  a  total  of  35,008    complaints  which  were  received  by  the  SEBI  against  20  mutual
funds  till  March  31,  2000,  33,371  complaints  were  redressed.  The  rate  of  redressal  of
investors’  grievances  by  mutual  funds  as  a  whole  is  95.32  per cent  .    UTI,  which
accounted for 67.15 per cent  of the total complaints, showed a redressal rate of 97.05 per
cent .

Investors’  grievances redressal – securities market

The SEBI has established a comprehensive investor grievances redressal mechanism. The
Investor  Grievances  Redressal  and  Guidance  Division  of  SEBI  assists  investors  who
prefer to make complaints to SEBI against companies. A standardized complaint format
is available at all SEBI offices and on the SEBI Website for the convenience of investors.
Each complaint received by the SEBI from the investors is acknowledged and a reference
number is sent to the complainant. Each complaint is taken up with the company and if
the  complaint  is  not  resolved  within  a  reasonable  time,  a  periodical  follow  up  is  also
made  with  the  company.  The  SEBI  officers  also  hold  meetings  with  the  company
officials  to  impress  upon  them  their  obligation  to  redress  the  grievances  of  investors.
Errant  companies  are  warned  of  stern  action  for  their  failure  to  redress  grievances.
Recalcitrant  companies  are  referred  for  prosecution.  The  SEBI  also  issues  fortnightly
press  release  for  public  information  on  the  status  of  redressal  of  investor  grievances
highlighting the companies against whom more than 1000 complaints are outstanding.

During the period 1991-92 to 1999-2000, the SEBI received 25,32,969 grievances from
investors against companies and the same were taken up by the SEBI with the concerned
companies  for redressal.  Of  this  a  total  of  24,16,218  grievances  were  redressed  by  the
companies, which indicates a redressal rate of 95.39 per cent . Further, during the year
1999-2000,  SEBI  received  98,605  grievances  from  the  investors  as  against  99,132
grievances  received  during  the  year  1998-99.    During  the  year  1999-2000,  1,46,553
complaints  were  redressed  by  the  companies  as  against  1,27,227  grievances  redressed
during the year 1998-99.  These redressed grievances include grievances pending from
the previous period.   The cumulative status of investor grievances received by the SEBI,
resolved  by  companies  and  the  redressal  rate  in  this  regard  from  the  year  1991-92  to
1999-2000 is furnished in the Table 3.13.

The data furnished above, reveal that there has been a sustained increase in the number of
investor grievances resolved through SEBI’s intervention, over the period of time.

In  order  to  ascertain  correct  status  of  redressal  of  grievances,  the  SEBI  has  been
conducting an exercise of sending reply paid post cards to investors requesting them to
reply as to whether their complaint has been resolved by the companies or not.   During
the  year  1999-2000,  the  SEBI  sent  78,239  reply  paid  post  cards  to  investors  whose
grievances were pending with SEBI head office as on March 31, 1999.  A total of 49,513
postcards were received  back of which 3451 replied that the complaints were resolved
and 45044 replied that the complaints were not resolved.

Activities of vigilance division

The ever increasing role of SEBI as regulator and supervisor in the Securities Markets
has  necessitated  a  proactive  role  to  be  played  by  Vigilance  division.    The  Vigilance
division  is  required  to  put  a  system  with  proper  checks  and  balances  for  ensuring  a
transparent decision making mechanism and also for ensuring that all the decisions are
fair, transparent and in consonance with the rules and regulations laid down from time to
time.

The  vigilance  set  up  in  SEBI  at  present  is  small.    It  is  gearing  up  to  strengthen  the
preventive  vigilance  activities.  The  foremost  objective  is  to  set  up  a  proper  vigilance
system  and  procedures  in  place.  It  acts  in  close  coordination  with  the  Personnel
Department  to  prevent  instances  of  financial  irregularities,  misconduct  and  impropriety
by putting certain systems into place. The procedures for handling complaints are being
standardised.    The  division  is  also  coordinating  for  one  departmental  inquiry  which  is
being conducted against one officer.  The vigilance set up in SEBI ensures that all the
guidelines,  rules,  regulations  issued  by  Central  Vigilance  Commission  and  other
competent  authorities  are  followed  and  implemented.  The  division  coordinates  and
cooperates with other governmental agencies for ensuring fair and transparent policies in
the capital market.

Defaulting companies
During 1999-2000 also, periodic meetings were held by the SEBI officials with the CEOs
/  Compliance  Officers  of  the  companies  which  did  not  register  satisfactory  investor
grievance  redressal  position.  During  such  meetings,  the  SEBI  impressed  on  the
companies the need to redress the investor grievances with greater urgency.  The impact
of these meetings on the redressal rate of grievances has been found to be very good and
therefore SEBI has been undertaking this exercise on an on-going basis.
Investors’  associations
With  a  view  to  create  a  greater  degree  of  awareness  among  the  investors  leading  to  a
more  healthy,  transparent  and  efficient  securities  market  in  India,  the  SEBI  has  been
registering  Investors’  Associations.   During  1999-2000,  under  the  revised  criteria  for
registration which was finalized by the SEBI in consultation with the representatives of
Investors’  Associations, SEBI has renewed the registration of 6 Investors’  Associations
for  a  period  of  3  years  and  has  granted  provisional  Registration  to  1  Investors’
Association  for  a  period  of  1  year.  Accordingly,  as  on  March  31,  2000,  the  following
Investors’  Associations were registered with SEBI:

(a) All Body Corporate Shareholders’  Forum, Secunderabad.
(b) Consumer Education and Research Society, Ahmedabad.
(c) Jagrut Grahak Mandal, Patan (Gujarat)
(d) Kovai Investors’  Association, Coimbatore
(e) Tamil Nadu Investors’  Association, Chennai
(f)  The Gujarat Investors’  and Shareholders’  Association, Ahmedabad
(g) Investors’  Grievances Forum, Mumbai (Provisional registration for 1 year)

The recognized Investor’  Associations are eligible to draw a sum upto Rs. 1 Lac each per
year  from  SEBI  to  meet  their  expenses  on  conducting  seminars  related  to  securities
market,  publication  and  circulation  of  investor  education  material,  one  time  capital
expenditure towards setting  up  computer  terminals  and  installation  of  database  on
companies  and  internet  services.
Appointment of auditor
The Board approved amendments to provide for appointment of professional auditors for
inspection or investigation of books of accounts, documents, infrastructure systems of a
depository, participant, beneficial owner and issuer or its agent. The expenses including
fees paid to the auditors would be recovered from such entities.
Y2K preparedness project
During the year, which saw the change over to the year 2000, the SEBI had taken up the
task of ensuring that the intermediaries were Y2K compliant. The  SEBI had collected
information  through  questionnaires  in  a  phased  manner.    The  Registrars  who  were  not
Y2K  complaint  before  30/9/99  were  advised  not  to  undertake  fresh  assignments.  The
SEBI had also obtained confirmation from RTI as to smooth transition to the year 2000.

PART IV

ORGANISATIONAL  MATTERS  OF  THE  SECURITIES  AND
EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

Board

During the year 1999-2000 (April to March), four Board Meetings were held.

Human resources

As  on  March  31,  2000,  SEBI  had  196  Officers  and  161  Staff  Members  (Total  357)  in
various  other  cadres.    During  the  year,  the  Board  recruited  34  candidates  in  various
cadres.    Of  the  total  staff  357,  18  persons  belong  to  SC,  44  to  OBC  and  2  to  ST
categories.

Parliamentary committee

A  Study  Group  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Subordinate  Legislation,  Rajya  Sabha
under the Chairpersonship of Ms Saroj Khaparde held a meeting with the Chairman and
other Senior Officials of the Board at Mumbai on November 20, 1999.

Promotion of official language

While  regulating  the  capital  market,  the  SEBI  is  also  putting  in  vigorous  efforts  to
implement the Official Language Policy of the Government of India.    Thus, SEBI has
been  paying  due  attention  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  Official  Language
Policy of the Government of India, as applicable to the capital market and various related
institutions.   Development of capital market and implementation of the official language,
both are equally important for SEBI and thus the Board is making continuous efforts for
accomplishment of these objectives.

The  SEBI  has  also  been  making  available  its  various  publications,  regulations,
notifications and other useful material in bilingual form.   In order to educate and guide
the investors, the relevant material is also being made available in bilingual form.  Efforts
are also being made to get this material published in regional languages.

In a short span of its existence, the SEBI has been making available material of quality
for implementation of the official language in its offices and the capital market.   In this
direction, five publications viz. “Capital Market Guide”,  “SEBI – Rajbhasha Sahayika”,
“Rajbhasha  Sandarshika”,    “Hindi  Aashu-Tankan  Sandarshika”  and  “Vidhi  Karya
Sahayika – Vol.-I” have been made available in diglot form (Hindi and English), which is
one of the major achievements of the official language division of the Board.    These
publications  spell  out  the  Official  Language  Policy  of  the  Government  of  India  and
provide information regarding various aspects of the capital market in Hindi and English

Page 159 of 17165

too.      In  these  publications,  efforts  have  also  been  made  to  standardize  capital  market
glossary as well as to establish clear and well-organized systems, so that uniformity may
be  maintained  in  the  usage  of  various  words,  terms  and  phrases  used  in  the  Capital
Market.      SEBI  has  taken  a  lead  in  providing  computer  package  based  Hindi  material
which  is  useful  in  imparting  Hindi  typewriting  and  shorthand  training.    “Vidhi  Karya
Sahayika”  is also useful in discharging the legal work relating to various activities of the
capital market in Hindi.    The work of standardization and preparation of the technical
terminology of the capital market is in progress.

Efforts  are  also  being  made  for  further  progress  of  the  official  language  in  day  to  day
activities in various offices of the Board.   The Board is making valuable contribution in
various  programmes  organized  by  other  institutions  for  implementation  of  the  Official
Language.      The  SEBI  is  also  providing  expertise  to  various  institutions,  which  are
facilitating the preparation of educative material related to capital market in Hindi.   In
future also, the Board’s endeavour would always be to implement the Official Language
more effectively.

Premises

During the year 1999-2000, the SEBI incurred capital expenditure amounting to Rs.6.20
crore  towards  purchase  of  30  flats  from  Maharashtra  Housing  And  Area  Development
Authority, for its officers posted at Mumbai.  The SEBI continued its efforts in acquiring
residential accommodation for officers to allot residential accommodation to all eligible
officers posted at Head Office in Mumbai.

The SEBI was also in the process of acquiring suitable office space in Mumbai which can
meet its present and future requirements.  The SEBI provided office space to Securities
Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to start its functioning from its office premises in Mumbai.

Status of information technology in SEBI

The  SEBI  has  continuously  been  in  the  process  of  adopting  emerging  technologies  to
maintain the status of advanced users of the modern techniques.  During 1999-2000, the
SEBI  initiated  the  process  of  consolidation  of  databases  to  implement  effective
Management  Information  Systems  on  the  securities  market,  enhancement  of  Network
Communication and implementation of workflow applications.

SEBI’s databases

With the installation of state-of-the-art database servers, during the year 1999-2000, the
emphasis was given to migration and re-engineering of SEBI’s  internal  databases  from
legacy systems to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

The  internal  database  primarily  comprises  of  information  pertaining  to  initial  public
offers,  securities  market  intermediaries,  Investments  by  Foreign  Institutional  Investors
(FII),  investigations/action  taken,  legislation  matters,  Investor  Grievances  and  Internal

Page 160 of 17165

Administration.    Consequently  the  application  software  packages  have  been  developed
and  deployed  for  up-to-date  maintenance  of  these  databases.    A  suitable  security  and
audit  mechanism  has  also  been  implemented  to  protect  the  data  from  unauthorized
access.
With the strengthening of the team of IT Professionals at SEBI, the application software
development  is  being  done  in-house,  with  an  aim  to  provide  Executive  Information
System and to provide quick response to the departmental needs.
Networking
During the year 1999-2000, the Network Communication Systems were enhanced.  The
local area network (LAN) was established at all the regional offices for implementing the
basic  infrastructure  for  client-server  computing.    With  the  installation  of  LAN  at  the
Regional Offices, Database applications, E-mail, Internet and Intranet were all configured
in tandem with the head-office.
As  part  of  the  Wide  Area  Network  (WAN)  between  SEBI  offices  and  the  offices  in
Mumbai have been inter-connected by Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) link
for the unified Database Applications and Web access.  A feasibility study has also been
initiated to form a SEBI-Net linking Head-Office and the Regional Offices.
SEBI web site
As part of our constant endeavour in promoting the development of the securities market
by providing the latest information, the official web site of SEBI http://www.sebi.gov.in
was  enhanced  during  the  year  1999-2000.    The  enhancements  included  Daily  Market
Trends  pertaining  to  FII  and  Mutual  Funds,  Hosting  Draft  Prospectus,  SEBI  Bulletin,
Department-Wise Classification of Contents, etc.
Electronic office
Pursuing the philosophy of “Less Paper”  office, Intranet and workflow applications have
been implemented, featuring hosting of internal circulars, various application formats etc.
and enhancement of the correspondence tracking system. The Work has been initiated to
foster the knowledge base management, by way of electronic hosting of internal bulletin
and discussion forums.
During 1999-2000 state-of-the-art multimedia notebook computers equipped with latest
office automation tools for presentations and mobile computing were procured.
Year 2000 initiative
  
The  SEBI  has  taken  all  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  all  the  workstations,  Database
Servers,  Databases  and  Communication  equipment  installed  at  SEBI  are  Year  2000
compliant and also ensured that the roll over to the Millennium year was smooth.
