PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

Annual Report 2004-05

1. PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

The  primary  segment  of  the  capital
market  was  characterised  by  heightened
activities during 2004-05. Strong fundamentals
of  the  economy,  encouraging  corporate
results, buoyant secondary market, revival of
structural reforms by the government and an
investor  friendly  regulatory  framework
provided  by  SEBI  attracted  the  investors  to
the  primary  market.  Several  mega  issues
apart,  a  number  of  small  issues  entered  the
market.  There  has  been  overwhelming
response  to  most  of  the  public  issues  from
FIIs, other institutional investors and the retail
investors.  Large  number  of  the  issues  was
over-subscribed  indicating  the  quality  of
issues  and  the  appetite  for  public  issues  by
the investors. The post-listing performance of
most  of  the  IPOs  was  encouraging.  Unlike
the  previous  year,  the  private  sector
dominated  the  primary  market  during  2004-
05  and  mobilised  sizeable  amount  of
resources through public and rights issues.

I.

Capital Raised during 2004-05
The total amount of capital raised during
2004-05  through  public  and  rights  issues
(including offer for sale) stood at Rs. 28,256
crore  as  compared  to  Rs.  23,272  crore  in
2003-04,  an  increase  of  Rs.  4,984  crore  or
21.42  per  cent  over  the  year  (Table  2.1).

Excluding  offer  for  sale,  the  total  amount
mobilised  in  2004-05  was  Rs.  25,056  crore,
which was more than three times higher than
that  of  Rs. 8,023  crore  in  the  previous  year.
This indicates the revival of investors’ interest
in the primary market. The number of issues
was also higher at 60 in 2004-05 than that of
57  in  2003-04.  Out  of  60  issues,  34  were
public  issues  (consisting  of  23  IPOs  and  11
listed  issues)  and  the  remaining  26  were
rights issues.

The public issues continued to remain as
the  dominant  mode  of  resource  mobilisation
through which Rs. 24,640 crore was mobilised
in 2004-05 as compared with Rs. 22, 265 crore
in 2003-04, an increase of 10.7 per cent over
the year. However, the share of public issues
in the total amount mobilised declined to 87.2
per  cent  in  2004-05  from  95.7  per  cent  in
2003-04.  Of  the  total  public  issues  in  2004-
05,  Rs.13,749  crore  was  mobilised  through
the  IPO  route  and  Rs.10,891  crore  through
subsequent  issues  by  the  listed  companies
(Chart 2.1). There was a quantum jump in the
amount  mobilised  through  IPOs  in  2004-05
with  its  share  in  total  capital  moblised  rising
from  14.7  per  cent  to  48.7  per  cent.  All  the
public issues through IPOs were equity issues
while the listed companies mobilised Rs. 7,023
crore  through  equities  and  Rs.  3,867  crore
through debt instruments.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

During 2004-05, resource mobilisation
through rights issues was Rs.3,616 crore which
was three and half times higher than that of
Rs.1,007 crore in 2003-04. As there was an
exponential growth in the amount mobilised
through rights issues, their share in the total
amount mobilised jumped from 4.3 per cent in
2003-04 to 12.8 per cent in 2004-05.

The sector-wise classification shows that
the  private  sector  dominated  the  resource
mobilisation  efforts  in  2004-05  with  60.7  per
cent share in the total resource mobilisation,
followed  by  the  public  sector  with  39.3  per
cent (Table 2.2). The share of joint sector in
2004-05  was  nil.  In  2003-04,  the  shares  of
private, public and joint sectors were 15.5 per
cent,  80.2  per  cent  and  4.3  per  cent,
respectively.  Dominance  of  private  sector  in
the mobilisation of resources from the primary
market could be attributed to several factors
which  include, 
inter  alia,  resurgence  of
industrial activities, buoyancy in the secondary
market, downward rigidity in the lending rates
of  the  commercial  banks  and  investors’
confidence 
the  regulatory  system
(Chart 2.2).

II. Size and Composition of the

Issues
The size-wise distribution of capital raised
is  presented  in  Table  2.3.  While  the  number
of issues were more for issue sizes up to Rs.
100 crore, the amount mobilised continued to
remain  high  in  the  cluster  between  Rs. 100
crore and Rs. 500 crore. During 2004-05, there
were  2  issues  worth  Rs.3  crore  in  the  issue
category of less than Rs.5 crore compared to
6 issues worth Rs.16 crore in 2003-04. In the
issue  size  category  of  between  Rs.10  crore
and Rs.50 crore, there were 16 issues worth
Rs.330  crore  in  2003-04  which  improved  to
17 issues worth Rs.461 crore in 2004-05, an
increase of 39.7 per cent. The highest increase
was  in  the  range  of  Rs.50  crore  to  Rs.100
crore,  within  which  11  issues  worth  Rs.723
crore  was  raised  in  2004-05  compared  to  5
issues  worth  Rs.351  crore  in  2003-04,  an
increase  of  106.0  per  cent.  The  amount
mobilised in the issue size category between
Rs.100  crore  and  Rs.500  crore  declined  by
21.4 per cent to Rs.3,594 crore in 2004-05 as
compared with Rs.4,571 crore in 2003-04. The
amount mobilised in the above Rs.500 crore

Rs.23,431  crore  in  2004-05  as  against
Rs.17,968  crore  in  2003-04.  The  share  of
above  Rs.500  crore  category  in  the  total
resource mobilisation rose from 77.2 per cent
in 2003-04 to 82.9 per cent in 2004-05.

There  were  11  large  issues  of  Rs.  300
crore and above, accounting for 87 per cent
of  the  total  resources  mobilised  in  2004-05
(Table 2.4). The highest amount mobilised by
a  single  public  issue  was  that  of  NTPC  at
Rs.  5,368  crore,  accounting  for  22  per  cent
of  large  issue  mobilisation  and  19  per  cent
of  the  total  resource  mobilisation  during  the

year  under  review.  There  were  seven  mega
issues  above  Rs.1,000  crore  which  together
constituted  80  per  cent  of  the  total  resource
mobilisation.

III.

Industry-wise Resource
Mobilisation
Industry-wise, banking/financial institution
sector  mobilised  the  largest  amount  of
resources  in  2004-05,  both  in  terms  of
number  of  issues  and  amount  mobilised
(Table  2.5).  There  were  12  issues  worth
Rs.11,311  crore  in  2004-05  by  the  banking/
financial  institution  sector  compared  to  11
issues  worth  Rs.5,428  crore  in  2003-04,  an

crore  in  2004-05  as  compared  with  Rs.804
crore  through  9  issues  in  2003-04.  Though
there was a decline in the number of issues
by  the  IT  sector,  the  amount  mobilised  rose
sharply by more than six times. Other sectors
that witnessed relatively larger increase in the
amount  mobilised  in  2004-05  over  2003-04
were cement and construction industry, food
processing,  healthcare  etc.  There  were  no
issues  in  the  textile  sector  in  2004-05  as
against  4  issues  worth  Rs.61  crore  in  2003-
04. The amount mobilised by the engineering
sector, electronics sector and chemical sector
declined considerably in 2004-05 by 86.6 per
cent,  75.3  per  cent  and  75.4  per  cent,
respectively over the previous year.

2. SECONDARY SECURITIES

MARKET

I.

Equity Market : An Overview
The 

Indian  stock  market,  which
witnessed a strong rally in 2003-04, continued
to  maintain  its  momentum  during  2004-05
except  subdued  condition  witnessed  in  the

first quarter of the year. Barring a temporary
phase  of  turbulent  condition  around  the
middle of May 2004, the stock market in India
gradually  gathered  momentum  with
benchmark BSE Sensex crossing 6000-mark
on  November  17,  2004  and  reached  an  all-
time high of 6915.05 on March 8, 2005 before
closing at 6492.82 on March 31, 2005 (Table
2.7 and Chart 2.3). On a point to point basis,
the BSE Sensex posted a return of 16.1 per
cent  in  2004-05  on  top  of  83.4  per  cent  in
2003-04.  The  S&P  CNX  Nifty  also  recorded
a gain of 14.9 per cent in 2004-05 over and
above  the  gain  of  81.2  per  cent  in  2003-04.
On an average basis, the returns in 2004-05
were  at  27.8  per  cent  and  26.5  per  cent  for
BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty, respectively.
The buoyancy in the stock market was broad
based. The price appreciation in terms of S&P
CNX 500 was still higher at 21.6 per cent on
a  point  to  point  basis  and  34.2  per  cent  on
an  average  basis.  The  highest  price
appreciation was witnessed in S&P CNX Mid-
cap  (73.5  per  cent).  Strong  macroeconomic
outlook,  encouraging  corporate  results,  high
and  sustained  portfolio  investments  by  the

foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and sector-
specific  developments  contributed  to  the
sustained rally in the stock market. However,
intermittent  profit  booking  was  observed
particularly  towards  the  end  of  2004-05,
mostly  influenced  by  acceleration  in  the
international  prices  of  crude  oil  and  rise  in

the US interest rates. Trends in international
markets as well as domestic inflation rate also
adversely affected the market sentiment.

In  consonance  with  buoyancy  in  the
stock market, the turnover as well as market
capitalisation  rose  significantly.  Increase  in
turnover  was  more  pronounced  in  case  of

derivatives. The BSE market capitalisation as
a percentage to GDP rose from 43.5 per cent
at the end of March 2004 to 54.6 per cent at
the  end  of  March  2005.  Despite  sharp
increase  in  share  prices,  the  price-earning
(P/E)  ratio  declined  modestly  which  can  be
partly attributed to improved profitability by the
corporate sector. With effect from December
20,  2004,  the  P/E  ratio  of  BSE  has  been
computed on the basis of four-quarter moving
average of profitability of the company instead
of year-end (balance sheet) profit used earlier.
This is in conformity with the international best
practices.  At  the  current  level  of  P/E  ratio,
the  Indian  stocks  appear  to  be  attractive,
although  India’s  P/E  ratio  was  one  of  the
highest in the emerging markets. The volatility
measured  in  terms  of  annualised  standard
deviation  was  modestly  higher  in  2004-05
than that in the previous year.

The  movement  of  major  stock  indices
and  the  monthly  returns  indicate  that  stock

market  was  highly  turbulent  in  May  2004
mainly  due  to  politically  uncertainty  (Table
2.8).  On  May  17,  2004,  the  BSE  Sensex
crashed by 564 points or 11.13 per cent over
its  previous  close.  The  intra-day  fall  on  that
day  was  as  high  as  842  points,  the  highest
in the history of BSE. The nation-wide circuit
breaker  was  triggered  suspending  trading
twice on the day. The subdued conditions in
the  international  market  also  weakened  the
market  sentiment  further.  SEBI  responded
quickly to contain volatility and impart orderly
condition to the capital market. Despite severe
setback to the market, there was no payment
default.  As  the  fundamentals  were  strong,
stock markets recovered quickly and normalcy
was  restored  within  a  short  period.  The
recovery  in  the  stock  market  was  sustained
except for periodic consolidation. The monthly
returns  were  positive  consecutively  for  the
next  seven  months.  The  benchmark  stock
indices closed at a historic high on March 8,

Annual Report 2004-05

2005.  The  BSE  Sensex  was  close  to  7000
mark in the intra-day trade on March 9, 2005.
Market was volatile during the last quarter of
the year mainly due to year-end consideration,
rise  in  international  crude  oil  prices  and
apprehension  about  acceleration  in  the
interest  rates  in  the  developed  countries,
particularly in the US.

The movement of the major international
indices  (normalised  to  100  as  on  March  31,
2004) indicate that BSE Sensex outperformed
most  of  the  indices  such  as  Dow  Jones
Industrial  of  USA,  the  DJ  Stoxx  of  Europe
and  Shanghai  Composite  of  China  (Chart
2.4). The volatility as measured by standard
deviation  was  higher  in  India  than  that  in
major international markets. The Indian stock
markets  witnessed  high  volatility  due  to
exceptional events.

II. Performance of Sectoral Indices

Different  sectors  of  the  economy  grew
at  varied  pace.  Depending  upon  the  macro
economic  policies  and  the  current  business
environment,  certain  sectors  led  the  real

economic  growth.  The  services  sector  has
been leading the overall GDP growth during
the post-liberalisation period. If stock markets
are  to  reflect  the  economic  fundamentals  in
the  long-run,  returns  generated  by  sectoral
stock  indices  should  trace  the  growth  rates
of  the  respective  sectors.  The  S&P  CNX  IT
index  grew  by  50.9  per  cent  on  a  point-to-
point basis in 2004-05, much higher than that
of 29.4 per cent in 2003-04 (Table 2.9). This
is  corroborated  by  8.6  per  cent  growth
recorded by services sector during the same
period. The BSE capital goods index gained
by 39.9 per cent in 2004-05 on top of 147.2
per  cent  in  the  previous  year.  Performance
of  PSU  and  FMCG  was  lower  than  that  of
BSE Sensex (Chart 2.5).

Monthly  returns  of  sectoral  indices
present a mixed picture. The highest gain in
sectoral  indices  (on  a  1-month  horizon)  was
noticed in case of CNX Bank (21.5 per cent
in  November  2004).  The  losses  were
maximum in CNX PSE, CNX Bank, and BSE
capital goods in the month of May 2004. The
banking  sector  was  among  the  top  gainers

as  well  as  losers,  exhibiting  a  highly  volatile
behaviour  throughout  the  year.  Returns  in
CNX  Mid-cap  and  CNX  IT  have  recorded
monthly highs of 13.0 per cent and 12.4 per

cent,  respectively.  This  stands  in  contrast  to
the yearly returns of 73 per cent and 50 per
cent posted by these indices. Although short
term volatile gains were observed in different

sectors,  CNX  Mid-cap  and  CNX  IT  have
amply  rewarded  the  medium  term  investors
with a 1-year horizon.

III. Turnover in the Indian Stock

Market
The total turnover in all stock exchanges
rose  modestly  by  2.86  per  cent  in  2004-05
as  compared  with  67.25  per  cent  in  the
previous year (Table 2.10). The NSE and BSE
combine accounted for more than 99 per cent
of the total turnover in 2004-05.The turnover
at  BSE  and  NSE  rose  by  3.2  per  cent  and

3.7  per  cent,  respectively  in  2004-05  on  top
of  60.0  per  cent  and  77.9  per  cent  in  the
previous  year  (Table  2.11).  Month-wise,  the
BSE recorded the highest turnover in March
2005  (Rs.  59,528  crore)  followed  by
December  2004  (Rs.50,226  crore)  while  the
NSE  recorded  the  highest  turnover  in
December 2004 (Rs. 1,15,593 crore) followed
by  March  2005  (Rs.1,13,055  crore).  In
percentage  term,  the  highest  increase  in
turnover  over  the  previous  month  was
observed in December 2004 in case of both
the major exchanges.

IV. Market Capitalisation

Widening  the  geographical  reach  of
capital  markets  is  one  of  the  avowed
objectives  of  development  of  securities
markets  in  India.  Besides  the  regulation
aspect  of  securities  market,  development  of
market infrastructure and automated systems
has  been  high  on  the  agenda  of  the
regulatory agency. It is believed that securities
market  can  generate  a  nation-wide  interest
on  the  pillars  of  a  transparent  and  efficient
securities  market.  On-line  trading  facilities,
dematerialised  securities  and  electronic  IPO
application system are a few of the features
that  catalyse  the  penetration  of  stock
investment  culture  into  the  farthest  corners
of  a  diverse  nation  like  India.  The  financial
hub at Mumbai accounted for 56 per cent of
stock turnover, while Delhi region accounted
for  11  per  cent  of  business  during  2004-05.
Among the other metropolitan cities, Kolkata
accounted for 9 per cent, but Chennai shared
a meagre 2 per cent (Table 2.12).

The  market  capitalisation  indicates  the
size  of  capital  market.  Moreover,  it  acts  as
an indicator of the amount of notional wealth
generated, though all of it cannot be realised.
The market capitalisation increased by more
than  41  per  cent  by  the  end  of  2004-05  for
both  BSE  and  NSE  over  the  previous  year
(Tables  2.13  and  2.14).  In  absolute  terms,
market  capitalisation  at  BSE  was  higher  at
Rs. 16,98,428 crore than that of NSE at Rs.
15,85,585 crore on March 31, 2005. A higher
market  capitalisation  implies  the  larger
number of active scrips at BSE during 2004-
05.  Market  capitalisation  of  the  shares
included in S&P CNX Nifty rose by a higher
margin of 49 per cent during the financial year
as compared with 41 per cent increase in the
total market capitalisation of NSE. Hence, the
valuation  of  Nifty  scrips  has  risen  faster  as
compared  to  the  whole  of  NSE.  The  market
capitalisation  in  BSE  Teck  recorded  an
impressive  increase  of  94.7  per  cent  in

previous  year.  In  NSE,  the  IT  sector
witnessed  still  higher  increase  in  market
capitalisation (120.2 per cent).

V. Activities in Regional Stock

Exchanges

All the 22 stock exchanges in India are
geographically  widespread.  However,  other
than  NSE,  BSE,  Ahmedabad,  Calcutta  and
UPSE,  the  remaining  exchanges  had
negligible or nil turnover. During 2004-05, the
total turnover at regional exchanges increased
by 4 per cent over the previous financial year.
Many brokers of regional exchanges trade on
the terminals of NSE and/or BSE through their
regional  subsidiary.  The  trading  details  of
subsidiaries  of  regional  exchanges  are
provided  in  Tables  2.15  to  2.17.  Trading  on
subsidiaries has recorded a substantial jump
in  the  case  of  a  few  regional  exchanges.
Subsidiary of Delhi Stock Exchange witnessed
a rise in turnover by 113 per cent while that

of Bangalore Stock Exchange recorded a rise
of  48  per  cent.  The  number  of  total  brokers
declined  in  most  of  the  stock  exchanges
except  Bangalore,  BSE,  Delhi,  Inter-
connected  Stock  Exchange,  Magadh  and
NSE  where  there  were  marginal  increase.
Barring  NSE  and  BSE,  active  brokers  were
much less than the total brokers (Table 2.16).

While the all-India turnover increased by
3  per  cent,  the  number  of  shares  traded
increased  by  14  per  cent  in  2004-05.  Again
quantity  of  shares  delivered  increased  by  a
substantial 23 per cent and the value of total
delivered  shares  increased  by  19  per  cent.
Thus  lower  value  shares  have  traded  with
higher frequency as compared to the previous
financial year.

VI. Trading Frequency

The  fulfillment  of  listing  requirements
does  not  ensure  liquidity  of  scrips  unless
frequently  traded  in  the  stock  exchanges.

* Figures received from various stock exchanges.

Therefore,  frequency  of  trading  assumes
significance  as  an  indicator  of  liquidity.  As
indicated earlier, although India has 22 stock
exchanges,  BSE  and  NSE  together  account
for more than 99 per cent of the total turnover.
Therefore,  trading  frequency  of  listed  scrips
is analysed in respect of BSE and NSE. The
trading  frequency  improved  in  2004-05  over
that  of  the  previous  year  (Table  2.18).  The
number  of  shares  traded  on  BSE  and  NSE
were  higher  at  2,906  and  856,  respectively
than those of 2,610 and 804 in the previous

year.  The  number  of  shares  traded  on  BSE
for  more  than  100  days  rose  from  1,960  in
2003-04  to  2,368  in  2004-05.  Similarly,  the
number  of  shares  traded  on  NSE  for  more
than  100  days  increased  from  741  to  818
during  the  same  period.  The  actively  traded
shares above 100 days as percentage to total
traded shares also rose considerably in both
the exchanges. Another positive development
was  that  the  percentage  of  stocks  that  are
traded for 30 days or less, declined in 2004-
05 over the previous year.

VII. Capital Market Indicators

The ratios such as market capitalisation
to  GDP  (m-cap  ratio),  traded  value  to  GDP
(traded  value  ratio)  and  price  to  earning  per
share (P/E ratio) are monitored to gauge the
extent  of  development  of  stock  market.  The
m-cap ratio, which was 23.2 per cent in 2002-
03,  more  than  doubled  to  43.5  per  cent  in
2003-04  and  further  increased  to  54.6  per

cent  in  2004-05  (Table  2.19).  Similarly,  the
traded value ratio in the cash segment went
up from 39.3 per cent in 2002-03 to 58.7 per
cent  in  2003-04,  before  slightly  declining  to
53.6  per  cent  in  2004-05.  However,  the
turnover in derivative segment as percentage
to  GDP  rose  persistently  from  17.9  per  cent
in  2002-03  to  77.6  per  cent  in  2003-04  and
further to 82.5 per cent in 2004-05.

Annual Report 2004-05

During the upswing of a business cycle,
P/E  ratio  has  a  general  tendency  to  fall.
Following  global  recovery,  the  P/E  ratio,  in
fact, declined in most of the countries despite
higher  security  prices  (Chart  2.6).  Similar  to
the  international  trend,  the  P/E  ratio  relating

to  benchmark  indices  also  declined  in  India
(Table 2.20). This is an indication that market
has  the  potential  to  grow  further.  However,
the  P/E  ratios  relating  to  major  sectoral
indices such as Mid-cap, IT were higher than
those in the previous year.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

Month-wise,  the  P/E  ratio  shows  that
CNX  IT  index  witnessed  consistently  higher
P/E  ratio  above  30  with  the  highest  (51.14)
by  end-March  2005.  As  compared  to  the  IT
index,  the  CNX  Bank  had  low  P/E  ratio  at
approximately 10 with highest of 11.0 at end-
April 2004.

The  P/B  ratio  is  an  indicator  of  the
returns left for shareholders after providing for
liabilities  of  a  company.  Thus,  the  P/B  ratio
indicates  the  asset  quality  of  companies
pertaining  to  that  sector.  The  CNX  IT  index
recorded the highest P/B ratio of 11.3 at the
end of February and March 2005. The lowest
P/B  ratio  was  noticed  in  CNX  Bank  index
hovering around 2 (Table 2.21). A combination
of  rising  P/B  ratio  and  falling  P/E  ratio  in  a
buoyant  market  condition  offers  tremendous
scope for investment.

VIII. Volatility in Stock Markets

Volatility  measures  the  variability  of  the

price  of  an  asset.  Conventionally,  it  can  be
measured  in  terms  of  variance,  standard
deviation  or  coefficient  of  variation.  Several
sophisticated  econometric  techniques  could
also  be  applied  to  measure  volatility.  For
simplicity,  conventionally  used  measure  of
volatility such as standard deviation is relied
upon.  For  most  of  the  months  during  2004-
05, volatility in both the indices was less than
one  (Table  2.22).  The  highest  monthly
volatility  was  recorded  during  May  2004  at
3.8 per cent for the BSE Sensex and 4.2 per
cent  for  S&P  CNX  Nifty.  The  May  2004
volatility  captures  the  842  points  intra-day
slide in Sensex on May 17, 2004 when an 8
sigma  deviation  was  observed  in  Value-at-
Risk.  The  risk  management  systems,  that
were  put  in  place,  were  used  to  contain
volatility.  As  a  result,  payment  defaults  and
other  anomalies  did  not  occur  out  of  market
shock.  During  the  last  quarter  of  2004-05,
January  saw  the  highest  volatility  of  1.5  per
cent in Sensex and 1.7 per cent in Nifty index.

Volatility of International Indices:
A Comparison

Global  investors  explore  emerging
markets in search of higher returns and also
to reduce risk through portfolio diversification.
However, cross border flows entail a possible
contagion  in  the  event  of  a  financial
turbulence.  Hence,  at  times,  volatility  of
international markets moves in sync with each
other. The developed markets, in general, had
less  annualised  volatility  during  2004-05
compared  to  the  volatility  exhibited  by  the
emerging market economies (Chart 2.7). The
highest  volatility  among  developed  markets
was  observed  in  Nasdaq  (15.7  per  cent)
followed by Hang Seng Index (15.1 per cent)
and  the  lowest  volatility  was  in  AS30  Index
of  Australia  (6.8  per  cent).  Among  the
emerging  economies,  Russia  witnessed  the
highest annualised volatility of 36.4 per cent
while Malaysia had the lowest volatility of 10.2
per cent (Table 2.23).

A comparative picture of annual returns
on  indices  vis-à-vis  the  annualised  volatility
is  examined  (Table  2.24).  It  is  evident  from
Table  2.24  that  among  developed  markets,
with a low volatility of 6.8 per cent, Australia
posted  a  healthy  return  of  20  per  cent.
However, Hong Kong with a volatility of 15.1
per  cent  could  provide  only  a  6.6  per  cent
index  return  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  In
emerging  markets,  index  returns  trace  the
volatile  pattern  with  China  SHCOMP  index
sliding  by  32.2  per  cent  with  an  annualised
volatility  of  20.4  per  cent.  In  case  of  India,
both Sensex and Nifty posted positive returns
of  16.1  and  14.9  per  cent,  respectively  with
annualised volatility of 23.8 and 26.1 per cent,
respectively.  The  correlation  coefficient
between volatility and annualised return from
a  sample  of  19  countries  worked  out  to  be
negative  (-0.43).  A  high  level  of  return  from
stock market may be possible with low level
of volatility.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

IX. Dematerialisation

In  order  to  speed  up  the  transfer  and
ownership  of  securities  and  also  to  reduce
risks associated with transfer of shares, SEBI
has  pursued  the  policy  of  dematerialisation
since 1996. The number of companies signed
up  for  dematerialisation  in  NSDL  increased
from  5,216  in  2003-04  to  5,537  in  2004-05.
In case of CDSL, the number rose from 4,810
in 2003-04 to 5,068 in 2004-05. The number
of  companies  available  at  NSDL  for
dematerialisation  also  increased  from  5,212
in 2003-04 to 5,536 in 2004-05. The number
of  dematerialised  shares  in  NSDL  went  up
by  53.7  per  cent  to  12,86,630  lakh  in  2004-
05 from 8,36,935 lakh shares in 2003-04. In
CDSL,  the  number  of  shares  dematerialised
rose  by  36.2  per  cent  to  1,90,800  lakh  in
2004-05  as  compared  with  1,40,100  lakh  in
2003-04 (Table 2.25).

The  depository  participants  (DPs)  of
NSDL  were  available  at  340  cities  in  2004-
05 compared to 241 in 2003-04. Similarly, the
depository  participants  of  CDSL  were
available at 124 cities in 2004-05, higher than
that  of  108  in  2003-04.  In  terms  of  absolute
figures, the reach of DPs of NSDL and CDSL
increased by 99 and 16 locations, respectively
in 2004-05.

The  dematerialisation  process  in  bonds
and commercial paper was also accelerated
in 2004-05. The total value of dematerialised
bonds in NSDL rose from Rs.2,48,190 crore
in  2003-04  to  Rs.2,81,205  crore  in  2004-05,
an increase of 13.3 per cent (Table 2.26). The
total  value  of  dematerialised  commercial
paper also increased in NSDL from Rs.10,229
crore in 2003-04 to Rs.15,880 crore in 2004-
05, a rise of 55.2 per cent.

X. Derivatives Market in India

Investors  require  derivative  instruments
for  effective  risk  management.  Financial
derivatives  such  as  futures,  options  and
swaps  are  conventionally  used  by  the

investors for managing various types of risks.
Moreover, several hybrid derivative products
are also offered through financial engineering
which are tailor made to suit the requirements
of  the  clients.  The  underlying  assets  have
been  broadly  securities,  commodities  and
foreign  currencies.  The  commodity  and
currency related derivatives are regulated by
Forward  Market  Commission  and  RBI,
respectively, while SEBI regulates derivatives
on securities.

Indian  stock  market  provides  various
kinds of derivative instruments to investors for
hedging  and  investment  purposes.  The
trading  platform  in  derivative  instruments  is
offered  by  BSE  and  NSE  only.  Derivatives
trading began with the launch of index futures
in June 2000 followed by index options, single
stock options and single stock futures in 2001.
Interest  rate  futures  were  launched  in  June
2003. There is hardly any secondary market
trading in interest rate futures. The derivative
products have a monthly maturity cycle. From
September  13,  2004  onwards,  weekly  stock
and index options cycle was launched on the
derivative segment of BSE.

The combined turnover in derivatives in
both  the  exchanges  was  much  higher  than
the  combined  turnover  in  the  cash  segment
(Chart 2.8). The last four months of fiscal year
2004-05 saw higher derivatives turnover. The
picture is different if we take stock exchanges
individually.  The  turnover  of  derivatives  at

is  dominated  by  NSE  with  its  share  of  99.3
per  cent  in  the  turnover  as  well  as  in  the
number of transactions. The highest number
of derivative contracts was recorded in March
2005  and  the  lowest  in  November  2004.
Similarly,  the  highest  turnover  in  terms  of
notional  value  was  recorded  in  March  2005
and lowest in June 2004. The open interests

in  terms  of  number  of  contracts  as  well  as
notional  value  went  up  significantly  since
September 2004.

Product-wise,  single  stock  futures
continued to remain the most popular product
followed  by  index  futures,  stock  options  and
index options (Table 2.28, 2.29 and Chart 2.9).
As mentioned earlier, BSE introduced weekly

selected  stocks.  Thereafter,  there  was  a
significant  increase  in  the  turnover  of  index
options  in  BSE  (Tables  2.29  and  2.32).
However, stock options did not pick up. Month-
wise detail derivative transactions in BSE and

At  NSE,  there  were  418  trading
members  at  the  end  of  March  2005.  There
were 160 trading-cum clearing members and
96  trading-cum-self-clearing  members

(Table 2.34). At BSE, there were 198 trading
members  and  62  trading  cum  clearing
members  at  the  end  of  March  2005.  The
percentage  share  of  trading  cum  clearing
members  in  the  total  F&O  turnover  was  the
highest  for  all  the  months  in  2004-05.  It
increased from 45.7 per cent in April 2004 to
50.8 per cent in March 2005 (Table 2.35). The
trading  member  share  in  the  F&O  turnover
declined  from  32.4  per  cent  in  April  2004  to
25.8 per cent in March 2005.

Put  Call  Ratio  (PCR)  is  one  of  the
important  indicators  used  by  market
participants 
the  market
movements. Index put call ratio in fiscal year
2004-05  was  in  range  of  51-99  per  cent

in  gauging 

showing  that  number  of  calls  were  greater
than number of puts. In the last four months,
the  ratio  increased  with  range  bound  Nifty.
PCR for the stocks was much lower in range
of 23 to 39 per cent (Chart 2.10).

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

3. MUTUAL FUNDS

The  growth  of  mutual  fund  industry
globally can be accredited to increase in the
investment opportunities due to liberalisation
of  capital  markets  world-wide.  In  emerging
economies,  the  demand  for  mutual  fund
products is expected to increase further due
to  privatisation  of  the  pension  /insurance
systems.  Indian  investors  prefer  to  invest  in
capital  markets  through  some  institutional
structure having professional expertise in fund
management.

Net  resource  mobilisation  by  mutual
funds (MFs) declined by 95.3 per cent to Rs.
2,200  crore  in  2004-05  as  compared  with
Rs. 46,808 crore in the previous year (Table
2.36). The UTI Mutual Fund and other public
sector  mutual  funds  witnessed  net  outflows
of  Rs.2,722  crore  and  Rs.2,677  crore,
respectively in 2004-05 as against net inflow
of  Rs.1,667  crore  and  Rs.  2,597  crore  in
2003-04.  The  sectoral  shares  in  the  gross
mobilisation  and  redemption  indicate
dominance  of  private  sector  mutual  funds
(Chart  2.11).  However,  the  net  resource

mobilisation  by  private  sector  mutual  funds
came  down  significantly  in  2004-05.  The
major  reason  behind  such  performance  of
MFs  has  been  the  redemption  pressures
mainly  on  income  and  gilt  schemes.  In  an
environment  of  rising  interest  rates,  gilt
schemes lost some of its appeal. Part of the
proceeds  redeemed  from  the  mutual  fund
investments  might  have  been  reinvested  in
the  small  savings  schemes  due  to  attractive
rates  offered  by  the  Government  along  with
the fiscal incentives.

Scheme-wise, the gross amount of funds
mobilised  by  income  oriented  schemes
amounted to Rs. 7, 98,674 crore in 2004-05
whereas the amount mobilised by equity and
balanced  schemes  amounted  to  Rs.  37,280
crore and Rs. 3,755 crore, respectively. The
percentage  share  of  equity  and  balanced
schemes  together  in  gross  funds  mobilised
was 4.89 per cent only which was meager as
compared to income oriented schemes with a
share  of  95.11  per  cent.  Similar  trend  was
observed  in  case  of  repurchases  where
income schemes had a lion’s share of 96 per

$

Annual Report 2004-05

cent with gross redemption of Rs. 8, 03,918
crore.  There  was  a  net  outflow  of  Rs.  5,244
crore from income oriented schemes in 2004-
05. Equity and balanced schemes experienced
a  net  inflow  of  Rs.  7,100  crore  and  Rs.  345
crore, respectively during 2004-05.

The total assets under management went
up  by  7.2  per  cent  to  Rs.  1,49,600  crore  by
end  of  March  2005  from  Rs.  1,39,616  crore
as  on  March  31,  2004.  In  India,  the  assets
under equity funds are meagre as compared
to  debt  similar  to  many  other  emerging
markets.  Assets  under  income  and  debt
oriented 
India  were
Rs.  1,06,250  crore  (71.0  per  cent)  whereas
assets  under  equity  oriented  schemes  were
only Rs. 38, 483 crore (25.7 per cent). There
were 450 mutual fund schemes in total as on
March 31, 2005 of which, 227 were income/
debt  oriented  schemes,  188  were  growth/
equity  oriented  schemes  and  the  remaining
35 were balanced schemes (Table 2.37).

schemes 

in 

Break  up  of  schemes  into  open-ended
and  close-ended  schemes  shows  the
dominance  of  open  ended  schemes  (Table

2.38 and Chart 2.12). There were 403 open-
ended  schemes  of  which  200  were  income
oriented, 169 equity oriented and the rest 34
were  balanced  schemes  in  2004-05.  There
were  47  close-ended  schemes  of  which  27
were income oriented, 19 equity oriented and
only one was balanced scheme.

In  the  secondary  market,  mutual  funds
have  an  important  role  to  play.  Their  gross
purchases and sales (equity + debt) stood at
Rs.  1,07,232  crore  and  Rs.  89,796  crore,
respectively in the secondary market. The net
purchase  of  both  equity  and  debt  securities
by  Mutual  Funds  amounted  to  Rs.  17,435
crore in 2004-05 of which 97.4 per cent was
in  debt  (Table  2.39).  Another  important
institutional investor in the capital market was
the  Foreign  Institutional  Investors  (FIIs).
Comparing  both  the  classes  of  institutional
investors,  it  was  found  that  net  investment
by  mutual  funds  in  debt  at  Rs.  16,987  crore
was much higher than that by FII investment
at  Rs.  1,759  crore  (Table  2.40  and  Chart
2.13).  Reverse  was  the  case  with  equity
where net investment by FII was much higher
(Rs.44,123  crore)  as  compared  with  mutual

4. FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL

INVESTORS
Foreign  Institutional  Investors  (FIIs)
invest in various countries including emerging
markets  in  order  to  reduce  risk  through
portfolio  diversification  and  also  to  receive
additional returns. Country-specific factors are
important  determinants  of  such  institutional
investment.  Strong  macro-economic
fundamentals of the Indian economy coupled
with other positive factors like good corporate
results,  low  inflation,  abolition  of  long-term
capital  gains  tax,  transparent  regulatory
system,  etc.,  were  the  major  factors  which
influenced  the  FII  investment  in  India  during
2004-05. The total number of FIIs registered
with  SEBI  went  up  from  540  as  on  March
31,  2004  to  685  as  on  March  31,  2005,  an
increase of 145 over the year.

The FIIs continued to remain bullish on
the  Indian  securities  for  the  second  year  in
succession.  The  net  FII  investment  in  2004-
05  (including  debt)  was  Rs.  45,881  crore
which was marginally higher than Rs.45,765
crore in 2003-04 (Table 2.41 and Chart 2.14).
In terms of the US Dollar, the net investment

by  FIIs  in  2004-05  was  US  $  10.17  billion,
which  was  the  highest  ever  net  investment
by FIIs in any year since 1992-93 when FIIs
were  allowed  to  invest  in  Indian  securities
(Chart  2.15).  The  cumulative  investment  by
FIIs  by  the  end  of  2004-05  was  US  $  35.93
billion.

The pace of investment was slow in the
first  two  quarters  of  the  year,  but  increased
considerably in the subsequent months (Table
2.42). The gross purchases and sales in 2004-
05 were Rs. 2,16,953 crore and Rs. 1,71,073
crore, respectively. Comparing with 2003-04,
there  was  an  increase  of  49.77  per  cent  in
gross purchases and 72.64 per cent in gross
sales  by  FIIs.  The  highest  gross  purchases
and  sales  were  observed  in  the  month  of
March 2005. The highest net investment was
witnessed in the month of December 2004 (US
$ 2.23 billion), followed by February 2005 (US
$ 2.10 billion), March 2005 (US $ 1.81 billion)
etc. Bulk of the net investment by FIIs was in
equities, i.e., 96 per cent of net investment or
Rs. 44,123 crore, whereas investment in debt
was only Rs. 1,759 crore (Table 2.43).

Annual Report 2004-05

The FIIs continue to be one of the major
players in the stock market (Chart 2.16). The
mutual funds were generally active when FIIs
were  cautious,  except  in  March  2005,  when
both  the  institutional  investors  were  active.

Mutual  funds’  exposure  to  equity  market
improved  significantly  in  the  last  quarter  of
the  year  reflecting  large  mobilisation  of
resources under equity schemes.

MARKET

I.

Bond Markets: Global Trend

Bond  market  behaviour  in  the  major
international  markets  was  mainly  influenced
by international liquidity and policy stance of
the  central  banks.  The  overall  liquidity
condition  continued  to  remain  comfortable
during 2004-05. This had an enduring impact
on the bond prices. As a result, the long-term
yields in the major economies either declined
or remained broadly steady over the year. The
short  term  yields,  however,  looked  up
heralding turnaround in the interest rate cycle
following signs of rising inflation expectations.
Many  central  banks,  including  the  Federal
Reserve revised their policy rates upward in
a measured way. Consequently, the sovereign
yield curve continued to flatten, driven by rise

in  short-term  rates.  In  the  Euro  area,  as  the
growth impulse was rather hesitant, the policy
rates remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the
shape  of  the  yield  curve  was  flat  as  the
decline  in  the  long-term  yields  was  more
pronounced.  With  the  flattening  of  the  yield
curve, the term spread narrowed in most parts
of the globe.

Following comfortable liquidity condition,
the credit spread also narrowed in the major
economies.  In  the  emerging  markets,
particularly  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  the
outlook  was  better  with  upgradation  of
sovereign ratings of many countries such as
Brazil,  India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Mexico,
Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela.
The  local  currency  bonds  were  in  demand
due to yield differential. There was large inflow
of funds into the debt markets of the emerging
economies  in  search  of  high  yields.  In  the

%

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

emerging markets, together with bond prices,
other asset prices like equity, real estate also
hardened significantly during 2004-05.

II.

Indian Wholesale Debt Market
In  the  WDM  segment  of  NSE,  the  net
traded  value  and  the  number  of  trades
declined by 32.6 per cent and 34.4 per cent,
respectively  in  2004-05  over  the  previous
year. Month-wise trend shows that there was
a continuous fall in the net traded value from
April  2004  to  August  2004  (Table  2.45).
However,  in  September  2004,  it  went  up  to
Rs.87,695 crore registering a growth of 37.4
per  cent  over  the  previous  month.  The  net
traded  value  could  not  reach  this  level
thereafter. The highest net traded value was
observed  in  April  2004  (Rs.1,33,478  crore)
and the lowest in November (Rs.45,541 crore)
during  2004-05.  The  net  traded  value
remained  below  the  previous  year’s  level  in
each month except April 2004 and February

2005 (Chart 2.17). The average daily traded
value  worked  out  for  2004-05  was  Rs.3,039
crore,  which  was  32.1  per  cent  lower  than
that  of  Rs.4,477  crore  for  2003-04.  Month-
wise, the highest average daily traded value
was recorded in April 2004 (Rs.6,067 crore).
The  trend  in  the  number  of  trades  broadly
mimicked the trend in the net traded value.

Instrument-wise,  the  government  dated
securities  continued  to  dominate  the
transactions  in  the  WDM  segment  of  NSE,
although  their  share  declined  considerably
from  92.6  per  cent  in  2003-04  to  81.7  per
cent  in  2004-05  (Table  2.46).  On  the  other
hand,  the  share  of  Treasury  bills  traded  in
the WDM segment of NSE rose significantly
from 4.2 per cent to 14.1 per cent during the
same  period.  This  indicates  the  preference
of  the  market  players  to  remain  liquid  in  an
uncertain  interest  rate  environment.  The
combined  share  of  the  government  dated
securities  and  Treasury  bills  also  declined,

although modestly from 96.8 per cent in 2003-
04  to  95.8  per  cent  in  2004-05.  The
percentage  share  of  “others”  which  include
mainly  corporate  debt  securities,  improved
from  1.1  per  cent  to  2.2  per  cent  during  the
same period. This is a healthy sign given the
need  for  the  development  of  the  corporate
debt  market.  The  share  of  PSU/institutional
bonds remained unchanged at 2.0 per cent.

With  regard  to  the  market  share  of
participants, the trading members dominated
the  debt  market  although  their  share  of
participation declined marginally from 34.8 per
cent  in  2003-04  to  34.0  per  cent  in  2004-05

(Table  2.47).  One  of  the  most  notable
developments  during  2004-05  was  the
significant decline in the share of Indian banks
which  fell  from  36.4  per  cent  in  2003-04  to
29.9  per  cent  in  2004-05.  Besides  more
reliance on repo transactions, the RBI policy
to allow Indian banks to hold more government
securities  under  the  category  of  ‘held  to
maturity’  could  be  the  possible  reason  for
decline  in  their  share.  It  is  also  important  to
note that the share of foreign banks jumped
from 7.3 per cent to 12.5 per cent during the
same  period.  The  rise  in  the  shares  of  FIs/
MFs/corporates and mutual funds was modest.
