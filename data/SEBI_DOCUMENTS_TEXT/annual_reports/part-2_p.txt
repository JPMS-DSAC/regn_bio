REVIEW OF THE TRENDS AND WORKING OF THE
SECURITIES MARKET

Annual Report 2000-2001

A] PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

Capital raised during 2000-01

During  the  financial  year  2000-01,  the  primary  market  was  subdued.  The  total  funds  raised
through equity and bonds in the primary market suffered a set back during 2000-01 registering a
decline of 22 per cent as against a rise of 40 per cent during 1999-2000. In absolute terms, total
funds mobilised through 151 issues declined from Rs.7,817 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs.6,108 crore
during 2000-01. There was also a structural change in capital mobilised as the share of rights
issues which was about 20 per cent in 1999-2000 declined to just 12 per cent during 2000-01, the
lowest during the preceding 5 years. On the other hand, share of public issues was higher at 88
per  cent  compared  to  80  per  cent  during  the  preceding  year.  The  market  sluggishness  was
reflected  in  the  poor  response  of  investors  as  11  issues  were  under  subscribed  and  nearly  89
issues were subscribed less than twice in 2000-01 as compared to 11 issues which were subscribed
less than twice in 1999-2000. There was a decline also in the average size of an issue in the year
under review due to small issues from industries like chemicals, electronics, engineering, plastic,
etc. As observed in the last year’s report (1999-2000), banks and FIs mobilised less amount from
the primary market and their relative share witnessed a declining trend. They raised about 85 per
cent of total resources during 1998-99, which declined to 52 per cent in 1999-2000; and further
to 51 per cent during the year under review. Two issues in telecommunication, and infrastructure
sectors raised Rs.922 crore during the year as compared to 1 issue in 1999 - 2000 which raised
Rs. 75 crore. There was no issue by telecommunication industry during 1998-99. The share of
capital raised by the entertainment and finance companies increased to 7.5 per cent and 7.2 per
cent during 2000-01 respectively from 1.6 per cent each during 1999-2000.

While there was a decline in the amount of capital raised through issue of offer documents, the
capital  raised  through  private  placement,  which  is  not  regulated  by  SEBI  remained  high.
According to data available from RBI and other market sources, during 1998-99, a total amount
of Rs.49,664 crore was raised of which more than Rs. 6,000 crore was accounted by the private
corporate sector. The private corporate sector raised Rs. 18,122 crore through private placement
in  1999-2000.  During  2000-01,  the  resource  raised  was  of  the  order  of  Rs.  67,  500.0  crore.
Thus in the aggregate i.e. taking into account capital raised through the offer documents, private
placement  and  mobilisation  by  the  mutual  funds  (not  withstanding  the  possibility  of  double
counting),  the  mobilisation  of  the  financial  resources  from  the  market  does  not  seem  to  have
declined.

Public and Rights Issues
During 2000-01, 151 issues came to the market of which 124 were public issues for raising Rs.
5378 crore as compared to 65 issues for raising Rs. 6256 crore during the previous year. The
companies  entered  the  market  with  27  rights  issues  and  raised  Rs.729  crore  during  2000-01
which was substantially lower than the amount of Rs. 1560 crore mobilised through 28 issues
in  1999-2000.  Thus,  while  amounts  through  public  issues  decreased  by  14  per  cent,  rights
issues recorded a steep decline of more than 53 per cent. (Table 2.1).

The share of resource mobilisation through primary market accounted for only 1.4 per cent of
total domestic savings in 1998-99. The investment in shares and debentures by the households
accounted for only 3.6 per cent of their total financial assets in 1998-99. In 1999-2000 although
this share had increased to 6.4 per cent, it declined to around 2.7 per cent in 2000-01.

Month-wise trends in capital mobilisation

Annual Report 2000-2001

Analysis of monthly data on capital mobilisation through offer documents filed with the SEBI,
reveals that more than half of the capital was raised during the second half of the year during
2000-01.  The  bulk  of  the  capital  was  raised  during  July,  September  and  November  2000  and
February and March 2001 (Table 2.2). The time pattern of issues entering the market remained
the same as in 1999-2000.

Trends in size and composition of issues
There  were  18  large  issues  during  the  year  for  mobilising  Rs.4486  crore  as  compared  to  19
issues,  in  1999-2000  for  raising  Rs.6034  crore.  Thus  large  issues  formed  73.4  per  cent  of  the
total  amount  of  capital  raised  during  2000-01  compared  to  a  ratio  of  77.2  per  cent  during  the
previous year. The FIs and banks which were the major issuers in this segment mobilised 69.9
per  cent  of  the  total  amount  raised  by  the  large  issues  during  the  current  financial  year  as
compared to a slightly lower share of 66.9 per cent during the previous year. The ICICI entered
the  market  7  times  for  mobilising  Rs.2050  crore  followed  by  the  mega  issues  of  other  banks
Rs.489 crore and IDBI with Rs.600 crore. The corporates on the other hand mobilised Rs. 1246
crore  of  which  Rs.886  crore  was  accounted  for  by  one  company,  Hughes  Telecommunication
India  Ltd.  forming  14.50  per  cent  of  the  total  capital  raised  during  2000-01.  Of  the  18  large
issues, 9 were bond issues for Rs.2650 crore and an equal number of equity issues (9) amounting
to  Rs.1836  crore.  In  terms  of  percentage  share,  the  amount  through  large  equity  issues  and
bonds was 41 per cent and 59 per cent, respectively in 2000-01 as compared to 48 per cent and
52 per cent, respectively for 1999-2000 (Table 2.3).

Annual Report 2000-2001

Trends in listed and IPO issues
The capital raised by the listed companies recorded a sharp decline of 34 per cent in 2000-01
as against a marginal decline of 2 per cent in 1999-2000 over the previous year. On the other
hand, the capital raised through Initial Public Offers (IPOs) showed a small rise of 0.1 per cent
as compared to an exponential rise in the previous year. The corporates as well as other entities
have  been  resorting  to  mobilise  funds  through  IPOs.  During  2000-01,  114  issues  came  in  the
market  as  IPOs  for  raising  Rs.2722  crore  as  compared  to  51  issues  during  1999-2000  for
mobilising Rs.2719 crore. Though the number of issues increased substantially, the capital raised
showed a marginal increase of Rs.3.4 crore. Moreover, the average size of issue too declined to
Rs.40  crore  in  2000-01  from  Rs.84  crore  in  the  previous  year.  In  terms  of  percentage  share,
while  IPOs  contributed  45  per  cent  during  2000-01  as  compared  to  their  share  of  35  per  cent
during 1999-2000, the listed companies’ share declined to 55 per cent from 65 per cent because
of  sharper  decline  in  the  amount  raised  by  the  listed  companies.  Thus,  the  IPOs  continued  to
play a significant role in sustaining their role of resource mobilisation from the primary market
compared  to  the  listed  companies,  recording  an  evidence  that  more  and  more  new  companies
entered the capital market providing more instruments for trading on the bourses (Table 2.6).

As regards average size of issues of listed and IPO companies, the listed companies recorded a
decline to Rs.91 crore per issue in 2000-01 from Rs.121 crore per issue in 1999-2000. On the
other hand IPO’s average size declined from Rs.53 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs.24 crore in 2000-
01  reflecting  that  relatively  a  larger  number  of  small  size  issues  came  from  new  and  small
companies particularly from information technology industry with a average size of Rs.9 crore
compared to Rs.43 crore per issue in 1999-2000.

Sector-wise analysis of capital mobilisation
As in the previous year, the investment activity in the primary market was by and large dominated
by the private sector companies, which included banks and financial institutions. Their share in
capital raised by private sector companies remained around 97 percent as in the previous year
mobilising Rs.5893 crore through 148 issues in 2000-01 as compared to Rs.7603 crore through
90 issues during 1999-2000. Joint sector did not enter the market though it had mobilised Rs.14
crore through only 1 issue in 1999-2000. There were only 3 issues by public sector companies
which mobilised Rs.215 crore accounting for 3.5 per cent of the total capital raised in 2000-01
as against 2 issues with Rs.200 crore in 1999-2000 (Table 2.7).

Investor-wise details of allotment
The amount of capital allotted to the public amounted to Rs. 5378 crore of which 94 per cent
came from Indian public as compared to a share of 97 per cent during the previous year. The
second important category was of promoters, who accounted for 4.6 per cent during the current
financial  year  under  review  as  compared  to  0.8  per  cent  in  the  previous  year  reflecting  the
rising contribution of promoters. The share of NRIs which stood at 1.2 per cent in 1999-2000,
declined  to  0.3  per  cent  in  2000-01.  In  absolute  terms  the  allotment  to  NRI  declined  from
Rs.75.5  crore  in  1999-2000  to  Rs.16.0  crore  in  2000-01.  The  share  of  employees  has  shown

increase  from  0.6  per  cent  to  0.7  per  cent  probably  due  to  Employee  Stock  Option  Scheme.
Allotment to mutual funds, which was 0.2 per cent in 1999-2000, increased to 0.3 per cent or
by Rs.6 crore. Allotment to banks and FIs has substantially declined from Rs.16 crore in 1999-
2000 to Rs.8 crore in 2000-01 constituting only 0.1 per cent of the total allotment. (Table 2.9)

Industry-wise analysis of resource mobilisation
Allocation of resources to various industries in the primary market is an important indicator of
industrial diversification, its growth and perceptions of the entrepreneurs. A notable feature of
resource  mobilisation  was  a  sharp  decline  in  case  of  infotech  industry  from  Rs.1547  crore  in
1999-2000  to  Rs.804  crore  in  2000-01,  banking/FIs  from  Rs.4039  crore  during  1999-2000  to
Rs.3139 crore during 2000-01 followed by health care from Rs.575 crore to Rs.48 crore, cement
and  construction  from  Rs.337  crore  to  Rs.82  crore,  chemical  from  Rs.181  crore  to  Rs.31.5
crore and electronics from Rs.213 crore to Rs.69 crore (Table 2.11).

There were 13 issues in the financial year 2000-01 by Banks/Financial Institutions. Of the 13
issues, 7 issues were launched by the ICICI. These were basically 7 tranches of umbrella issue
of  bonds.  IDBI  also  came  out  with  2  tranches  of  bonds  issue  in  2000-01.  The  other  4  issues
were  of  equity  issues  to  public  by  Vijaya  Bank,  Indian  Overseas  Bank,  Andhra  Bank  and
Centurion Bank Limited. Details of these issues by Banks/FIs are given in table 2.10.

The share of banking and FIs in total capital raised declined marginally from 51.7 per cent in
1999-2000 to 51.4 per cent in 2000-01, while information and technology suffered when their
share fell from about 19.8 per cent to 13.2 per cent mainly on account of marked deceleration
in  the  demand  for  products  of  industry  in  the  United  States  having  adverse  effect  on  infotech
exports  from  India.  The  entertainment  and  finance  industries,  however,  witnessed  increase  in
their share from 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent in 1999-2000 respectively to 7.5 per cent and 7.2
per cent in 2000-01, respectively. The share of healthcare on the otherhand declined from 7.4
per cent to 0.8 per cent. The telecommunication seems to have dominated the field and shared
15.1  per  cent  of  the  total  capital  raised  from  the  primary  market  during  the  year  of  2000-01
though the number of issues were only 2 in this sector.

It would be noticed that banking/FIs, information technology, entertainment, finance and telecom
together accounted for 94 per cent of the total capital raised during the financial year 2000-01
through 127 issues which constituted more than 84 per cent of the total issues launched.

Region-wise analysis of capital mobilisation
During 2000-01, the western region mobilised Rs.4105 crore or about 67 per cent of the total
resources followed by the southern region with about Rs.1555 crore accounting for 25 per cent
and eastern region with only Rs.240 crore or 4 per cent. Though number of issues from western
region  declined  marginally  from  46  in  the  financial  year  1999-2000  to  43  in  financial  year
2000-01, amount of capital raised sharply declined by 22 per cent to Rs. 4105 crore.

76

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

As regards trends, a total number of 89 issues were launched in southern region which is 3.30
times of that of last year. Capital mobilised by the issues from Southern region also increased
by  170  per  cent  to  Rs  1555  Crore  in  2000-01  from  Rs.  577  crore  in  previous  financial  year.
However, in spite of the fact that 59 per cent of the total issues launched were from southern
region,  capital  raised  by  this  region  is  only  25  per  cent  of  the  total  capital  raised  in  2000-01.
This  is  because  of  concentration  of  issues  of  smaller  sizes  in  this  region.  Out  of  91  issues  of
sizes  of  less  than  Rs.  10  crore,  launched  in  2000-01,  69  issues  were  from  southern  region
(Table 2.12).

Instrument-wise analysis of capital raised
The equity issues continued to be on top in resource raising in 2000-01 as total capital raised
through these instruments stood at Rs.3225 crore accounting for 53 per cent of the total capital
raised  during  the  year  under  review.  Out  of  138  issues  of  equity  shares  84  issues  were  at  par
constituting 56 per cent of total number of issues and contributing only 13 per cent of the total
capital raised. However, the equity capital on the premium contributed 39.4 per cent of the total
capital raised. Its share in total equity was 75 per cent in 2000-01 as compared to a share of 83
per cent during 1999-2000. As regards size of equity issues, average size of equity on par was
Rs.10 crore in 2000-01, which was lower than Rs.26 crore in 1999-2000 (Table 2.13).

As regards bonds, there were 10 issues of Rs.2704.0 crore during 2000-01 as compared to 10
issues  for  Rs.3200.0  crore  in  1999-2000  resulting  in  higher  share  of  capital  raised  through
bonds to 44.3 per cent. This share was 40.9 per cent in 1999-2000. There was only one Fully
Convertible  Debenture  (FCD)  for  Rs.36.3  crore.  However,  in  2000-01  there  was  no  Partially
Convertible Debenture (PCD) though there was one for Rs.30 crore in 1999-2000.

Further  analysis  revealed  that  out  of  84  issues  of  equity  shares  at  par,  58  issues  were  IPOs
which came through appraisal route for which average issue size was Rs.3.6 crore. There were
12  IPOs  of  equity  shares  at  par  which  were  non-appraised  issues.  Average  issue  size  for  this
category was Rs. 33 crore. However, if 3 IPOs of equity shares at par by Vijaya Bank, Indian
Overseas Bank and Andhra Bank are removed from this category then average issue size comes
down to Rs. 4.2 crore.

Underwriting of issues
During  2000-01,  105  issues  for  Rs.3697  crore  were  underwritten.  Only  19  issues  were  not
underwritten  for  Rs.1681.16  crore,  which  reflect  that  a  large  number  of  good  issues  did  not
require underwriting facility (Table 2.14).

Subscription of primary issues
During the period 2000-01 (April-March), there were eleven undersubscribed issues. Two issues
were  later  subscribed  by  the  underwriters.  In  case  of  one  issue,  the  promoters  brought  in  the
unsubscribed portion and in 8 issues the money was refunded, as per the figures available with
SEBI as on April 04, 2001. It would be noticed that during 1999-2000, there was no unsubscribed
issue. A large number of issues was not subscribed on account of investors’ poor response. A
number  of  issuers  had  to  refund  the  amounts  collected  by  way  of  application  money  because
they failed to receive minimum subscription from shareholders as per the provisions and directives
of  the  SEBI.  Of  the  subscribed  issues,  89  issues  were  subscribed  for  less  than  twice  and  18
issues were subscribed for more than twice and less than 5 times. (Table 2.15)

B] SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

Price behaviour in the secondary securities market during 2000-01
The stock market in India experienced several reversals during 2000-01 leading to sharp decline
in total market capitalisation, turnover and trading activity particularly more persistently towards
the end of the year. There was a sharp deceleration in equity prices which got culminated into
substantial  decline  in  the  BSE  Sensex  and  other  indices.  While  the  BSE  Sensex  fell  sharply
from 5001 as on March 31, 2000 to 3604 as on March 30, 2001 registering a decline of 28 per
cent, BSE 100 with a larger downturn of 42 per cent from 2902 as on March 31, 2000 to 1691
as  on  March  30,  2001  suffered  larger  losses.  The  NSE  50  and  S&P  CNX  500  also  suffered
similar losses of 25 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively. While S&P CNX 50 decreased from
1528  to  1148,  S&P  CNX  500  slowed  down  from  1323  to  754  during  the  same  period.  It  is
noteworthy to observe that level of major indices at the end of March 2001 had reversed back
more or less to the level reached on end March 1999.

However, intermittent trends were quite erratic. The BSE Sensex following the Union Budget
2000-01 registered somewhat upsurge from the close of 5053 as on April 3, 2000 to 5541 as on
April 11, 2000 recording a rise of about 9.7 per cent. The Sensitive Index, however, began to fall
thereafter and reached the lowest level at 3920 as on May 22, 2000 before gradually firming up
to 4964 by July 12, 2000. However, the stocks prices continuously declined during the subsequent
periods  and  the  BSE  Sensex  declined  to  4186  by  August  4,  2000.  From  August  4,  2000  to
September  12,  2000  the  market  witnessed  a  boom  period  for  the  stocks  as  the  BSE  Sensex
moved upward touching as high as 4764 as on September 12, 2000. This upsurge was experienced
by all the indices. The share prices during the remaining 6 months of the current financial year
under  review  were  in  the  grip  of  bearish  sentiments  except  for  a  rise  between  January  11  –
February 20, 2001 when the BSE Sensex rose from 4027 to 4359 on February 20, 2001.

The stock prices showed high intra-day variations during certain days of the year particularly in
April 2000 and May 2000 when it ranged between 7.8 per cent and 3 per cent in case of BSE
Sensex.  Again  in  the  last  week  of  July,  intra-day  variations  ranged  between  2  per  cent  and  7
per  cent.  The  month  of  March  2001  witnessed  intra-day  variations  of  high  magnitude  on
continuous basis.

The analysis of indices reveals that on monthly average basis there was a persistent decline in
BSE Sensex from 4905 in April 2000 to 3808 in March 2001, showing a loss of 1097 points or
decrease of 22 per cent during the year. The monthly movement of S&P CNX Nifty reflected

80

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

the  same  trend.  It  declined  from  an  average  of  1469  for  April  2000  to  1214  for  March  2001
registering a loss of 255 points or a fall of 17 per cent. The Natex with larger number of scrips
recorded  a  loss  of  835  points  from  2664  for  April  2000  to  1829  for  March  2001.  It  may  be
noted that despite the positive net investment of FIIs, stocks prices continued to fall. During the
months of January and February 2001, FIIs investment probably supported the equity prices as
almost all the indices which showed rising trend but in March 2001, despite a net investment of
about US$ 379.5 million, the BSE Sensex monthly average declined to 3807.6 from 4310.1 in
February 2001. The similar trend was observed in case of Natex and S&P CNX Nifty also.

Table 2.19 below summarizes the daily movements of indices of BSE Sensex and Nifty during
2000-01. Of the 251 trading days at BSE, Sensex recorded increases on 135 trading days and
decreases on 116 trading days. Similarly, Nifty recorded increase on 135 days and decrease on
116 days. However, out of 251 trading days, the Sensex showed nominal increase for 109 days
and decrease for 86 days of around 2.5 per cent. There were very few days when BSE Sensex

82

showed  increase  or  decrease  between  5  and  7.5  per  cent.  Though  over  the  year  of  2000-01
indices showed large declines but on day to day basis, there were very few days when declines
were of alarming size.

Relative strength index (RSI)
The  analysis  of  movement  of  share  index  can  also  be  made  on  the  basis  of  Relative  Strength
Index  (RSI)  which  studies  the  relative  strength  of  stocks  prices  in  relation  to  their  previous
positions.  RSI  of  Sensex  for  the  period  2000  -  01  (April-March)  mostly  hovered  within  the
equilibrium territory of 30 to 70. The standard parameters in RSI analysis are:
overbought territory
equilibrium territory
oversold territory

above 70
30 to 70 and
below 30

=
=
=

During  the  financial  year  2000-01,  though  the  RSI  of  both  the  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty
witnessed upturns as well as downturn movements but remained inside the equilibrium territory
(range 30 – 70) for major periods of time. A case in point is the movement of RSI during May,
June  and  August  2000  as  also  for  February  and  March  2001  for  Sensex  and  Nifty  as  well.
During these months RSI for both the indices regularly exhibited to and fro movements mostly
forming  new  tops  and  bottoms.  Despite  such  swings  the  RSI  remained  contained  within  the
equilibrium territory during such periods. Extreme movements during the year into overbought
/oversold territories have been very few. This portends well for the Indian markets as it possibly
indicates more of secular trends ruling the market in the long run allaying fears of any persisting
excessive volatility for long term period (Annexures 3 & 4).

Trends in market capitalisation
Market  capitalisation  of  equity  shares  on  Indian  bourses  experienced  a  substantial  fall  during
the year, 2000-01. There has been a sharp fall in the market value of equity investment during
2000-01. As such the market capitalisation of NSE which stood at Rs.10,20,426.0 crore at end
March 2000 substantially and continuously declined to Rs.6,57,847 crore recording a fall of 35
per cent over the year whereas, market capitalisation at BSE declined from Rs.9,12,842 crore to
Rs.5,71,553.0 crore during the same period at the rate of 37 per cent. It would be observed that
between March 2000 and March 2001 market capitalisation in absolute term suffered a loss of

83

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

Rs.3,62,579 crore at NSE. The same position was observed at BSE showing a loss of Rs.3,41,289
crore. This reversal has implications for future growth of transactions in the capital market. The
loss of wealth in the hands of investors may have adversely affected the consumption growth as
well  as  the  investment  growth  in  the  private  sector.  The  capital  gains  on  account  of  market
capitalisation can produce pushing up impact on investment growth and consumption patterns
of the households.

technology shared 16 per cent and telecom 4 per cent, whereas media and publishing accounted
for 1.5 per cent. As regards the intra composition of new economy stocks, information technology
accounted  for  74  per  cent  of  total  market  capitalisation  of  new  economy  stocks  followed  by

Trading pattern of listed companies
The number of listed companies at BSE has been increasing over the years and it stood at 9810
as  at  end  March  2001  compared  to  a  number  of  8027  as  at  end  March  2000.  The  number  of
companies  traded  on  the  stock  exchange  is  one  of  the  basis  for  judging  the  depth  of  a  stock
market. The number of companies traded during 2000-01 showed discouraging trend as it declined
from 2713 in April 2001 to 2416 as on end October 2001 forming just 27 per cent of the total
companies  listed  as  compared  to  41  per  cent  in  the  same  month  in  1999-2000.  Though  the
number  of  traded  companies  during  the  year  under  review  increased  to  2598  by  end  March
2001, it was substantially lower than 3318 in the same month in 2000 forming 26 per cent as
against 41 per cent in the same month of the previous year. It is observed from month to month
comparison  that  the  proportion  of  traded  companies  was  substantially  lower  in  2000-01  as
compared to their percentage in 1999-2000. As such the proportion of traded companies declined
from 33 per cent in April 2000 to 26 per cent at the end of March 2001. The low proportion of
traded companies in total listed companies reflects the thinness of trading pattern and also the
concentration of trade on few companies. The data also reveal that more than 6000 companies
are listed but not traded on BSE. (Table 2.21).

The frequency distribution of companies according to number of days they are traded is presented
in Table 2.22. It would be observed that 1596 companies were traded for more than 100 days
and formed 41 per cent of the total number of traded companies whereas in 1999-2000 only 28
per cent of the total companies were traded for more than 100 days. In 1999-2000, as large as
51  per  cent  of  the  listed  companies  were  traded  for  1  to  10  days  whereas  this  percentage
declined  to  26  per  cent  in  2000-01  reflecting  improvement  in  trading  magnitude  in  terms  of
number  of  days.  However,  this  improvement  does  not  set  right  the  deterioration  which  took
place in 2000-01 in terms of decline in number of traded companies.

Annual Report 2000-2001

Trends in turnover in major stock exchanges
Turnover on stock exchanges reflects the transaction activity of the market players in the stock
market. The turnover figures demonstrate not only change in price of shares but also variation
in volume traded. It is also a sign of size of market and liquidity. The liquidity allows investors
to  alter  their  portfolios  and  cheaply  makes  investment  less  risky.  However,  the  average  daily
turnover  at  BSE  and  NSE  which  had  risen  from  Rs.2,071  crore  and  Rs.2,606  crore  in  March
1999 to Rs.4,050 crore and Rs.5,028 crore in March 2000 markedly declined to Rs.2,150 crore
and Rs.2,867 crore, respectively in March 2001. There was a fall of 47 per cent in case of BSE
and 43 per cent in case of NSE turnover.

Movement in volatility
Volatility  in  stock  prices  in  India  showed  by  and  large  a  declining  trend  except  for  certain
months.  The  BSE  Sensex,  which  had  a  volatility  of  3.9  per  cent  in  April  2000,  witnessed  an
improved performance, as it was only 1.6 per cent by October 2000. In March 2001 a pronounced
volatility  in  the  market  was  reflected  in  the  BSE  Sensex  indices  measuring  at  2.9  per  cent.
Volatility  of  BSE  Natex,  which  was  3.8  per  cent  in  April  2000,  declined  to  1.8  per  cent  in
February 2001 but rose back to 3.3 per cent in March 2001. The S&P CNX Nifty demonstrated
a volatility of 3.5 per cent in April 2000 which decreased to as low as 1.2 per cent by January
2001.  Thus  volatility  by  and  large  declined  during  the  year  under  review  except  for  March
2001.  The  volatility  in  March  increased  due  to  some  sudden  abrupt  developments  depressing
the market. The Nifty Junior which saw a volatility level of 4.6 per cent in April 2000 ended
the financial year with a volatility of 3.3 per cent in March 2001.

It may be noted that in months of April and March in 1999-2000 as well as in 2000-01 volatility
was  of  the  highest  order  implying  that  post  budget  months  such  as  March  and  April  show
higher volatility every year. The similar trend has been observed in case of BSE Natex , S&P
CNX  Nifty,  BSE  Natex  and  CNX  Nifty  Jr.  with  highest  volatility  in  two  post  budget  months
namely  March  and  April.  However,  the  volatility  during  these  two  months  as  per  the  data
available was aggravated (Table 2.24).

Stock exchange-wise trends in volume of business
Total turnover of business at 23 stock exchanges in 2000-01 was Rs. 28,80,803 crore as compared
to  Rs.  20,67,030  crore  in  1999-2000,  recording  a  growth  of  39  per  cent  during  the  year.  The
performance of various stock exchanges can be viewed in terms of their share in total turnover
of all the stock exchanges. As such NSE accounted for 46 per cent of total turnover in 2000-01
as compared to 40 per cent during the previous year. Similarly, the share of BSE also increased
to  35  per  cent  in  2000-01  from  33  per  cent  in  1999-2000.  On  the  other  hand,  the  share  of
Calcutta  declined  to  12  per  cent  from  17  per  cent  and  that  of  Delhi  from  5  per  cent  to  3  per
cent  during  the  same  period.  It  would  be  observed  that  several  stock  exchanges  like
Bhubaneshwar,  Jaipur,  Gauhati,  Mangalore,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Magadh,  SKSE,  Coimbatore,
Cochin did not report any turnover activity in 2000-01 or reported very nominal turnover showing
their unviability. (Table 2.27)

Annual Report 2000-2001

Delivery pattern in stock exchanges
Data on delivery ratio and turnover in volume as well as in value are furnished in Table 2.28.
The delivery ratio in volume (i.e. shares traded) at aggregate level showed improvement from
19  per  cent  in  1999-2000  to  21  per  cent  in  2000-01.  However,  there  were  large  variations  in
delivery ratio. While at NSE the delivery ratio declined from 20 per cent, in 1999-2000 to 14
per cent in 2000-01, it increased from 24 per cent to 34 per cent, 7 per cent to 10 per cent and
17  per  cent  to  27  per  cent  at  stock  exchanges  of  Mumbai,  Calcutta  and  Delhi  respectively
during the same period. Hyderabad showed a high delivery ratio of 45 per cent during 2000-01,
Madras with 31 per cent. OTCEI showed fall in delivery ratio from 42 per cent to 23 per cent.
In terms of value, however, delivery ratio remained constant and was estimated at 11 per cent
during  2000-01.  The  delivery  ratio  at  NSE  declined  from  10  per  cent  in  1999-2000  to  8  per
cent in 2000-01. But the same was increased from 16 per cent to 17 per cent, 5 per cent to 7
per  cent,  9  per  cent  to  12  per  cent  and  5  per  cent  to  7  per  cent  at  the  stock  exchanges  of
Mumbai,  Calcutta,  Delhi  and  Ahmedabad.  Delivery  ratio  at  OTCEI  was  very  high  at  31  per
cent  followed  by  Hyderabad  at  17  per  cent  and  Gauhati  recorded  100  per  cent  delivery  ratio.
However, at small stock exchanges trading activity was very negligible.

Bad deliveries on Indian stock exchanges
The  bad  deliveries  in  relation  to  net  deliveries  have  shown  sharp  decline  reflecting  the  better
implementation of SEBI guidelines as well as the efforts taken by the SEBI. The ratio of bad
deliveries  to  net  deliveries  declined  from  0.11  per  cent  in  April  2000  to  0.02  in  March  2001.
This ratio was substantially higher in 1999-2000 ranging between 0.11 and 0.57 per cent if the
month  of  October  is  excluded  when  this  ratio  was  as  low  as  0.1  per  cent.  At  NSE  also  bad
deliveries  sharply  declined  and  the  performance  of  this  stock  exchange  corroborated  with  the
performance of BSE. Probably dematerialisation of trade and other binding conditions on brokers
and investors have resulted in fall in bad deliveries. (Table 2.29)

Liquidity movement in stock market
Liquidity is generally regarded as one of the conditions for smooth functioning of stock market.
The variations in the degree of liquidity affect the price discovery process and efficiency of the
market.  For  definition  purposes,  the  liquidity  of  the  market  is  the  situation  in  which  a  large
trade  in  shares  can  be  transacted  without  having  any  material  impact  on  the  price  of  shares.
Liquidity in the market has shown improvement during the recent years as the turnover during
1995-96 to 2000-01 rose by more than 80 per cent. The growth of the liquidity is also measured
in terms of value-traded ratio and turnover ratio. (Table 2.30)

Traded value ratio is estimated by dividing the total value by the GDP. Whereas turnover ratio is value of total shares traded
divided by market capitalisation. Market Capitalisation ratio. 1998-1999 GDP is QE. 99-00 GDP is RE.

Source : SEBI, RBI Handbook of Statistics, 1999-2000.

The  traded  value  ratio  indicates  volume  of  trading  in  relation  to  the  size  of  the  economy.  On
the  other  hand  turnover  ratio  shows  trading  in  relation  to  the  size  of  the  market.  It  would  be
seen  from  the  Table  2.30  that  traded  value  ratio,  which  was  4.6  per  cent  of  GDP  in  1995-96
rose to 38.6 per cent by 1999-2000 in case of BSE. In case of NSE, this ratio rose from 6.3 per
cent to 47.4 per cent during the same period. Similar improvement has taken place in turnover
ratio.  The  turnover  ratio  at  BSE  rose  from  43  per  cent  in  1995-96  to  226  per  cent  in  1999-
2000. Similarly the turnover ratio at NSE rose from 17 per cent in 1995-96 to 204 per cent in
2000-01. Both the ratios reflect improvement in the liquidity in the market. The performance of
the  market  can  also  be  seen  in  terms  of  market  cap-GDP  ratio  or  market  capitalisation  ratio.
The market capitalisation ratio indicates the size of the market. The market capitalisation which
was 49 per cent in 1995-96 increased to 52 per cent in 1999-2000.

Performance of dematerialisation
Dematerialisation of shares has spread rapidly. Based on the recommendations of SEBI’s Working
Group  on  dematerialisation,  the  number  of  scrips  for  compulsory  settlement  of  trades  in
dematerialised form for all investors was increased in phases to 1746 as at end of the financial
year  under  review.  This  number  would  be  increased  to  2390  by  July  30,  2001.  These  scrips
comprise of all shares forming the part of A Group scrips of BSE Sensitive Index, CNX S&P
Nifty, BSE 500 and CNX S&P 500 and most of the highly traded B1 Group scrips of BSE.

Number of dematerialised shares increased from 6,970 million as on end March 1999 to 15,500
million as on end March 2000 and further to 39,000 million shares as at end March 2001. The
increase in number of dematerialised scrips reflects fast pace in institutionalisation of paperless
trading in equities. Total market capitalisation of companies at NSDL and CDSL amounted to
Rs.600,000  crore  at  the  end  of  March  2001,  as  compared  to  Rs.700,658  crore  at  end  March
2000. Depositary participants of NSDL and CDSL also increased from 150 to 300 and a total
of 3000 companies were trading in dematerialised form as on end March 2001.

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

According  to  the  information  furnished  by  National  Securities  Depository  Ltd.  and  Central
Depository Services (I) Limited, number of dematerialised securities and volume substantially
increased  during  the  year  2000-01.  As  on  March  31,  2001,  3000  companies  with  a  market
capitalisation of over Rs. 6,00,000 crore had signed agreement with the depositories. The number
of  depository  participant  offering  depository  services  have  grown  from  150  as  on  March  31,
2000  to  300  as  on  March  31,  2001.  The  depository  services  were  available  at  2000  centres
covering  345  cities  across  the  country  as  on  March  31,  2001.  The  value  of  dematerialised
shares increased from Rs. 4,00,000 crore as on March 31, 2000 to Rs. 4,35,000 crore at the end
of March 2001. There has been an increase in the beneficiary accounts opened with the depository
participants from 25,00,000 as on March 31, 2000 to 38,00,000 as on March 31, 2001.

The volume of dematerialised securities constitute around 99.5 percent of the total delivery of
securities at the NSE and BSE together. 10 Stock Exchanges viz. NSE, BSE, CSE, DSE, MSE,
OTCEI, BgSE, LSE, ASE and ICSEIL have established connectivity with NSDL for settlement
and clearing of dematerialised trading.

All  markets  except  China  showed  decline  in  stocks  prices.  A  few  of  these  markets  declined
much more than Indian market. For instance, the Nasdaq of USA, Taiwan Weighted Index, the
Korean  Composite  Index,  Nikkei  225  of  Japan  and  the  Kuala  Lumpur  Composite  index  of
Malaysia registered much larger decline than the BSE Sensex and the S&P CNX Nifty.

P/E ratio and correlation analysis
The prevalent slump in stocks indices was reflected in the downward slide in P/E ratios with the
exception  of  Hong  Kong  and  China.  The  P/E  ratios  as  at  end-March  2001  when  compared  to
with that of 2000 reveal that the Nasdaq had a highest P/E ratio at 208 as on end March 2000
which slightly came down to 196 at end March 2001. Nikkei with 84 as at end March 2000 and
50  at  end  March  2001  followed  by  Sanghai  with  corresponding  figures  of  42  and  48.  At  the
bottom South Korea Comp. had a P/E ratio of 21 as at end March 2000 and 9 as at end March
2001. The BSE Sensex, however, fared better than many countries like South Korea, Hang Seng
and Singapore Straits at 17 as at end March 2001 slightly lower than 19 per cent as at end March
2000. In terms of trend, South Korea came down from 21 to 9 per cent, Taiwan Weighted index
suffered a fall from 51 to 23 per cent and the Kuala Lumpur composite from 38 to 18 per cent.
While the P/E ratio of BSE Sensex slided by 14 per cent, the S&P CNX Nifty suffered a decline

of 20 per cent. The P/ E ratio of Dow Jones Industrial index got devalued by 22 per cent, while

Market volatility in major securities markets in the Asian countries and USA
In almost all the major securities markets across the world, volatility in stock prices was higher
by and large in 2000-01 than that noticed during the previous year, though it showed receding
trend  towards  the  end  of  the  year.  The  volatility  was  on  the  higher  side  during  the  months  of
April to August 2000 and thereafter it showed noticeable declining trend. Month-wise volatility
ratios of major indices in terms of percentages are presented in Table 2.34 for 2000-01. In the

month of April 2000, Korea Comp. recorded the highest volatility of 4.99 per cent followed by
Nasdaq  4.21  per  cent,  S  &  P  CNX  Nifty  3.51  per  cent  and  Sensex  3.93  percent.  Taiwan  and
Brazil  also  demonstrated  high  volatility  at  2.88  per  cent  and  2.91  per  cent,  respectively.  The
volatility was, however, lower in China reflected by China Se Shang. Over the year, there was a
declining tendency in volatility ratios and by March 2001 Nasdaq volatility declined to 3.46 per
cent, that of Korea Comp. to 1.8 per cent and Taiwan Weighted 1.36 per cent. In case of Thai
stock volatility declined to 1.32 per cent. Sensex volatility declined to 2.91 per cent and S & P
CNX Nifty to 2.97 per cent in March 2001. Comparatively, volatility in case of Sensex and S & P
CNX  Nifty  was  always  lower  than  that  of  Nasdaq  and  Korea  Comp.  but  higher  than  those  at
other stock exchanges like Dow Jones, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Brazil etc.

year. The trading members have substantially increased their share from the range of 20 per cent
and 25 per cent to the range of 14 per cent and 26 per cent. Thus, government securities market

Resources mobilised by mutual funds
According  to  data  available,  the  mutual  funds  mobilised  a  gross  amount  of  Rs.92,957  crore
(USD  20.21  billion)  during  the  financial  year  2000-01  compared  to  an  amount  of  Rs.61,241
crore (USD 13.31billion) during the previous year 1999-2000, showing a rise of 51.8 per cent.

After  adjustment  of  repurchases  and  redemptions,  there  was  an  inflow  of  funds  of  Rs.9,128
crore  (USD  1.99  billion)  during  the  financial  year  2000-01  as  compared  to  a  net  inflow  of
Rs.18,969  crore  (USD  4.12  billion)  during  the  financial  year  1999-2000.  The  year  of  1999-
2000  had  performed  extraordinarily  well  in  comparison  to  the  year  1998-99  during  which  all
mutual funds together had recorded net outflows of the order of Rs. 950 crore. Thus, the good
performance  of  1999-2000  could  not  be  sustained  by  the  mutual  fund  industry  inspite  of  the
fact that the fiscal incentives continued during the financial year under review.

The  analysis  of  data  shows  that  there  was  a  net  inflow  of  funds  of  Rs.9,849  crore  in  case  of
private sector mutual funds compared to net inflow of Rs.15,166 crore during the previous year
of  1999-2000.  The  net  inflow  of  UTI  declined  sharply  to  Rs.323  crore  as  compared  to  net
inflow of Rs.4,548.32 crore during the previous year. Public sector mutual funds continued to
show  net  outflow  of  funds  this  year  also  -  there  was  a  net  outflow  of  Rs.1,044.50  crore  in
2000-01 as against net outflow of Rs.744 crore during the previous year.

Total  net  assets  of  all  domestic  schemes  of  mutual  funds  were  Rs.90,586  crore  (USD  19.69
billion)  as  on  March  31,  2001.  During  the  year,  inspite  of  net  inflow  of  funds  to  the  mutual

102

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

fund industry, there was a fall of about 16 per cent in the net assets of the mutual funds which
declined  from  Rs.1,09,746  crore  as  on  March  31,  2000  to  Rs.90,586  crore  as  on  March  31,
2001.  The  fall  in  the  assets  may  be  attributed  to  decline  in  their  investment  in  equity  market
during the year. The details are given in Table 2.38.

The outstanding net assets of mutual funds reflect compositional change in their share. While
the  private  sector  share  in  cumulative  net  assets  increased  from  about  10  percent  at  the  end-
March 1999 to 28.6 percent at end-March 2001, the share of public mutual fund declined from
12.1 percent to 7.3 percent during the same period.

The UTI which is the largest holder of net outstanding net assets of mutual funds, has shown
noticeable fall in its share from 77.9 per cent in 1998-99 to 62.7 per cent in 2000-01 implying
that ownership pattern of mutual fund assets has greatly influenced the performance of mutual
funds.

As can be seen from the Table 2.39 below, there has been an inflow of funds only from open-
ended  schemes  whereas  all  the  close-ended  schemes  have  shown  an  outflow  of  funds.  Thus
total  net  inflow  of  funds  on  account  of  close-ended  schemes  during  2000-01  amounted  to
Rs. 3190.2 crore accounting for nearly 26 percent of the net resources mobilised through open-
ended schemes. It is also observed that the outflow was the highest at Rs. 2531.9 crore during
the year under review on account of public sector mutual funds’ close-ended schemes followed
by UTI with outflow of Rs. 656.0 crore.

Annual Report 2000-2001

Trend in purchases/sales by mutual funds
During the year 2000-01, mutual funds have been net buyers in the debt segment of Rs.5023.49
crore and net sellers in the equity segment of Rs. 2766.98 crore. The month-wise details of the
trend  in  purchases  and  sales  in  the  market  during  the  year  are  given  in  the  table  2.40.  On
aggregate basis, net combined investments of mutual funds in debt and equity were of the order
of Rs.2256.5 crore. It is also observed that investment in debt is more stable and positive than
the investment in equity shares. The frequency of sales is very high in case of equity. It would
be  seen  from  table  2.40  that  sales  were  exceeding  the  purchases  by  more  than  100  per  cent
almost in all the months reflecting the disinvestment by the mutual funds during these months.
On the other hand, in case of debt, sales were less than 100 per cent reflecting net investment
in the debt by the mutual funds.

Annual Report 2000-2001

Offer documents received and cleared by SEBI
During the year 2000-01, the SEBI received 75 offer documents as against 96 offer documents
received during the year 1999-2000. The decline in number of offer documents might be due to
the  reason  that  most  of  the  mutual  funds  have  already  launched  various  open-ended  schemes
for different investment objectives.

The  SEBI  cleared  59  offer  documents  including  6  offer  documents  for  conversion  of  close-
ended schemes into open-ended schemes during the year under review as against a total of 86
offer documents cleared in the previous year. The observations were communicated in case of
all  offer  documents  in  21  working  days  in  accordance  with  the  regulations.  In  most  of  the
remaining cases, the mutual funds have been advised to incorporate the preliminary observations.

Features of offer documents received
The following pattern and features were observed in case of 75 new offer documents received
by SEBI for launching schemes by the mutual funds during the period under review
 37 offer documents have been received for launching income schemes, out of which;







4 offer documents were for launching gilt schemes investing in government securities.
25  offer  documents  were  for  launching  schemes  investing  predominantly  in  corporate
debt securities.
8 offer documents for investing in liquid/ money market instruments.

 19  offer  documents  were  for  growth  schemes  investing  predominantly  in  equities  ,  which

also include sector specific schemes and tax saving schemes.

 11 offer documents were for balanced schemes investing in equities as well as debt securities.
 8 offer documents have been received for conversion of old close-ended schemes into open-

ended schemes.

Schemes launched
The year also saw a decline in the number of new schemes being launched by the mutual funds in
comparison with the previous year. Though 59 offer documents (which includes 6 conversion
schemes) were given clearance, only 29 new schemes were launched by the mutual funds and 4
schemes were converted from close-ended schemes to open-ended schemes. It may be mentioned
here that out of the offer documents cleared by SEBI, there were offer documents of 3 existing
schemes of UTI where UTI agreed to bring them under voluntary compliance arrangement. During
the last financial year 1999-2000, 58 new schemes were launched by the mutual funds in addition
to 21 schemes which were converted from close-ended schemes to open-ended schemes.

Assured return schemes of mutual funds
Some of the schemes which assured returns in the offer documents faced difficulties in meeting
the  assurances.  SEBI  in  pursuing  its  objective  to  protect  the  interest  of  investors  has  been
directing the AMCs/Sponsors to honour their commitments of paying assured returns.

In  case  of  Canstar  Scheme  of  Canbank  Mutual  Fund,  on  the  termination  of  this  scheme  in
September 2000, the mutual fund agreed to pay the redemption price of Rs.40/- per unit on a

107

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

face  value  of  Rs.10/-  as  assured  in  the  offer  document.  A  sum  of  Rs.87.60  crore  would  be
contributed by its sponsor, Canara Bank, to meet the shortfall as and when the investors approach
the mutual fund for redemption of their Canstar units. An amount of Rs. 45 crore has already
been paid to the unitholders.

Bank of India, the sponsor of BOI Mutual Fund contributed Rs.224.92 crore to meet the assured
returns in case of its Double Square Plus Scheme which matured during the year.

The sponsors/AMC of GIC Mutual Fund have contributed Rs.138 crore in case of GIC Rise 91
and  Rs.5.66  crore  in  case  GIC  Suraksha  96.  In  case  of  the  Dhanvarsha  (6)  scheme  of  LIC
Mutual Fund, the AMC/ sponsor has contributed Rs.1.03 crore towards the shortfall.

Due  to  directions  by  SEBI,  the  sponsors  and  asset  management  companies  of  7  mutual  funds
have contributed a total amount of Rs. 2,438.16 crore to meet the shortfall in case of 22 schemes
as on March 31, 2001 as compared to Rs. 1,979.35 crore for 19 schemes which was paid as on
March  31,  2000.  It  may  be  mentioned  here  that  many  of  these  schemes  were  launched  even
before  the  enactment  of  the  SEBI  Act  1992.  The  details  of  these  schemes,  contribution  made
by the asset management companies or the sponsors are given in Table 2.43.

Annual Report 2000-2001

Developments with respect to collective investment schemes
Subsequent to the notification of regulations, SEBI received applications for grant of registration
from 50 CIS entities. This includes 3 entities which had not filed information with SEBI earlier,
but have now filed an application for grant of registration.

Out  of  the  50  CIS  entities  which  had  filed  application  for  grant  of  registration,  SEBI  granted
provisional registration to 4 CIS entities, while applications of 13 CIS entities were been rejected
and they were ordered to wind up their schemes and make repayment to their investors.

An existing CIS which has failed to make an application for registration to SEBI has to wind
up  its  existing  schemes  and  make  repayment  to  the  investors  and  thereafter  submit  “Winding
up  and  Repayment  Report”  to  SEBI.  SEBI  has  received  such  “Winding  up  and  Repayment
Report” from 30 existing CIS entities.

Taking into account CIS entities whose applications for grant of registration are under process;
CIS entities against whom the Hon’ble Courts passed specific Orders; CIS entities which wound
up their existing schemes and made repayment to their investors; and CIS entities which have
been granted hearing before the Chairman; SEBI, in the interests of investors has issued Directions
under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 65 and 73 of SEBI (Collective
Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 to the remaining CIS entities. These Directions dated
December  7,  2000  have  been  sent  to  523  CIS  entities,  directing  them  to  refund  the  money
collected under the scheme(s) with returns which is due to the investors as per the terms of the
offer within a period of one month from the date of the Order failing which it was impressed
upon them that further action(s) would be initiated against them.

As the one month time period, for making payment to the investors, specified in the Order has
passed,  SEBI  has  initiated  the  process  of  action(s)  as  mentioned  in  the  Order.  Accordingly,
prosecution  under  Section  24  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  which  prescribes  imprisonment  for  a  term
which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both is being taken up. Also, other actions,
as mentioned in the Order, such as debarring the promoters / directors / managers / persons in
charge  of  the  business  of  the  scheme  from  operating  in  the  capital  market  for  a  period  of  5
years; writing to the State Governments / local police to register civil / criminal cases against
the  erring  entities  for  apparent  offences  of  fraud,  cheating,  criminal  breach  of  trust  and
misappropriation of public funds; writing to the Department of Company Affairs to initiate the
process of winding up of the erring CIS entities are also being taken up.

SEBI  has  been  issuing  extensive  press  releases  /  public  notices  from  time  to  time  to  educate
and  caution  the  investors  about  risks  associated  with  investments  in  collective  investment
schemes.  Members  of  the  public  have  also  been  cautioned  through  these  public  notices  that
they  should  not  invest  in  the  CIS  entities  which  are  not  registered  with  SEBI.  SEBI  has  also
broadcast  message  for  investors  in  collective  investment  schemes  through  National  hook-up
and Regional stations of Vividh Bharati. SEBI has also issued message in the interest of investors
on National channel and Regional stations of Doordarshan, in this regard.

D] FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT
Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) in the Indian capital market had shown remarkable recovery
from  a  negative  net  investment  of  US$  386.1  million  in  1998-99  to  US$  2.3  billion  in  1999-
2000. This positive trend continued in 2000-01 also and foreign institutional investors invested
about US$ 2.16 billion. In rupee terms the net investment was of the order of Rs.10121.9 crore
in 1999-2000 which showed a decline to Rs.9934.3 crore in 2000-01 at the rate of 1.9 per cent.
In dollar terms, however, the decline was higher at 7.7 per cent probably due to appreciation of
dollar.

On account of sluggish trend prevailing in the South East Asian countries’ stock markets and
the resultant effect of crash in the value of the Information Technology stocks in the American
stock  market,  the  first  9  months  of  the  year  2000-2001  witnessed  a  net  investment  of  Rs.
2,031.6  crore.  However,  during  the  last  quarter  of  2000-01,  the  net  FIIs  investment  was  Rs.
7,902.7  crore  which  is  more  than  the  total  net  investment  by  FIIs  during  the  financial  year
1997-98 and 1998-99. The total cumulative net investment as at March 31, 2001, made by the
FIIs  in  the  Indian  Capital  Market  since  September  1992,  was  US  $13.39  billion.  The  yearly
cumulative net investment made by FIIs is given in the Table 2.44.

As regards transaction activities of FIIs, they made gross purchases of Rs.74,050.6 crore during
2000-01as compared to Rs. 56,855.5 crore in 1999-2000 recording an increase of 30.2 per cent.
It  would  be  seen  from  Table  2.45  that  inspite  of  very  large  increase  in  gross  purchases,  net
investment  declined  during  the  year  under  review  because  of  heavy  sales  of  FIIs  during  the
months of June 2000, July 2000, October 2000 and December 2000. The sales were also large
in the months of May 2000 and December 2000. In the four months of June, July, October and
December the FIIs made large disinvestment as their gross sales exceeded the gross purchases.

E] SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF SHARES AND TAKE-OVERS
During  the  year  2000-01,  77  letters  of  offer  for  making  open  offers  were  filed  with  SEBI.
Under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers), Regulations, 1997, a category
of  non-applicability  of  open  offer  obligations  was  introduced  to  automatically  exempt  certain
transactions from open offer which may become necessary in the overall commercial and business
interest  of  the  company.  During  the  year,  248  reports  were  filed  under  this  category.  The
transactions, which are not covered under the said category, are required to be submitted to the
Takeover  Panel  for  exemption  from  open  offer.  During  the  year,  38  such  applications  were
submitted out of which exemption from making open offer was granted in respect of 21 cases.
(Table 2.46).

INVESTIGATION, ENFORCEMENT AND SURVEILLANCE

MARKET SURVEILLANCE

Market Surveillance plays a key role in ensuring safety and integrity of the markets. The Market
Surveillance Division of SEBI keeps a proactive oversight on the surveillance activities of the
stock exchanges.

112

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

SEBI’s market surveillance essentially focuses on:









policy formulation for introduction of surveillance systems at the stock exchanges to bring
integrity, safety and stability in the Indian securities markets;
overseeing  the  surveillance  activities  of  the  stock  exchanges  including  the  monitoring  of
market movements by them;
inspection of the surveillance cells of the stock exchanges; and
preparation of reports and studies on market movements, which SEBI circulates, periodically
to the Government of India and to securities markets regulators from other countries.

The  primary  responsibility  of  market  surveillance  has  been  entrusted  to  the  stock  exchanges.
However,  SEBI  keeps  a  proactive  oversight  on  market  monitoring  and  in  exceptional
circumstances it analyses the same. When appropriate, on the basis of reports received from the
stock exchanges or specific complaints, preliminary enquiries are conducted to determine whether
the trading raises suspicion of market manipulation and/or insider dealing. At times, on exception
basis only, cases are taken up suo-moto also. In case an analysis of the trading information for
the  stock  exchanges  leads  to  a  suspicion  of  market  abuse,  then,  client  details  and  records  are
obtained  from  the  stockbrokers.  If  further  analysis  of  these  records  suggests  the  possibility  of
occurrence  of  market  manipulation  or  insider  dealing  or  other  misconduct,  investigations  are
initiated.

The Market Surveillance systems are developed and consolidated on a continuous basis. Some
of  the  surveillance  systems  and  risk  containment  measures  that  have  been  put  in  place  are
briefly given below:

 Risk containment measures in the form of elaborate margining system and linking of intra-

day trading limits and exposure limits to capital adequacy;

 Daily price bands to curb abnormal price behavior and volatility;

 Reporting by stock exchanges through periodic and event driven reports;

 Establishment of independent surveillance cells in stock exchanges;

 Inspection of intermediaries;

 Imposition of trading restrictions including suspension of trading in scrips by exchanges to

prevent market manipulation;

 Formation of Inter Exchange Market Surveillance Group for prompt, interactive and effective

decision making on surveillance issues and co-ordination between stock exchanges;

 Implementation  of  On-line  automated  surveillance  system  (Stock  Watch  System)  at  stock

exchanges.

Mechanisms for a fair and transparent securities market
In order to make the securities markets fair and transparent and for enhanced investor protection,
SEBI had taken initiatives, which are given below:

113

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

Dissemination of price sensitive information to public

It is necessary to have a proper method for dissemination of price sensitive and other important
information  relating  to  companies  and  market  to  the  public  so  that  they  can  make  informed
investment  decisions.  The  stock  exchanges  have  been  advised  to  display  such  information  on
their terminals in the quickest possible manner.

Dealing with market rumours

Market  rumours  can  do  considerable  damage  to  the  normal  functioning  and  behaviour  of  the
securities market. It is therefore essential to have quick verification of such rumours from the
corporates as well as from other entities whenever necessary. On being asked by SEBI, companies
have designated compliance officers who would be contacted by the stock exchanges whenever
such verification is needed. Exchanges have been asked to take up quick verification of rumours
and proper dissemination of the same. Exchanges have started verifying rumours and the same
are getting reported to SEBI also.

Public disclosure of information relating to actions taken against stockbrokers

The stock exchanges are required to make public the actions taken by the Disciplinary Action
Committee  of  the  stock  exchanges  against  their  member  brokers.  The  stock  exchanges  have
also been asked to issue press releases when such actions are of serious nature.

Strengthening of insider trading regulations

While insider-trading regulations were framed in 1992, it was felt that there was no framework
for  prevention  of  insider  trading.  A  group  was  set  up  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  Kumar
Mangalam  Birla,  member,  SEBI,  Board  to  suggest  measures  to  be  taken  for  strengthening  of
the regulations as well as requirements of procedures, code of conduct and reporting for entities
in the capital market which may have access to non-public information.

Drafts of suggested procedures and code of conduct and code of corporate disclosure practices
were prepared and circulated to a cross section of corporates, market intermediaries like merchant
bankers, brokers and mutual funds, industry associations, financial institutions and professional
firms for their comments.

After incorporating suggestions received, the group finalised a set of suggested code of internal
procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities, and a code of corporate disclosure
practices for prevention of insider trading. The group recommended amendments in the Insider
Trading Regulations to provide for adoption of these codes by listed companies and other entities
and recommended some amendments in the existing provisions to strengthen the Insider Trading
Regulations.

The recommendations of the group have been put up for consideration of the Board.

Surveillance in internet environment
Internet based securities trading was permitted in Indian capital markets in Jan 2000. Internet is
a versatile medium and apart from proliferating genuine applications, it has also provided new
avenues for market manipulators and fraudsters. The SEBI Committee on Internet based trading
and services has set up a working group to look into surveillance and monitoring related issues
arising due to Internet based securities trading. The group is in the process of deliberations on
the issue.

Co-ordination and sharing of information
Information  sharing  between  exchanges  is  crucial  in  the  light  of  multiple  listings  and
memberships, trading aberrations and also in the context of derivatives trading. After discussion
on this issue with exchanges, it was decided that the exchange would designate a senior level
official handling surveillance function to co-ordinate with other exchanges on surveillance matters.
It  has  been  advised  that  these  officials  would  meet  periodically,  at  least  once  in  a  month,  to
discuss relevant issues and evolve a continuous mechanism for information sharing.

Greater responsibility and accountability of the surveillance cells of the stock exchanges
SEBI has initiated several steps in order to bring about greater responsibility and accountability
in discharging the surveillance functions by stock exchanges.

Reporting by stock exchanges
For  overseeing  and  supervision  of  the  surveillance  activity  at  stock  exchanges,  SEBI  receives
both periodic as well as event driven reports from exchanges.

The  periodic  reports  comprise  of  the  settlement  report  which  includes  details  about  overall
safety  level  at  the  exchange,  member  deactivations,  scrip  suspension,  instances  of  rumor
verifications, working of stock watch system and reporting on exception basis, any happenings,
trends, events, specific actions/ decisions which have bearing on risk management of the exchange
and safety and integrity of market. The monthly report gives details about analysis/investigations
taken  up  by  the  exchanges  following  investor  complaints  forwarded  by  SEBI  or  otherwise,
outcome of the same and actions taken by the exchange against members/ issuers, and reporting
on exception basis, any happenings, trends, events, specific actions/ decisions which have bearing
on risk management of the exchange and safety and integrity of market.

Documentation
Surveillance  cells  of  stock  exchanges  have  been  advised  to  devise  an  internal  system  of
documentation of their surveillance activities and follow-up actions.

Surveillance staff strength at exchanges
To  improve  the  functioning  of  the  surveillance  cells  of  stock  exchanges,  it  has  been  decided
that exchanges will take steps to assess manpower requirements and deploy adequate staff for

115

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

surveillance  and  monitoring.  Exchanges  are  also  required  to  provide  appropriate  training  and
certification to surveillance staff and facilitate process of certification.

Surveillance staff strength and training and certification of staff
The functioning of the surveillance department depends on, inter alia, availability of adequate
number of trained staff. It was decided that exchanges would suitably enhance staff strength for
surveillance  functioning.  Exchanges  are  also  required  to  provide  appropriate  training  and
certification  to  surveillance  staff  and  facilitate  process  of  certification.  For  training  and
certification of staff, training modules would be offered by NSE/BSE.

Development of the stock exchanges as self-regulatory organisations
The exchanges are empowered by their bye-laws and regulation to perform necessary functions
for enabling trading and settlement activity. The functions undertaken by exchanges include

ensuring adherence to risk management measures

–
– conducting settlement process and guarantee the settlements
– monitoring market trading activity including trading data and member positions.
–
–
–

taking up periodic inspections and special inspection of brokers
taking up analysis and investigation into abnormal trading activity
taking action against members including imposing fines / penalties, de-activation of terminals,
suspension of trading, expulsion from exchange, declaring a member defaulter, etc.

Thus, the exchanges are the first level regulators and the primary responsibility of monitoring
and  surveillance  lies  with  them.  SEBI  has  been  trying  to  strengthen  the  role  of  exchanges  as
effective  self-regulatory  organisations.  Setting  up  of  independent  surveillance  cells  directly
reporting  to  the  exchange  executive  directors  was  a  step  in  this  direction.  Development  of
exchange level surveillance capabilities like stock watch system, directing exchanges to augment
their surveillance staff strength and devising a training and certification module for the exchange
surveillance staff are further initiatives taken by SEBI in this direction.

To  perform  their  self-regulatory  role,  the  exchanges  have  direct  and  immediate  access  to  the
trading  data  including  member  positions.  Surveillance  and  monitoring  of  trading,  detection  of
abnormal  trading  patterns,  analysis  and  initiation  of  investigations  has  been  entrusted  to
exchanges. Exchanges are required to make reference to SEBI, in appropriate cases, for further
investigations  by  SEBI.  In  the  year  2000-2001,  in  17  cases,  further  investigations  were  taken
up by SEBI on reference from exchanges. Major exchanges conducted suo-moto investigations
in more than 100 other cases. As part of its oversight of surveillance activity, SEBI also takes
up  cases  for  investigations,  but  this  is  done  on  exception  basis  only.  In  the  year,  in  38  cases,
exchanges  were  asked  by  SEBI,  on  the  basis  of  complaints/  references  received,  to  conduct
investigations/  send  details  to  SEBI.  In  some  of  these  cases,  exchanges  had  already  initiated
investigations on their own.

116

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

Development and implementation of stock watch system – an on-line
automated surveillance system

SEBI  had  asked  the  exchanges  to  develop  and  implement  an  online  market  monitoring  and
surveillance system on the basis of basic parameters specified by SEBI.

Major  exchanges  have  implemented  the  real-time  alert  generation  systems  at  a  basic  level.
However, as the hardware and software is vendor supplied and is different in different exchanges,
the implementation differs from exchange to exchange. Further, the benchmarking of parameters,
prioritisation  of  alerts  and  connectivity  with  various  databases  is  still  in  the  process  of
implementation.  Because  of  non-availability  of  information  in  electronic  form,  population  of
some  of  the  databases  has  been  done  partially.  This  information  is  filed  in  manually  with
exchanges.  Therefore  it  was  decided  that  exchanges  would  develop  a  secure  link  between
stockwatch databases and the central database for filing envisaged by SEBI. This would enable
immediate  updation  of  information  with  all  exchanges,  as  soon  as  it  was  made  public  by
companies through the central database.

Some other constraints/ limitations faced by exchanges in implementation of the system are as
follows:

– With  a  high  rate  of  growth  in  trading  volumes,  additional  hardware  may  be  required  to

handle increasing volumes.

– Software changes are continuously required in the light of changes in the rules or guidelines
with regard to trading, risk management etc. Whenever such changes are made in the software,
software bugs may crop up, which take time to be rectified.

–

Introduction of derivatives trading, on-line trading on Internet etc. requires upgradation of
the surveillance systems.

Inter exchange market surveillance group

There  are  24  stock  exchanges  having  different  trading  and  settlement  cycles  and  at  the  same
time  scrips  have  multiple  listing  on  these  stock  exchanges.  For  effective  and  meaningful  co-
ordination between these stock exchanges for healthy functioning of the market, an Inter Exchange
Market Surveillance Group was set up by SEBI and the group meets at regular intervals. The
group through its meeting facilitated an inter-action between exchanges over surveillance issues
and  also  initiated  surveillance  related  policies.  Improvements  in  the  surveillance  system  of
exchanges in view of investigations and inspections by SEBI were discussed and communicated
to exchanges through the group. Some of the recent decisions taken under the aegis of ISG are
as follows:

Maintaining historical records of trade logs and order logs: Records of trade and order logs are
maintained by different stock exchanges for different periods. Both logs may be required at a
later  date,  in  connection  with  investigations  into  trading  patterns  or  for  other  reasons.  It  was
decided  that  trade  logs  would  be  maintained  by  exchanges  for  a  minimum  period  of  seven
years and order logs would be maintained for minimum five years. It was further decided that

117

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

brokers should maintain a mapping of their client Id’s i.e. particulars like names, contact details,
details of introducer and other details given in the Know your Client Form for each Client ID
for a period of seven years.

New  listings:  For  allowing  price  formation,  price  bands  were  kept  open  on  the  first  day  of
listing of a security. Wide fluctuations were observed at times on the first day. It was decided
that exchanges would develop a software module by 31st March 2001 for pre-opening session
of one hour for new listings. This session would be used to determine the base price of the new
listed security, which would be communicated to other exchanges, during a cooling-off period
of  one-hour.  Trading  would  be  opened  after  one  hour  with  price  bands  applicable  to  the  base
price so determined. However, till such a system was implemented, exchanges would continue
with the present system.

Enforcement  Manual:  It  was  decided  that  exchanges  would  develop  their  own  enforcement
manual for providing guidance to staff and standardizing procedures.

Database  on  violations,  contravention’s,  non-compliance  and  actions  taken:  Exchanges  were
advised  to  develop  internal  databases  compiling  details  of  contravention,  instances  of  non-
compliance by members as well as listed companies and details of action taken by exchanges
in all such cases.

Powers of the exchange to take action against members:  It was seen that Articles, Bye-Laws,
Rules and Regulations of some exchanges limit the penalty which can be imposed on members
for non-compliance to nominal amounts, whereas other exchanges allow actions such as expulsion
or suspension of trading rights, de-activation of trading terminals and imposition of fines/penalty
without specifying the maximum fine/penalty to be imposed. Some exchanges were unable to
take disciplinary actions in respect of their members due to inadequate powers. It was decided
that necessary changes would be made in the Articles, Bye-Laws, Rules and Regulations by the
concerned exchanges to have such powers.

Inspection of surveillance cells of stock exchanges

The  surveillance  cells  of  stock  exchanges  have  been  strengthened  in  terms  of  manpower  and
systems as directed by SEBI. During 1999-2000, SEBI inspected surveillance cells of 3 stock
exchanges.

Regulatory role in the context of market volatility
Though volatility is an inherent aspect of the securities markets, excessive volatility is a cause
of concern for regulators, corporates and investors. When prices swing at extreme levels, they
can have a number of adverse consequences including the following:



such volatility increases trading risks and requires market intermediaries to charge more for
their liquidity services, thereby reducing the liquidity of the market as a whole.

118

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001



if such volatility persists, securities firms are less able to use their available capital efficiently
because of the need to reserve a larger percentage of cash-equivalent investments to reassure
lenders and regulators.



it can reduce investor confidence in investing in the markets.

As a result of these effects, increased price volatility could in the long run, impact the securities
markets adversely. Regulators across the world remain concerned about excessive price volatility.

Date

The  Indian  markets  which  were  on  an  upward  trend  from  mid  1999  to  around  March  2000,
started  to  show  downward  trend/correction  from  April  2000  onwards.  The  Sensex  fell  from  a
high of 5541 on April 11, 2000 to touch 3933 on May 24, 2000. Though the markets remained
at  stable  levels  from  July  to  Sep,  2000,  the  downward  trend  continued  in  the  later  part  of  the
year and sharply precipitated in March 2001, with the Sensex touching a low of 3540 on March
13,  2001.  This  trend  was  in  consonance  with  the  trend  in  all  stock  markets  across  the  world.
For  example,  during  the  same  period,  the  Japanese  market  index  touched  a  twelve  year  low,
and  the  Nasdaq  Composite  index  touched  a  two  year  low  after  recording  life  high  in  March
2000.

Technology,  media  and  telecom  sectors  have  dominated  the  economy  and  the  markets  in  the
recent  past.  This  resulted  in  greater  influence  of  global  markets  on  the  Indian  stock  markets,
particularly  the  perception  of  investors  in  India  that  price  movements  in  Indian  Markets  have
linkage with the movements on Nasdaq. Because of absence of existing models of valuation in
the so called new economy stocks, trading in such stocks was more sentiment driven and less
related  to  fundamentals.  As  earnings  by  these  companies  fell  short  of  market  expectations,  a
negative sentiment towards these sectors dominated markets worldwide.

Annual Report 2000-2001

In addition to the global influences several domestic factors contributed in a significant manner
towards the downward trend during the period beginning around October, 2000 onwards. Some
of these factors have been as under:

1. Downward pressure on Indian Rupee vis-à-vis dollar

2. Fears of economic slow down as indicated by key indicators and particularly the Economic

Survey 2000-2001.

3. Reduction in rating of India by Standard & Poor.

4. Downward  revision  of  weightage  to  India  in  recasting  of  MSCI  (Morgan  Stanley  Capital

International) Index.

5. Devastating earthquake in Gujarat in January 2001 causing extensive loss to life, property

and business.

The  markets  witnessed  high  volatility  in  the  early  part  of  the  financial  year.  Sensex  volatility
(calculated  on  a  30-day  rolling  window)  peaked  at  3.62  per  cent  during  May  2000.  In  the
relatively stable period from July to Sep 2000, volatility fell to as low as 1.08 per cent. But as
the  markets  started  moving  downwards  from  Oct  2000  onwards,  volatility  rose  to  touch  2.66
per  cent  in  March  2001.  While  fluctuation  in  markets  is  on  account  of  various  factors,  the
principal concern of SEBI is to ensure that the markets are safe and fair. To ensure this, SEBI
put in place several surveillance and risk containment measures like capital adequacy, margining
system,  exposure  controls  and  price  bands.  Also,  SEBI  interacted  with  the  stock  exchanges
through  meeting  of  the  Inter  Exchange  Market  Surveillance  Group  and  the  Risk  management
Group held from time to time

Some of the measures taken by SEBI to maintain market stability during the period when the
markets started showing downward volatile trend from April 2000 onwards, are as follows:

–

It was decided that in the carry forward system, carry forward charges would not be payable
to the short sellers who did not either own shares or did not borrow shares.

– To encourage delivery based transactions, cash margin requirements was relaxed for delivery
based  transactions  and  it  was  decided  to  allow  all  margins  to  be  paid  in  the  form  of  bank
guarantees for such trades.

– Minimum margin requirement of 10 per cent to be maintained by clients with their broker

was specified.

Following temporary measures were taken from time to time:

– Additional margin of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on net sale positions was imposed.

– Compulsory delivery of end of the day net sale position during certain period

121

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

– Threshold level for applicability of volatility margin was reduced

– Exchanges imposed special and ad-hoc margins

– Exchanges were asked to examine trading activity of top brokers from time to time.

Because  of  the  systems  put  in  place  and  proactive  measures  by  SEBI  discussed  above  there
have  not  been  any  system  failures  except  some  payment  problems  at  CSE.  This  is  inspite  of
highly volatile conditions witnessed in May 2000 and then in March 2001.

INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations are carried out with a view to gather evidence of alleged violations of securities
market such as price rigging, creation of artificial market, insider trading, public issue related
irregularities  and  other  misconduct,  as  well  as  to  find  out  persons/entities  behind  these
irregularities  and  violations.  SEBI  has  been  strengthening  its  investigation  activities  over  the
years and these activities were further strengthened during 2000-2001.

Pursuant to completion of investigation, various actions like administrative directions and penal
actions  under  the  SEBI  Act  and  the  various  SEBI  Rules  and  Regulations  were  undertaken.
These actions include monetary penalties, warning, suspension of activities and cancellation of
registration, refund of issue proceeds, prohibiting dealing in securities and access to the capital
market, asking trustees and key persons of mutual fund to step down for their failure to protect
the interest of the investors, etc.

Summary of representative investigation cases
During the year 2000-2001, 68 cases were taken up for investigation. These cases pertained to
allegations of market manipulations and price rigging, issue related manipulations, insider trading,
non-compliance with Takeover Regulations, mis-statement in the prospectus, etc. Out of these
68  cases,  investigations  were  taken  up  in  47  cases  of  alleged  market  manipulation  and  price
rigging,  5  cases  of  issue  related  manipulations,  6  fresh  cases  of  alleged  insider  trading,  etc.
Such  investigations  coupled  with  effective  market  surveillance  under  the  oversight  of  SEBI
have resulted in significant reduction in cases of market manipulation and price rigging.

During 2000-01, investigations in 26 cases of market manipulation and price rigging, 8 cases of
issue related manipulations, 5 cases of insider trading, 3 cases of takeover code violations were
completed.  The  investigations  into  market  manipulation  cases  have  brought  out  that  certain
persons / entities created artificial market and manipulated the prices of certain scrips. Likewise,
investigations into issue related manipulations showed that there was mis-use of stock invests,
arrangement of subscription to circumvent requirement of minimum subscription, buy-back of
shares  by  the  company  in  contravention  of  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act,  acceptance  of
applications after the closure of the issue, gray market operations, mis-statement in prospectus
etc. After completion of investigations, SEBI has ordered refund of the issue proceeds in four
cases.  Investigations  into  alleged  insider  trading  cases  revealed  that  in  one  instance  insider
trading had taken place.

Some of the representative cases where investigations have been completed during 2000-2001
are discussed below: -

Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (BDMCL)
Investigations were conducted by SEBI into the alleged acquisition of shares in excess of 5 per
cent of the paid up equity capital of Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co. Ltd (BDMCL), by
certain  entities  acting  in  concert,  in  violation  of  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  &
Takeover)  Regulations,  1997.  The  matter  was  also  reported  on  a  large  scale  in  the  media.
Various contentions and claims were made through media by the acquirer and the target company
BDMCL. In order to ascertain the facts in respect of aforesaid issues, investigation was ordered
by  Chairman  in  terms  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  read  with  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares
and Takeover) Regulations, 1997 and SEBI (Stock and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992.

Investigations  revealed  that  Shri  Arun  Bajoria  acquired  shares  in  excess  of  5  per  cent  of  the
equity capital of BDMCL on March 15, 2000, however he did not make disclosure in respect
of his holding in excess of 5 per cent of the paid up equity capital to the company BDMCL. It
was contended by Shri Arun Kumar Bajoria that he had made the necessary disclosures to the
company within the stipulated time and also disclosed his holding to Calcutta Stock Exchange.
It was contended that a letter was sent to BDMCL by “Under Certificate of Posting” in which
the disclosure of shareholding was made. It was also contended that a letter was sent to CSE in
which the disclosure of holding was made by Shri Arun Kumar Bajoria. Investigations revealed
that  Shri  Arun  Kumar  Bajoria  did  not  send  intimation  required  to  be  sent  under  the  SEBI
(Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  &  Takeover)  Regulations,  in  respect  of  his  holding  to  the

127

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

company  BDMCL  and  the  contentions  of  Shri  Arun  Kumar  Bajoria  in  this  regard  were  not
correct. Investigations also brought out that no letter was sent by Shri Arun Kumar Bajoria to
CSE  in  respect  of  his  holdings  in  BDMCL  within  the  stipulated  time.  It  was  found  that  Shri
Arun  Bajoria  and  persons  acting  in  concert  violated  provisions  of  Regulation  7(1)  of  SEBI
(Substantial Acquisition of Shares & Takeover) Regulations, 1997. Pursuant to investigations,
proceedings u/s 11(B) of SEBI Act, read with Regulation 44 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition
of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997, have been initiated against Shri Arun Kumar Bajoria
and persons acting in concert.

Vakrangee Software Ltd.
There  were  allegations  of  creation  of  artificial  market  and  manipulation  of  the  price  in  this
scrip.  The  price  of  the  scrip  had  moved  from  Rs.10/-  to  Rs.600/-  during  September  1999  to
March  2000.  Investigations  revealed  that  certain  entities  transacted  in  the  scrip  to  manipulate
the price by cornering substantial quantity of floating stock in the scrip by making purchases in
large quantities. These entities manipulated the price of the scrip by misusing the circuit filter
mechanism of the stock exchange. Large orders were entered in the trading system immediately
on opening of the trading session at a price which was 8 per cent higher than the price of the
previous closing day which led to creation of artificially high price of the scrip on subsequent
days.  The  investigation  established  that  trading  by  these  entities  violated  provisions  of  SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  Unfair  Trade  Practices  relating  to  Securities  Markets)  Regulations,
1995 and SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997. Cornering
of the floating stock was done by indulging in off-market transactions in violation of provisions
of  the  Securities  Contract  Act,  1956  and  SEBI  (Stock  Brokers  and  Sub-Brokers)  Rules  and
Regulations  1992.  Pursuant  to  investigations,  proceedings  u/s  11(B)  of  SEBI  Act,  read  with
Regulation 11 ((Prohibition of Fraudulent Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Markets)
Regulations, 1995, have been initiated. Enquiry proceedings have been initiated against brokers
and sub-brokers involved. Adjudication proceedings have also been initiated u/s.15A (b) of the
SEBI Act, 1992 against some of these entities.

Krishna Filaments Ltd.
Investigations were conducted by SEBI to examine the abnormal spurt in price and volume in
the scrip of Krishna Filaments Ltd. (KFL) during the period May-June 1998. KFL had brought
out a public issue of optionally fully convertible discounted debentures (OFCDD) in April 1997
of Rs. 200 each. The debentures were convertible into an equity share at the end of 17 months
at  a  discount  of  33  1/3  per  cent  to  the  closing  prices  for  the  previous  six  months  at  BSE.
Investigations revealed that there were large purchases by a set of entities prior to the conversion
date (record date for conversion fell on 13/11/98). Cornering of shares started much earlier and
through  a  set  of  six  companies  controlled  by  two  Chartered  Accountants  who  were  actually
college teachers.

The  entire  dealing  of  shares  (including  placement  of  orders,  receipt  of  delivery  from  brokers/
sub-brokers)  and  arrangement  of  funds  relating  to  purchase  of  shares  in  the  name  of  these
entities was done by the Managing Director of KFL. Funds for the purchase of shares were also

128

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

provided by the promoters by siphoning off funds from KFL itself by getting fictitious bills for
machinery/  spare  parts  etc  from  these  entities.  Some  of  the  shares  held  in  the  name  of  these
entities were fraudulently pledged by KFL in favour of IDBI for availing foreign currency loan.
KFL used all the entities to purchase its own shares and at all time these shares were in control
and possession of KFL.

It  was  noticed  that  shares  held  in  the  name  of  the  six  companies  were  later  transferred  to
another set of three front companies of KFL. These three front companies showed purchase of
shares of KFL and Krishna Vinyls Ltd (KVL), an unlisted associate concern of KFL, from the
six  companies  by  raising  debit  notes  in  off  market  deals.  Even  these  debit  notes  were  ante
dated in order to justify possession of shares, consequent to searches by Income Tax Department
at  KFL  group  companies  and  their  directors.  The  shares  were  shown  to  have  been  sold  at
prices, which had no relevance with the then existing market price.

Investigations  further  brought  out  that  during  the  period  1/9/97  to  31/12/98,  KFL  transferred
funds  to  its  seven  front  entities  –  directly  or  indirectly  under  the  garb  of  investment  in  these
companies  by  way  of  preference  shares  or  ICDs.  Funds  so  transferred  were  used  by  these
companies  to  corner  the  floating  stock  of  KFL  from  the  Secondary  Market  through  various
brokers  and  sub-brokers.  These  companies  purchased  13,48,000  shares  of  KFL  on  continuous
basis in BSE and NSE. All these acquisitions, which constituted 29.31 per cent of equity share
capital before conversion of OFCDs, were made before the date fixed for conversion of OFCDD
into equity shares. Funds to the tune of Rs.27.03 crores were transferred by KFL/its associate
concerns  for  purchase  of  shares  of  KFL/KVL.  Thus  a  complicated  web  of  various  companies
was  created  so  that  identity  of  persons  carrying  rigging  of  prices  of  the  scrip  of  KFL  was
hidden behind smoke screen of these front companies. Continuous delivery based purchases of
its shares by KFL through its front entities, further squeezed the already low floating stock and
this  cornering  led  to  price  rigging  of  shares  from  Rs.153  level  to  Rs.311  level.  This  rigging
enabled KFL to fix the conversion price of its OFCDD at Rs.144/- per share. This acquisition
also resulted in increase in the holding by promoters / directors / associate concerns of KFL to
over 94 per cent of the equity before conversion of OFCDD. Enquiry proceedings were initiated
against  the  brokers  and  actions  are  being  taken  as  per  the  SEBI  Act  and  Regulations  against
Directors of KFL and other persons/entities who have abetted them in this act.

Exel Software Ltd.
The  case  of  Exel  Softwares  Ltd.  was  taken  up  because  of  abnormal  activity  in  the  scrip  in
terms of large volumes immediately after listing on the BSE despite the fact that the company
had its registered office at Chandigarh and issue applicants were mainly from New Delhi and
Ludhiana.  The  volumes  were  not  observed  on  Ludhiana  or  Delhi  Stock  Exchanges.  Further,
concentration was seen in terms of the quantity purchased and there was auction and subsequent
close  out  of  large  quantity  of  shares.  The  beneficiaries  were  only  two  trading  members.
Investigations  revealed  that  there  were  large  scale  irregularities  in  the  maiden  public  issue  of
the company and there had been cornering of shares leading to price manipulation.

The shares were cornered at the time of public issue through unofficial buyback arrangement.
Certain shareholders admitted that the company had entered into an arrangement with them to

129

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

bailout the public issue which was not getting minimum required 90 per cent subscription and
agreed that subsequent to allotment their shares will be bought back by the company itself.

During  the  period  when  the  scrip  of  Exel  Softwares  Ltd.  was  traded  the  purchases  were
concentrated on counters of two Bombay based brokers. The clients of these brokers belonged
to one group only. It was also observed that the shares subscribed by promoters through financing
arrangement were also delivered by persons belonging to this group Thus volumes were generated
by  certain  persons  acting  in  concert  with  the  brokers.  Artificial  liquidity  was  created  through
large transactions on squaring up basis. Artificial scarcity was created by concentrated buying
knowing fully well that floating stock was low (cornering by the promoters just after the public
issue). This was done with the sole purpose of inducing others to buy and sell shares of ESL. It
was also noticed that false rumours were being floated to create artificial liquidity and demand
in  the  scrip.  When  the  general  public  entered  the  market  pursuant  to  artificial  creation  of  the
market, promoters off-loaded part of the shares purchased from the financiers.

Pursuant to investigations it was recommended that prosecution proceedings be initiated against
the  company  directors,  clients  of  the  brokers  and  sub-brokers  and  their  aides  and  abettors.
Further suitable directions were issued to not to allow ill-gotten profits of the auction/closeout
proceeds  to  be  released  to  the  market  manipulators  and  instead  be  transferred  to  the  Investor
Protection Fund of the Exchange. Enquiry proceedings have been initiated against the registrars
to the issue and the broker involved.

Soundcraft Industries Ltd.
Investigation  was  initiated  on  the  basis  of  a  reference  from  exchanges  on  alleged  attempt  by
certain  entities  to  create  false  market  and  manipulate  the  price  of  Sound  Craft  Industries  Ltd.
Investigations  brought  out  various  irregularities  committed  in  the  scrip  by  the  market
intermediaries / non-intermediaries and revealed that certain entities tried to create a false market
for the shares of Soundcraft Industries Ltd. through “Circular trading” i.e. by making simultaneous
sales  and  purchases  through  the  counters  of  different  brokers.  Sellers  and  buyers  connived  to
create large buy / sell positions in the scrip.

Facts on record indicated that the Chairman and main promoter of the company was instrumental
in committing the irregularities in the scrip and colluding with other brokers/ clients to manipulate
the  scrip  price.  The  stock  broking  arm  of  the  chairman  and  promoter  contributed  significant
volumes  in  the  scrip  and  clients/  brokers  across  exchanges  aided  and  abetted  the  promoter  in
the market manipulation. Pursuant to the investigations, enquiry proceedings have been initiated
against various brokers and action u/s 11B of SEBI Act is being undertaken against the promoter
and abettors.

DSQ Biotech Ltd.
Investigations were undertaken by SEBI on the basis of a complaint alleging price manipulation
and Insider Trading in the scrip. It was revealed that large quantities of shares were purchased
from the market through the group companies of DSQ Biotech Ltd. prior to coming out with the
Rights Issue at premium. Investigations brought out that these purchases were made with a view

130

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

to create artificial market in the scrip of the company and to increase the price of the shares. This
was done so that public could be induced to invest in the Rights Issue, which was brought out at
a premium. It was established that the promoters manipulated the price of the scrip by continuous
buying on the exchanges, which resulted in the squeezing of the floating stock.

The shares purchased by the Group Company from the market entitled them for the rights. The
purchases of the shares by the group company were made with prior knowledge of the impending
Rights  Issue  by  DSQ  Biotech  Ltd.  The  promoters’  group  companies  also  appeared  to  have
substantially acquired the shares of DSQ Biotech Ltd. without following the procedure of open
offer required in terms of SEBI (Substantial Acquisitions of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations,
1994.  Pursuant  to  the  investigations,  enquiry  proceedings  have  been  recommended  against  a
number  of  brokers  and  intermediaries  and  actions  including  steps  to  prosecute  DSQ  Biotech
Ltd. and its directors are also being undertaken.

Subhash Projects & Marketing Ltd.
Investigation was initiated after receiving a reference from the Income Tax Office, Calcutta and
a  number  of  complaints  regarding  bringing  in  applications  after  the  closure  of  rights  issue  to
bail out the issue and alleged price rigging before the rights issue. Investigations revealed that
the issue was shown to be subscribed to the extent of 90 per cent with the help of applications
lodged by close associates of the company. These associates used cheques issued by banks after
the  closure  date  for  subscribing  to  the  issue.  This  established  the  fact  of  late  applications.
Investigations also revealed that the company had used circuitous route to fund applications of
associates as also to prop up the price of the scrip with a view to inducing subscription.

Enquiry  proceedings  have  been  initiated  against  bankers  to  the  issue  and  a  member  broker  of
CSE. Action under Section 11 of the SEBI Act is being initiated against the Merchant Banker
to  the  Issue,  the  Company/  its  directors  and  also  a  group  of  persons  for  knowingly  conniving
with each other to create artificial volume and trading in the market to view to ensure successful
subscription  to  the  rights  issue.  Matter  is  also  being  referred  to  the  Department  of  Company
Affairs for apparent violation of Section 77 of the Companies Act, 1956.

Saket Extrusions Ltd.
Investigations into alleged irregularities in the public issue of Saket Extrusions Limited (SEL)
revealed  that  nearly  60  per  cent  of  the  issue  was  subscribed  through  stock  invests  which
apparently  were  not  encashed.  The  investigations  were  initiated  on  the  basis  of  a  complaint
from  Bank  of  Madura  stating  that  the  irregularities  committed  by  the  company  in  collusion
with the Registrars had led to their bridge loan becoming sticky and unrecoverable. Investigations
revealed that the stockinvests used for subscribing to the issue were in fact issued much after
the  closure  of  the  issue  for  some  other  company’s  issue  and  were  ultimately  cancelled.  SEL
was  found  to  be  non-traceable  at  the  site  of  its  registered  office.  Pursuant  to  investigations,
enquiry  proceedings  have  been  initiated  against  the  Merchant  banker,  Registrars  to  the  Issue
and Bankers to the issue. Action against the directors of purchaser of the stock invests, under
Section 11 and/or Section 24 of SEBI Act is also being initiated.

Important Pronouncements Relating To Securities Laws During 2000-01

Supreme Court Cases

B.S.E. Brokers Forum, Bombay & Ors. Vs. SEBI
The Supreme Court on 1st February 2001 has pronounced judgement dismissing the petition of
BSE Brokers Forum. The Supreme Court inter-alia has held that:

1. SEBI is empowered to collect two types of fees viz. fees under section 11(2)(k) for carrying
out the purposes of section 11 and fee for the purposes of registering the applicants under
section 12 (2) of the Act. Therefore, there is no room to attack the levy on the ground that
the same is not authorised by the Act.

2. The fee levied is both regulatory and registration fee leviable under section 11(2) (k) and 12

(2) of this Act.

136

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

3. So  far  as  the  regulatory  fee  is  concerned,  the  service  to  be  rendered  is  not  a  condition
precedent and the same does not lose the character of fee provided the fee so charged is not
excessive. It is also not necessary that the services to be rendered by the collecting authority
should be confined to contributories alone. If the fee is for the benefit of the entire industry,
there is sufficient quid pro quo between the levy recovered and the services rendered to the
industry as a whole.

4. Since the amount collected under the impugned levy is to be spent by the Board on various
activities of the stock and securities market, with which the petitioners are directly connected,
the  fact  that  the  entire  benefit  of  the  levy  does  not  accrue  to  contributories  i.e.  petitioners
would not make the levy invalid.

5. From the material on record, it is seen that approximately 50 per cent of the total expenditure
to be incurred by the Board would be on brokers related services and others amongst all the
players in the share market, brokers form a distinct and separate class as compared to others
including  other  intermediaries.  Therefore,  in  our  opinion  there  is  nothing  wrong  in  either
classifying the brokers as a separate class subject to levy based on annual turnover because
the volume of the transactions of the brokers has a direct bearing on the regulatory activities
of the Board. Hence, the classification has a direct bearing with the objective to be achieved.

6. Annual turnover of broker is not the subject matter of the levy but is only a measure of the
levy.  The  State  is  the  authority  to  impose  a  levy  but  it  has  a  discretion  in  choosing  the
measure of levy, provided it stands the test of reasonableness.

7. While  we  accept  the  levy  based  on  annual  turnover  on  the  brokers  as  valid,  we  have  to
notice that the Expert Committee as appointed by the Board. The Board is bound to bring
about the corresponding changes in the regulations so as to remove the anomalies pointed
out by the Committee. Changes recommended by the Bhatt Committee should be incorporated
in the Regulations.

8. The  trading  member  of  the  National  Stock  Exchange  is  a  member  of  the  stock  exchange
though  with  limited  right.  The  trading  member  of  the  National  Stock  Exchange  will  fall
within the definition of ‘member’ as defined in section 2 (c) of the SC (R) Act and Rule 2
(e) of the SEBI Rules.

Stock Exchange Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income - tax
The Stock Exchange Rules, Bye - laws and Regulations have been approved by the Government
of  India  under  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulations)  Act.  There  was  no  challenge  to  these
Rules. The question whether right of membership confers upon the member any right to property
was,  therefore,  to  be  examined  within  the  framework  of  the  Rules,  Bye-laws  and  Regulations
of Exchange. On a plain and combined reading of the rules, it is clear that right of membership
is  merely  a  personal  privilege  granted  to  a  member,  it  is  non-transferable  and  incapable  of
alienation by the member or his legal representatives and heirs except to the limited extent as
provided  in  the  rules  on  fulfillment  of  conditions  provided  therein.  The  nomination  wherever
provided for is also not automatic. It is hedged by rules. On right of nomination vested in the
stock  exchange  under  the  rules,  that  right  belongs  to  the  stock  exchange  absolutely.  The

137

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

consideration received by the stock exchange on exercise of the right of nomination vesting in
it. Is to be applied in the manner provided in rule 16.

Appeals Before SAT

Bank of Baroda & Union Bank of India Vs. SEBI
A  public  limited  company  has  no  obligation  to  have  its  shares  listed  on  a  recognised  stock
exchange.  But  if  the  company  intends  to  offer  its  shares  or  debentures  to  the  public  for
subscription  by  issuing  prospectus,  it  must,  before  issuing  such  prospectus,  apply  to  one  or
more  recognised  stock  exchanges  for  permission  to  have  the  shares  or  debentures  intended  to
be so offered to the public, to be dealt with in each such stock exchange in terms of section 73
of the Companies Act. One of the matter to be stated prominently on the face of the prospectus
is the name of the stock exchanges where the issue is going to be listed and the fact of making
application to the exchanges specified therein for quotation of the shares or debentures offered
for  public  subscription.  The  principle  objectives  of  listing  are  to  provide  ready  marketability
and  impart  liquidity  and  free  negotiability  to  stock  and  shares,  ensure  proper  supervision  and
control of dealings therein, and protect the interests of shareholders and of the general investing
public.  Till  such  time  the  shares  are  allotted  after  fulfilling  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the
section, the money collected by way of subscription is required to be kept in a separate account
with a scheduled bank, away from the reach of the issuer company to be available for returning
to the applicants in the event of allotment failing to come through. The Bankers to an Issue has
a prominent role in the process of raising capital by companies from the public through public
issue in as much as it is the custodian of public funds, accountable to the applicants in case an
issue  fails  to  pass  through  its  final  phase  i.e.  allotment  of  shares.  To  part  with  the  collected
money for any other purpose is in clear breach of trust.

Shri D.A.Gadgil Vs. SEBI & Others
There is manifest need to ensure that there is no breach of fundamental procedure in the original
proceeding, and to avoid treating an appeal as an overall substitute for the original proceeding.
A failure of natural justice in the trial body cannot be cured by a sufficiency of natural justice
in an appellate body.

VLS Finance Vs. SEBI
A  mere  mention  of  a  wrong  provision  of  law,  when  the  power  exercised  is  available  even
though  under  a  different  provision  is  by  itself  not  sufficient  to  invalidate  the  exercise  of  that
power.  Section 15A(b) of the Act. Under the said section if any person who is required under
the Act or any rule or regulations made thereunder “to file any return or furnish any information,
books or documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or
furnish the same, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five thousand rupees for every
day during which such failure continues”. As far as the default part is concerned, i.e. failure to
report the aggregate share holding of the acquirers, to the stock exchange and the company, the
same squarely fits into the ambit of the said section 15A(b). Even though this section does not
refer to the requirement to `disclose’, on a realistic interpretation it can be concluded that the,

138

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

failure  to  disclose  the  holdings  to  the  company  and  the  concerned  stock  exchange  within  the
stipulated time by an acquirer would come under the purview of the section.

HDFC Ltd Vs. SEBI & 5. Mrs. Sangeeta J Valia Vs. Adjudicating Officer, SEBI
On a careful reading, it is seen that section 15A has been drafted to meet different situations,
enumerated under clauses (a) (b) and (c). It is also pertinent to note that the legislature, taking
into  consideration  the  gravity  of  the  matter,  i.e.  the  resultant  consequences  of  the  default,  has
decided to provide monetary penalties of different quantum. It appears that failure under clause
(a) i.e. failure to furnish returns, reports, etc. to the Board, has been viewed rather leniently as
the  maximum  monetary  penalty  leviable  is  limited  to  one  lakh  and  fifty  thousand  rupees  for
each such failure. But, under clause (b) the penalty in the event of failure to file returns furnish
any information, books or other documents within the time prescribed by regulation meets with
a penalty upto five thousand rupees for every day during which such failure continues. It appears
from  clause  (c),  that  failure  to  maintain  the  requisite  books  of  account  or  records  is  viewed
more seriously as could be seen from the penal consequences, as the failure attracts a maximum
penalty of ten thousand rupees for every day during which the failure continues.

It is also to be noted that the expressions “document” and “return” have been repeated in clause
(b) also. If expression “information” referred to in clause (b) can be in a report form, as suggested
by  the  Respondent,  all  the  requirements  of  (a)  are  covered  under  (b)  also.  If  the  legislative
intention had been to include reporting to the Board also in clause (b) specific provision under
clause  (a)  for  the  same  purpose  with  a  different  quantum  of  penalty  would  not  have  been
provided in the Act. These two sub-clauses are meant to meet different requirements. It is clear
that clause (a) takes care of the matters to be exclusively dealt with the Board and clause (b) is
to the exclusion of the Board.

Eider e - Commerce Ltd Vs. SEBI
The  fact  that  the  communication  is  couched  in  a  letterform  does  not  matter  much.  What  is
relevant is the purport of the communication and not the format in which it is made. An order
is primarily a decision which has the effect of a command whether called by such name or not
and  is  distinguished  from  an  advice  or  request,  by  the  nature  of  the  consequences  that  may
flow from the non-implementation of the same. Section 19 of the Act empowers the Board to
delegate its powers to its officers also. The officers exercise those powers, which are delegated
to them either generally or specifically by the Board.

Kwality Ice creams (India) Ltd. Vs. SEBI & Others
As far as disclosure requirements are concerned no such flexibility is available. Requirements
are stringent. It is a measure of protection to investors. Requirement of disclosure of material
facts governing the scheme has been given utmost weightage, as is evident from the mandate in
regulation 29 (1) that the offer document shall contain disclosures which are adequate in order
to enable the investors to make informed investment decision. Precisely that is why the standard
offer document has been designed by SEBI and the stipulation for filing the same with it before

139

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

issue of units, reserving the right to suggest modification which the concerned mutual fund is
required to incorporate in the document. It is a must that investors should be pre informed of
the terms and conditions governing the investment in the scheme.

Cabot International Vs. Adjudicating Officer, Securities & Exchange Board of India
Though substantive requirements of preferential allotment such as passing the requisite resolution
by the company’s general body, firm commitment by the Appellant to buy the shares, requisite
approval from FIPB etc., were effected before publication of the 1997 Regulations and though
the  Regulations  had  no  retrospective  effect,  it  is  ultimately  that  date  on  which  the  board  of
directors  validly  allotted  the  shares,  that  matters,  which  is  after  the  notification  of  the  1997
Regulations. Compliance of the provisions of regulation 3 (4) is a post acquisition requirement.
Therefore, preferential allotment made  to the Appellant comes under the purview of the 1997
Regulations and thereby regulation 3 (4) is attracted.

As  per  section  151  imposition  of  penalty  is  linked  to  the  subjective  satisfaction  of  the
Adjudicating  Officer.  It  is  not  incumbent  on  the  part  of  the  Adjudicating  Officer,  even  if  it  is
established  that  the  person  has  failed  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  any  of  the  sections
specified in sub section (1) of section 151, to impose penalty. It is left to the discretion of the
Adjudicating Officer, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.

J M Financial Investment Consultancy Services Ltd. Vs. Adjudicating Officer, SEBI
Sub regulation 3 (g) of regulation 3 provides exemption from the compliance of the requirements
of certain provisions of the regulations, provided “the acquisition is by way of transmission on
succession  or  inheritance”.  In  terms  of  the  explanation  to  regulation  3  (1)  (e)  the  benefit  of
availing of exemption from applicability of Regulations for increasing share holding or inter se
transfer  of  share  holding  among  group  companies,  relatives  and  promoters  shall  be  subject  to
such group companies or relatives or promoters filing statements concerning group and individual
share holding as required under Regulations 6, 7 and 8. Requirements of notifying stock exchange
and reporting to SEBI in terms of sub regulations (3) and (4) are consequential to availing of
exemption and not a requirement to avail exemption under regulation 3 as is made crystal clear
in  the  Regulations.  According  to  regulation  13,  before  making  any  public  announcement  of
offer  referred  to  in  regulation  10,  regulation  11  or  regulation  12,  the  acquirer  is  required  to
appoint a merchant banker holding a Category I registration. The public announcement referred
to in the Regulation is required to be made by the Merchant Banker and none else. One of the
obligations enumerated thereunder is that “ the merchant banker shall ensure compliance of the
Regulations and any other laws or rules as may be applicable in this regard”. Appellant’s failure
has to be viewed in the back ground that it is a Category I Merchant Banker fastened with the
obligation of ensuring legal compliance by others. A person entrusted with such a duty, himself
failing  to  comply  with  the  legal  requirements  in  a  matter  directly  concerning  him,  cannot  be
viewed  lightly  and  the  Adjudicating  Officer’s  decision  imposing  monetary  penalty  on  the
Appellant cannot be considered as unwarranted.
