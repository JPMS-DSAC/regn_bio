PART III 
FUNCTIONS  OF  SEBI  IN  RESPECT  OF  MATTERS  SPECIFIED  IN 
SECTION 11 OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA 
ACT, 1992 
 
A]  REGULATION OF BUSINESS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGES  
 
In  the  year  2001-02,  inspections  in  respect  of  following  Stock  Exchanges  viz., Pune, OTCEI, 
Delhi, UPSE, Bangalore, Cochin, Madras Stock Exchange and following Subsidiaries of Stock 
Exchanges viz., Subsidiary of UPSE, Pune, OTCEI, MPSE, Jaipur, Bangalore, Cochin, Madras 
were commenced. Inspections in respect of certain exchanges falling in the Gujrat region could 
not be commenced due to the prevailing law and order situation.  
 
During  inspection  of  the  Stock  Exchanges,  a  review  of  the  market  operations,  organisational 
structure and administrative control of the exchange is made to ascertain whether:  
 
the exchange provides a fair, equitable and growing market to investors,  
the  exchange’s  organisation,  systems  and  practices  are  in  accordance  with  the  Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Act (SC(R) Act), 1956 and rules framed thereunder,  
the  exchange  has  implemented  the  directions,  guidelines  and  instructions  issued  by  the  SEBI 
from time to time,  
the  exchange  has  complied  with  the  conditions,  if  any,  imposed  on  it  at  the  time  of  renewal/ 
grant of its recognition under section 4 of the SC(R) Act, 1956.  
 
Based on the observations/suggestions made in the inspection reports, the exchanges were advised 
to send a compliance report to the SEBI within one month of the receipt of the inspection report by 
the exchange and thereafter quarterly reports indicating the progress made by them in implementing 
the  suggestions  contained  in  the  inspection  report.  The  public  representatives  on  the  governing 
board/council of management of the stock exchanges also pursue the matters in the meetings of the 
governing board/council of management. If the performance of the exchanges, whose renewal of 
recognition is due, is not found satisfactory, SEBI grants further recognition for a short period only, 
subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. Further, the functioning of the exchanges is also being 
monitored through a Monthly Development Report, which the exchanges are required to submit to 
the SEBI every month.

Stock brokers 
 
Stock  brokers  services  form  integral  part  of  stocks  market  expansion  and  growth  which  is  an 
indication of deepening of the market.  The year of 2001-02, witnessed a marginal reduction in 
the number of brokers as compared to the previous year. During the current financial year under 
review,  170  new  brokers  were  registered  and  265  registrations  were  de-registered  due  to 
cancellation or surrendered.  As a result total number of registered brokers declined from 9,782 
as on March 31, 2001 to 9,687 as on March 31, 2002. The details of registrations are given in

Table 3.4 presents stock exchange-wise brokers details according to their ownership structure.  A 
number  of  brokers,  proprietor  firms  and  partnership  firms  have  converted  themselves  into 
corporates. A number of FIs have also been registered as brokers.  This diversification reflects 
increase  in  decentralised  ownership  patterns.  This  is  a  sign  of  healthy  development  of  stocks 
market  in  the  country.    It  would  be  observed  that  of  the  9,687  brokers,  3,820  brokers  were 
corporate  brokers  as  on  March  31,  2002.    In  terms  of  percentage  share  corporate  brokers 
accounted for about 39 per cent in total brokers as on end March 2001. This percentage increased 
to nearly 40 per cent as on March 31, 2002.  The number of FIs remained at 20 as on March 31, 
2002  reflecting  no  change  from  last  year.  It  would  also  be observed that of the 9,687 brokers 
registered during 2001-02, 3,820 were corporate brokers and 5,517 were proprietors. The number 
of partnership firms in brokerage business, however, decreased from 325 in 2000-01 to 308 in 
2001-02.  The  corporatisation  and  institutionalisation  of  the  brokers  should  result  in  more 
organized and efficient services leading to healthier trading and accounting standards.

It may be stated that brokers in many cases get registered at more than one stock exchanges. It 
would be seen from table 3.5 below that 627 brokers had membership at two stock exchanges as 
on March 31, 2002 as compared to 621 brokers with double memberships as on March 31, 2001.  
Whereas 90 brokers had membership on 3 stock exchanges as on March 31, 2002, compared to 
82  members  as  on  March  31,  2001.    Thus  multiple  membership  is  increasing  on  Indian  stock 
exchanges  which  on  a  number  of  times  results  in  cross  trading  over  the  stock  exchanges  for 
arbitrage etc.  (Table 3.5 and 3.6).

Sub-brokers 
 
The  services  of  sub-brokers  provide  link  between  the  investors  and  the  brokers.    Since  sub-
brokers are located at far flung areas from the stock exchanges, they provide network of stocks 
market in the hinterland of the country.  There were 12,208 sub-brokers registered as on March 
31, 2002, as compared with 9,957 sub-brokers in the previous year.  As such the growth of sub-
brokers has been high and this is the indication that their services are in demand in the market.  It 
would be seen from Table 3.6 below that 98 per cent of the total sub-brokers registered with the 
SEBI during the current year were from the Stock Exchanges Mumbai and NSE.  This ratio was 
92 per cent as on March 31, 2001.  The high concentration of sub-brokers at Mumbai and NSE 
indicates  skewed  availability  of  brokers’  services  at  smaller  stock  exchanges  like  Madhya 
Pradesh, Guwahati, Managalore, Magadh, Coimbatore, Bhubaneswar etc. probably due to non-
availability  of  adequate  business.    In  these  areas  lack  of  sufficient  business  discourages  the 
brokers/sub-brokers  to  take  up  thinly  available  broking  services.  Sub-broker  services  are  very 
crucial  in  educating  the  potential  investors  in  the  primary  as  well  as  secondary  market.      The 
large number of brokers and sub-brokers warrants strengthening and expanding of surveillance 
and regulatory framework. (Table 3.6)

C]  REGISTRATION  AND  REGULATION  OF  WORKING  OF  COLLECTIVE 

INVESTMENT SCHEMES INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS 

 
Registration of Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) 
 
Subsequent to the notification of Regulations 1999, SEBI had received applications for grant of 
registration from 50 CIS entities. The SEBI has granted provisional registration to 6 CIS entities 
out of these 50 CIS entities, while applications of 35 CIS entities were rejected and they were 
ordered to wind up their schemes and make repayment to their investors.  The applications of 
remaining 9 CIS entities are under process. 
 
In terms of Regulations, an existing collective investment scheme which has (i) failed to make an 
application for registration to the Board; or (ii) has not been granted provisional registration by 
the Board; or (iii) having obtained provisional registration fails to comply with the provisions of 
Regulation 71; or (iv) is not desirous of obtaining provisional registration; is required to wind up 
its  existing  schemes,  make  repayment  to  the  investors  and  thereafter  submit “Winding up and 
Repayment Report”  to SEBI. The SEBI has received such “Winding up and Repayment Report” 
from 51 CIS entities. 
 
Prosecution under Section 24 of SEBI Act, 1992 has been filed by SEBI against 97 erring CIS 
entities. Other actions such as debarring the promoters/ directors/ managers/ persons in charge of 
the  business  of  the  scheme  from  operating  in  the  capital  market;  writing  to  the  State 
Governments to register civil/ criminal cases against the erring entities for apparent offences of 
fraud,  cheating  criminal  breach  of  trust  and  misappropriation  of  public  funds;  writing  to  the 
Department  of  Company  Affairs  to  initiate  the  process  of  winding  up  of  the  erring  515  CIS 
entities has also been taken up. 
 
In case of CWP No. 3352/98 in the matter of Shri. S. D Bhattacharya and others vs SEBI, the 
Hon’ble  High  Court,  Delhi  impleaded  all  the  CIS  entities.  Earlier,  the  court  had,  inter-alia, 
restrained  them  from  selling,  disposing  of  and  /or  alienating  their  immovable  properties  or 
parting  with  the  possession  of  the  same.  Their  directors  had  also  been  interdicted  from 
transferring their immovable property in any manner whatsoever.  The Hon’ble High Court also 
made it clear that its order will not come in the way of companies intending to refund the money 
to their investors. In a recent order dated January 22, 2002, the Hon’ble  High Court has ordered 
to  freeze  the  bank  accounts  of  513  erring  CIS  entities  and  their  directors/promoters  till  they 
comply with the regulations/SEBI Directions regarding repayment to  their investors. 
 
SEBI has been issuing press releases/ public notices from time to time to educate and caution the 
investors  about  Collective  Investment  Schemes.    Members  of  the  public  have  also  been 
cautioned through these public notices that they should not invest in the CIS entities which are 
not registered with SEBI 
 

Registration of Mutual Funds 
 
During  2001-02,  registration  was  granted  to  one  new  mutual  fund  in  the  private  sector  viz 
Benchmark  Mutual  Fund,  2  mutual  funds  wound  up  their  operations  viz  Indian  Bank  Mutual 
Fund  and  Anagram  Wellington  Mutual  Fund  in  the  public  and  private  sector  respectively.    In 
case  of  Indian  Bank  Mutual  Fund,  its  schemes  were  transferred  to  Tata  Mutual  Fund  after 
informing the unitholders and giving them an option to exit without load, in accordance with the 
provisions  of  the  Regulations.  The  total  number  of  mutual  funds  as  on  March  31,  2002  is  37

there  is  an  arrangement  of  voluntary  compliance  of  regulations  by  the  UTI  for  the  schemes 
launched  after  July  1,  1994.  Subsequently,  UTI  on  its  own  has  brought  some  more  schemes 
launched before July 1994 under the voluntary compliance arrangement. However, five schemes 
including the largest scheme US-64 scheme do not come under the purview of SEBI.

D]  PROMOTION 

ORGANISATIONS 

  AND  REGULATION  OF  SELF  REGULATORY 

 
Development of the Stock Exchanges as Self Regulatory Organisations 
 
To  further  the  goal  of  self-regulation  in  the  stock  exchanges  in  the  area  of  monitoring  for 
detection of abuses and enhancing their capabilities of detecting malpractices and manipulations, 
SEBI  had  directed  the  stock  exchanges  to  set  up  surveillance  cells  in  the  stock  exchanges 
independently reporting to the exchange executive directors.  As a part of market surveillance, 
stock  exchanges  have  started  administering  trade  halts,  imposing  price  bands,  deactivating 
brokers’  trading terminals and suspending the trading in scrips in appropriate cases.  These self-
regulatory steps taken up by the stock exchanges under active oversight of SEBI have improved 
market stability and integrity.  The activity of analysis of market trading and investigations by 
exchanges  has  picked  up  momentum  in  the  last  few  years.    In  case  of  any  adverse  finding  in 
suitable cases they have been sending references to SEBI for further investigation and necessary 
actions.  In the present year 2001-02, the exchanges have taken up 167 cases on their own (116 – 
NSE and 51  – BSE) and have taken disciplinary action in 59 cases (12 – NSE and 47  – BSE).  
Moreover, the exchanges have also been advised to share information with each other and ensure 
greater coordination. 
 
SEBI  is  further  working  towards  developing  the  stock  exchanges  as  effective  self  regulatory 
organisations.  A training capsule and certification programme for the surveillance staff of the 
stock exchanges has also been developed. 
 
Association of Merchant Bankers of India (AMBI) 
 
The AMBI, a self regulatory organisation set up in 1993 ensures that its members use healthy 
business practices.  The AMBI exercises overall supervision over its members in the matters of 
compliance  with  statutory  rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  merchant  banking.    It  is  also  a 
nodal point for the assimilation and dissemination of information relating to merchant banking.  
It  works  as  a  sole  representative  to  all  statutory  authorities  including  SEBI.    The  AMBI  has 
published  its  code  of  conduct  for  merchant  bankers  setting  out  the  broad  parameters  and  the 
spirit for conducting the business.  It has also published Due Diligence Hand Book for the use of 
merchant  bankers.    The  AMBI  during  2001-02,  being  a  member  of  Malegam  Committee  on 
accounting standards has participated in various meetings conducted by the SEBI.   
 

Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) 
 
The SEBI undertakes regular consultations with the members of AMFI on various issues relating 
to mutual funds.  In 2001-02, the SEBI also discussed issues relating to mutual funds industry.  
The  AMFI  has  been  designated  to  issue  certificates  to  agents  and  distributors  under  the 
certification programme. 
 
Registrars Association of India (RAIN) 
 
The RAIN founded in 1991 represents Securities' Registrars & Share Transfer Agents (RSAT) in 
India  to  ensure  that  its  members  observe  the  prescribed  service  standards  and  follow  good 
business ethics.  The RAIN was associated with the process of switchover to paperless trading 
and electronic share holdings also.  The other major activities carried out by the RAIN are: 
?  Promoting programs necessary for development of RSTA. 
?  Rendering and providing common services and utilities to the persons engaged in RSTA. 
?  Conducting seminars and workshops to promote knowledge of RSTA. 
 
 
E]  FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES 
 
The SEBI made vigorous efforts to unearth cases of fraudulent and unfair trade practices. During 
2001-  02,  the  SEBI  undertook  84  cases  regarding  manipulations  and  price  rigging  and  
completed 9 cases of manipulation and price rigging during 2001-02 
 
 
F] 
 
Investors’  Education 
 
The  SEBI  has  been  continuously  focusing  on  investors’  education  and  awareness  relating  to 
functioning of the capital market.  During 2001-02, SEBI took following steps for educating the 
investors  
?  SEBI distributed the booklet titled “A Quick Reference Guide for Investors” to the investors. 
?  Various corporates on a request made by the SEBI distributed the booklet titled      “A Quick 

INVESTOR EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING OF INTERMEDIARIES 

Reference Guide for Investors” to their shareholders. 

?  The  SEBI  issued  a  series  of  advertisements  /public  notices  in  national  as  well  as  regional 

newspapers to educate and caution the investors regarding collective investment schemes.

half-year  ended  March  31,  2001  that  the  scheme  portfolios  were  not  in  accordance  with  the 
format prescribed by SEBI.  A lot of information pertaining to investments as specified in the 
format and which was very important for the investors was not disclosed. Penalty of Rs 2 lakh 
was imposed on the AMC which has since been paid. 
 
Alliance Capital Mutual Fund: Adjudication was ordered last year. 5 Schemes of the mutual 
fund exceeded the 10 per cent investment limit as prescribed in the Regulations. A penalty of Rs 
5 lakh was imposed on the AMC.  Mutual Fund has paid the penalty.

ordered in January 2000 for inadequate disclosures in the offer documents. A penalty of Rs. 2 
lakh was imposed. The mutual fund preferred an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal 
and the decision of Adjudicating officer was upheld. Mutual Fund has paid the penalty.   
 
Details of other adjudication cases are given below:  
 
Escorts Mutual Fund: The adjudication was ordered in the last financial year for the delay in 
publication of annual report and submission of the same to SEBI. The adjudication officer levied 
a  penalty  of  Rs  52,000.  However,  the  mutual  fund  preferred  appeal  before  the  Securities 
Appellate Tribunal and the decision of adjudication officer was set aside.  
 
DSP  Merrill  Lynch  Mutual  Fund:  Adjudication  was  ordered  for  exceeding  the  investment 
limits in one of their schemes. Adjudication Officer passed an order to caution the mutual fund.  
 
Shriram Mutual Fund: In various quarters, the business through associated brokers exceeded 
the limit of 5 per cent of the aggregate purchases and sales of securities made by the mutual fund

mutual  funds  on  the  basis  of  monitoring  through  various  periodical  reports  and  deficiencies 
pointed out in the inspection reports.

(xiv)  Marginally exceeding the investment limits for a short period.  
 
Payment of Interest 
 
SEBI has made it mandatory that the mutual funds must pay interest @ 15 per cent for the delays 
in despatch of repurchase/ redemption proceeds to the unitholders. The mutual funds are required 
to report these cases of delays to SEBI on quarterly basis. 
 
During the year 2001-02, 14 mutual funds reported to have paid Rs 2.57 lakh as interest to 399 
investors for the delay in despatch of redemption/ repurchase proceeds. 
 
It may be mentioned here that during the previous year 2000-01, 22 mutual funds paid interest of 
Rs  8.37  lakh  to  6,722  unitholders  as  against  a  total  amount  of  Rs  17.24  lakh  paid  to  14,686 
investors during 1999-2000. 
 
Due  to  strict  action  taken  by  SEBI  and  making  it  mandatory  to  pay  interest  for  the  delays  in 
despatch of redemption/ repurchase proceeds, the number of such cases of delays have declined 
considerably.

M]  OTHER FUNCTIONS 
 
Grievances Redressal 
 
Mutual funds 
 
Redressal of grievances of investors is given a lot of importance in SEBI. Out of a total of 40,022  
complaints (cumulative) which have been received by SEBI against the mutual funds till March 
31, 2002, 39,854 complaints stand redressed. The rate of redressal of investors’  grievances by 
mutual funds as a whole has gone up from  99.12 per cent last year to 99.58 per cent during the 
year 2001-02. This high rate of redressal has been achieved due to constant follow up with the 
mutual funds.  
 
Securities market 
 
SEBI has a comprehensive investor grievances redressal mechanism. A standardised complaint 
format  is  available  at  all  offices  of    SEBI  and  on  the  SEBI  Website  for  the  convenience  of 
investors.  The complaints received from investors are acknowledged and a reference number is 
sent  to  the  complainant.    Complaints  are  taken  up  with  the  concerned  companies.  The  SEBI 
officers also hold meetings with the company officials to impress upon them their obligation to 
redress the grievances of investors.  Recalcitrant companies are referred for prosecution. SEBI 
also issues fortnightly press release on the status of redressal of investor grievances for public 
information. This report is also hosted on SEBI web-site. 

During  the  period,  1991-92  to  2001-02,  the  SEBI  received  more  than  27  lakh  grievances  from 
investors. Of these nearly 26 lakh grievances were redressed by the companies, which indicates a 
redressal rate of 94.86 per cent. The cumulative status of investor grievances received by SEBI, 
resolved by the companies and the redressal rate in this regard from the year 1991-92 to 2001-02 is 
furnished in Table 3.13.
