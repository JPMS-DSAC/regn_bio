AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ACT, 1992

Part  Three  of  this  Annual  Report  discusses
and  analyzes  regulation  and  functioning  of
stock  exchanges,  subsidiaries  of  stock
exchanges,  regulatory  action  against  stock
exchanges,  status  of  capital  market,
intermediaries  registered  with  SEBI  and
matters  pertaining  to,  Mutual  Funds,

1. REGULATION OF STOCK

EXCHANGES AND SUBSIDIARIES

One  of  the  key  functions  of  the  Board  is  to
supervise  and  monitor  the  activities  of  the
exchanges,  clearing  houses  and  the
settlement  system,  strengthen  market
infrastructure and ensure that appropriate risk
management systems are in place.

Inspection of Stock Exchanges:

I.
On-site  supervision  through  inspection  of
stock  exchanges  is  considered  an  effective
regulatory tool. Under the policy of risk-based
supervision which has been adopted from the
year  under  review,  stock  exchanges  having
a  significant  turnover  were  taken  up  for  on-
site  inspection.  These  were  The  Bombay
Stock  Exchange  (BSE),  Calcutta  Stock
Exchange  (CSE),  National  Stock  Exchange
(NSE),  Inter  Connected  Stock  Exchange
(ISE),  Ludhiana  Stock  Exchange  (LSE),
Hyderabad  Stock  Exchange  (HSE)  and
Ahmedabad Stock Exchange (ASE).

The  objectives  of  the  inspection  were  to
ensure that -
A.

The exchange provides a fair, equitable
and growing market to investors,

B.

the  exchange  has  complied  with  the
conditions,  if  any,  imposed  on  it  at  the
time  of  renewal/  grant  of  its  recognition
under section 4 of the SC(R) Act, 1956.
C. The  exchange’s  organization,  systems
and practices are in accordance with the
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act
(SC(R)  Act),  1956  and  rules  framed
thereunder,

D. The  exchange  has  implemented  the
directions,  guidelines  and  instructions
issued by the SEBI from time to time,
There  are  adequate  internal  control
mechanisms  and  risk  management
systems.

E.

A  Special  inspection  of  Calcutta  Stock
Exchange  (CSE),  Uttar  Pradesh  Stock
Exchange (UPSE), Ludhiana Stock Exchange
(LSE) and Jaipur Stock Exchange (JSE) was
also carried out during the year.

The  post  inspection  follow  up  was  also
strengthened through -
A.

Increase  in  periodicity  of  review  of
compliance reports.

B. Mandating review of action taken on the
report  by  a  sub-committee  of  the
Governing Board of the stock exchanges
atleast 
twice  each  quarter  and
submission  of  the  review  to  the
Governing Board of the exchange.
Issue of letters of displeasure for failure
to  comply  with  the  previous  inspection
reports and unsatisfactory compliance.

C.

D. Personal meetings to discuss the status
of  implementation  of  findings  of
inspection reports.

II.

Inspection of Subsidiaries of Stock
Exchanges

A. Six subsidiaries of stock exchanges were
inspected  during  the  financial  year  2002-03
viz  ASE  Capital  Markets  Ltd  (ACML  –
Subsidiary of ASE), ISE Securities & Services
Ltd (ISS - Subsidiary of ISE), LSE Securities
Ltd  (LSESL  -  Subsidiary  of  LSE),  HSE
Securities Ltd (HSESL - Subsidiary of HSE),
SKSE Securities Ltd (SKSESL - Subsidiary of
Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange) and VSE
Securities Ltd (VSL- Subsidiary of Vadodara
Stock  Exchange).  A  special  inspection  of
MPSE  Securities  Ltd  (MPSESL  -  Subsidiary
of  MPSE)  was  carried  out.  Follow  up  action
included discussion with the parent exchanges
of the subsidiaries. Letters of displeasure were
issued to the parent stock exchanges of those
subsidiaries  for  which  findings  were  serious
as well as those which failed to comply with
suggestions/observations of inspection reports.

III. Restructuring of Management of

Subsidiaries:

The  inspection  of  the  subsidiaries  of  stock
exchanges  revealed  deficiencies  in  their
functioning and risk management systems The
management  structure  of  the  subsidiaries
needed to undergo change in order to enable
them  to  be  able  to  provide  a  safe  and
transparent market and effectively discharge
their  responsibilities  towards  investor
protection. A Circular dated February 11, 2003
has,  therefore,  been  issued  to  stock
exchanges  directing  them  to  carry  out  the
changes  in  management  structure  of  their
subsidiaries.

IV.

Illegal Trading in Securities

It  had  come  to  the  notice  of  the  SEBI  that
certain  persons  were  engaging  in  trading  in
securities  outside  the  purview  of  the  stock
exchanges (‘illegal trading in securities’). Such
trading particularly in Gujarat has come to be

112112112112112

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

known  as  ‘DABBA’  trading.  There  were  also
reports  in  the  media  regarding  illegal  use  of
terminals  provided  to  the  brokers  by  the
National Stock Exchange in Kolkata and other
places. Media had also reported Kerb trading
in  the  cities  of  Kanpur,  Kolkata,  Mathura,
Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Mumbai. Since these
activities are illegal and pose a systemic risk
besides luring common investors into the net
the  Board  tool  immediate  action  by  sending
teams  to  some  cities  of  Gujarat  viz.
Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot to conduct
surprise  inspections.  Since  it  is  not  possible
to  identify  the  persons  who  carry  on  these
activities the Chief Ministers of all the States
were requested through letters and reminders
to  use  the  local  police  force  to  check  these
illegal  activities.  NSE,  BSE  and  other  Stock
Exchanges were altered to verify involvement
of  their  members  and  take  coercive  action.
The  public  were  also  cautioned  through  a
notice  issued  in  the  newspapers  in  English,
Hindi and major regional languages about the
illegal activities and educating them about the
perils of such illegal trades.

2. REGISTRATION AND REGULATION

OF THE WORKING OF
INTERMEDIARIES

In order to interpose between issuers and
investors, regulators recognize various classes
of  intermediaries  in  the  capital  market.
Regulation through intermediaries has been
found,  perhaps  more  effective  in  certain
spheres of activity. SEBI, over the period,
recognized many types of capital market
intermediaries in India and operations during
the year is reviewed in the following sections.

Primary Market

I.
Intermediaries  such  as  merchant  bankers,
underwriters, debenture trustees, bankers to
an  issue,  registrars  to  an  issue  and  share
transfer agents and portfolio manager are the

intermediaries  that  function  in  the  inter  alia
in the primary markets. From Table 3.1 it may
be  seen 
that  number  of  registered
intermediaries  declined  (except  for  portfolio
managers)  as  a  result  of,  consolidation  of
intermediary activities, enhanced compliance
and disclosure systems and the general down
trend in the primary markets.

Secondary Market

II.
Brokers  are  one  of  the  most  important  links
between the investors and the market. Their
association  with  the  stock  exchanges  and
investors dates back to as early as nineteenth
century.  The  number  of  registered  brokers
declined by168 during 2002-03. Jaipur, NSE,
Gauhati and OTCEI stock exchanges mainly
contributed  to  this  fall.  However,  on  certain
exchanges, for example, BSE, Delhi etc. there
were new registrations. Tables 3.2 to 3.4 give

details of registered brokers – exchange wise,
and their composition, and ownership pattern.
There are 3835 corporate brokers in India as
on March 31, 2003 and they constituted about
40  per  cent  of  total  brokers.  Percentage  of
corporate brokers is found to be at the highest
at NSE, OTCEI and BSE at 89 per cent, 76
and  67  per  cent  respectively  and  together
constitute  over  fifty  percent  of  the  corporate
brokers  in  all  exchanges.  NSE  and  BSE
together  have  over  one-third  of  corporate
brokers  between  them.  On  the  smaller
exchanges  such  as  Gauhati  and  Jaipur
percentage of corporate brokers is negligible.
The  composition  of  membership  has  been
shifting  to  the  corporate  entities  over  the
years.

MULTIPLE MEMBERSHIP :
Entities are allowed to obtain membership at
more  than  one  stock  exchange.  Table  3.5
gives details of such Multiple membership.

The multiple membership ranges between two
to six. It may be seen that 854 entities.

have membership at two exchanges while 3
entities  have  membership  at  6  exchanges.
About ten per cent of the total brokers have
multiple memberships.

B. Sub-Broker Registration
Sub-brokers  are  intermediaries  between  the
broker and the investor. SEBI Requirements
include registration of sub-brokers through the
stock  exchanges  at  which  the  broker  is  a

3. REGISTRATION AND REGULATION

OF COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT
SCHEMES INCLUDING MUTUAL
FUNDS

I.

Registration of Collective Investment
Schemes (CIS)

Subsequent to the notification of Regulations,
SEBI  had  received  applications  for  grant  of

registration from 50 CIS entities. Out of these
50 CIS entities, SEBI had granted provisional
registration  to  six  CIS  entities,  while
applications of 44 CIS entities were rejected
and  they  were  ordered  to  wind  up  their
schemes  and  make  repayment  to  their
investors.  During  the  year  2002-2003,  the
provisional  registration  granted  to  one  CIS

118118118118118

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

entity  expired.  Thus,  the  total  number  of
provisionally registered CIS entities is five.

In terms of Regulations, an existing collective
investment  scheme  which  has  (i)  failed  to
make  an  application  for  registration  to  the
Board;  or  (ii)  not  been  granted  provisional
registration  by  the  Board;  or  (iii)  having
obtained  provisional  registration  fails  to
comply with the provisions of Regulation 71;
or (iv) is not desirous of obtaining provisional
registration; is required to wind up its existing
schemes,  make  repayment  to  the  investors
and  thereafter  submit  “Winding  up  and
Repayment  Report”  to  SEBI.  SEBI  has
received “Winding up and Repayment Report”
from 57 CIS entities.

Prosecution  under  Section  24  of  SEBI  Act,
1992  has  been  filed  by  SEBI  against  139
erring  CIS  entities.  Other  actions  such  as
debarring the promoters/ directors/ managers/
persons  in  charge  of  the  business  of  the
scheme from operating in the capital market;
writing  to  the  State  Governments  to  register
civil/ criminal cases against the erring entities
for  apparent  offences  of  fraud,  cheating
criminal breach of trust and misappropriation
of public funds; writing to the Department of
Company  Affairs  to  initiate  the  process  of
winding up of the erring 555 CIS entities has
also been taken up.

Requests  have  been  made  to  police
authorities to file the First Information Reports
against  49  CIS  entities  for  offences  such  as
criminal breach of trust, cheating, etc.

In CWP No. 3352/98 in the matter of Shri. S.
D  Bhattacharya  and  others  vs  SEBI,  the
Hon’ble  High  Court,  Delhi  impleaded  all  the
CIS entities. Earlier, the court had, inter-alia,
restrained them from selling, disposing of and
/or  alienating  their  immovable  properties  or
parting with the possession of the same. Their

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

directors  had  also  been  interdicted  from
transferring  their  immovable  property  in  any
manner whatsoever. The Hon’ble High Court
also made it clear that its order will not come
in the way of companies intending to refund
the  money  to  their  investors.  In  an  order
dated  January  22,  2002,  the  Hon’ble  High
Court  has  ordered  to  freeze  the  bank
accounts of 513 erring CIS entities and their
directors/promoters  till  they  comply  with  the
regulations/SEBI  Directions  regarding
repayment to their investors.

II. Mutual Funds Registered with SEBI

During  the  year,  registration  was  granted  to
two  new  mutual  funds  in  the  private  sector
viz HSBC Mutual Fund and Deutsche Mutual
Fund.  With  the  enactment  of  the  UTI
(Repealment Ordinance), the UTI was divided
into the UTI-I and UTI-II. UTI-II known as UTI
Mutual  Fund  was  registered  with  SEBI  on
January 14, 2003.

During  the  year  2002-03,  the  certificate  of
registration granted to two mutual funds were
cancelled viz JF Mutual Fund (formerly known
as Jardine Fleming Mutual Fund) and Pioneer
ITI  Mutual  Fund  (formerly  known  as  Kothari
Pioneer  Mutual  Fund).  In  case  of  JF  Mutual
Fund, the schemes were taken over by Sun
F&C  Mutual  Fund  whereas  the  schemes  of
Pioneer  ITI  Mutual  Fund  were  merged  with
Templeton Mutual Fund.

PROMOTION AND REGULATION OF
SELF REGULATORY
ORGANISATIONS

Development of Stock Exchanges as
Self Regulatory Organisations

There  are  23  stock  exchanges  recognized
under  Section  4  of  the  Securities  Contracts
(Regulation) Act, 1956.These exchanges were
recognized  /set  up  over  a  period  of  time  to
stimulate  growth  of  capital  market  through
channelising  the  savings  of  individuals  and
small investors. These exchanges are suitably
empowered by the section 9 of SC(R)A, 1956
to make bye laws for the conduct of business,
regulation and control of contracts.

SEBI  is  contemplating  development  of  Self
Regulatory  Organizations(SROs)  for  market
intermediaries. Stock exchanges are already
acting as SROs and the SRO structure needs
to be strengthened further. The objective for
promoting intermediaries like Stock Exchanges
as  Self  Regulatory  Organizations  (SROs)  is
that  since  they  have  a  better  feel  on  the
ground  reality,  they  should  take  care  of  the
micro aspects of regulation. The other inherent
advantages of self regulation are:

a.

Self regulation becomes the responsibility
of  market  professionals  and  may  result
in  greater  acceptance  of  rules  by  the
members of SRO.

120120120120120

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

It also provides market players with greater
flexibility to respond to securities market.

It  avoids  duplication  of  responsibilities:
it  is  observed  over  years  of  experience
that if the regulatory body gets into micro
regulation, 
the  sight  of
fundamentals and lands up in duplication
of responsibilities, besides

loses 

it 

d.

SROs  are  expected  to  have  a  better
understanding of ground realities.

However, for any organization /body like Stock
Exchange to effectively function as an SRO,
it  is  necessary  that  it  has  the  capacity  to
enforce  compliance  to  byelaws,  rules  and
regulations laid down by itself. Further, these
SROs should be able to enforce and establish
rules  which  prevent 
fraudulent  and
manipulative trade practices and promote just
and  equitable  principles  of  trade.  Presently
such powers are conferred to the exchanges
by  the  section  9  of  SC(R)A,  1956  whereby
they  can  make  bye  laws  for  the  conduct  of
business, regulation and control of contracts.

However,  developing  Stock  Exchanges  as
Self Regulatory Organizations and enhancing
their  effective  regulatory  role  puts  additional
responsibility  on  SEBI  to  ensure  that  SROs
are  efficiently  carrying  out/conducting  their
monitoring responsibilities.

FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE

SEBI  took  up  investigations  in  122  cases  in

654 cases. Of these 122 cases, investigation
into  102  cases  have  been  completed  during
2002-2003.

BOARD OF INDIA

investors  with  education  in  the  securities
market in a ceremony held at Vigyan Bhawan,
New  Delhi  on  January  17,  2003.  The
campaign  was  inaugurated  by  Shri  A.B.
Vajpayee, Hon’ble Prime Minister, Republic of
India.  Shri  Jaswant  Singh,  Hon’ble  Union
Minister  for  Finance  and  Company  Affairs
delivered  the  keynote  address.  Several
prominent  personalities  contributing  to  the
growth  of  the  Indian  Securities  Market  and
other eminent personalities were also present.

The  inaugural  session  of  the  programme
featured  a  curtain  raiser  audio-visual
encompassing  the  theme  of  the  campaign  “

Empowering Investors – A SEBI Initiative”. It
showed that people in India have respect for
money  but  treat  it  with  a  little  knowledge.  A
mnemonic  especially  created  by  Shri  R.K.
Laxman,  for  the  SEBI  campaign  was  also
unveiled  by  Hon’ble  Prime  Minister.  The
inaugural  session  was  followed  by  three
technical  sessions  wherein  discussions
emphasising  empowerment  of  investors
through  education  and  the  roles  played  by
intermediaries,  issuers  and  professionals  in
investor  education  were  held  by  eminent
personalities.  This  campaign  is  expected  to
sustain  the  felt  need  for  investor  education
and awareness across the country.

IL&FS Mutual Fund – For the purpose
of meeting immediate cash requirement
the  AMC  shifted  the  sell  position  from
one exchange to another. In this process

124124124124124

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

the  scheme  incurred  a  notional  loss  of
Rs.1.05 lac. The matter was reported in
the  inspection  report  of  1999-2001  and
on  discussing  this  issue  with  the  AMC,
they  reimbursed  the  notional  loss  of
Rs.1.05 lacs to the scheme.

2. Birla  Sun  Life  Mutual  Fund  –  The
mutual  fund  reported  that  various
balances and accounts of their schemes
had  deficits  of  around  Rs.10.82  crores.
The reasons attributed for the variations
included errors, non-reporting/ inaccurate
reporting of subscription, redemption and
exchange  transactions,  factoring  of
applicable loads, computation of dividend
liability. The differences were made good
by  the  AMC  alongwith  interest.  The
boards of the AMC and trustee company
confirmed that no investor was adversely
affected and they were satisfied with the
entire  adjustment  process  including  the
control  systems  put  in  place  to  prevent
recurrence of such events.

Other Actions :
Escorts Mutual Fund – Two offer documents
filed  by  the  mutual  fund  have  been  kept  in
abeyance,  pending  compliance  of  certain
directions issued to them on the basis of the
findings of the inspection report.

Payment of Interest
SEBI has made it mandatory that the mutual
funds must pay interest @ 15% for the delays
in  despatch  of  repurchase/redemption
proceeds to the unitholders. The mutual funds
are required to report these cases of delays
to SEBI on quarterly basis.

During the year 2002-2003, 19 mutual funds
paid  Rs.  5.56  lacs  as  interest  to  9805
investors  for  the  delay  in  despatch  of
redemption / repurchase proceeds.

During the year 2001-2002, 14 mutual funds
paid Rs. 2.57 lacs as interest to 399 investors

for  the  delay  in  despatch  of  redemption  /
repurchase proceeds.

During the year 2000-2001, 22 mutual funds,
paid  interest  of  Rs.  8.37  lacs  to  6,722
unitholders  as  against  a  total  amount  of  Rs
17.24  lacs  paid  to  14,686  investors  during
1999-2000.

Due  to  strict  action  by  SEBI  and  making  it
mandatory  to  pay  interest  for  the  delays  in
despatch of redemption/repurchase proceeds,
the  number  of  such  cases  of  delays  have
declined considerably.

RELATIONS

During  the  year,  SEBI  brought  out  several
research  papers  on  various  aspects  of  the
secondary  market.  One  of  the  papers  was
on  price  discovery  and  volatility  on  NSE
futures market.

I.

Price Discovery and Volatility on NSE
Futures Market

This  paper  studied  price  discovery  and
volatility in the context of introduction of Nifty
futures at the National Stock Exchange (NSE)
in June 2000. Cointegration and Generalised
AutoRegressive 
Conditional
Heteroscedasticity  (GARCH)  techniques  are
used  to  study  price  discovery  and  volatility
respectively.  The  major  findings  are  that  the
futures  market  (and  not  the  spot  market)
respond to deviations from equilibrium; price
discovery  occurs  in  both  the  futures  or  spot
market,  especially  in  the  latter  half  of  the
study  period.  The  results  also  show  that
volatility  in  the  spot  market  has  come  down
after the introduction of stock index futures.

A. Price discovery
Results  indicate  that  the  null  hypothesis  is
rejected  at  one  per  cent  level,  showing  that
both  the  markets  are  integrated.  Information
flows from one market to another market. The
results  are  very  useful  to  regulators  as  well
as  to  market  participants.  Any  regulatory
initiative  on  futures  market  will  have  its
desired  impact  on  cash  market.  Therefore,
regulators  can  take  actions  in  the  futures
market  such  as  reduction  in  contract  size,
changes  to  margins  and  others  which  will
have their desired impact on the cash market.
Market  participants,  such  as  investors,  can
use these results to predict impact of shocks
of the futures market on cash market.

Price  discovery  results  indicate  that  the
information  gets  reflected  first  in  the  futures

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

market and the dissemination time to the cash
market  is  unascertainable  from  the  results.
One of the constraints of the data is that daily
close  values  are  used  whereas 
the
information might get transmitted much faster.
This  particular  aspect  can  be  stated  more
authoritatively  only  if  high  frequency  data  is
used  for  this  purpose.  High  frequency  data
is currently not available for spot market Index
in India, therefore they could not be employed
in the equation.

B. Volatility
Results of the study indicate that volatility has
reduced  after  introduction  of  Index  futures.
The study suggested the following to further
improve  efficiency,  liquidity  and  reduce
volatility : a) introduction of futures contracts
on  more  number  of  indices  b)  permission  to
introduce  smaller  value  contracts  c)  Efforts
may  be  made  to  look  at  margin  imposition
system  and  reduce  margins  without
compromising  on  the  integrity  of  the  market
and d) enhance institutional participation.

Survey of Indian Investors, 2000-01

II.
The  first  Survey  of  Indian  Investors  was
conducted during1998-99 SEBI and NCAER
conducted another survey of Indian investors
during  April-December,  2000  based  on  a
sample  of  2,88,081  households  located  in
geographically  dispersed  rural  and  urban
areas.  The  findings  of  the  Survey  were
published  in  March,  2003.  The  important
findings are:

During  the  year  2002-03,  SEBI  was  elected
as  a  member  of  the  IOSCO  Emerging
Markets  Advisory  Board  in  Kuala  Lumpur,
Malaysia.  SEBI  also  became  a  member  of
the  Screening  Group  and  the  Verification
Team  for  the  IOSCO  Multi  Lateral  MoU
project. SEBI was also  a  part  of  the IOSCO
Implementation  Committee  Meeting  on
IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities
Regulations.

In  December  2002,  SEBI  signed  a
Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  the
Financial Services Commission, Mauritius to
strengthen  communication  channels  and
establish  a  framework  for  assistance  and
mutual cooperation between the two parties.
The  MoU  marked  the  beginning  of  greater
collaboration between India and Mauritius to
effectively  regulate  and  develop  securities
and futures markets, in view of greater cross-
border  trade  and  cross-market  linkages
brought about by the globalisation of financial
markets.  In  January  2003,  SEBI  signed  a
Memorandum  of  Understanding  with
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  Sri
Lanka.  Under  the  MoU,  both  regulators
recognised  the  desirability  for  providing
assistance  and  exchange  of  information  to
aid  each  other  in  ensuring  compliance  with
laws  and  regulations  in  their  respective
countries.  The  scope  of  the  Memorandum
includes  providing  assistance  and  taking
action  against  insider  dealing,  market
manipulation  and  other  fraudulent  practices
in securities dealings.

SEBI’s application for becoming signatory to
the  IOSCO  Multilateral  MoU  concerning
Consultation  and  Cooperation  and  the
Exchange of Information was approved by the
Screening  Group  of  IOSCO  and  the  MoU
would be signed in the near future. Currently,
only  nine  IOSCO  members  have  become
signatory  to  the  MoU.  SEBI  is  amongst  the
few  Regulators  from  the  emerging  markets
to be admitted as a signatory.
