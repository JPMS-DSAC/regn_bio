PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

 
The Annual Report of the Securities and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  for  2010-11 
delineates  the  policies  and  programmes  of 
SEBI and its working and operations during 
the financial year as per the format prescribed 
by the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Annual Report) Rules, 1994. During the year, 
SEBI  continued  to  ensure  its  commitment 
to  fulfill  three  statutory  objectives,  namely: 
(a)  protection  of  the  interests  of  investors  in 
securities, (b) promotion of the development 
of the securities market and (c) regulation of 
the securities market. 

The 

 
three  statutory  objectives  are 
achieved  in  a  transparent  manner.  SEBI  has 
set-up  various  Advisory  Committees  in  all 
major  areas  of  work  to  advice  proactively 
for  the  development  and  regulation  of  the 
securities markets. Policy decisions are taken 
after consultations with the stakeholders and 
by  disseminating  policy  papers  for  public 
comments. SEBI’s decisions /orders are placed 
on its website for wider dissemination. Further, 
agenda  papers  submitted  to  the  Board  and 
their decisions are also placed on the website. 

The Annual Report provides the manner 
 
in which SEBI discharged its responsibilities 
and exercised its powers during the financial 
year in furtherance of the objectives enshrined 
in  (a)  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of 
India  Act,  1992,  (b)  the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation)  Act,  1956  (c)  the  Depositories 
Act, 1996 and (d) the relevant provisions of the 
Companies Act, 1956. Further, it also provides 
a  review  of  the  developments  in  the  Indian 
securities market during 2010-11. 

 
SEBI  had  amended  various  regulations 
to  face  the  new  challenging  dynamics  of 
global and domestic markets. Further, existing 
regulatory 
framework  was  strengthened, 
and  policies  and  programmes  were  framed 
to  promote  a  safe,  transparent,  efficient  and 
orderly securities market.

1.  GENERAL  MACRO-ECONOMIC 

ENVIRONMENT

 
Indian economy maintained its position 
as one of the fastest growing economies in the 
world  during  2010-11.  According  to  revised 
estimates  of  Central  Statistical  Organisation 
(CSO), real GDP grew at 8.5 percent in 2010-11 
compared to an upwardly revised 8.0 percent 
in  2009-10  (Table  1.1).  The  services  sector 
continued to be the main driver of growth in 
India, albeit at a slower pace of 9.2 percent in 
2010-11  compared  to  9.7  percent  in  2009-10. 
Growth in the industrial sector was lower at 
7.8  percent,  where  manufacturing  activities 
registered a growth of 8.3 percent, lower than 
previous  year  (Table  1.2).  The  agricultural 
sector witnessed a rebound in growth at 6.6 
percent  in  2010-11  compared  to  0.4  percent 
in  2009-10.  The  share  of  ‘agriculture  and 
allied  activities’  in  overall  GDP  declined 
marginally  from  14.6  percent  in  2009-10  to 
14.4 percent in 2010-11 (Chart 1.1). The share 
of  services  sector  remained  stable  around 
65 percent while share of industry remained 
steady  at  around  20  percent.  During  the 
first  four  years  of  the  Eleventh  Plan  period 
(2007-12), India’s real GDP grew at 8.2 percent 
per  annum  (average)  higher  than  the  7.8 
percent per annum (average) during the Tenth 
Plan period (2002-07).

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Industrial sector growth fell by 50 bps during 
2010-11 over the previous year and the decline 
was  contributed  by  all  the  three  segments 
namely, mining and quarrying, manufacturing 
and  electricity,  gas  and  water  supply. 
Manufacturing sector which takes lion's share 
in the industrial sector also declined by 50 bps 
during the year. The fall in electricity, gas and 
water supply and mining and quarrying is 70 
bps over the previous year.

During  2010-11,  services  sector  continued 
to  remain  the  largest  contributor  to  GDP.  In 
terms of growth during 2010-11, construction, 
trade,  hotel,  transport  and  communication, 
financing, insurance, real estate and business 
services  recorded  improved  growth  rate. 
However,  community,  social  and  personal 
services  witnessed  marked  deceleration  in 
growth rate during 2010-11. 

Chart 1.1: Share of Components of GDP (at Factor Cost)

As  per  the  CSO  data  on  India’s  savings  and 
investments, India’s Gross Domestic Savings 
(GDS) as proportion of GDP at market prices 
increased from 32.2 percent in 2008-09 to 33.7 
percent  in  2009-10  on  the  back  of  improved 
savings  by  private  corporate  sector  and 
public sector (Table 1.3). Public sector savings 
increased  from  0.5  percent  in  2008-09  to  2.1 
percent  in  2009-10  and  private  corporate 
sector  savings  increased  from  7.9  percent  in 
2008-09 to 8.1 percent in 2009-10. Savings of 
household  sector  remained  stable  around 

3

23  percent  in  2009-10.  The  Gross  Domestic 
Capital Formation (overall investment) at 36.5 
percent of GDP in 2009-10, exceeded GDS by 
2.8 percentage points reflecting net inflow of 
foreign savings. 
Bank  credit  during  2010-11  witnessed  
 
increased 
economy 
experiencing  a  challenging  environment 
following  increased  inflationary  pressures. 
Credit  picked  up 
first  half  of 
2010-11  as  corporates  in  order  to  fund  their 
expansion  plans  resorted  to  bank  sources.

They  also  resorted  to  non-bank  sources  of 
finance, mainly primary market and external 
commercial borrowings in face of hardening 
of interest rates and inflation. There was also 
an  increase  in  demand  for  credit  from  oil 
marketing companies as global crude oil prices 
started moving up following an expansion in 
global demand. As economic recovery became 
moderate  in  the  later  half,  with  industrial 
output  contracting  following  high  interest 
rates and inflation, credit demand witnessed 
a  slowdown  in  recent  past.  Non-food  credit 
started  declining  from  the  later  half  of 
2010-11  reaching  a  year-on-year  growth  of 
21.2 percent in March 2011 as corporates faced 
high  interest  cost  following  a  hike  in  bank 
lending  rates.  According  to  disaggregated 

provisional  data  released  by  the  Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI), the year-on-year growth 
in  bank  credit 
to  agriculture  declined, 
witnessed  mild  moderation  for  industry, 
while  credit  to  real  estate  and  housing 
witnessed significant turnarounds. 
 
Liquidity condition remained tight for the 
larger part of 2010-11 since banks faced tight 
liquidity  amidst  increasing  credit  demand 
as working capital needs of corporates went 
up.  The  key  factors  for  tight  liquidity  were 
increasing  domestic  inflation  due  to  supply 
side  bottlenecks  and  a  structural  shift  in 
consumption  pattern  of  the  economy.  The 
situation got further accentuated in the later 
half  of  2010-11  following  a  higher  forex 
demand  from  oil  marketing  companies  as 

4

global  crude  oil  prices  spiked.  Faced  with 
liquidity  squeeze,  banks  started  borrowing 
heavily  from  the  repo  window  of  RBI  to 
the  tune  of  over  `  1  lakh  crore  (compared 
to  lending  of  close  to  `  1  lakh  crore  in 
reverse  repo  window  during  second  half  of 
2009-10)  and  increased  deposit  rates  for 
shorter tenures to augment fund mobilisation.
To  curb  inflationary  expectations  in  the 
economy, RBI raised cash reserve ratio (CRR), 
repo and reverse repo rates during the course 
of 2010-11. 
Rates  in  the  money  market  hovered 
 
around 
the  upper  bound  of  Liquidity 
Adjustment  Facility  (LAF)  corridor  for  the 
better  part  of  2010-11  due  to  tight  liquidity 
conditions  in  the  system.  Interest  rates  in 
money  markets  and  yield  on  government 
bonds  hardened  during  2010-11  reflecting 
concerns  of  rising  domestic  inflation  and 
high  global  crude  and  commodity  prices. 
Following  the  aggressive  stance  by  RBI  to 
anchor 
interest 
rates  crept  up  across  the  term  structure  in 
government securities markets. The secondary 
market yield on 10-year government securities 
hardened and reached a peak of 8.15 percent 
during January 2011. 
 
Inflation  on  an  year-on-year  basis, 
measured by variation in the Wholesale Price 
Index (WPI), was 9 percent at the end of March 
2011 compared to 10.2 percent at the end of 
March 2010. On an average basis, the inflation 
rate  was  9.4  percent  in  2010-11  compared 
to 3.6 percent in the previous year. Prices of 
manufactured products (weight: 64.97 percent 
in WPI) rose by 6.2 percent compared to 5.2 
percent a year ago. Following the hardening 
of  international  crude  oil  prices  in  the  last 
six  months  of  the  financial  year  2010-11, 
fuel group recorded a rise of 12.9 percent in 
2010-11 lower than 13.8 percent witnessed in 
the previous year. The rise in overall index was

invisibles,  particularly 

mainly attributed to food articles registering 
a  rise  of  9.5  percent  in  2010-11  following 
a  structural  shift  in  consumption  pattern 
of the economy. 
 
India’s  import  bill  increased  during 
2010-11 both on account of crude oil as well 
as  non-oil  imports.  However,  trade  deficit 
narrowed  because  of  a  rebound  in  exports 
post  global  financial  crisis.  Bulk  of  trade 
deficit  was  financed  through  net  receipts 
under 
through 
remittances  from  Indian  migrant  workers 
abroad.  India’s  foreign  exchange  reserves 
increased by USD 24 billion to USD 303 billion 
during  2010-11.  The  inflow  of  funds  from 
foreign direct investment recorded a decline 
and that from foreign portfolio investments, 
external  commercial  borrowings,  short-term 
trade credits recorded a rebound. The Rupee 
appreciated  vis-à-vis  US  dollar  during  the 
better part of 2010-11. 
Stock  prices  in  India  became  volatile
 
during 
adverse 
developments  in  global  financial  markets. 
Stock  prices  witnessed 
an  upsurge, 
particularly in the month of November 2010, 
when  global  stock  markets  were  at  peak. 
With  the  improvement  in  global  markets, 
BSE Sensex closed above the 21,000 mark on 
November  05,  2010.  Thereafter,  it  witnessed 
a  correction  to  close  at  19,445  on  March  31, 
2011. BSE Sensex recorded an increase of 10.9 
percent and Nifty 11.1 percent in end-March 
2011 over end-March 2010.
2.   REVIEW  OF  POLICIES  AND 

following 

2010-11 

PROGRAMMES 
 
SEBI  initiated  a  number  of  policies 
and  programmes  during  2010-11  which 
are  presented  in  this  section  under  nine 
major  heads  viz.,  primary  securities  market, 
secondary  securities  market,  corporate  debt 
market,  mutual  funds,  portfolio  managers, 
takeovers, 
foreign 

institutional 

investors, 

Annual Report 2010-11

surveillance  and 
investor  assistance  and 
education.  The  section  concludes  with 
‘Retrospect and Prospects’.

I.   Primary Securities Market
 
Role  of  an  efficient  primary  market  is 
critical for resource mobilisation by corporates 
to  finance  their  growth  and  expansion. 
Indian  primary  market  witnessed  renewed 
activity in terms of resource mobilisation and 
number of issues during 2010-11, continuing 
its  momentum  from  2009-10.  In  view  of  the 
recovery  witnessed  in  equity  markets  post 
global financial crisis, companies, largely public 
sector  with  a  divestment  mandate,  entered 
the primary market during 2010-11. Investors’ 
response to public issues was encouraging in 
2010-11. Capital (equity and debt) was raised 
to the tune of ` 67,609 crore through 91 issues 
during  2010-11,  higher  than  `  57,555  crore 
mobilised  through  76  issues  during  2009-10. 
Continued  reforms  in  the  primary  market 
further strengthened investors’ confidence. An 
analysis on number of issues made, amount 
mobilised, size and composition of issues and 
industry-wise resource mobilised is presented 
in Part Two of this report. Following were the 
major policy initiatives taken by SEBI relating 
to the primary market during 2010-11:

i.   Encouragement  of  Retail 

Investor 

Participation 
In  order  to 

increase  retail 

 
investor 
participation and to keep pace with inflation, 
monetary  limit  on  retail  individual  investor 
application  was  increased  from  `  1  lakh  to 
`  2  lakh.  The  limit  was  enhanced  with  the 
objective 
investors 
who  have  capacity  and  appetite  to  apply 
for securities worth above ` 1 lakh should not 
be constrained. 
ii.   Reforms in Issue Process 
In  order  to  make  our  markets  competitive, 

that  retail 

individual 

6

SEBI  has  been  constantly  reviewing  various 
rules  and  procedures  to  make  issue  process 
simpler and at the same time safer. Some of 
the major initiatives in this area include:
a)  Reduction in process time lines: In order 
to lessen the market risk, infrastructural 
stress  and  costs,  time  between  issue 
closure  and  listing  was  reduced  from 
22  days  to  12  working  days.  Reduction 
in  process  timelines  help  in  reducing 
exposure of issuers/ investors to volatility 
in  market  conditions,  enable  quicker 
turnaround of money invested and help 
issuers to raise money quicker. 

• 

• 

b)  Enhancement  in Application  Supported 
by Blocked Amounts (ASBA) Process: To 
smoothen the payment/refund process in 
issues, SEBI has introduced Applications 
Supported  by  Blocked Amount  (ASBA) 
Process  in  issues,  wherein  application 
money  is  blocked  in  a  bank  account 
and  debited  only  to  the  extent  of 
allotment  entitlement  while  continuing 
to earn interest. ASBA has resulted in the 
following benefits:
Savings  for  investors  on  account  of 
interest earnings 
Savings for issuers on account of lesser 
cost  arising  out  of  savings  in  refund 
expenses 
Systemic 
arising  out  of 
unclogging  of  the  payment  system, 
work  load  reduction,  better  liquidity 
management by banks and reduction in 
refund related concerns. 
 
In order to enhance use of ASBA, the 
following measures have also been taken 
i.e.  ASBA  forms  are  now  available  for 
download  through  exchanges’  websites 
and  issue  advertisements  prominently 
highlight  the  use  of ASBA  facility.  Vide 

savings 

• 

 

Circular  dated  April  06,  2010,  SEBI 
also extended the ASBA facility to QIBs 
in  public  issues,  opening  on  or  after 
May 1, 2010.

c)  Public  Announcement  by  companies 
proposing  to  access  the  capital  market: 
In  order  to  draw  the  attention  of 
investors  about  filing  of  draft  offer 
document so as to elicit timely comments 
without  adversely  impacting  the  issue 
process, it was mandated that the issuer 
company  may  make  a  simultaneous 
public  announcement  about  filing  of 
draft offer document. 

d)  Lead  managers  mandated  to  submit 
compliance  certificate 
in  respect  of 
news reports: In order to ensure that the 
information  that  had  appeared  in  the 
media is consistent with the disclosures 
made in the offer documents, merchant 
bankers  were  mandated  to  submit  a 
compliance certificate as to whether the 
contents  of  the  news  reports  that  had 
appeared  after  filing  of  the  draft  offer 
document  till  closure  of  the  issue  were 
supported  by  appropriate  disclosures 
in  the  offer  document  or  not.  This 
was  made  applicable  for  all  reports 
appearing 
in  newspapers  stipulated 
in  SEBI  (ICDR)  Regulations,  2009  for 
issue  advertisements,  major  business 
magazines  and  also  in  the  print  and 
electronic  media  controlled  by  a  media 
group  where  the  media  group  has  a 
private  treaty/shareholders’  agreement 
with  the  issuer  company/promoters  of 
the issuer company.

e)  Details of current and past directorship(s) 
in  listed  companies  whose  shares  have 
been  /  were  suspended  from  being 
traded  on  the  BSE/NSE:  In  order  to 
enable investor to assess track record of 

7

Part One: Policies and Programmes

directors,  director  of  issuer  companies 
have  been  mandated  to  disclose  in 
Red  Herring  Prospectus 
regarding 
directorship  in  other  companies  whose 
shares  have  been  de-listed  /  suspended 
from trading for a period of 3 months or 
more in the past 5 years.

iii.  Uniform  Procedure  for  Dealing  with 

Unclaimed Physical Shares 
 
It  was  brought  to  the  notice  of  SEBI 
that  there  is  a  large  quantum  of  physical 
shares,  which  remain  unclaimed  despite 
the  best  efforts  of  the  Registrar  to  Issue  or 
Issuers and that there is no uniform practice 
for dealing with such shares. In view of this, 
SEBI decided to provide a uniform procedure 
for  dealing  with  unclaimed  physical  shares 
i.e., shares which could not be allotted to the 
rightful shareholder. Accordingly, the existing 
Clause 5A in the equity listing agreement was 
amended to provide for such a procedure. 
iv. 

Pre-Announced 
Introduction 
of 
Fixed  Pay  Date 
for  Payment  of 
Dividends  and  for  Credit  of  Bonus 
Shares 
 
In  order  to  enable  investors  to  manage 
their  cash/securities  flows  efficiently  and  to 
enhance  process  transparency,  it  has  been 
decided  to  mandate  companies  to  have  a 
pre-announced  fixed  pay  date  for  payment 
of dividends and for credit of bonus shares. 
This  is  in  line  with  prevailing  international 
practice. 
v.   Preferential  Issue  of  Equity  Shares  or 
Convertible  Securities  or  Warrants  to 
Promoters and Promoter Group 
 
In order to further tighten the preferential 
allotment  framework,  SEBI  decided  that 
in  case  of  preferential  issues,  where  any 
promoter  or  promoter  group  entity  has 
previously subscribed to the warrants of the 

Annual Report 2010-11

company but failed to exercise the warrants, 
the  promoters  and  promoter  group  shall 
be  ineligible  for  preferential  issue  of  equity 
shares or convertible securities or warrants in 
that company for a period of one year from the 
date of expiry of the currency /cancellation of 
the warrants. SEBI further decided that if any 
member  of  the  promoters/  promoter  group 
has  sold  shares  in  the  previous  six  months, 
then the promoters/ promoter group would be 
ineligible for allotment on preferential basis. 
vi.  Minimum  Promoters’  Contribution  in 

Follow-on Public Offers (FPOs) 
 
In order to enable listed issuers to have 
more  flexibility  in  raising  capital  through 
various  instruments,  it  was  decided  that 
the  requirement  of  promoters’  contribution 
shall not be applicable to FPOs where equity 
shares  of  the  issuer  are  frequently  traded  in 
a  recognised  stock  exchange  for  three  years 
and the issuer has a track record of dividend 
payment for three years. 
vii.  Uniform/Single  Payment  Option  in 

Rights Issues 
 
In order to ensure uniform treatment for 
all  classes  of  investors  in  rights  issues,  SEBI 
decided that only one payment option may be 
given by the issuer to all the investors i.e. either 
(a) part payment on application with balance 
money to be paid in calls or (b) full payment 
on application. SEBI also decided that where 
the  issuer  opts  for  part  payment,  it  shall  be 
incumbent  on  them  to  obtain  approvals,  if 
any, as may be necessary for the purpose.
viii. Disclosure  of  Proforma  Financial 

Statements 
 
In certain cases it was observed that issuer 
companies  had  done  material  acquisition  or 
divestment after the end of the latest disclosed 
annual financial results in the offer document, 
due  to  which  certain  companies  become/

8

cease  to  be  direct  or  indirect  subsidiaries  of 
the issuer. In such cases, it was mandated that 
the  issuer  companies  shall  submit  proforma 
financial  statements  in  respect  of  the  last 
completed  accounting  year,  and  the  period 
beginning  from  the  date  of  the  end  of  the 
last  completed  accounting  year  and  ending 
on the date on which financial statements of 
the  issuer  have  been  disclosed  in  the  offer 
document.
 
Further,  in  cases  where  the  acquisition/
divestment is not material, it has been specified 
that the fact of the acquisition or divestment 
along with the consideration paid / received 
and  the  mode  of  financing  such  acquisition 
shall be disclosed in the offer documents. 
ix.  Amendment to Clause 40A of the Listing 
Agreement  -  Requirements  in  Respect 
of  Minimum  Public  Shareholding  in 
Listed Entities 
 
In  order  to  align  the  requirements  in 
Clause 40A of the Listing Agreement with the 
amended  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation) 
Rules,1957  on  the  captioned  subject  and 
to  specify  the  manner  in  which  public 
shareholding may be raised to the prescribed 
minimum, it was provided that:
a)  Listed entities shall agree to comply with 
the requirements specified in Rule 19(2) 
and Rule 19A of the Rules.

b)  Where the company is required to achieve 
the  level  of  public  shareholding  as 
specified in Rule 19(2) and/or 19A of the 
Rules, it shall adopt any of the following 
methods to raise the public shareholding 
to the required level: 
issuance  of  shares  to  public  through 
prospectus; or 
offer for sale of shares held by promoters 
to public through prospectus; or
sale of shares held by promoters through 
the secondary market.

 Secondary Securities Market
II.

in  global 
amidst  adverse  developments 
financial  markets.  The 
initial  positive 
headways  fizzled  out  as  global  markets 
became  increasingly  adverse  owing  to  Euro 
zone debt crisis at the start and Middle East 
and  North  African  crisis  in  later  half  of 
the  year.  Following  were  the  major  policy 
initiatives  taken  by  SEBI  relating  to  the

vii.   Smart Order Routing 
 
Based  on  the  proposal  received  from 
stock  exchanges  and  market  participants 
and  the  recommendation  of  TAC,  SEBI 
has  introduced  the  facility  of  Smart  Order 
Routing  (SOR)  which  allows  the  brokers 
trading  engines  to  systematically  choose  the 
execution  destination  based  on  factors  viz. 
price,  costs,  speed,  likelihood  of  execution 
and  settlement,  size,  nature  or  any  other 
consideration relevant to the execution of the 
order. This facility would help brokers execute 
client orders efficiently by providing the best 
price available across multiple trading venues 
(stock exchanges). 
viii. Securities  Lending  and  Borrowing 

Mechanism (SLB) 
Further to extending the contract tenure 

 

Box 1.1: Smart Order Routing (SOR)

Smart Order Routing (SOR) is used by stock brokers/clients to determine the ‘best venue’ to execute an order, i.e., 
‘where’ to execute the order, based on client specified criteria like best price, liquidity, etc.

SEBI  has  permitted  SOR  in  Indian  securities  market  for  all  classes  of  investors.  SOR  has  been  envisaged  as  a 
mechanism  to  provide  ‘best  execution’  to  the  investors.  It  allows  the  brokers  trading  engines  to  systematically 
choose the execution destination based on factors viz. price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, 
size, nature, etc.

Stock brokers desirous to offer SOR to its clients have to apply to the respective stock exchanges where SOR intends 
to route orders. Detailed application requirements have been prescribed by the stock exchanges which inter-alia 
include system audit of SOR system/software by CISA certified auditor, undertaking that SOR would route orders 
in a neutral manner, etc. 

Stock brokers are required to communicate to all its clients the features, possible risks, rights, responsibilities and 
liabilities associated with the smart order routing facility. Any client desirous of availing such facility can do so by 
entering into a broker-client agreement, as applicable. For the existing clients, stock brokers can implement the same 
through an addendum to the existing broker-client agreement, as applicable.

Other key features of the SOR framework include stock broker to maintain logs of all activities to facilitate audit trail, 
periodic system audit of SOR system/software, unique identification number for the orders placed through SOR 
system, permit SOR for all orders without restricting to any specific type of order, synchronization of system clocks 
of the stock exchanges with atomic clock before the start of market, conditions under which the stock exchange can 
advise its stock brokers to seek re-approval of the SOR facility.

circular  dated  December  28,  2010,  revised 
the auction schedule, to be conducted on the 
same day of the settlement, after the pay-in is 
completed. i.e. the auction for trades done on 
T day shall be conducted on T+2 day after pay-
in  is  completed  and  shortfall  is  crystallized. 
The settlement of the same would be carried 
out on T+3 day.

b)  Derivative  Contracts  on  Volatility 
Index:  SEBI,  vide  circular  dated  April 
27,  2010,  permitted  stock  exchanges 
to  introduce  derivative  contracts  on 
Volatility Index, subject to the condition 
that the underlying Volatility Index has 
a  track  record  of  at  least  one  year  and 
the  exchange  has  in  place  appropriate 
risk  management  framework  for  such 
derivative  contracts.  Stock  exchanges 
disseminate data on Volatility Index on a 
regular basis. 

c)  Physical

Settlement 

Stock 
Derivatives:  SEBI,  vide  circular  dated 
July 15, 2010, provided stock exchanges 
flexibility  to  offer;  (i)  cash  settlement

options  on  USD-INR  spot  rate  in  their 
currency  derivatives  segment.  Options 
on  USD-INR  were  introduced  at  NSE 
and USE on October 29, 2010.

Box 1.2: OTC Market Reporting

In  the  financial  world,  Over-the-Counter  (OTC)  trades  are  defined  as  trading  of  financial  instruments  such  as 
stocks, bonds, commodities or derivatives directly between two parties without the attendant benefits of trading on 
exchanges in terms of central counter party, novation, trade guarantee, investor protection, transparency of pricing, 
etc. 
OTC  trades  generally  escape  regulatory  oversight  as  they  are  traded  bilaterally  and  without  any  reporting 
requirements. The disclosure of details of OTC transactions would enhance regulatory oversight and transparency 
by assisting regulators in assessing systemic risks; providing regulators the ability to identify the obligations of 
trading parties; maintaining a complete audit trail for trades which do not happen on exchanges; and by making 
available  to  public  access  to  aggregated  data  on  open  positions  and  trading  volumes.  From  a  public  policy 

13

Annual Report 2010-11

perspective also, oversight of OTC financial trades may be necessary to promote the efficiency and transparency of 
those markets; prevent market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses; ensure that OTC derivatives are not 
marketed inappropriately to unsophisticated parties; and prevent activities in OTC derivatives markets from posing 
risk to the financial system
Given the above, one such mechanism for oversight of OTC market may be to set up a central repository which 
would act as a warehouse for the storage, electronically, of trades done in the OTC markets.
International Scenario 
After the global financial crisis, there is a move to bring in more transparency in OTC markets. To this effect, in 
September 2009, the G-20 Leaders mandated OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories; 
all standardised OTC derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where 
appropriate; and all standardised OTC derivatives contracts should be cleared through central counterparties.
To support the realisation of these objectives, in October 2010, IOSCO formed a Task Force on OTC Derivatives 
Regulation with Securities and Exchange Board of India, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities 
and Exchange Commission from USA and Financial Services Authority from the UK as co-chairs. The mandate of 
the Task Force is to come up with the following reports -
•  Report on exchange and electronic trading;
•  Report on data reporting and aggregation requirements; and
•  Report on international standards for central clearing.
Indian Scenario
At present, the instrument-wise reporting position for OTC transactions is presented below :
 
 

FRAs/IRS
The  inter-bank  reporting  of  interest  rate  derivative  (FRAs  and  IRS)  transactions  is  done  electronically  on 
Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) platform (within 30 minutes of the deal). The client transactions 
are being collected (w.e.f. Oct 2009) on a weekly basis. The FRAs and IRS market (inter-bank) data is widely 
disseminated through RBI and CCIL website which include high/low/last traded rate, weighted average rate, 
volume and no. of transactions for each maturity bucket in IRS. There is no significant volume in FRAs. 
Forex Forwards
The aggregate daily sale and purchase data is published in Weekly Statistical Supplement (WSS) of RBI with lag 
of 2-3 weeks. The USD-INR forwards transactions are being cleared by CCIL on guaranteed basis.
Forex-INR Swaps
The aggregate daily sale/ purchase data is published in WSS with lag of 2-3 weeks. The data published in the 
WSS presents separate volume figures for inter-bank transactions and merchant transactions.
Cross-Currency Derivatives
Presently,  cross-currency  derivatives  transactions’  reporting  from  banks  is  through  half-yearly  statements 
covering number of transactions and notional amounts in USD for various types of products. 
Corporate Bonds
The OTC trades in ‘Corporate Bonds’ for transactions of the value of Rs.1,00,000 or above are required to be 
reported to the corporate bond platform at either BSE, NSE or FIMMDA. The transactions are reported within 
30 minutes of closing the deal. 
Repo in Corporate Debt
For trading in repo in corporate debt securities, all repo trades are reported on the FIMMDA reporting platform 
within 15 minutes of the trade. Further, the trades are also reported to any of the clearing houses of the exchanges 
for clearing and settlement. 
Credit Default Swaps
RBI  has  proposed  setting  up  a  centralised  CDS  trade  repository  with  reporting  platform  for  reporting 
transactions in CDS within 30 minutes from the deal time

e)  European Style Stock Options: SEBI, vide 
circular dated October 27, 2010, provided 
stock exchanges flexibility to offer either 
European  style  or American  style  stock 
options.  After  opting  for  a  particular 
style of exercise, a stock exchange has to 
offer  option  contracts  of  the  same  style 
on  all  eligible  stocks.  European  style 
stock options were introduced at NSE for 
all options contracts expiring on or after 
January 27, 2011 and at BSE for contracts 
expiring on or after March 17, 2011.

f)  Derivative  Contracts  on  Foreign  Stock 
Indices: SEBI, vide circular dated January 
11,  2011,  permitted  stock  exchanges  to 
introduce  derivative  contracts  (Futures 
and Options) on foreign stock indices in 
their equity derivatives segment.

xiii.  Setting  Up  of  a  Stock  Exchange/  a 
Trading Platform by a Recognised Stock 
Exchange having Nation-wide Trading 
Terminals  for  Small  and  Medium 
Enterprise (SME) 
 
SEBI  vide  circular  dated  May  18,  2010 
has put in place the framework for recognition 
and supervision of SME. A company desirous 
of being recognised as a SME exchange or a 
recognised  stock  exchange  having  nation 
wide  trading  terminals  desirous  to  set  up 
a  trading  platform  may  apply  to  SEBI, 
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the 
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956 
read  with  the  provisions  of  the  Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, subject to 
the  applicant  fulfilling  the  conditions,  inter-
alia, stipulates i.e. it shall be a corporatised & 
demutualised entity, compliant with Securities

xv.  Mandating the Stock Exchanges to credit 
the  penalties  levied  on  their  members 
to their Investor Protection Fund 
 
Stock  exchanges  were  earlier  treating 
the penalties levied on their member brokers 
as their revenue. SEBI vide letter dated June 
25,  2010  advised  all  the  stock  exchanges 
to  credit  the  penalties  levied  by  them  on 
their  members  to  their  Investor  Protection 
Funds  (IPFs).  Amongst  the  active  stock 
exchanges,  NSE,  MCX-SX,  CSE  and  MSE 
have already complied with the requirement 
of  crediting  penalties 
their 
members to their IPFs. However, BSE is in the 
process of carrying out necessary amendments 
to  its  byelaws,  pursuant  to  which  it  will 
comply with the requirement. The aggregate 
amount of penalties transferred by the stock 
exchanges  during  the  year  2010-11  to  IPFs 
was ` 7.26 lakh.

levied  on 

xvi.  Display of Details by Stock Brokers 
 
It  was  observed  that  the  stock  brokers 
were making prominent use of brand names 
/  logos  of  their  group  companies  instead  of 
using  their  names  as  registered  with  SEBI. 

This was creating confusion in the minds of 
the investors. Hence, SEBI vide circular dated 
November 4, 2010 advised the stock brokers 
that while a stock broker may use the brand 
name / logo of its group companies, it must 
display the following more prominently: 
a) 

its name as registered with SEBI, its own 
logo, if any, its registration number, and 
its  complete  address  with  telephone 
numbers  in  its  portal  /web  site,  if  any, 
notice / display boards, advertisements, 
publications,  know  your  client  forms, 
and member client agreements;
its name as registered with SEBI, its own 
logo, if any, its registration number, and 
its  complete  address  with  telephone 
numbers,  the  name  of  the  compliance 
officer, his telephone number and e-mail 
address in the contract notes, statement of 
funds and securities, and correspondences 
with the clients. This will help the clients 
to  contact  the  compliance  officer  of  the 
stock broker in case of any complaints or 
if any information is required.

xvii. Enhancing 

the  Employees  of 

the  Competency  Level 
the  Market 

of 
Intermediaries

 

a)  Certification  of  Approved  Users  and 
Sales Personnel of the Trading Members 
of  the  Currency  Derivatives  Segment 
Trading in Interest Rate Derivatives
SEBI vide notification dated June 29, 2010 
mandated  the  requirement  of  series-IV: 
IRD certification for approved users and 
sales personnel of the trading members 
of currency derivatives segment trading 
in  interest  rate  derivatives.  This  will 
ensure that the persons employed by the 
trading  members  are  certified  and  thus 
they will be better equipped to carry out 
the dealing and sales operations skillfully 
and effectively.

16

 

b)  Certification of Persons Associated with 
Registered  Stock  Brokers  Involved  in 
Risk Management
SEBI  vide  notification  dated  December 
10,  2010  mandated  the  requirement  of 
NISM-Series-VII:  Securities  Operations 
and  Risk  Management  Certification  for 
persons  associated  with  a  registered 
stock-broker  /trading  member/  clearing 
member  in  recognised  stock  exchanges, 
who  are  involved  in,  or  deal  with 
assets  or  funds  of  investors  or  clients, 
redressal of investor grievances, internal 
control or risk management, or activities 
having  a  bearing  on  operational  risk. 
This will enable them to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively in the interest 
of investors.

c)  Certification  of  Associated  Persons  of 

 

the 

NISM-Series-VI: 

Registered Depository Participants
SEBI  vide  notification  dated  March 
requirement 
29,2011  mandated 
of 
Depositories 
Operations  Certification  Examination 
(DOCE) for associated persons engaged 
or  employed  or  to  be  engaged  or 
employed  by  a  registered  Depository 
Participant.  An  associated  person  is 
one  who  is  responsible  for  dealing 
or 
interacting  with  clients,  dealing 
with  securities  of  clients,  handling 
redressal of investor grievances, internal 
control  or  risk  management,  activities 
having  a  bearing  on  operational  risk 
or  maintenance  of  books  and  records 
pertaining  to  the  above  activities.  This 
will  equip  them  to  discharge  their 
responsibilities effectively in the interest 
of investors and market. 

xviii.  Expansion  of  Market  Access  through 

Authorised Persons 

   With a view to expand the reach of the 

17

Part One: Policies and Programmes

markets  for  exchange  traded  products,  SEBI 
vide  circular  dated  November  6,  2009  had 
allowed  registered  stock  brokers  to  provide 
market  access  to  clients  through Authorised 
Persons 
(APs)  and  provided  a  broad 
framework governing the same. Further, vide 
circular  dated  July  23,  2010  the  certification 
requirements for APs were rationalized in line 
with  those  applicable  for  stock  brokers  and 
sub-brokers. As of March 31, 2011, 63,042 APs 
have been registered by the stock exchanges, 
as against 34,767 as on March 31, 2010. Thus, 
there  has  been  a  substantial  increase  in  the 
number  of  APs  registered  with  the  stock 
exchanges  and  thus  increasing  the  reach  of 
the markets for exchange traded products.
xix.  Granting of Permanent Registration to 

Intermediaries 
 
According  to  Regulations,  while  the 
stock  brokers  and  sub-brokers  are  granted 
permanent  registration,  other  intermediaries 
are granted registration for a period of 3 – 5 
years.  After  the  expiry  of  their  registration, 
the  above  intermediaries,  if  they  so  desire, 
apply  for  renewal  in  order  to  continue  their 
business. 
 
The  purpose  of  renewal  is  to  check 
whether the intermediary is complying with 
the  basic  requirements  such  as  net  worth, 
infrastructure,  key  personnel,  fit  and  proper 
compliance, etc. 
 
renewal,  other  checks 
and  balances  are  available  with  SEBI  for 
monitoring the activities of the intermediaries 
on  a  continuous  basis.  Accordingly,  SEBI 
Board  approved  the  proposal  to  amend 
the  respective  Regulations  governing  the 
intermediaries to grant permanent registration 
to  the  intermediaries.  The  intermediaries 
would  be  granted  registration  initially  for 
a period of five years. On assessment of the 
performance of the intermediary and its track 

Apart 

from

record  during  the  initial  five  years,  it  will 
be  granted  registration  on  permanent  basis. 
Necessary amendments to the regulations are 
being carried out. 
the 
 
registration process and help SEBI in effective 
regulation of intermediaries. 

The  above  would 

streamline 

xx.  Dispensed with Prior Approval (Except 

for Change in Control) 
 
It  was  decided  to  do  away  with  the 
requirement of obtaining prior approval from 
SEBI  by  the  intermediaries  for  ‘change  of 
their status or constitution’ as defined in the 
regulations. 
 
SEBI  receives  a  lot  of  such  requests 
in  respect  of  very  small  and  sometimes 
insignificant changes in the constitution of the 
intermediaries.  It  was  felt  desirable  that  the 
time spent on these activities can be focused on 
inspection  and  monitoring  of  intermediaries 
and their effective regulation. 
 
However,  in  case  of  change  in  control, 
the  intermediaries  except  the  sub-brokers  - 
who do not deal with funds and securities of 
clients - would continue to seek prior approval 
of  SEBI.  SEBI  Board  approved  the  proposal 
and necessary amendments to the regulations 
are being carried out. 
xxi.  Enhanced Transparency and Disclosure 
Norms  for  Credit  Rating  Agencies 
(CRAs)
 
Recent events in global financial system 
have  underlined  the  pivotal  role  that  credit 
rating  agencies  play  in  the  financial  sector. 
Effective  use  of  credit  ratings  by  the  users 
is  crucially  dependent  upon  quality  and 
quantity  of  disclosures  made  by  the  Credit 
Rating  Agencies  (CRAs).  There  have  been 
widespread  consultations  on 
issue 
both  globally  and  within  India  and  several 
documents have been prepared. 

the 

 
In the wake of the above and in order to 
impart higher credibility to the processes and 
procedures associated with the credit rating, 
SEBI  prescribed  the  following  norms  for 
transparency and disclosures in consultation 
with the CRAs:
a.  Rating Process
 

A  CRA  shall,  in  support  of  each  credit 
rating and review / surveillance thereof, 
keep  till  five  years  after  maturity  of 
instruments, the records of:
the  important  factors  underlying  the 
credit rating and sensitivity of such credit 
rating to changes in these factors; 
summary of discussions with the issuer, 
its  management,  auditors  and  bankers 
which  have  a  bearing  on  the  credit 
rating; 

i. 

ii. 

iv. 

iii.  decisions  of  the  rating  committee(s), 
including  voting  details  and  notes  of 
dissent,  if  any,  by  any  member  of  the 
rating committee. 
in  case  of  a  quantitative  model  being 
a  substantial  component  of  the  credit 
rating  process,  the  rationale  for  any 
material  difference  between  the  credit 
rating  implied  by  the  model  and  the 
credit rating actually assigned.

b.  Default Studies
 

In  order  to  promote  transparency  and 
to  enable  the  market  to  best  judge  the 
performance of the ratings, the CRA, shall 
publish information about the historical 
default rates of CRA rating categories and 
the changes in the default rates of these 
categories  over  time.  For  this  purpose, 
the  method  for  calculation  of  one-year 
default rate as well as cumulative default 
rate has been specified.
On  annual  basis,  the  average  one-year 
and  three-year  cumulative  default  rates 

 

18

(based on weighted average), for the last 
5 years, shall be disclosed for each credit 
rating category as well as structured and 
non-structured instruments, separately.

c.  Dealing with Conflict of interest
 

For dealing with the conflict of interests, 
the  CRAs  shall  formulate  the  policies 
and internal codes and ensure that (a) its 
analysts  do  not  participate  in  any  kind 
of marketing and business development 
including  negotiations  of  fees  with  the 
issuer  whose  securities  are  being  rated, 
(b) the employees’ involved in the credit 
rating  process  and  their  dependants 
do not have ownership of the shares of 
the issuer and there is a prompt review 
of  the  credit  ratings  of  the  securities  as 
and when any of its employees joins the 
respective issuer. 

d.  Obligations  in  Respect  of  Rating  of 

 

Structured Finance Products

structured  finance  products,  namely, 
instruments  /  pay-outs  resulting  from 
securitization transactions, the CRA or its 
subsidiaries shall not provide consultancy 
or advisory services regarding the design 
of  the  structured  finance  instrument. 
Also that the rating symbols shall clearly 
indicate that the ratings are for structured 
finance  products.  While  publishing  the 
ratings  of  structured  finance  products 
and  their  movements,  the  track  record 
of  the  originator  and  details  of  nature

Part One: Policies and Programmes

credit rating symbol shall be accompanied 
by  the  word  “UNSOLICITED”  in  the 
same  font  size.  The  CRA  is  required  to 
monitor and disclose credit rating during 
the life of the rated securities, as if it were 
a solicited rating. The CRAs shall disclose 
annually all the unsolicited ratings carried 
out in the last three financial years. 

f.  Disclosure of Information
 

The  CRAs  are  required  to  make  the 
following  disclosures  to  bring  about 
transparency in their operations: 

•

rating  procedure,  Credit  rating  history 
and defaults, income, structured finance 
products,  unsolicited  credit  ratings, 
shareholding  and  compliance  status  of 
IOSCO  Code  of  Conduct.  A  CRA  shall 
formulate  and  disclose 
its  policies, 
methodology  and  procedures  in  detail 
regarding solicited and unsolicited credit 
ratings. A CRA shall disclose the details 
of new credit ratings assigned as well the 
movement of the outstanding ratings. 
In  case  of  listed  securities,  the  CRA 
shall also make disclosures to the stock 
exchanges as specified in the SEBI (Credit 
Ratings)  Regulations,  1999.  For  ratings 
assigned and their periodic reviews, the 
CRA  shall  issue  press  releases  which 
shall also be placed on their websites. 
The  CRAs  are  required  to  disclose  the 
general  nature  of 
its  compensation

year  (March  /  September).  The  yearly 
disclosures  stipulated  above  shall  be 
made by the CRAs within 30 days from 
the end of the financial year. 

xxii. Constitution  of  Standing  Committee 

for Credit Rating Agencies 
 
The  CRAs  registered  with  SEBI  also 
carry out rating of securities and instruments 
not  arising  out  of  public  or  rights  issues 
which are relied upon by other regulators and 
investors. 
 
In  order  to  bring  about  coordination 
among  the  regulators  pertaining  to  issues 
related  to  CRAs,  a  Standing  Committee 
comprising  of  representatives  of  all  the 
regulators  (SEBI,  RBI,  IRDA  &  PFRDA)  has 
been set up. The Committee met twice during 
the financial year and discussed various issues 
related to CRAs. 

III.  Corporate Debt Market
i.   Listing Agreement for Securitized Debt 

Instruments 
 
On  March  16,  2011,  SEBI  put  in  place 
the  Listing  Agreement  for  Securitized  Debt 
Instruments (SDI) issued by a special purpose 
distinct entity (SPDE). Listing of SDI on stock 
exchanges  would  help  improve  secondary 
market for such instruments. Also, the Listing 
Agreement  also  provides  for  continuous 
disclosure  requirements  that  include  pool 
level,  tranche  level  and  select  loan  level 
information  that  are  aimed  at  enhancing 
information available in the public domain on 
performance of asset pools on which the SDI 
are issued. The enabling framework for listing 
of  such  instruments  along  with  the  initial 
disclosure requirements is provided for in the 
SEBI  (Public  offer  and  Listing  of  Securitised 
Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 notified 
on May 26, 2008.

ii.   Reporting of CPs and CDs
 
On  July  30,  2010,  SEBI  directed  all 
its  regulated  entities  to  report  their  OTC 
transactions in CPs and CDs on the FIMMDA 
reporting  platform  within  15  minutes  of  the 
trade. This was introduced pursuant to an RBI 
decision  to  introduce  a  reporting  platform 
for all secondary market transactions in CPs 
and  CDs.  RBI  had  advised  FIMMDA  to  set 
up  a  reporting  platform  to  capture  all  OTC 
transactions in CPs and CDs. The circular has 
been effective since August 16, 2010.
IV.  Mutual Funds 
Mutual  funds  witnessed  redemption 
 
pressures during 2010-11 due to volatile market 
conditions.  SEBI  had  taken  the  following 
initiatives  to  improve  the  functioning  of 
mutual funds: 
i.  Disclosure of Investor Complaints with 

investor 

Respect to Mutual Funds 
 
To  improve  transparency  in  ‘grievance 
redressal  mechanism’,  it  was  decided  that 
funds  shall  henceforth  disclose 
mutual 
detailed 
status  of 
complaints 
received by them in a prescribed format, on 
their websites, on the AMFI website as well as 
in their Annual Reports. These details should 
have  been  signed  off  by  the  trustees  of  the 
concerned mutual fund.
ii.  Certification Programme for Sale and/or 
Distribution of Mutual Fund Products 
 
Earlier,  agents/distributors  of  mutual 
fund  units  were 
to  obtain 
certification  from  Association  of  Mutual 
Funds  in  India  (AMFI).  Under  Regulation  3 
(1) of (Certification of Associated Persons in 
the  Securities  Markets)  Regulations,  2007, 
it  was  decided  that  from  June  01,  2010,  the 
certification  examination  for  distributors, 
agents or other persons employed or engaged 

required 

or to be employed or engaged in the sale and/or 
distribution of mutual fund products, would 
be  conducted  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Securities Markets (NISM). Persons who have 
attained  the  age  of  fifty  years  or  who  have 
at least ten years experience in the securities 
markets  in  the  sale  and/  or  distribution  of 
mutual  fund  products  as  on  May  31,  2010, 
will  be  given  the  option  of  obtaining  the 
certification  either  by  passing  the  NISM 
certification  examination  or  qualifying  for 
Continuing Professional Education (CPE) by 
obtaining  such  classroom  credits  as  may  be 
specified by NISM from time to time.

iii.  Extension of Date of Implementation of 

ASBA Facility 

The 

requirement 

of  Application 
 
Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) facility 
for investors’ subscriptions in all mutual fund 
New  Fund  Offers  (NFOs)  that  was  to  be 
mandated from July 01, 2010 was extended for 
implementation from October 1, 2010. 

iv.  Alternative Expense Structure for Fund 

of Funds 

 
To  allow  fund  of  funds  choose  a 
suitable  expense  structure,  amendment  to 
regulations 
(Notification  no.  LAD-NRO/ 
GN/2010-11/13/13945  dated  July  29,  2010) 
were  specified  vide  circular  dated  August 
06,  2010  so  that  fund  of  fund  schemes,  may 
continue with existing total expense structure 
laid out in Regulation 52(6)(a) of SEBI(Mutual 
Funds) Regulations or adopt the new expense 
provisions of charging a total expense of 2.5 
percent per annum inclusive of management 
fees,  other  administrative  expenses  and 
charges  levied  by  the  underlying  schemes. 
Change in expense structure could be carried 
out  with  the  approval  of  trustees  and  after 
giving unit holders an option to exit.

v.  Updation 

of 

Investor 

Related 

including 

are  maintained/ 

Documents 
 
Earlier,  mutual  funds  were  required 
to  confirm  whether  all  the  investor  related 
documents 
available 
with  them.  To  ensure  that  investors  have 
unrestricted  access 
to  AMCs,  mutual 
funds  were  further  directed  vide  circular 
dated  August  12,  2010  that  investor  related 
documents 
account  opening 
documents,  PAN,  KYC,  PoA  (if  applicable), 
specimen signature are available with AMCs/ 
their RTAs and not just with the distributor. 
AMCs  shall  be  responsible  for  updation  of 
these documents. It has been observed that due 
to such incomplete documentation, investors’ 
rights  to  approach  the  AMCs  directly  were 
restricted and investors were forced to depend 
on the distributors for executing any financial 
or non-financial transactions. 
vi.  Review  of  Norms  for  Investment 
and  Disclosure  by  Mutual  Funds  in 
Derivatives 
In  order  to  have  prudential  limits  for 
 
derivative investments by mutual funds and 
to  bring  in  transparency  and  clarity  in  the 
disclosure  of  the  same  to  investors,  it  was 
decided to bring in modifications in derivative 
exposure  by  mutual  fund  schemes  vide 
Circular  No.  Cir/  IMD/  DF/  11/  2010  dated 
August  18,  2010.  The  highlights  of  the  new 
provisions  are:  cumulative  gross  exposure 
through equity, debt and derivative positions 
should  not  exceed  100  percent  of  the  net 
assets of the scheme, mutual funds shall not 
write  options  or  purchase  instruments  with 
embedded  written  options,  total  exposure 
related  to  option  premium  paid  must  not 
exceed  20  percent  of  the  net  assets  of  the 
scheme, cash or cash equivalents with residual 
maturity of less than 91 days may be treated 
as  not  creating  any  exposure  and  mutual

consolidation 

funds may enter into plain vanilla interest rate 
swaps for hedging purposes.
vii.  Consolidation or Merger of Schemes 
 
or  merger 
of  schemes  was  viewed  as  changes 
in 
fundamental attributes of the related schemes 
and the mutual funds were required to comply 
with the requirements laid down in the SEBI 
(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,  for  the 
purpose.  To  facilitate  merger  of  schemes,  it 
was  decided  vide  circular  dated  October  22, 
2010 that merger or consolidation shall not be 
seen as change in fundamental attribute of the 
surviving scheme if: 
a)  Fundamental attributes of the surviving 
scheme as per SEBI Circular No-IIMARP/
MF/CIR/01/294/98 dated February 4, 1998 
do  not  change.  For  the  purpose  of  this 
circular, the surviving scheme means the 
scheme which remains in existence after 
the merger. 

b)  Mutual  funds  are  able  to  demonstrate 
that  the  circumstances  merit  merger  or 
consolidation of schemes and the interest 
of the unitholders of surviving scheme is 
not adversely affected. 

On  October  15,  2010,  SEBI 

V.  Portfolio Managers
i.   Fee charged by Portfolio Manager
 
issued 
circular on fee and charges levied by portfolio 
managers  to  bring  about  greater  uniformity, 
clarity and transparency to the process. Prior 
to  the  circular,  most  portfolio  managers 
charged profit sharing / performance related 
fees  on  gains  exceeding  a  hurdle  rate  or 
an  agreed  benchmark  and  there  was  no 
uniformity on how the profit / performance of 
the  portfolio  computed.  The  instant  circular 
made  it  mandatory  that  where  performance 
fee is charged, the same shall be computed on 
the basis of high water mark principle and the 

22

frequency not be less than quarterly. 
ii.  Monthly  Reporting  by  Portfolio 

format 

Manager
 
On  October  08,  2010,  SEBI  revised 
the  monthly  reporting  format  for  portfolio 
is  more 
managers.  The  revised 
comprehensive  with  details 
including 
investment  in  equity,  debt,  listed,  unlisted 
securities  including  the  AUM  of  EPFO/PF 
clients included therein. 
iii.  Clarification  on  Minimum  Investment 
Amount  by  Clients,  Performance  of 
Portfolio
On  November  02,  2010,  SEBI  clarified 
 
that  all  portfolio  managers  shall  ensure  that 
the first single lump-sum investment amount 
received  as  funds  or  securities  from  clients 
should not be less than ` 5 lakh. The circular 
also, made it mandatory to disclose portfolio 
performance in percentage terms of portfolios 
grouped by investment category for the past 
three years after netting all fees and charges 
levied by the portfolio manager.
VI.   Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)
(PCC) 
i.   Protected  Cell  Company 

/ 
Multiply  Share  Class  Vehicle  (MCV) 
Policy 
The 

intention  of  FII  regulations 

 
is 
that  “broad  based”  funds  should  have 
access  to  Indian  securities  markets,  so  as 
to  encourage  diverse 
funds.  Eligibility 
criterion for applicants required applicants to 
satisfy the broad based criteria. Registration 
requirements  now  require  applicants  to 
additionally satisfy that the structures of these 
applicants are otherwise not non-transparent 
or circumvent the spirit of regulation such as 
Protected  Cell  Companies  (PCCs)  or  Multi 
Class  Share  Vehicles  (MCV).  Vide  circular 
dated April 15, 2010, all FIIs were advised to 
provide  declarations  and  undertakings  that 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

they  conform  to  the  broad  based  criteria  as 
specified  in  regulations.  Further,  all  those 
entities  that  were  broad  based  and  were 
structured  as  MCVs  were  required  to  seek 
prior  permission  before  a  share  class  is 
added  for  directing  investments  into  India. 
All  registered  FIIs  were  mandated 
to 
provide  the  requisite  declarations  and  the 
undertakings  about  their  structures  to  SEBI 
by September 30, 2010. 

a)  FIIs/sub-accounts  that  did  not  comply 
with  these  provisions  were  advised 
not  to  take  fresh  positions  in  cash  and 
derivatives  markets  while 
they  can 
retain  their  current  positions  or  sell 
off/ unwind. 

b)  The  status  of  compliance  of  providing 
requisite declaration and undertaking as 
prescribed by above circular is given in

iii.   Change  in  Reporting  Format  of  ODIs/

PNs Activity 

a)  Monthly Reporting Format
 

Some  of  the  concerns  relating  to  PNs 
arise from the fact that the PNs represent 
indirect  participation  in  the  market  by 
entities  which  are  not  registered  with 
SEBI  as  FIIs  or  sub-accounts  and  there 
may  be  cases  where  the  identity  of  the 
ultimate  beneficiary  may  not  be  well 
established. Said concern was addressed 
with  earlier  reporting  format  providing 
information about name and jurisdiction 
of PN subscribers of issued PNs by FIIs 
monthly  with  effect  from  Circular  No. 
IMD/CUST/15/2004, dated April 02, 2004. 
Monthly  PN  reporting  format  required 
the issuer to report the immediate owner 
of PN and in case the PN is issued onward 
to another entity then the details of the 
second level owner of PN.
The new reporting format was announced 
by Circular - CIR/IMD/FIIC/1/2011 issued 

 

on January 17, 2011 ensured that the PN 
issuing FIIs:
Report  the  information  about  the  name 
and  jurisdiction  of  the  end  beneficial 
owner of PNs at all times. 
Provide  information  of  the  PN  issuers 
transactions 
that  are  hedged  and 
referenced in India.
Compliance  of  PN  issuer  with  KYC 
norms for PN end beneficial owner. 
Provide  confirmation  on  regulatory 
compliance with the KYC norms. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

•  Undertaking by PN issuer that PNs are 
not  issued  to  Non  Resident  Indians  or 
Indian Residents. 

b)  Reporting of Short Lending 
 

issuance 

of  Circular 

By 
IMD/
FII&C/32/2008  on  October  16,2008 
FIIs  and  subaccounts  were  required  to 
submit information about the quantity of 
securities which they have lent to entities 
other than in the Indian securities market, 

23

Annual Report 2010-11

i.e.,  where 
the  Overseas  Derivative 
Instruments  (ODIs)  are  issued  which 
have the effect of a short sale in the Indian 
security (including F&O)/synthetic shorts, 
twice  a  week.  Subsequently,  with  effect 
from  circular  No.IMD/FII&C/34/2008 
dated  October  20,2008,  SEBI  prohibited 
the  activity  of  the  FII  lending  shares 
abroad.  SEBI  continued  to  monitor  the 
existing  outstanding  positions  which 
were  continuously  decreasing  over  a 
period of time. Subsequently, on a review 
on March 04, 2011, it was observed that 
there were no outstanding short positions 
reported by FIIs. As the prohibition on the 
activity of short lending continued since 
October 2008 , there were no outstanding 
positions reported in March 2011. Hence, 
with effect from issuance of circular no 
CIR/IMD/FIIC/4/2011  dated  March  29, 
2011, reporting of synthetic shorts in ODI 
by FIIs was discontinued.

iv.   Allocation of Debt Investment Limits 
a)  Vide circular dated November 26, 2010, 
a  new  debt  category  viz.  Government 
debt - long term with residual maturity 
of  over  5  years  was  introduced  with  a 
limit  of  USD  5  billion.  Another  new 
category  viz.  corporate  debt  –  long 
term  infra  with  residual  maturity  of 
over 5 years issued by companies in the 
infrastructure  sector  was 
introduced 
with a limit of USD 5 billion. 
FIIs were permitted to invest in corporate 
debt - long term infra as per the definition 
of infrastructure as governed by External 
Commercial Borrowing (ECB) Policy.
It  has  been  decided  to  allow  a  single 
FII entity to make bidding on behalf of 
multiple entities.
FIIs  were  allowed  to  make  investment 
in primary debt issues of “to be listed” 

• 

• 

•

• 

securities.  In  case  the  debt  issue  is  not 
listed within 15 days, FIIs were allowed 
to  sell  debt  holdings  only  to  domestic 
investors until such securities are listed.
In line with the budget proposal made on 
February 28, 2011 by the Government of 
India, SEBI, vide circular dated March 31, 
2011 increased the limit of corporate debt 
long term infrastructure by an additional 
amount of USD 20 billion, thereby taking 
the overall limit to USD 25 billion. 
FIIs have now been permitted to invest 
in unlisted bonds issued by companies in 
the infrastructure sector. 
Investments in such bonds shall have a 
minimum lock-in period of three years. 
However,  during  the  lock-in  period, 
FIIs  will  be  allowed  to  trade  amongst 
themselves.  During  the  lock-in  period, 
the investments cannot however, be sold 
to domestic investors. 
To  facilitate  the  FIIs  during  the  lock-in 
period a special trading window for FIIs 
shall  be  provided  by  exchanges  on  the 
same lines as is available for equities. 
Further,  FIIs  have  also  been  allowed  to 
avail  investments  under  this  category 
without obtaining SEBI approval till the 
quantum  of  overall  investment  reaches 
90  percent  of  the  overall  limit  i.e  USD 
22.5 billion.

VII. Takeovers
i. 

Submission of Report by the Takeover 
Regulations Advisory Committee 
SEBI, vide its order dated September 4, 
 
2009, had constituted the Takeover Regulations 
Advisory  Committee  with  the  mandate  to 
examine and review the Takeover Regulations 
of 1997 and to suggest suitable amendments 
to  the  same,  as  deemed  fit.  The  Committee 

24

changes 

to 

substantive 

was  headed  by  Shri.  C.  Achuthan,  former 
Presiding  Officer  of  the  Securities Appellate 
Tribunal and comprised of eminent members 
with expertise in diverse fields, viz. lawyers, 
industry representatives, investor association 
representative, merchant bankers, academics 
and SEBI representatives. 
 
The  Committee  submitted  its  report  to 
SEBI  on  July  19,  2010.  Upon  review  of  the 
existing law governing substantial acquisition 
of shares and takeovers vis-à-vis international 
practices, 
judicial  pronouncements  and 
experience  gained  so  far,  the  Committee 
proposed 
the 
Regulations  and  consequently  thought  it  fit 
to  comprehensively  re-write  the  Takeover 
Regulations.  The  proposed  draft  Takeover 
Regulations  were  also  made  part  of  the 
Committee Report. 
 
The  Committee  Report  was  uploaded 
on  the  SEBI  website  for  public  comments. 
The  public  comments  so  received  together 
with recommendations of the Committee are 
presently under consideration of the SEBI. 
VIII. Surveillance
i.   Criteria for Trade for Trade Segment
 
to  moderate  sharp  and 
destabilizing  price  movements  in  shares  of 
companies, to encourage better price discovery 
and  to  increase  transparency  in  securities 
market,  SEBI  in  consultation  with  stock 
exchanges  had  decided  to  adopt  following 
measures:
a)  The  securities  of  all  companies  would 
be traded in the normal segment of the 
exchange  if  and  only  if,  the  company 
has achieved at least 50 percent of non-
promoters  holding  in  dematerialized 
form by October 31, 2010.
In all cases, wherein based on the latest 
available quarterly shareholding pattern, 
the  companies  do  not  satisfy  above 

In  order 

b)

criteria, the trading in such scrips would 
take  place  in  Trade  for  Trade  segment 
(TFT segment).
In  addition  to  above  measures,  in  the 
following  cases  (except  for  the  original 
scrips, on which derivatives products are 
available or included in indices on which 
derivatives  products  are  available)  the 
trading would take place in TFT segment 
for first 10 trading days with applicable 
price band while keeping the price band 
open on the first day of trading.

scheme 

c)  Merger, demerger, amalgamation, capital 
reduction/consolidation, 
of 
arrangement, in terms of the Companies 
Act and/or as sanctioned by the Courts, 
in  cases  of  rehabilitation  packages 
approved  by  the  Board  for  Industrial 
and Financial Reconstruction under Sick 
Industrial  Companies  Act  and  in  cases 
of  Corporate  Debt  Restructuring  (CDR) 
packages by the CDR Cell of the RBI.

d)  Securities  that  are  being  admitted  to 
trading from another exchange by way of 
direct  listing/MOU/securities  admitted 
for trading under permitted category.

e)  Where  suspension  of  trading  is  being 

 

revoked after more than one year.
Further in all cases, the exchanges have 
been  advised  to  ensure  that  before 
starting trading in a scrip, the companies 
have  complied  with 
the  disclosure 
requirements  and  the  same  is  publicly 
disseminated on the website of exchanges 
to  enable  investors  to  take  informed 
decision. 
ii.   Measures 

to  Check  Any  Unusual 
Movements  in  Share  Prices/Trading 
Volume  Criteria  for  Trade  for  Trade 
Segment
In  order  to  enhance  the  surveillance 
to  any  unusual 

 
measures  with  regard 

25

Annual Report 2010-11

movements  in  share  prices/trading  volumes 
of stocks, after discussion with the exchanges, 
during surveillance meeting held on January 
31, 2011, a mechanism has been put in place 
whereby  in  case  of  significant  price/volume 
variation  being  witnessed  in  the  trading 
of  shares  of  the  company,  the  exchanges 
would seek comments of the company in this 
regard, and also the company’s confirmation 
that  it  has  made  all  required  disclosures. 
Further,  similar  to  the  practice  followed  in 
rumour  verification;  the  stock  exchanges 
would  publicly  disseminate  the  comments/
clarifications  received  from  the  company  to 
enable investors to take informed decisions.

iii.   Private Treaties 
 
SEBI had taken up with Press Council of 
India its concerns on practice of many media 
groups  entering  into  agreements,  such  as 
‘Private  Treaties’,  with  companies.  Typically, 
such arrangements are with companies which 
are listed or which proposes to come out with 
public  offerings.  These,  in  general,  entail  a 
company giving stake in it (shares, warrants, 
bonds  etc.)  in  return  for  media  coverage 
through 
reports, 
editorials etc. in the print or electronic media.
 
It was felt that such agreements may give 
rise to conflict of interest and may, therefore, 
result  in  dilution  of  the  independence  of 
press.  This  may  consequently  compromise 
the nature, quality and content of the news/
editorials 
companies. 
relating 
Needless 
to  say,  biased  and  motivated 
dissemination  of  information,  guided  by 
commercial  considerations  can  potentially 
mislead  investors  in  the  securities  market. 
Such journalism would not be in the interest

building strategies of media groups, without 
appropriate  and  adequate  disclosures  may 
not be in the interest of investors and financial 
markets.  There  are  prescribed  norms  of 
Journalistic  Conduct  that  require  journalists 
to disclose any interest that they may have in 
the company about which they are reporting. 
However, there was no equivalent requirement 
in  the  case  of  media  companies  holding  a 
stake in the company which is being reported 
/ covered. 
 
Press  Council  of  India  informed  SEBI 
that in its meeting held on February 22,2010 
at  New  Delhi,  it  has  accepted  the  following 
suggestions  of  SEBI  and  has  mandated  the 
following:
a.  Disclosures  regarding  stake  held  by 
the  media  company  should  be  made 
in  the  news  report/  article/  editorial  in 
newspapers/television  relating  to  the 
company  in  which  the  media  group 
holds such stake.

b.  Disclosure  on  percentage  of  stake  held 
by  media  groups  in  various  companies 
under  such 
'Private  Treaties'  on  the 
website  of  media  groups  should  be 
made.

c.  Any  other  disclosures  relating  to  such 
agreements such as any nominee of the 
media group on the Board of Directors of 
the company, any management control or 
other details which may be required to be 
disclosed and which may be a potential 
conflict  of  interest  for  media  group, 
should also be mandatorily disclosed.
The  copy  of  the  press  release  sent  to 
SEBI  by  Press  Council  of  India  in  the 
matter,  is  available  on  SEBI  website 
vide  Press  Release  No.  200/2010  dated

Further, 

to  ensure  public

entered  into  by  corporates  with  media 
companies,  SEBI  has  decided  that  the 
listed entities shall disclose details of such 
agreements  on  their  websites  and  also 
notify the stock exchange of the same for 
public dissemination. In order to ensure/
enhance public dissemination of all basic 
information about the listed entity, it was 
also  decided  to  mandate  that  the  listed

contains certain basic information about 
them,  duly  updated  for  all  statutory

iv.  Measures  to  Address  Unauthenticated 
News  Circulated  by  SEBI  Regulated 
Market Intermediaries 
 
It  has  been  observed  by  SEBI  that 
unauthenticated  news  related  to  various 
scrips  are  being  circulated  in  blogs/chat 
forums/e-mail etc., by employees of broking 
houses/other 
without 
adequate  caution  as  mandated  in  the  code 
of  conduct  for  stock  brokers  and  respective 
Regulations  of  various 
intermediaries 
registered with SEBI. 
 
Further, in various instances, it has been 
observed that the intermediaries do not have 
proper  internal  controls  and  do  not  ensure 
that proper checks and balances are in place 
to govern the conduct of their employees. Due 
to  lack  of  proper  internal  controls  and  poor 
training, employees of such intermediaries are 
sometimes not aware of the damage which can 
be  caused  by  circulation  of  unauthenticated 
news or rumours. It is a well established fact 
that  market  rumours  can  do  considerable 

27

Part One: Policies and Programmes

damage  to  the  normal  functioning  and 
behavior of the market and distort the price 
discovery mechanisms.
 
In view of the above facts, vide circular 
Cir/ISD/1/2011  dated  March  23,  2011,  SEBI 
registered  market 
intermediaries  were 
directed that:
a)  Proper  internal  code  of  conduct  and 

controls should be put in place.

b)  Employees/temporary 

staff/voluntary 
workers  etc.  employed/working  in  the 
offices  of  market 
intermediaries  do 
not  encourage  or  circulate  rumours  or 
unverified  information  obtained  from 
client,  industry,  any  trade  or  any  other 
sources without verification.

c)  Access to Blogs/Chat forums/Messenger 
sites  etc.  should  either  be  restricted 
under  supervision  or  access  should  not 
be allowed.

d)  Logs  for  any  usage  of  such  Blogs/
Chat  forums/Messenger  sites  (called 
by  any  nomenclature)  shall  be  treated 
as  records  and  the  same  should  be 
maintained as specified by the respective 
regulations which govern the concerned 
intermediary.

e)  Employees  should  be  directed  that  any 
market  related  news  received  by  them 
either in their official mail/personal mail/
blog or in any other manner, should be 
forwarded only after the same has been 
seen  and  approved  by  the  concerned 
intermediary’s  compliance  officer.  If  an 
employee fails to do so, he/she shall be 
deemed  to  have  violated  the  various 
provisions contained in SEBI Act/Rules/
Regulations  etc.  and  shall  be  liable  for 
action. The compliance officer shall also 
be held liable for breach of duty in this 
regard.

Investment  Advice 
Media/ Electronic Media/ SMS 
 
SEBI  has  been  receiving  complaints 
against persons who have been giving stock-
specific  advice  to  investors  and  receiving 
consideration for the same. Further, it has also 
come to the notice of SEBI that some persons 
are  giving  investment  advice  through  the 
print media or by sending bulk SMS messages 
even  without  entering  into  any  contract  or 
arrangement or without any consideration. 
Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 requires 
 
all 
intermediaries, 
including  portfolio 
managers,  associated  with  the  securities 
market to obtain registration from SEBI before 
operating in the securities market. Under the 
SEBI  (Portfolio  Manager)  Regulations,  1993, 
a portfolio manager is a body corporate who 
pursuant  to  a  contract  or  arrangement  with 
a  client,  advises  or  directs  or  undertakes 
on  behalf  of  the  client  management  or 
administration of a portfolio of securities or 
the funds of the client. 
The code of conduct for all intermediaries 
 
including  portfolio  managers  provides  that 
the  intermediary  or  any  of  his  employees 
shall  not  render,  directly  or  indirectly  any 
investment  advice  about  any  security  in  the 
publicly accessible media, unless a disclosure 
of  his  long  or  short  position  in  the  said 
security has been made, while rendering such 
advice.  The  code  of  conduct  also  provides 
that in case an employee of the intermediary 
is rendering such advice, he shall also disclose 
the interest of his dependent family members 
and the employer including their long or short 
position in the said security, while rendering 
such advice.
 
In  this  context,  investors  were  advised 
to  be  cautious  and  to  take  the  following 
precautions  before  dealing  in  any  manner 
with persons seeking to render such advice: 

a)  Where the advice is rendered or sought 
to  be  rendered  by  a  body  corporate 
pursuant to a contract or arrangement, to 
verify whether it is registered as portfolio 
manager  under 
(Portfolio 
Manager)  Regulations,  with  SEBI.  The 
list  of  entities  which  are  registered  as 
portfolio  managers  with  SEBI  can  be 
verified from the SEBI website.

the  SEBI 

b)  where the advice is rendered or sought 
to be rendered by any person, by means 
of  advertisements  through  SMSs,  or 
the  electronic  or  print  media,  whether 
pursuant  to  or  in  the  absence  of  any 
contract or arrangement, it might be an 
attempt to influence market price and lure 
investors. Investors are therefore advised 
to  take  adequate  care  and  carry  out 
necessary due diligence before acting on 
the basis of such advice/communication.

SEBI  Complaints  Redress  System 
(SCORES) 

 
SEBI is in the process of upgrading the 
investor  grievance  redressal  mechanism. 
The  upgraded  mechanism  SCORES  (SEBI 
Complaints Redress System) would be a web-
based,  centralized  grievance  redress  system 
for SEBI. All grievances will be in electronic 
mode  with  facility  for  online  updation  of 
action  taken  reports  by  the  users.  SCORES 
will  reduce  grievance  process  time  at  SEBI 
since  physical  movements  of  grievances 
are  not  required.  Similarly  the  grievance 
redressal time will be reduced since the entire 
process is in electronic mode, including action 
taken  report  submitted  by  the  company/
intermediary.  Similarly, 
the  problem  of 
physical  storage,  maintenance  and  redressal 
has also been addressed due to the proposed 
into 
conversion  of  physical  grievances 

28

electronic mode. As investors can track their 
grievance  redressal  status  online,  multiple 
correspondences  from  investors  to  know 
the  status  of  their  grievances  are  avoided. 
SCORES has been developed and the system 
will be fully functional in the financial year 
2011-12. 
X.   Retrospect and Prospects
i.   Retrospect
 
Indian  economy,  after  recovering  to 
a  growth  rate  of  8  percent  in  2009-10  post 
global  financial  crisis  recorded  a  healthy 
growth  of  8.6  percent  during  2010-11.  The 
increase  in  agriculture  produce  following  a 
normal  monsoon  and  sustained  momentum 
in services pulled up the overall growth rate 
amidst improved global environment.

to  GDP  ratio  decreased  to  86.8  percent  and 
59.4 percent, respectively in 2010-11 from 94.1 
percent  and  84.2  percent  a  year  ago.  Due  to

witnessed  volatility  during  2010-11  amidst 
developments  in  global  financial  markets. 
The  initial  positive  headways  fizzled  out  as 
global markets became increasingly adverse 
owing  to  Euro  zone  sovereign  debt  crisis  at 
the start and Middle East and North African 
crisis in later half of the year. Inflation concern 
and worries over surging global crude prices 
further aggravated the situation. SEBI would 
continue with its efforts to deepen and widen 
the  Indian  market  and  take  appropriate 
regulatory  measures  to  make  them  resilient 
enough to withstand volatility.
 
SEBI has been pursuing to its objectives 
of investor protection, investor education, and 
market  developments.  The  potential  issues

As part of its efforts to make the market

Indian 

companies  also 

 
Year 2010-11 clearly belongs to activities 
in  primary  market  which  witnessed  record 
number  of  Initial  Public  Offerings  (IPOs)/
Follow-on  Public  Offerings  (FPOs)  and  new 
debt  issues  (Non-Convertible  Debentures/
Bonds)  including  the  biggest  ever  IPO  of 
Coal  India  which  came  out  with  issue  size 
of  `  15,199.4  crore  in  October  2010.  In  debt 
segment,  State  Bank  of  India,  the  country’s 
largest  bank,  came  out  with  debt  issues  in 
multiple tranches which were subscribed by 
investors multiple times. 
 
Secondary  market  segment  showed 
signs  of  recovery  of  Indian  corporates  from 
global  financial  crises  witnessed  in  2008. 
The  recovery  phase  was  clearly  reflected 
in  substantial  increase  in  average  market 
capitalisation,  revenues  and  profit  after  tax 
of top 500 listed companies at NSE and BSE. 
With  growth  in  domestic  demand  being 
intact, 
showed 
improvement  on  export  front 
significant 
in  2010-11  despite  the  fact  that  the  global 
economy  is  still  recovering  from  financial 
crises. The cumulative value of exports for the 
period  from  April,  2010  to  March  2011  was 
US  $  245.8 billion  (`  11,18,822.8  crore)  as 
against  US  $  178.7 billion 
(`  8,45,533.6 
crore) registering a  growth of 37.5 per cent in 
Dollar terms and 32.3 per cent in Rupee terms 
over the same period last year.
 
During  2010-11,  Foreign  Institutional 
Investors  (FIIs)  made  record  investments  of 
` 1,46,438 crore in the Indian market (equities 
and debt combined) surpassing the previous 
high of 2009-10 net investments of ` 1,42,658 
crore. This reflects their confidence in Indian 
securities market and better growth potential 
of  Indian  economy  as  compared  to  many 
developed and emerging economies. 
 
There  was  substantial  improvement  in 
the resource mobilisation by corporates in the 
primary  market  in  2010-11  as  compared  to 

that in 2009-10, however, unlike previous year, 
mobilisation  of  resources  by  mutual  funds 
was  less  than  redemptions  which  resulted 
into  substantial  net  outflow  of  funds  from 
mutual funds. 

1.  PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET
 
The primary market segment witnessed 
positive  trend  during  2010-11.  Coal  India 
Ltd.  came  out  with  India’s  biggest-ever
initial  public  offering  (IPO)  having  issue 
size    of    `    15,199.4  crore  in  October  2010.
During  2010-11,  a  number  of  public  sector 
undertakings  (PSUs)  raised  money  through 
primary  market  as  part  of  disinvestment 
plan of Union Government The total resource 
mobilisation  by  PSUs  accounted  for  56.5 
percent  of  total  resources  mobilised  by  all 
companies in 2010-11 as against 54.1 percent 
share in 2009-10.

issues  and  10  debt 
raised 
primary  market  and 
`  67,609  crore  through  public  (68)  and  rights 
issues  (23)  as  against  `  57,555  crore  raised 
in  2009-10  through  public  (47)  and  rights 
issues  (29).  There  were  53  IPOs  during 
2010-11  as  against  39  during  2009-10.  The 
amount  raised  through  IPOs  during  2010-11 
was at  ` 35,559 crore as compared to  ` 24,696 
crore  during  2009-10.  The  share  of  public 
issues  in  the  total  resource  mobilisation  stood 
at  85.9  percent  during  2010-11  as  compared 
to 85.5 percent in 2009-10 showing a marginal 
increase  over  the  previous  year.  The  share  of 
rights issues was at 14.1 percent in 2010-11 as

Chart  2.1  represents  the  relative  share 
of  the  four  modes  of  resource  mobilisation 
namely, IPOs, rights, FPOs, and bond issues. 
It has been observed that the relative share of 
bond  issues  has  increased  significantly  over 
the previous year whereas the share of FPOs 
has  decreased  from  38.3  percent  in  2009-10 
to 19.4 percent in 2010-11. The relative share 
of  IPOs  has  increased  from  42.9  percent  in 
2009-10 to 52.6 percent in 2010-11 whereas the 
share of rights issues has declined from 14.5 
percent in 2009-10 to 14.1 percent in 2010-11.
 
In  order  to  make  Indian  markets  more 
competitive    and    efficient  and  to  facilitate 
quicker  resource  mobilisation  by  companies 
from  institutional  investors,  an  additional 
mode  for    listed  companies  to  raise  funds  
from domestic market in the form of Qualified 
Institutional  Placement  (QIP)  was  introduced 
in  May  2006.  Securities  which  can  be  issued 
through QIP are equity shares or any securities

MARKET

in 

Equity  market 

I.  Equity Market in India
 
India  witnessed 
a  significant  uptrend  during  2010-11  till 
October 2010. This was primarily on account 
of  significant  FII  inflows  into  India  and 
number of IPOs/FPOs of companies like Coal 
India  Ltd,  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India 
Ltd,  Tata  Steels  Ltd,  etc  coming  to  primary 
market  which  attracted  number  of  investors 

to  capital  market.  However,  post  Diwali  in 
November  2010  when  market  touched  its 
peak, Indian securities market took downward 
trend from December 2010 to February 2011 
on  account  of  significant  FII  outflows  and 
concerns raised on domestic and international 
issues.  However,  the  markets  got  revived  in 
March  2011  as  compared  to  February  2011 
on account of easing of concerns on domestic 
and  international  issues  and  FIIs  being  net 
investor  in  Indian  markets  in  March,  2011 
which helped the market sentiments.

NSE, the turnover in cash segment declined 
to  ` 35,77,410 crore in 2010-11 as against of 
`  41,38,023  crore  in  2009-10,  indicating  a 
decrease  of  13.5  percent  over  the  previous 
year. However, derivatives turnover at NSE 
gained  by  65.6  percent  over  the  previous 
year.  This  is  on  account  of  the  fact  that  the 
Indian  securities  market  is  undergoing  a 
fundamental change as market is developing 
both 
investor 
awareness and usage of leverage. As a result, 
investors are trading more in derivatives than 
cash segment. At BSE, however, derivatives 
turnover declined by 34.1 percent.
 
Unlike  previous  year  when  all  equity 
markets across the world witnessed uptrend, 
during 2010-11, equity markets across the world 
witnessed a mixed trend in terms of increase or 
decrease in year end values of their benchmark 
indices over previous year. On one hand, there 
were equity markets witnessing uptrend – the 
highest increase was seen in Argentina’s IBG

All-India cash turnover to GDP ratio decreased 
to 59.5 percent in 2010-11 from 84.2 percent in 
2009-10.  However,  in  the  derivative  segment, 
the turnover to GDP ratio increased from 269.7 
percent in 2009-10 to 371.3 percent in 2010-11. 
 
The  valuation  of  the  shares  might  be

V.   Stock Market Indicators
 
The market capitalisation to GDP ratio 
is an important parameter for evaluation of 
stock  markets.  The  liquidity  of  the  market 
can be measured by the traded value to GDP 
ratio, i.e., value of the shares traded to GDP 
at current market prices. Excluding 2008-09, 
since 2003-04, there has been a considerable 
improvement  in  the  market  capitalisation 
to GDP ratio. The BSE market capitalisation 
to GDP ratio improved from 43.4 percent in 
2003-04 to 86.8 percent in 2010-11. Similarly, 
at  NSE  also  the  ratio 
increased  from 
40.5  percent  to  85.1  percent  over  the  same 
period (Table 2.15). 
 
The turnover to GDP ratio was the highest 
in  2010-11  under  derivatives  segment.  The

VI.   Volatility in Stock Markets
 
Average  daily  volatility  of  a  stock 
or  index  is  measured  by  calculating  the 
standard  deviation  of  logarithmic  returns 
during  a  certain  period.  In  2010-11,  the 
stock markets around the world displayed 

lesser  volatility  as  compared  to  2009-10. 
Month-wise, average daily volatility in the 
Indian benchmark indices was the highest 
in May, 2010 and Feb, 2011 (Table 2.18). The 
lowest volatility in the benchmark indices 
was noticed during July 2010.

increasingly  getting  integrated  with  the  rest 
of  the  world  through  increased  trade  and

hedging  instruments  like  currency  futures 
and  options  to  manage  foreign  currency 
exchange  risk  in  addition  to  existing  OTC 
products.  With  electronic 
trading  and 
efficient risk management systems, exchange 
traded currency derivatives were introduced 
at  different  points  of  time  through  four 

exchanges,  namely  NSE,  BSE,  MCX-SX  and 
USE starting from August 2008 onward.
 
Trading  in  USD:INR  currency  futures 
contracts started on August 29, 2008 at NSE, on 
October 1, 2008 at BSE and on October 7, 2008 
at MCX-SX. BSE has stopped all its operations 
in  the  currency  derivatives  segment  from 
April 7, 2010. futures on 3 additional currency 
pairs,    namely,    EURO:INR,    GBP:INR  and 
JPY:INR were introduced at NSE and MCX-SX 
on  February  1,  2010.  Trading  on  all  currency 
futures  pair  started  at  USE  on  September  20, 
2010.  Further,  options  on  USD:INR,  were

  With  effect  from  December  1,  2009,  it 
has been made mandatory for all trades in 
corporate  bonds  between  mutual  funds, 
FIIs/sub-accounts,  venture  capital  funds, 
foreign venture capital investors, portfolio 
mangers,  and  RBI  regulated  entities  as 
specified  by  RBI  to  be  cleared  and  settled 
through the exchange clearing corporations, 
NSCCL  or  ICCL.  IRDA  has  also  issued 
similar  directions.  During  2010-11,  the 
value  of  corporate  bond  trades  settled 
through the clearing corporations stood at 
`  4,32,632  crore  at  NSE  and  `  17,492  crore 
at BSE. Further, the total number of trades 

65

settled was 32,662 in 2010-11, out of which 
30,948 trades were settled at NSE and 1,714 
trades were settled at BSE (Table 2.38). 
 
Although the year has seen a number 
of  public  issues,  private  placements  have 
also remained as one of the preferred modes 
of  raising  debt  funds.  The  rise  in  funds 
mobilised could also be possibly attributed 
to  issuers  preferring  the  domestic  debt 
markets  as  a  primary  source  of  corporate 
debt.  The  issuers  raised  an  amount  of 
` 2,18,785 crore by way of private placement 
during    2010-11  as  compared  to  `  2,12,635 
crore in 2009-10 (Table 2.39).

II.   Utilisation of Debt Investment Limits 
By FIIs
 
 
SEBI  has  been  allocating  debt  limits  to 
FIIs  by  a  combination  of  two  methods  viz. 
open  bidding  and  first  come  first  served 
(FCFS). Corporate debt allocation is currently 
made through FCFS only. 
a) 

In  the  first-come-first-served  basis  for 
allocation  of  government  debt  limits, 
requests for investment limits are called 
from the entities in a dedicated mail box 
thrown open on a particular day subject 
to a maximum limit per entity. The limits 
are then allocated based on the time the 
e-mails were received in the designated 
mailbox. For allocation of corporate debt 
limits,  requests  for  investment  limits 
are invited at a dedicated mail box and 
the limits are allotted based on the time 
priority of the mail.
In open bidding methodology registered 
FIIs/sub  accounts  can  bid  through  their 
trading  members  for  getting  the  debt 
limits. The features of which are:
•  The  allocation  is  to  be  done  on  an 
open  screen  based  bidding  platform 
wherein  bidders  would  pay  a  fee  for 
taking the limits. 

b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

•  The  allocation  is  on  a  price  time 
priority,  where  the  highest  bidder 
would take away the given limit.

•  Maximum  and  minimum  limits  vary 

as per the amount available. 

•  The successful bidders are required to 
pay a minimum of  `  1000 or the bid 
premium which ever is higher. 

•  The  premium  amount 

collected 
through this mechanism is to be paid 
to the Consolidated Fund of India. 

•  45/ 90 days period is provided to the 
entities for utilization of limits under 
this allocation method.

•  Details of debt limits allocated to FIIs 
and  sub-account  through  these  two 
processes during the financial year are 
given in the Table 2.54.

  During the financial year, an amount of 
` 117.26 crore was received as bidding 
fees,  which  has  been  credited  to  the 
Consolidated Fund of India.

c)  The  category  wise  utilization  of  debt 
limit as on March 31, 2011 is given in the 
following table.

d)  As  on  March  31,  2011,  tenure-wise 
net  investment  in  debt  is  given  in  the

PART THREE: REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKET

This part of the Report delineates the functions of SEBI as specified in 

Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992

1. 

INTERMEDIARIES

I.   Streamlining the Process of Registration 

/  renewal  of 

further  streamlined  enhancing 

/Renewal of Intermediaries
 
During the year, the process of granting 
registration 
intermediaries 
was 
the 
transparency  of  the  entire  process.  By  and 
large,  the  applications  have  been  processed 
within  30  days  from  the  date  of  receipt  and 
registration  /  renewal  has  been  granted, 
if  the  application  is  found  to  be  complete 
in  all  respects.  Wherever  deficiencies  are 
observed,  the  same  were  brought  to  the 
notice of the applicant within 30-day period. 
Further,  the  status  report  on  registration 
/  renewal  of  applications  is  displayed  on 
SEBI  website  on  a  monthly  basis  clearly 
showing whether the application is pending 
with SEBI or information is awaited from the 
applicant.  If  the  application  is  pending  with 
SEBI, the status report also shows how long it 
has been pending.
 
 It has also been mentioned on the website 
that  in  case  any  application  has  remained 
unattended, the applicant should not hesitate 
to  approach  the  concerned  Division  Chief 
(DC)  or  the  Executive  Director  (ED).  The 
respective  e-mail  IDs  of  concerned  officials 
are also displayed. 
 
The  practice  of  seeking  details  of 
corrective  measures  taken  by  the  applicant 
where  quasi-judicial  actions  have  been 
initiated  by  SEBI,  while  processing  the 
registration 
/  renewal  applications,  has 
greatly  improved  the  compliance  culture 
among the intermediaries.
  With  respect  to  registration/renewal  of 
Bankers to an Issue (BTI), SEBI has revised the 
existing  Additional  Information  Sheet  to  be 

for 

submitted along with Form ‘A’ making it more 
comprehensive so that necessary information 
is obtained with less correspondence thereby, 
enabling  quicker  processing  of  applications. 
The revised Additional Information Sheet has 
been uploaded on SEBI website.
i. 

Expediting  the  process  for  granting 
(NOCs) 
No  Objection  Certificates 
to 
Intermediaries 
setting  up 
subsidiaries abroad
 
In  order  to  expedite  the  granting  of 
no  objection  to  intermediaries  setting  up 
subsidiaries  or  entering  into  joint  ventures 
in  other  countries,  a  standard  application 
form was designed and uploaded on the SEBI 
website.  This  standardization  enables  the 
intermediaries to understand the requirements 
of  SEBI  for  granting  of  such  NOCs  and 
expedites the whole process.
II.  Registered  Intermediaries  Other  than 

Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers
During  2010-11,  a  mixed  trend  was 
 
observed  in  the  number  of  intermediaries 
registered.  During  the  year,  the  highest 
increase  in  absolute  terms  for  registered 
intermediaries  was  observed 
in  case  of 
depository  participants  (DPs)  of  CDSL  (44) 
followed  by  merchant  bankers  (28)  and 
portfolio  managers  (24).  A  marginal  decline 
was  witnessed,  in  the  number  of  registered 
intermediaries  like  registrar  to  issue  and 
share transfer agents, debenture trustees and 
underwriters during 2010-11. During the year, 
SEBI  also  processed  many  applications  for 
renewal of registration of the intermediaries. 
Overall  registrations  of  as  many  as  273 
intermediaries were renewed. The details are 
provided in Table 3.1 and 3.1a. The details of 
applications of intermediaries in the process 
of registration are provided in Table 3.1b.

matter is under litigation before the Hon’ble 
High Court of Judicature at Madras. Pursuant 
to SEBI circular dated December 29, 2008 on 
‘Guidelines for exit option for regional stock 
exchanges’,  CSX  has  expressed  its  desire  to 
surrender its recognition.
SEBI,  vide  order  dated  July  06,  2007, 
 
has  withdrawn  the  recognition  granted  to 
Saurashtra  Kutch  Stock  Exchange  Limited 
(SKSE).  In  the  matter  of  withdrawal  of

SEBI.  SEBI  conducts 
inspections  either 
directly  or  through  organizations  like  stock 
exchanges, depositories etc. Inspections on a 
periodic  basis  were  conducted  to  verify  the 
compliance  levels  of  intermediaries.  Special 
purpose inspections were also conducted on 
the  basis  of  investor  complaints,  references, 
surveillance reports, specific concerns, etc. The 
inspection of the depositories was also carried 
out in order to examine the effectiveness and 
quality  of  audit/inspections  and  the  action 
taking process of depositories.
I. 
Inspection of Market Intermediaries
 
The inspection process of intermediaries 
has  been  further  reviewed  with  a  view  to 
expedite  the  inspection  process  as  well  as 
to  improve  the  quality  of  follow  up  action 
resulting  in  enhanced  level  of  compliance 
amongst  the  intermediaries.  The  findings 
of  the  inspections  are  communicated  to  the 
intermediaries and thoroughly discussed with 
them  wherever  necessary,  to  ascertain  their 
views  and  action  is  initiated  commensurate 
with the seriousness of the violation committed 
by the intermediary. 
 
also 
specifically  advised  about  the  areas  where

market. With a view to gauge and strengthen 
their compliance level and risk management 
systems, SEBI initiated inspection of clearing 
members  during  2010-11.  The  inspections 
were aimed at checking whether the clearing 
members  collect  appropriate  margins  from 
the trading members, whether the collaterals 
collected towards margin are as prescribed by 
the  clearing  corporations  and  whether  they 
reported the collection of margins correctly to 
the clearing corporations. 

During  2010-11, 

 
total  number  of 
inspections completed of stock brokers, sub-
brokers  and  clearing  members  was  46  as 
compared to 36 completed last year. It includes 
42 inspections of stock brokers, one inspection 
of sub-broker and three inspections of clearing 
members (Table 3.16).

In  addition,  SEBI  also  directed  that  the 
stock  exchanges/clearing  corporations  shall 
inspect all active members in various segments 
every  year.  The  inspections  carried  out  by 
stock exchanges during 2010-11 are shown in 
Table 3.16a.

 
Further, SEBI vide circular dated August 
22, 2008, advised the stock exchanges to direct 
their stock brokers/clearing members to carry 
out  complete  internal  audit  on  a  half  yearly 
basis  by  independent  auditors.  The  focus  of 
the  internal  audit  is  to  assess  the  efficacy  of 
the internal controls and soundness of the risk 
monitoring  system  of  the  trading/clearing 
member. 

 
Internal auditors are required to submit 
their  audit  reports  to  the  intermediary.  The 
intermediary  would  place  the  report  before 
its Board of Directors / Proprietors / Partners 
and  shall  forward  the  same  along  with 
para-wise  comments  to  the  respective  stock 
exchange  within  three  months  of  the  end  of 
the half year period.
By and large all the active stock brokers/
 
clearing  members  of  the  three  major  stock 
exchanges  (NSE,  BSE  and  MCX-SX)  have 
submitted the internal audit report for the half 
year ended March 31, 2010 and September 30, 
2010, to the stock exchanges. 
The  major  findings  pointed  out  in  the 
 
internal  audit  reports  were  discussed  with

I. 
 Mechanism of Market Surveillance
 
An  effective  surveillance  mechanism 
is  one  of  the  prime  requirements  for  well

functioning  securities  market.  The  primary 
responsibility  of  safe-guarding  the  integrity 
of the market and ensuring that the market is 
performing in accordance with the stipulated 
norms  and  practice,  has  been  entrusted  to 
stock  exchanges,  which  act  as  first-level 
regulators.  The  exchanges,  as  part  of  their 
surveillance  mechanism,  keep  a  watch  on 
securities  and  analyze  their  trading  pattern 
and appropriate actions are initiated by them 
in case of any discrepancies. Any suspicious 
incident  or  price  movement  is  reported  to 
SEBI for further examination. 

 
The Integrated Surveillance Department 
(ISD)  of  SEBI  is  in  charge  of  overall  market 
surveillance  and  scope  of 
its  activities 
includes monitoring market movements and 
detecting  potential  breach  of  Regulations, 
analysing  the  trading 
in  securities  and 
initiation  of  appropriate  action  wherever 
warranted.  While  primary 
inputs  are 
received  through  examination  reports  from 
stock  exchanges,  ISD  also  receives  inputs 
viz.,  complaints  from  Investors,  references 
from  other  departments  of  SEBI,  regulatory 
bodies,  and  other  Government  agencies  as 
also reports in the media.

 
In  addition,  to  enhance  the  efficacy  of 
the  surveillance  function,  SEBI  has  put  in 
place  a  comprehensive  Integrated  Market 
Surveillance System (IMSS) which generates 
alerts  arising  out  of  unusual  market 
movements.  SEBI  also  keeps  an  oversight 
on  the  activities  of  the  stock  exchanges 
and  depositories  to  promote  an  effective 
surveillance

mechanism. 

II.   Surveillance Actions 
 

During  the  year  2010-11,  NSE  initiated 

95

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

preliminary examination and investigation in 
a total 222 cases and BSE initiated examination 
and investigation in 1,625 cases. 
 
Further, as surveillance measure, during 
the year, NSE shifted 259 scrips to Trade-for-
Trade segment and BSE shifted 1,194 scrips 
to Trade-for-Trade segment. On shifting the 
scrip’s  into  Trade-for-Trade  segment,  both 
legs  of  the  transaction  i.e.  purchase  and 
sale  has  to  be  settled  separately  on  a  gross 
basis. This leads to reduction in the amount 
of speculation as only those who can deliver 
the securities can enter into sale transactions 
and  thereby  day  trading  is  reduced.  Also, 
the  volatility  in  prices  was  decreased  due 
to reduction of the applicable circuit filters 
i.e. 10 percent, 5 percent, and 2 percent. NSE 
reduced  circuit  filter  in  510  instances  and 
BSE  in  1,744  instances.  Further,  NSE  and 
BSE verified 73 and 82 rumours respectively 
(Table 3.18).

Annual Report 2010-11

in  securities  market,  SEBI  issued  circular 
inter-alia  stipulating  that  the  securities  of 
companies  would  be  traded  in  the  normal 
segment  of  the  exchange  if  and  only  if,  the 
company has achieved at least 50 percent of 
non-promoters  holding 
in  dematerialized 
form by October 31, 2010. Also, norms were 
specified which would govern cases of merger, 
demerger,  amalgamation,  capital  reduction/
consolidation, scheme of arrangement, etc. 

ii.  A  mechanism  has  been  put  in  place 
whereby  in  case  of  significant  price/volume 
variation  being  witnessed  in  the  trading  of 
shares of the company, the exchanges would 
seek comments of the company in this regard, 
and  also  the  company’s  confirmation  that 
it has made all required disclosures. Further, 
stock 
the 
exchanges  would  publicly 
disseminate 
comments/clarifications 
the

Integrated Market Surveillance System

 
During  the  year,  the  Integrated  Market 
Surveillance  System 
(IMSS)  continued to 
provide  assistance  to  SEBI  in  monitoring 
the market and in discharging its regulatory 
functions effectively. The system is being used 
for detecting aberrations, analyzing them and 
identifying the cases for investigation and for 
taking  further  action,  wherever  warranted. 
The  purpose  of  this  exercise is  to  promote

The  first  phase  of  the  project  was 
launched on February 11, 2011 by making few 
reports available to the users. Over next one 
year, the Data Warehousing platform will also 
host pattern recognition algorithms that will 
monitor the trade and order data received by 
SEBI,  in  order  to  identify  networked  clients 
who possibly collectively indulge in violations 
of  securities  laws.  Several  other  pattern 
recognition modules would be implemented 
to  address  detection  of  crimes  like  insider 
trading, front running etc.

VI.  Data  Warehousing 

and  Business 

Intelligence System

 
The  objective  of  Data  Warehousing 
and  Business  Intelligence  System  (DWBIS) 
is  to  significantly  enhance  the  capability  of 
the  investigation  and  surveillance  functions 
of  SEBI.  The  Data  Warehousing  tool  will 
allow  SEBI  to  exploit  the  power  of  modern 
technology in terms of computation and speed 
of  data  analysis.  To  meet  the  said  objective, 
SEBI has signed a contract for DWBIS project 
with  TATA  Consultancy  Services  Limited 
(TCS),  as  the  system  integrator.  The  chosen 
platform for data warehouse is of Netezza (an 
IBM  Company),  Business  Intelligence  tool  is 
from  SAP  Business  Objects  and Analytics  is 
from  SAS.  The  solution  includes  developing 
processes for data acquisition and collection, 
data  mining,  analysis,  modeling,  business 
intelligence and predictive modeling.
 
is planned in three phases:

Annual Report 2010-11

Box 3.1: Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence System

 
A  data  warehouse  is  a  structured  extensible  environment  designed  for  the  analysis  of  non-volatile  data, 
logically and physically transformed from multiple source applications to align with regulatory structure, updated 
and maintained for a long time period, expressed in simple business terms, and summarized for quick analysis. Data 
warehousing involves the entire information delivery process – from access and transformation of data that resides 
in diﬀ erent operational stores, through the organization process that makes the data available for decision making, 
to surfacing the data for exploitation via a range of decision support tools. The data warehousing process begins 
with operational data sources and ends with decision support applications and reports. William Inmon coined the 
term “data warehouse” in 1990 and deﬁ ned it as a managed database in which the data is subject oriented.
 
NYSE  Euronext Inc.,  the  operator  of  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  Euronext  and  several  other  stock 
exchanges, has adopted data warehousing systems to accelerate its analysis of internal business and performance 
data. Similarly, NASDAQ has also deployed data warehousing system to store, manage and analyze terabytes of 
critical transaction data generated by billions of daily trades at its U.S. markets.
 
As organisations are becoming more competitive in their respective marketplaces, products and services are 
geĴ ing  commoditized  with  liĴ le  diﬀ erentiation.  Hence  these  are  organisations  are  looking  at  warehousing  and 
business intelligence to uncover paĴ erns, behavior and trends pertaining to their brands, products and customers. 
Business  intelligence  provides  them  beĴ er  information  that  enables  diﬀ erentiation  through  innovative  product 
oﬀ erings, beĴ er customer segmentation and service delivery. Secondly, multinationals using data warehousing and 
business intelligence in developed economies are bringing these capabilities to their local operations in India. Indian 
companies are also adapting and evolving BI capabilities to deliver a stronger value proposition and grow their 
businesses.
 
In a 1958 article, IBM researcher Hans Peter Luhn coined the term “Business Intelligence” for the ﬁ rst time. 
He deﬁ ned business intelligence as: “the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way 
as to guide action towards a desired goal.” This is a very general deﬁ nition and does not provide for necessity of 
using computers for business intelligence. However, as the volume of data grows, it makes sense for an organisation 
to use computer-aided tools like data warehousing systems to store, analyse and retrieve data eﬃ  ciently.
 
  Standardisation  and  Benchmarking  –  DWBIS  can  be  used  to  create  a  hierarchy  of performance  metrics, 
standardisation  and benchmarking  informs  business  leaders  about  the  progress  of  organisation  towards 
business goals.

Key applications of DWBIS: It can be used for following purposes:

  Analytics – DWBIS provides strong analytical capabilities to for a business to arrive at optimal decisions. 
  Reporting/Enterprise Reporting – DWBIS builds an infrastructure for strategic reporting to serve the strategic 
management of a business. It frequently involves Data visualization, Executive Information System, OLAP 
etc.

  Integrated platform – DWBIS provides an integrated platform that collects data from diﬀ erent areas (both 
inside and outside the organisation). It enables to work together through data sharing and electronic data 
interchange.

  Knowledge Management – DWBIS enables an organisation to make its decisions based on analysis of data. 
The process of storing such decisions, strategies and practices to identify, create, represent, distribute, and 
enable  adoption  of  insights  and  experiences  is  known  as  known  as  knowledge  management.  Knowledge 
Management leads to beĴ er learning and eﬃ  cient regulatory compliance.
 
Over the last few years, the Indian stock markets have grown at an exponential rate driven by strong macro 
fundamentals and positive investor sentiments. The markets have recently witnessed a deluge in terms of the number 
of daily transactions which necessitated the move to augment the current Integrated Market Surveillance System 
in SEBI with a more robust, intelligent and multidimensional platform to equip the surveillance, investigation and 
research teams with the analyzing capabilities that they would require to monitor an increasingly complex network 
of market entities. The proposed system will involve extensive usage of the latest data warehousing and business 
intelligence technologies to support a far wider range of capabilities including historical data analysis, transaction-
based reporting, trading paĴ ern recognition and fraud detection.

VII. Enforcement Actions
 
During  2010-11,  SEBI  passed  many 
orders  in  its  enforcement  capacity.  Some  of 
the important orders are given below:

findings 

i)  Orders
a)  Order in the matter of Mr.Sanjay Dangi
 
SEBI  had  received  a  reference  from 
Income  Tax  Department,  containing 
certain 
the  matter  of 
M/s.  Murli  Industries  Limited.  A  plain 
reading  of  the  certified  true  copy  of 
documents,  which  IT  Department  had 
found during their survey at the offices 
of  the  company,  prima  facie  indicated 
a  well  laid  down  strategy  planned  by 
promoters  of  the  company  who  had 
floated  10  dummy  entities,  who  along 
with  Mr.Sanjay  Dangi  manipulated  the 
share  price  of  the  company  before  the 
issuance of the FCCBs.
This led SEBI to search for and examine 
similar patterns in the trading and price-
volume of scrips of other companies that 
had  issued  FCCBs  or  in  which  Dangi 
Group  had  been  found  to  have  traded 
regularly,  or  both.  SEBI  also  analyzed 
the demat transaction statements of few 
of  the  entities  belonging  to  the  Dangi 
Group.  It  was  revealed  that  the  Dangi 
Group was actively trading in the shares 
of  many  companies  where  there  was 
capital  raising  through  FCCB 
issue, 
ADR/GDR  issue,  QIB/QIP  placement, 
preferential allotment or loans or pledge/
revocation of pledge of promoter shares.
Examination  revealed 
the 
aforesaid  entities  and 
the  persons

the shares of Spectacle Infotek Limited 
(earlier  known  as  Spectacle  Industries 
Limited),  Goldstone  Technologies 
Limited, 
Investments 
Limited, LGS Global Limited and Well 
Pack Papers & Containers Limited
Pursuant to the detection of a huge rise 
in the traded volumes and/or price of the 
shares  of  Spectacle  Industries  Limited 
Infotek 
(now  known  as  Spectacle 
Limited), 
Technologies 
Limited, Gemstone Investments Limited, 
LGS Global Limited and Well Pack Papers 
&  Containers  Limited  during  the  years 
2008,  2009  and  2010,  the  SEBI  initiated 
an investigation into the dealings in the 
scrips.  SEBI  also  received  complaints 
from investors about unusual activities by 
certain named persons in the scrips. The 
trading  patterns  in  the  scrips  were  also 
analyzed by the Bombay Stock Exchange 
Limited. The preliminary observations of 
the aforesaid investigation had revealed 
the following.

Goldstone 

    Pattern  of  trading  and  dealing  in 
the  select  scrip  indicated  that  the 
Pabari-Parikh group (43 entities) was 
responsible  for  creating  substantial 
volumes,  which  appeared  to  be

the  shares  of  Spectacle, 
Goldstone,  LGS  and  Gemstone.  The 
Pabari-Parikh  group  has  also  been 
active  as  a  dominant  partner  while 
dealing  in  the  shares  of  Gemstone 
and  a  support  to  the  Walmiki-Shah 
group  (196  entities)  in  the  shares  of 
Well Pack. 

    Further,  the  fact  that  there  are 
several  entities  common  to  both 
the  Pabari-Parikh  group  and  the 
Walmiki-Shah  group  indicates  the 
nexus  and  the  close 
interaction 
between the two groups. It has also 
been observed that they have made 
significant contributions to price rise 
and creation of volumes. The entities 
are connected (through Mr. Bhavesh 
Pabari)  to  a  director  (Mr.  Narendra 
Ganatra)  of  at  least  two  scrips  viz. 
Gemstone  and  Spectacle, 
there 
is  a  distinct  possibility  that  these 
entities could be connected with the 
promoters of other companies.

sold them in the market after listing and 
made huge ill-gotten gains.

In  addition,  few  entities  identified  as 
depository  participant 
(DP),  prima 
facie appeared to have grossly failed in 
adhering to the Know Your Client norms 
laid down by SEBI and thereby facilitated 
opening of demat accounts in fictitious/
benami  names  and  cornering  the  retail 
portion of IPO shares.

SEBI  passed  an  ad-interim  ex-parte 
order  dated  April  27,  2006  under 
Sections 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, 
which  was  also  the  show  cause  notice, 
directing  the  entities  who  acted  as  key 
operator  or  financier,  not  to  buy,  sell 
or  deal  in  securities  market,  including 
IPOs,  directly  or  indirectly,  till  further 
directions.  Also,  few  DPs  who  failed 
to  adhere  due  diligence  were  directed 
not  to  open  fresh  demat  accounts  till 
further directions.

During  the  period  of  2010-2011  final/
consent orders have been passed against 
those entities that were identified as key 
operator/financier/DPs 
in  above  said

Money 

Laundering 

is 

iii.  Prevention of Money Laundering
 
globally 
recognized as one of the largest threats posed 
to the financial system of a country. The fight 
against  terrorist  financing  is  another  such 
emerging  threat  with  grave  consequences 
for both the political and economic standing 
of  a  jurisdiction.  Rapid  developments  and 
greater  integration  of  the  financial  markets 
together  with  improvements  in  technology 
and  communication  channels  continue  to 
pose  serious  challenges  to  the  authorities, 
and  institutions  dealing  with  anti  money 
laundering  and  combating 
financing  of 
terrorism (AML and CFT).
The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering 
 
Act  ,  2002  (PMLA)  and  Rules  framed  there 
under brought into force with effect from July 
01,  2005  has  been  a  significant  step  towards 
India  joining  the  global  war  against  money 
laundering and financing of terrorism.
 
In  2010-11,  SEBI  continued  its  focused 
efforts  to  bolster  the  regulatory  framework 
and  minimize  the  risk  emanating  from 
money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing. 
In  pursuance  of  these  efforts,  SEBI  issued 
two  circulars  containing  key  obligations 
required 
securities 
market  intermediaries  on  areas  relating  to 
AML and CFT. 
 
In  the  first  circular  issued  on  June  14, 
2010  following  membership  to  the  FATF, 
SEBI sought to plug the identified gaps in the 
AML  regulatory  framework  and  ensure  that 
the  market  was  more  attuned  to  combating 
money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing. 
Following  this,  on  December  31,  2010,  SEBI 
issued  a  Master  Circular  consolidating  the 
requirements  and  obligations  pertaining 
to  the  area  of  AML  and  CFT.  The  Master 
Circular  replaced  the  Master  Circular  SEBI 
has issued in the preceding financial year. In 
the  same  manner  as  the  preceding  circular, 

fulfilled  by 

to  be 

the current Master Circular contains specific 
provisions  to  give  effect  to  the  relevant  49 
recommendations of the Financial Action Task 
Force  (FATF)  and  incorporated  the  various 
changes in law reflected through the issuance 
of other SEBI circulars as well as amendments 
to  the  PMLA  Act,  and  Rules  there  under. 
Thus,  the  Master  Circular  serves  as  a  single 
reference  point,  containing  legislative  and 
regulatory obligations to be fulfilled by market 
intermediaries.

organized 

 
SEBI  has  consistently  in  coordination 
with  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit-India 
(FIU-IND) 
and  participated 
in  meetings  with 
the  stock  exchanges, 
depositories  and  depository  participants, 
stock  brokers  and  mutual  funds,  registrars 
and  transfer  agents  etc  wherein  further 
guidance  to  different  intermediaries  was 
provided for enhancing their compliance with 
the legislative requirements. Officers of SEBI 
also participated in seminars and workshops 
organized jointly by stock exchanges (NSE and 
BSE) and the depositories (NSDL and CDSL) 
for  enhancing  the  compliance  standards  by 
stock  brokers  and  depository  participants. 
Of note, is a workshop conducted jointly by 
the  Australian  FIU  and  FIU-IND  that  was 
attended  by  SEBI  and  intermediaries  of  the 
securities market where efforts were made to 
identify typologies that would help regulators 
and  intermediaries  to  better  identify  and 
capture  situations  of  money  laundering  and 
terrorist financing.

INVESTIGATION
5. 
 
Timely completion of investigation cases 
and  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive 
action  in  case  of  violations  of  established 
securities laws is important for protection of 
investor’s  interest,  ensuring  fair,  transparent 
and  orderly  functioning  of  the  market.  It  is 

104

integrity  of 

Keeping 

of 

non-compliance 

also  vital  for  improving  the  confidence  in 
the 
the  securities  market. 
Importance  of  effective  and  credible  use  of 
investigation  has  also  been  underscored  by 
IOSCO in its “Principles for the Enforcement 
of Securities Regulation”. 
 
the  above  objectives  and 
principles  of  securities  regulations  in  view, 
SEBI initiates investigation to examine alleged 
or suspected violations of laws and obligations 
relating  to  securities  market.  The  possible 
violations  may  include  price  manipulation, 
creation  of  artificial  market,  insider  trading, 
capital  issue  related  irregularities,  takeover 
related  violations,  manipulation  of  financial 
results, 
disclosure 
requirements and any other misconduct in the 
securities markets. 
Initiation of Investigation
I. 
 
There are various sources of information 
for  initiation  of  investigation.  SEBI  initiates 
investigation  based  on  reference  received 
from sources such as stock exchanges, internal 
surveillance  department,  reference  received 
from 
other  Government  Departments, 
information submitted by market participants 
and  complainants.  In  appropriate  cases, 
investigation  may  also  be  initiated  suo  moto, 
where there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that  investors’  interests  are  being  adversely 
affected or there is a suspected violation of the 
provisions of the securities laws. 
II.  Process of Investigation
The steps involved during investigation 
 
process  include  an  analysis  of  market  data 
(order  and  trade  log,  transaction  statements 
etc.)  and  static  data  (KYC  documents,  bank 
records, financial results, events around major 
corporate developments, etc.) The purpose of 
such investigation is to gather evidence and to 
identify persons/ entities behind irregularities 
and violations so that appropriate and suitable 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

regulatory  action  can  be  taken,  wherever 
required.  Outcome  of  investigation  in  the 
form of enforcement action is a clear signal to 
the market players to comply with the law and 
expected standards of conduct in the market. 

III.  Trends in Investigation Cases
Since  1992-93,  SEBI  has  undertaken 
 
investigation  cases.  In  1,346  cases 
1,463 
investigations  have  been  completed.  Apart 
important 
from  enforcement  action,  an 
attendant  benefits 
from  such 
investigations  is  contribution  to  the  policy 
changes with a view to further strengthen the 
regulatory  and  enforcement  environment. 
During 2010-11, 104 new cases were taken up 
for investigation and 82 cases were completed 
(Table 3.19 and Chart 3.3).

of 

Investigation 

Cases 

Taken Up 
 
During the year 2010-11, about 54 percent 
of the cases taken up for investigation pertain 
to market manipulation and price rigging, as 
against about 62 percent of such cases in the 
previous year. Other cases pertain to insider 
trading,  takeover  violations,  irregularities  in 
capital issues, and other irregularities. Since, 
several  investigation  cases  involve  multiple 
allegations  of  violations,  strict  classification 
under  specific  category  becomes  difficult. 
Such cases are classified on the basis of main 
charge / violations.

ii.   Nature 

of 

Investigation 

Cases 

Completed

 
About 62 percent of the cases completed 
in both current as well as previous year were 
pertaining to market manipulation and price 
rigging including front-running. Other cases 
in which investigation was completed pertain 
to capital issue related manipulation, insider 
trading, takeovers etc.

 
The  details  of  investigation  cases  taken 
up and completed are provided in Table 3.20,

further  penal  action  is  initiated  as  per  the 
recommendations  made  in  the  investigation

authority.  Action 
is  decided  based  on 
the  principles  of  objectivity,  consistency,

agencies.  As  a  matter  of  policy,  SEBI  has 
continued to lay greater emphasis on issuance 
of prohibitive directions under Section 11 of 
the SEBI Act, 1992. These directions have the 
strong  and  salutary  effect  of  deterrence  as 
well as an effective tool to deal with emergent

V.  Follow up of Investigations
 
After  completion  of  investigation,  the 
Investigation  Department  is  also  actively 
involved  in  post-investigation  enforcement 
actions  and  quasi-judicial  proceedings. 
Such  actions  include  issuing  show  cause 
notices 
their 
replies,  organizing  and  participating  in  the 
hearings of the entities before the Whole Time 
Members  of  SEBI, 
coordination  with 
Enforcement  Department  (EFD),  preparing 
draft orders, issuing press releases after orders 
are  passed,  attending  briefings  of  advocates 
and replying to their queries, coordination with 
Enforcement Department in the proceedings 
before Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and 
before courts, coordination with Prosecution 
Department  for  cases  filed  in  the  courts, 
follow up for collection of penalty after orders 
passed  by  Adjudicating  Officers,  initiating 
prosecution  for  non-payment  of  penalties, 
processing  of  consent  proposals  filed  by 
the  entities,  etc.  Timely  and  qualitative 
completion of such actions is also important 
for  ensuring  the  effectiveness  of  regulatory 
measures taken by SEBI.

VI.  Inputs to the Policy Formulation
Investigation is not only an enforcement 
 
mechanism  but  also  an 
important  tool 
to  provide  inputs  for  policy  formulation 
so  that  actual/potential  issues  of  concern 
observed  during  the  investigation  process 
may  be  addressed  through  effective  policy 
intervention.  For  example,  during  the  year 
2010-11,  SEBI  decided  to  recommend  to  the 
Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs  to  suitably 
amend  Clause  166  of  the  Companies  Bill, 
2009  to  disallow  interested  shareholders 
from  voting  on  the  special  resolution  of 
the  prescribed  related  party  transaction. 
This  was  intended  to  protect  small  and 
diversified shareholders in listed companies 

109

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

from abusive related party transactions. The 
view  was  taken  based  on  the  learning  from 
the  investigation  in  the  matter  of  Satyam 
Computer Services Limited. Apart from this, 
various policy inputs were given to different 
departments  with  a  view  to  calibrate  policy 
changes accordingly.

6.  ENFORCEMENT OF 

REGULATIONS 
 
Effective  enforcement  in  the  form  of 
effective follow ups and disciplinary actions 
makes a regulatory system effective. 
I. 
Enforcement Mechanisms
 
There are five enforcement mechanisms 
that  SEBI  uses  in  case  of  any  violation(s) 
pertaining to the laws regulating the securities 
market.  Age-wise  analysis  of  enforcement 
action details viz. actions u/s 11, 11B and 11D of 
SEBI Act, Enquiry Proceedings, Adjudication 
Proceedings,  Prosecution  Proceedings  and 
Summary Proceedings as on March 31, 2011 
are provided in Tables 3.22a to Table 3.22e.
a.  Section 11/11B Proceedings
 

Under section 11/11B of SEBI Act, 1992, 
SEBI may issue directions or prohibitive 
orders such as debarment from accessing 
the  securities  market  or  not  to  deal 
in securities. 
In  the  year  2010-11,  320  cases  under 
section 11/11B were disposed by SEBI. In 
the  same  financial  year,  346  fresh  cases 
under  the  captioned  provisions  of  law 
were initiated by SEBI.
b.  Enquiry Proceedings
 

 

registration  of  an 

SEBI may suspend or cancel the certificate

investors in 2009-10.
iii.  Show Cause Notices
During 2010-11, two show-cause notices were

for violation of advertisement code.
iv.  SEBI Orders
 
During  the  period,  one  mutual  fund 
was directed by SEBI to strictly comply with 
law governing their conduct and business of 
mutual fund in securities market as they had 
contravened  the  provisions  of  SEBI  (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations, 1996. 
IV.   Regulatory  Actions 

SEBI 
(Substantial Acquisition of Shares and 
Takeovers) Regulations, 1997
 
During  2010-11,  17  cases  were  referred 
for adjudication under Section 15 of the SEBI 
Act, 1992 for alleged violation of the provisions 
of  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares 
and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 and a sum 
of  `  44,80,585  was  recovered  as  monetary 
penalty.
V.   Regulatory Actions against FIIs
 
took  action 
against  two  FIIs  i.e.  Barclays  Bank  PLC  and 
Societe  Generale  for  their  failure  to  adhere 
to various reporting requirements under the 
Participatory Note (PN) regime.  
a.  Barclays Bank PLC
 
the  Offshore  Derivative 
Instruments (ODI) Reports submitted during 
the period January 2006 and January 2008 by 
Barclays  Bank  PLC,  it  was  observed  that  it 
had  issued  ODIs  to  UBS  AG,  with  Reliance 
Communications  Limited  (‘RCom’)  as  the 
underlying.  When  SEBI  sought 
further 
information,  Barclays  submitted  that  upon 

During  2010-11,  SEBI 

Based  on 

review,  the  counterparty  of  the  transactions 
was not UBS AG as earlier reported by it but 
was  Hythe  Securities  Limited  (‘Hythe’),  an 
entirely new entity which did not form part 
of  any  of  the  submissions  previously  made 
by  Barclays  to  SEBI.  From  the  information 
submitted  by  Barclays,  it  was  observed  that 
the  ODIs  which  were  issued  by  it  to  Hythe 
Securities Limited (originally stated to be issued 
to  UBS AG)  were  onward  issued  to  another 
entity Pluri Emerging Companies PCC Cell E 
Emerging  Markets  Growth  Fund.  However, 
from the ODI monthly reports submitted by 
Barclays,  it  was  observed  that  there  was  no 
mention of any back to back issuance of the 
ODI to any other entity. Barclays stated that 
the  error  in  the  reporting  had  occurred  due 
to manual compilation of the ODI reports in 
December 2006 and error in data entry level 
and that after improvements in its systems for 
ODI reporting in 2008 and 2009, the errors in 
reporting continued to be carried forward in 
the new system. Barclays had not only failed 
to  provide  true,  fair  and  complete  details  of 
the  ODI  activity  undertaken  by  it  but  also 
prima  facie  violated  the  provisions  of  FII 
Regulations by furnishing false and incorrect 
information to SEBI. Full and fair disclosure 
forms  the  cornerstone  of  FII  regulation  by 
SEBI.  As  the  source  of  funds  available  with 
an FII comes from offshore, by its very nature 
SEBI  has  no  direct  access  to  verifying  the 
nature  of  the  funds.  In  other  words,  SEBI 
places almost absolute faith and unqualified 
reliance on the ability of an FII to carry out the 
basic regulatory and prudential oversight.
 
SEBI  as  a  regulator  requires  fair,  true 
and  correct  information  for  assessing  and 
monitoring FII activity in the securities market. 
When a registration is granted to an FII, SEBI 
presupposes  that  the  FII  has  the  capacity  to 
exercise the necessary oversight and ensure the 
integrity and accuracy of the data it provides 

114

to  SEBI  under  the  regulations  applicable. 
Given  that  Barclays  had  provided  incorrect 
reporting  Barclays  has  been  non-compliant 
with  the  provisions  of  the  FII  regulations 
Accordingly,  SEBI  directed  vide  order  dated 
December 09, 2009 Barclays Bank, PLC under 
Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, not to 
issue/ subscribe or otherwise transact in any 
fresh/new Offshore Derivative Instrument till 
such time as Barclays satisfies SEBI that it has 
put adequate systems, processes and controls 
in place to ensure true and correct reporting 
of its ODI transactions to SEBI. 
The  auditor,  appointed  by  Barclays 
 
pursuant to the Order, has in its final report 
certified that the information provided in the 
reports of Barclays to SEBI during the review 
period is accurately extracted from the source 
systems of Barclays in all material respects. It 
also certified that the said reports accurately 
reflect all outstanding positions of the ODIs. 
In view of the same, vide SEBI Order dated 
August 30, 2010, the directions of the earlier 
order were disposed off.
b.  Societe Generale
 
From  the  reports  submitted  by  Societe 
Generale, during the period January 2006 and 
January  2008,  it  was  observed  that  Societe 
Generale  had  issued  certain  ODIs/PNs  to 
Hythe  Securities  Limited  (‘Hythe’),  with 
Reliance  Communications  Limited  as  the 
underlying. While providing details of all the 
ODIs/PNs  entered  into  with  Hythe,  Societe 
Generale  acknowledged  that  there  had  been 
errors in its reporting to SEBI of transactions 
with Hythe. Subsequently, it was also observed 
that those ODIs/PNs had been onward issued, 
and  that  Hythe  is  not  the  end  beneficiary. 
Societe  Generale  failed  to  adhere  to  ‘Know 
Your Client’ norms as it had little or no relevant 
knowledge of the ultimate beneficiary of the 
ODIs issued by it. Societe Generale failed to 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

provide true, fair and complete details of the 
ODIs/P-Notes  activity  undertaken  by  it  and 
also prima facie violated the provisions of FII 
Regulations by furnishing false and incorrect 
information  to  SEBI.  Vide  an  order  under 
section  11(1),  11(4)  and  11B  of  the  SEBI Act, 
1992,  dated  January  16,  2010,  SEBI  directed 
Societe  Generale,  a  registered  FII,  not  to 
issue, subscribe or otherwise transact in any 
new ODIs or P-Notes in India till such time 
it provides a true and correct reporting of its 
ODI and P-Notes transactions to SEBI.
 
In view of the submissions of SG and its 
undertaking that it has reviewed and rectified 
its systems and processes for ensuring correct 
reporting of its ODI activity to SEBI and also 
the fact that SG had not transacted in any fresh 
ODIs as directed in the Order, it was decided 
that the ex-parte directions issued against SG 
were revoked vide order dated December 30, 
2010.

i.  Trends 

in  Redressal  of 

Investor 

Grievances

 
SEBI has been taking various measures to 
expedite the redressal of investor grievances. 
The grievances lodged by investors are taken 
up  with  the  respective  listed  company  and 
are continuously monitored. The company is 
required  to  respond  in  prescribed  format  in 
the form of Action Taken Report (ATR). Upon 
the receipt of ATR, the status of grievances is 
updated. Where the response of the company 
is insufficient / inadequate, follow up action 
is  initiated.  Grievances  pertaining  to  stock 
brokers  and  depository  participants  are 
taken up with concerned stock exchange and 
depository for redressal and monitored by the 
concerned department through periodic report 
obtained from them. Grievances pertaining to 
other intermediaries are taken up with them 
directly  for  redressal  and  are  continuously 
monitored  by  concerned  Department  of 
SEBI.  SEBI  takes  appropriate  enforcement 
actions  (adjudication,  direction,  prosecution 
etc)  as  provided  under  the 
law  where 
progress  in  redressal  of  investor  grievances 
is not satisfactory. The following paragraphs 
highlight  SEBI’s  performance  and  measures 
taken  in  the  year  2010-11  for  expediting  the 
redressal of investor grievances.

iii.   Issuance  of  No  objection  Certificate 

(NOC) 

a)  Revocation of Suspension of Trading at 

Stock Exchanges:

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

 
It was observed that the shares of certain 
suspended companies, who failed to redress 
investor grievances pending with SEBI, were 
subsequently  allowed  to  trade  at  BSE  and 
NSE. BSE and NSE were advised during the 
year to obtain no objection certificate (NOC) 
from  SEBI,  informing  that  the  company  has 
no  complaints  pending  with  SEBI,  before 
revoking the suspension of trading. 
 
During the year, NOC’s were issued to 158 
companies who have resolved all the pending 
grievances  before  revocation  of  suspension 
and in case of 29 companies, NOCs were not 
issued for commencement of trading in their 
shares,  as  grievances  against  them  are  still 
pending. 
b)  NOC  for  Release  of  One  percent 

Security Deposit
Companies 

raising  capital 

 
through 
public  issue  of  securities  are  required  to 
deposit  one  percent  of  the  issue  amount 
with  the  designated  stock  exchange.  This 
deposit is released by the stock exchange only 
after SEBI issues a ‘No Objection Certificate’ 
(NOC). SEBI issues NOC to companies after 
satisfactory  redressal  of  complaints  received 
by SEBI against the company.
 
During  the  year  2010-11,  NOCs  were 
issued  to  62  applicant  companies.  NOCs 
to  53  companies  were  not  issued  or  due 
to  unsatisfactory 
investor 
grievances.

Companies 
 
A  sub-committee  was  constituted  to 
expedite the redressal of investor grievances 
against suspended companies who were active 
in their business and filing their returns with 
Registrar  of  Companies  to  avoid  declaring 
them as vanishing companies and subsequent 
regulatory actions. After several deliberations, 

123

suggest appropriate course of action by stock 
exchanges.  After  detailed  deliberation,  the 
committee recommended the following. 
a) 
to start with, NSE and BSE may initiate 
action  by  issuing  of  notice  for  appropriate 
action  in  respect  of  60  and  365  active 
companies listed on NSE and BSE who have 
failed to comply with the listing agreement as 
on September 30, 2010. 
b) 
amended to provide for the following:
• 

the  listing  agreement  may  be  suitably 

in 

The  companies 
their  quarterly 
submissions  to  exchanges  shall  furnish 
the  name  of  promoters,  directors  and 
compliance  officer  alongwith 
their 
addresses,  PAN  and  DIN.  This  would 
enable exchanges to disclose the people 
behind  the  companies  responsible  for 
non-compliance  as  well  as  for  taking 
appropriate penal action against them. 
The  listing  agreement  shall  specifically 
provide  the  details  of  actions,  that  the 
exchanges  and  SEBI  can  take  for  non-
compliance  with  the  listing  agreement 
by a listed company.
Every  listed  company  shall  submit  a 
quarterly  report  to  its  Board  detailing 
the compliance with the various clauses 
of the listing agreement and this will also 
form part of the secretarial audit of the 
company.

as recommended by the said sub-committee, 
BSE and NSE have validated pending investor 
grievances  against  the  above  suspended 
companies  and  submitted  their  report,  after 
issuing notices to the companies, to SEBI.
 
Based  on  the  reports  submitted  by  BSE

2.  SIGNIFICANT COURT 

PRONOUNCEMENTS

I. 

i. 

Supreme Court 

SEBI  vs.  M/s.  S.Kumars  Nationwide 
Ltd. and Anr. (Civil Appeal No. 2049 of 
2010, date of order: 26/11/2010)

 
S. Kumars Nationwide, a company listed 
on the BSE, had filed an application before it 
seeking an in-principle approval for the issue, 
allotment and listing of preferential shares to 
its  promoters,  necessitated  on  account  of  a 
restructuring package for repayment of a loan 
amount  of  `  850  crore.  On  being  denied  by 
BSE, the company appealed to the SAT under 
section  22A  (1)  of  the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation)  Act,  1956.  The  BSE  in  refusing 
permission has stated that the Issue violated 
Guideline  13.3.1(f) 
(dealing  with  which 
persons  a  company  can  make  a  preferential 
issue of equity shares to). The SAT highlighted 
Guideline 17.2A.1, which allows the Board to 
grant an exemption from one of the provisions 
of the Guidelines, ‘on being satisfied that the 
violation  was  caused  or  may  be  caused  due 
to factors beyond the control of the applicant’. 
Based  on  its  finding  that  the  company  was 
in  breach  of  Guideline  13.3.1(f)  for  ‘no  fault 
of  its  own’,  the  SAT  exercised  this  power  of 
the  SEBI  and  directed  the  BSE  to  grant  the 

SEBI 

that 

contended 

approval.  SEBI  had  filed  the  instant  Appeal 
before the Supreme Court with the question 
of law involved being whether the SAT could 
grant exemption under Clause 17.2.A.1 of the 
DIP Guidelines, 2000 (since replaced with the 
ICDR Regulations). 
 
the  powers 
conferred  on  SEBI  by  Clause  17.2.A.1  of  the 
DIP  Guidelines  cannot  be  directly  exercised 
by the SAT since these powers are conferred 
only upon the Board, more so when there was 
no  order  passed  by  SEBI  itself.  SEBI  further 
submitted  that  the  impugned  order  of  SAT 
insofar  as  it  pertains  to  the  exercise  of  the 
aforesaid  powers  amounted  to  passing  an 
order on an issue not agitated before the SAT 
and  further  is  an  exercise  of  jurisdiction  not 
vested  in  the  SAT  and  needs  to  be  set  aside 
to this extent. The SC upheld the contention 
made by SEBI. 

II.  High Court 

i.  M/s.  Rose  Valley  Real  Estate  & 
Constructions  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI 
(Writ 
Petition  No.  45  of  2010,  date  of  order: 
23/03/2011 )-before the Hon’ble Kolkata 
High Court 

 
The  petitioner  M/s.  Rose  Valley  had 
challenged  SEBI’s  order  dated  January  3, 
2011. SEBI found that the petitioner company 
was  running  collective  investment  schemes 
without obtaining registration from the SEBI 
Board.  Accordingly,  by  an  interim  direction 
dated  January  3,  2011,  SEBI  directed  the 
petitioner  company  (a)  not  to  collect  any 
money  from  investors;  (b)  not  to  dispose  of 
any  of  the  properties  or  delineate  assets  of 
the scheme; (c) not to divert any fund raised 
from public at large kept in bank account and/
or at the custody of the company, giving the 
company an opportunity to file its objections 
including  opportunity  of  personal  hearing, 

134

if  any,  within  15  days  from  the  date  of  the 
order. 

 
The  petitioner  raised  the  contention 
that  since  the  company  is  neither  a  listed 
company  nor  has  applied  for  listing,  SEBI 
has  no  jurisdiction  to  make  enquiries  and 
pass of the impugned order and also alleged 
violation  of  the  principles  of  natural  justice. 
It was argued on behalf of the SEBI that writ 
jurisdiction of Hon’ble High Court cannot be 
invoked since alternate remedy was available 
to the petitioner i.e. to challenge the said order 
before SAT. 

 
Rejecting the contentions of the petitioner, 
the Hon’ble High Court held that there is no 
extraordinary situation to exercise the power 
under  article  226  in  the  interest  of  justice  or 
for  preventing  a  miscarriage  of  justice  and 
that  the  petitioners  were  entitled  to  appeal 
to  the  tribunal  that  has  been  functioning 
and is competent to decide all the questions 
including the questions of jurisdiction of the 
SEBI  to  pass  the  order  and  violation  of  the 
principles of natural justice. 

(Note: the above order has been challenged by 
the petitioner before Division Bench of Hon’ble 
Kolkata High Court which is pending).

5249  &  5256  of  2010  –  date  of  order: 
13/08/2010) - before the Hon’ble Bombay 
High Court
 
The writ petitions were filed for quashing 
the proceeding pending before the SEBI under 
section 11B of SEBI Act against the petitioners 
(firm of Chartered Accountants) in connection 
with  the  audit  performed  by  them  of  the 
company  M/s.  Satyam  Computers  Services 
Ltd. It was contended by the petitioners that 
there is inherent lack of jurisdiction on the part 

135

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

of the SEBI to initiate any proceedings or call 
for any information from the petitioners who 
are discharging their duty as professionals and 
if there is any omission or neglect on the part 
of any of the petitioners or for that purpose by 
any  Chartered Accountants  in  the  matter  of 
discharging their professional duties, it is only 
the  institute  who  has  the  power  to  regulate 
this profession of the Chartered Accountants 
under  the  Chartered  Accountants  Act,  1949 
(hereinafter referred to as the “CA Act”) and 
SEBI  has  no  jurisdiction  to  issue  the  show 
cause notice and inquire into or adjudicate the 
alleged violations against the petitioners. 

The question raised in these petitions was 
 
as to whether the SEBI has power to issue show 
cause notice to the Chartered Accountants in 
connection  with  the  work  which  they  have 
undertaken for a listed company in the matter 
of maintaining accounts and balance-sheets.

The  Hon’ble  High  Court  held  that 
 
considering  the  judgments  and  the  scheme 
of the Act, the SEBI in the instant case, on the 
basis  of  show  cause  notice,  has  jurisdiction 
to  inquire  into  and  investigate  the  matter  in 
connection with manipulating and fabricating 
the  books  of  accounts  and  balance-sheets  of 
the  company.  The  powers  of  the  SEBI  are, 
therefore, independent and it cannot be said 
that  it  encroached  upon  the  powers  of  the 
institute  under  the  CA Act.  The  question  of 
jurisdictional  fact  depends  upon  the  facts 
which may be available at the time of evidence 
before the SEBI. SEBI will have to answer the 
question as to whether on the basis of evidence 
on record, it has any power to give directions 
as provided under the SEBI Act. This aspect 
will  depend  upon  the  evidence  which  may 
be  available  at  the  time  of  inquiry. All  these 
aspects are therefore left to the consideration 
of SEBI at the time of passing final order in the 
inquiry.

iii.  In the matter of M/s. Bank of Rajasthan 
and  M/s.  Jayabharat  Textiles  and  Real 
Estates Ltd. (21 Batch appeals) – before 
the High court of Rajasthan
SEBI passed two ad interim orders dated 
 
March 8, 2010 in the matter of M/s. Bank of 
Rajasthan Ltd. and March 12, 2010 in the matter 
of M/s. Jayabharathi Textiles and Real Estates 
Ltd. debarring certain entities from accessing, 
buying or selling or otherwise dealing in the 
securities market till further orders. 
 
Aggrieved  by  the  said  orders,  two 
batches  of  writ  petitions  were  filed  before 
the  Rajasthan  High  court.  The  petitioners 
challenged 
the  constitutional  validity  of 
sections 11B and 11(4) of SEBI Act, 1992. The 
Hon’ble High court of Rajasthan disposed of 
the writ petitions vide its common order dated 
October 29, 2010 holding that sections 11B and 
11(4)  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  are  constitutionally 
valid  and  further  held  that  whether  in  the 
facts and circumstances of the case, the said 
sections are applicable to the petitioners can 
be raised before SEBI and SEBI can decide the 
same.
III.  Securities Appellate Tribunal
i.  Mr.  Jalaj  Batra  vs.  SEBI-  (Appeal  No. 

184 of 2010, date of order : 06/12/2010 ) 
 
The  appeal  was  preferred  against  the 
order  dated  July  30,  2010  passed  by  the 
Adjudicating  Officer  imposing  a  penalty  of 
`  5,00,000/-  on  the  appellant  for  violation  of 
Section 11C (2) of the SEBI Act, 1992 for non-
compliance  of  summons  dated  November 
29, 2006. The contention of the appellant was 
that he did not receive the summons, was not 
accepted by SAT. It was seen from the material 
available on record that in another proceeding 
before  SEBI,  the  counsel  for  the  appellant 
had  inspected  few  documents  including  the 
summons dated November 29, 2006. For three 
years, the appellant did not inform SEBI if they 

136

had received the summons. The Hon’ble SAT 
dismissed the appeal and upheld the penalty 
of ` 5,00,000/. 
 
SAT also observed that the Adjudicating 
Officer  has  been  more  than  lenient  while 
imposing  the  monetary  penalty.  In  this  case 
SAT  has  felt  that  a  monetary  penalty  of  ` 
5,00,000  would  not  be  deterrent  for  others. 
SAT  has  expected  that  adjudication  officers 
would  in  future  take  note  of  amended 
provisions regarding imposition of monetary 
penalties and impose such amounts which are 
commensurate with gravity of the default and 
which also serves as a deterrent.

(Appeal No. 114 of 2007)
  M/s. Goldcrest Capitals Market Ltd vs. 
SEBI (Appeal No. 113 of 2007) and,
  M/s.  Pals  Overseas  Pvt  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI 
(Appeal No. 115 of 2007)
 
The  impugned  orders  in  the  captioned 
appeals were passed on July 31, 2007 by SEBI 
suspending  the  certificate  of  registration  of 
the appellants as brokers for a period of two 
months  for  the  violation  of  Regulation  4  of 
PFUTP  Regulations,  1995  and  the  Code  of 
Conduct under the Stock Broker Regulations. 
The  Hon’ble  SAT  upheld  the  WTM  orders 
and  dismissed  the  captioned  appeals  vide 
common  order  dated  December  27,  2010. 
Thereafter  the  appellants  filed  an  appeal 
against  the  order  of  SAT  which  was  duly 
dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order 
dated February 11, 2011.
 
The appellants as brokers had executed 
trades  on  behalf  of  their  clients  who  were 
related  to  each  other  and  also  related  to 
the  company,  M/s.  Roofit  Industries  Ltd., 

and  influenced  the  price  of  the  scrip  and 
created  volumes  by  executing  matched 
trades.  SAT  examined  the  impugned  trades 
and  also  statements  made  by  the  director 
of  the  appellant  and  noted  that  the  director 
was  aware  of  the  relationship  between  the 
brokers  and  the  company.  SAT  held  that 
“this fact by itself may not be enough to hold 
the  appellant  guilty  but  coupled  with  other 
circumstances of the case, we agree with the 
Whole  Time  Member.”  SAT  also  noted  that 
the  present  case  was  one  of  matched  trades 
where  the  brokers  have  pleaded  ignorance 
of the counter party since the trading system 
maintains complete anonymity. On this, SAT 
held that “in such a situation one has to look 
at the trading pattern and if the trades match 
too  often  or  if  the  matching  of  the  trades  is 
noticed  day  after  day  and  trade  after  trade, 
one  can  infer  that  the  matching  was  not 
done by the system but by manipulating the 
same...Normally,  no  direct  evidence  would 
be available to find out whether a broker was 
aware of the matching trades. The intention 
of the parties will have to be gathered from 
the surrounding circumstances looking at the 
trading pattern….”On detailed consideration 
of the conduct of the appellants in executing 
the impugned trades, SAT upheld the order 
of the WTM.

iii.  M/s.  Alstom  Sextant  5  vs.  SEBI 
(Appeal No. 172 of 2010, date of order: 
29/10/2010)
The instant Appeal involved the indirect 
 
acquisition of Areva T & D India Ltd (Target 
Company), a listed company in India through 
the global acquisition in France of the Parent 
Company  i.e.  T  &  D  Holding  SA  and  its  2 
subsidiaries, who collectively were promoters 
of  the  Target  Company.  The  acquisition  was 
being  made  by  the  Appellant.  Areva  SA 
which  was  selling  its  stake  in  the  Parent 

137

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

Company  had  conducted  a  competitive 
bidding  process  for  the  same  and  after  an 
invitation  of  bids,  Areva  SA  through  press 
releases  dated  November  30,  2009,  decided 
to  enter  into  exclusive  negotiations  with 
the Appellant.  On  January  20,  2010,  a  Share 
Purchase  Agreement  was  executed  between 
the  Appellant  and  Areva  SA.  A  public 
announcement  for  acquisition  of  the  Target 
Company was made by the Appellant on May 
28, 2010. 
 
Accordingly, the short question involved 
before SAT was the calculation of Offer Price 
[under  Regulation  20(4)  read  with  20(12) 
of  Takeover  Regulation]  for  the  indirect 
acquisition.  SAT  in  its  observations  had 
concluded  that  the  reference  date  for  Offer 
Price should be taken only when there exists 
an agreement to acquire the Parent Company 
on  that  date  and  not  whether  there  was  an 
intention  to  try  and  reach  an  agreement  in 
that regard. 
iv.  Dr.  Arvind  Kumar  Shah  vs.  SEBI 
(Appeal No. 107 of 2010, date of order: 
19/11/2010) 
 
The  Appellants  had  sought  exemption 
under Regulation 3(1)(l) read with Regulation 
4(2) of the Takeover Regulations in respect of 
their  proposed  acquisition  of  equity  shares 
by way of preferential allotment made by the 
target  company  i.e.  Arvind  Remedies  Ltd, 
since  the  said  acquisition  had  attracted  the 
provisions of Regulations 10 and 11(1) of the 
Takeover  Regulation.  It  was  the  case  of  the 
Appellants  that  the  preferential  allotment 
was  being  made  to  raise  capital  for  the 
expansion of the Target Company’s business 
and that since the allotment would not result 
in  change  of  control  or  management  of  the 
Target Company, exemption may be granted. 
The  SEBI  Takeover  panel  while  considering 
the exemption application had recommended 

Annual Report 2010-11

exemption  to  the  Appellants.  However,  the 
Whole  Time  Member  of  the  Board  by  his 
detailed  order  of  April  26,  2010  declined 
exemption  to  the  Appellants  inter  alia  on 
the  ground  that  the Appellants  should  have 
made  a  Rights  Issue  instead  of  Preferential 
Allotment  and  that  the  shareholders  of  the 
Target Company should have been provided 
with an exit route by requiring the Appellants 
to make a public offer. 

 
In  its  Order  dated  November  19,  2010, 
the SAT had set aside the impugned order of 
SEBI  dated  April  26,  2010  and  had  granted 
exemption to the appellants from complying 
with  the  provisions  of  Regulations  10  and 
11(1)  of  the  Takeover  Regulations  on  the 
ground that if the funds are required to meet 
the expansion activities of a Company and the 
objective of acquisition of shares is to provide 
financial assistance then the exemption under 
Regulation  3(l)  of  the  takeover  Regulation 
should  be  granted.  SEBI  has  preferred  an 
Appeal before the Supreme Court against the 
aforesaid SAT Order.

v.  M/s.  Kaynet  Finance  Ltd  vs.  SEBI 
(Appeal  No.  136  of  2010,  date  of 
order:13/12/2010) 
  
Prior to the filing of the instant Appeal, 
the Appellant (Broker) had preferred Appeal 
No.  94  of  2009  wherein  it  had  challenged 
a  communication  dated  May  22,  2009 
received  from  NSE  in  which  a  direction 
had  been  issued  to  the Appellant  to  resolve 
the  complaint  filed  by  Respondent  3  i.e.  M 
Sundararaman, regarding the transfer of 1100 
shares of VSNL to the complainant alongwith 
corporate  benefits  accruing  thereon.  In  the 
said  Appeal,  the  SAT  had  disposed  of  the 
matter by directing NSE to pass a fresh order 
after  affording  an  opportunity  of  hearing  to 
the parties concerned. NSE had subsequently 

SAT  while  upholding 

communicated its order through letters dated 
April  20,  2010  and  May  5  2010  wherein  the 
Appellant was directed to return 1100 shares 
of VSNL to Respondent 3 and an amount of ` 
582780 was blocked from the deposits made 
by  the  Appellant  on  account  of  failure  to 
return the said shares of VSNL. The Appellant 
through  the  instant  Appeal  had  challenged 
the aforesaid two letters of NSE. 
 
the  Orders 
communicated  through  the  aforesaid  NSE 
letters,  had  considered  two  SEBI  Circulars 
i.e. Circular dated November 18, 1993 (which 
pertained 
transactions 
between  clients  and  brokers/clients  and 
members) and Circular dated August 27, 2003 
(Mode of payment and delivery for securities 
transactions)  and  had  observed  that  latter 
SEBI  circular  laid  down  the  procedure  for 
the transfer of securities between clients and 
brokers  and  being  procedural,  shall  operate 
retrospectively  since  the  earlier  guidelines 
issued  in  the  year  1993  (Circular  dated 
November 18, 1993) could not lay down the 
procedure for the demat mode as that mode 
came into existence much later.

vi.  M/s.  Bhushan  Energy  Ltd.  &  Ors  vs. 
SEBI and BNS Tour & Travel Pvt. Ltd. 
vs. SEBI & Ors.(Appeal No.65 & 66 of 
2010, date of order: 28/12/2010)

 
The appeals were filed against the order 
of  Adjudicating  Officer  dated  January  18, 
2010 wherein a penalty of ` 4,50,000/-(Rupees 
Four lakh fifty thousand only) was imposed 
on the M/s. Bhushan Energy Ltd. & Ors. (M/s. 
Bhushan group) and M/s. BNS Tour & Travels 
Pvt. Ltd. (M/s. BNS) for violating the provisions 
of  Regulation  10  of  Takeover  Regulations. 
On January 29, 2009 the M/s. Bhushan group 
excluding M/s. BNS Tour & Travels Pvt. Ltd. 
(BNS)  was  holding  14.85  percent  and  M/s. 

138

BNS, a private limited company, was holding 
2.56 percent shares of the M/s. Orissa Sponge 
Iron and Steel Limited (the target company). 
It  was  held  by  the Adjudicating  Officer  that 
on  January  29,  2009  M/s.  BNS  was  part  of 
the M/s. Bhushan group and their combined 
shareholding  crossed  the  threshold  limit  (15 
percent) prescribed by Regulation 10. Whereas 
the contention of the appellants was that M/s. 
BNS  was  a  part  of  M/s.  Bhushan  Group  till 
October 6, 2008 and thereafter its shares were 
sold  to  M/s.  Jain  group  pursuant  to  Share 
Purchase Agreement  (SPA)  entered  between 
them on October 4, 2008. Therefore, the shares 
of the target company held by M/s. BNS ought 
not  to  be  clubbed  with  the  shareholding  of 
M/s.  Bhushan  group  subsequent  to  October 
6,  2008.  However,  the  Adjudicating  Officer 
rejected  the  said  contention  of  the  appellant 
on the ground that the transaction of sale of 
all the shares of M/s. BNS was complete only 
on  February  28,  2009  as  the  consideration 
for  transfer  of  shares  of  M/s.  BNS  was  paid 
by  M/s.  Jain  group  to  M/s.  Bhushan  group 
on February 27 and February 28, 2009 which 
date is subsequent to the trigger date (January 
29, 2009). Therefore, the Adjudicating Officer 
held that M/s. Bhuhsan group along with M/s. 
BNS had triggered Regulation 10 on January 
29, 2009.

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

 
The  Hon’ble  SAT  allowed  the  appeals 
and held that M/s. BNS ceased to be part of 
M/s. Bhushan group with effect from October 
6, 2008 and could not be said to be acting in 
concert  with  the  appellants  on  January  29, 
2009  and  shares  of  the  target  company  held 
by M/s. BNS could not be clubbed with those 
of the appellants (M/s. Bhuhsan group). The 
tribunal  held  that  the  SPA  dated  October 
4,  2008  entered  into  between  M/s.  Bhushan 
group  and  M/s.  Jain  group,  makes  it  clear 
that  the  parties  intended  that  the  property 
in  shares  would  get  transferred  on  date  of 
execution of the agreement and that payment 
shall be made by the purchasers to the sellers 
on  or  before  February  28,  2009.  Shares  of 
limited  companies  are  ‘goods’  within  the 
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and 
Section 19 of this Act stipulates that property 
in the goods is transferred to the buyer at such 
time as the parties to the contract intend it to 
be  transferred  and  Section  20  makes  it  clear 
that in a contract for the sale of specific goods 
in  a  deliverable  state,  the  property  in  the 
goods passes to the buyer when the contract 
is made and it is immaterial whether the time 
of payment of the price or the time of delivery 
of the goods or both is postponed.

international coordination of regulators with 
responsibility 
implementing  national 
legislation on derivatives. The Task Force has

came  into  force  in  the  year  2005.  The  Office 
of  Central  Public  Information  Officer  is 
processing  applications  received  under  the 
Right  to  Information  Act,  2005  from  SEBI 
Head  Office,  Mumbai. Applications  are  also 
received at the four regional offices where the 
Central Assistant Public Information Officers 
forward  the  application  to  the  Head  Office 
for  processing.  SEBI  Appellate  Authority 
has  also  been  designated  for  the  purpose  of 
first  appeals  under  the  Act.  In  accordance 
with the directions received from the Central 
Information  Commission,  SEBI  has  also 
designated the Transparency Officer.

disclosable  information  on  SEBI  website.  In 
order  to  ensure  greater  transparency  in  the 
working  of  listed  companies,  the  companies

SEBI 

are required to maintain their website and to 
disseminate disclosable information.
 
Since  the  implementation  of  the  Right 
to  Information  Act,  2005,  SEBI  has  received 
3,742 applications till March 31, 2011. During 
the financial year 4,093 issues were raised by 
various such applicants. 
 
The  number  of  applications  received 
under  the  Right  to  Information  Act,  2005 
increased  slightly  this  year  as  compared  to 
2009-10 (Table 5.6). The applications received 
pertained to various aspects of the functioning 
of SEBI and queries related to mutual funds, 
investor grievances, investigation, policies and

Regarding 

in  83  percent  of  the 

 
the 
applications and the providing of information 
relating  to  items  raised,  Board  provided 
information 
items 
pertaining  to  the  applications  received  in 
the year 2010-11 and only 17 per cent of the 
remaining items were rejected under various 
exemption sections of the RTI Act, 2005. Only in 
case of 3.5 percent of the applications, appeals 
were preferred before the Central Information 
Commission.  Out  of  this  3.5  percent  placed 
before  the  Central  Information  Commission 
in only 0.7 per cent of cases certain directions 
were  issued  by  the  Commission  to  furnish 
part  of  information.  So  in  2.8  percent  of  the 
cases  information  provided  by  the  Board 
was  found  to  be  satisfactory  or  exempted 
from  being  furnished  as  per  the  relevant 
exemption  sections.  Hence,  in  99  percent  of 
the cases the Board has furnished disclosable 
information. The Board has been transparent 
in its functioning. No penalties were imposed 
by  the  Central  Information  Commission  on 
the Board or any of its employees under the 
Act. 

 
A  comprehensive  training  program  for 
the  officers  of  the  Board  was  also  initiated 
by  the  office  of  Central  Public  Information 
Officer. Till date 90 officers have been trained 
on various aspects of the Right to Information 
Act, 2005.

 
In  the  year,  the  Board  took  various 
other  initiatives  to  maintain  transparency 
in  its  functions  including  disclosure  of  most 
of  the  information  on  a  regular  basis.  The 
implementation  of  the  Right  to  Information 
Act, 2005 in the Board has contributed towards 
attaining  the  Board’s  objective  of  protection 
and  education  of  the  investors  of  securities 
market.

information pertaining to their structure.
In view of the above, all applications submiĴ ed for registration w.e.f April

Protected Cell Company (PCC) & Multi Class Share Vehicle (MCV) on the

discontinuation of EDIFAR to all the listed companies.
Earlier, it used to take on an average around 22 days to list the securities 
aĞ er an IPO/FPO closes. This exposes investors as well as issuing companies 
to market risk as well as leading to infrastructural stress and costs. In view 
of the same, it has been decided to reduce the time between issue closure 
and listing to 12 working days.
It was decided to put in place a framework for seĴ ing up of new exchange 
or  separate  platform  of  existing  stock  exchange  having  nationwide 
terminals for SME. In order to operationalise the said framework, necessary 
changes have been made to applicable regulations, circulars etc. As per the
