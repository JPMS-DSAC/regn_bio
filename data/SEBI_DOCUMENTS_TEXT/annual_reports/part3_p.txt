Annual Report 2006-07
PART  THREE:  REGULATION  OF  SECURITIES  MARKET

This part of the Report delineates the functions of SEBI as specified in

Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992

1.

PRIMARY  SECURITIES  MARKET

Market  intermediaries  play  a  very
important role in development of the market
by providing a variety of services. Market
intermediaries can be classified on the basis of
the services provided by them. Typically, they
are classified as: merchant bankers, stock
brokers, bankers to issues, debenture trustees,
portfolio managers, DPs, registrars to issues,
share transfer agents, etc. These entities are
regulated by SEBI.

During  2006-07, 

the  number  of
intermediaries  belonging  to  the  group  of
merchant  bankers,  portfolio  managers,  and
DPs  increased  over  the  previous  year. As  on
March  31,  2007,  the  number  of  portfolio
managers  was  158  as  against  132  in  the
previous  year  indicating  an  increase  of  19.7
per  cent.  The  number  of  merchant  bankers
increased  to  152  as  on  March  31,  2007  as
against 130 in the previous year, showing an
increase of 16.9 per cent. The number of DPs
also increased from 526 to 593, amounting to
an increase of 12.7 per cent.

The number of registrar to an issue and

Table  3.1:  Registered  Intermediaries

share  transfer  agents,  debenture  trustees,
bankers  to  an  issue  and  underwriters,
declined  in  2006-07  over  the  previous  year.
The  decline  was  noticeable  in  the  case  of
bankers  to  an  issue  and  underwriters
(Table  3.1).

2.

SECONDARY  SECURITIES
MARKET

Similar  to  increase  in  activities  in  the
primary  market  there  was  an  increase  in  the
secondary  market  activities.

I. Registration of Stock Brokers

During  2006-07,  263  new  stock  brokers
were  registered  with  SEBI  (Table  3.2).  There
were 155 cases of reconciliation/ cancellation/
surrender  of  membership  during  2006-07
which  was  lower  than  that,  in  the  previous
year. As on March 31, 2007, the total number
of  stock  brokers  registered  with  SEBI  was
9,443  as  against  9,335  in  the  previous  year,
showing a net increase of 108.

The share of corporate brokers was 43.52
per  cent  of  the  total  stock  brokers  as  on

Brokers  can  also  be  categorised  as:
proprietary, partnership, corporate, institution,
composite corporate, etc. Since, the number of
broking entities registered under categories of
institution  and  composite  corporate  was
negligible during the recent years; therefore,
these categories are clubbed together under
corporate brokers. Table 3.4  and Chart 3.1
provide details of the exchange-wise stock
brokers on the basis of ownership.

In  17  out  of  22  recognised  stock

exchanges  (barring  Ahmedabad,  BSE,  Delhi,
NSE,  and  OTCEI),  as  a  proportion  of  total
number  of  members,  the  number  of  stock
brokers  under  ‘proprietorship’  was  50  per
cent  or  above.  The  percentage  of  stock
brokers  in  ‘proprietorship’  category  was  the
highest  in  Gauhati  Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  at
96.2  per  cent,  followed  by  95.1  per  cent  in
Jaipur  Stock  Exchange.  However,  stock
brokers  in  ‘proprietorship’  category  were  the
lowest  for  NSE  at  4.5  per  cent  of  the  total
stock brokers (Chart 3.2).

Act.  Out  of  the  22  stock  exchanges,  eight
stock  exchanges  have  been  granted
permanent recognition. During 2006-07, SEBI
granted yearly renewal to 10 stock exchanges.
Details of the renewal of recognition granted
to  the  stock  exchanges  are  provided  in  Table
3.6 and Table 3.7.

In  case  of  two  stock  exchanges,  renewal
of  recognition  was  not  granted  due  to
following  reasons:

i.

Coimbatore  Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  (CSX)
did  not  file  application  for  renewal  of
recognition which expired on September
17, 2006, due to pending litigation before
the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at
Madras.  However,  in  terms  of  order
dated September 15, 2006 of the Hon’ble
Court,  the  right  of  CSX  to  apply  for

ii.

renewal  is  subject  to  further  orders  of
the  court,  and  the  stock  exchange  is  not
entitled to oppose the renewal solely on
the ground of lapse of time.

SEBI  served  a  show  cause  notice  dated
November  30,  2006  on  the  Council  of
Management of Magadh Stock Exchange
Ltd.  (MSEL)  asking  why  its  application
for  grant/renewal  of  recognition  should
not  be  rejected,  and  why  SEBI  should
not refuse to grant/renew the recognition
to MSEL under Section 4 of SC(R) Act.

IX. Registration of Venture Capital

Funds
It is generally agreed that venture capital
funds play an important role in development
of  entrepreneurship  and  help  in  the
technological  progress  of  an  economy.  These
funds provide the capital required for various
industries  being  set  up  by  new  generation
entrepreneurs  who  have  limited  access  to
conventional  sources  of  finance.  Venture
Capital  Industry  has  made  considerable
progress  during  the  last  five  years.  The
number  of  domestic  venture  capital  funds
increased  to  90  during  2006-07,  from  80  in
2005-06.  However,  the  number  of  foreign
venture  capital  funds  doubled  to  78  in  2006-
07 from 39 in 2005-06 (Table 3.10).

SUPERVISION

through 

initiation 

Implementation  of  the  Regulations
entails  a  multi-stage  process  of  supervision
through  on-site  and  off-site  inspections,
enforcement 
of
adjudication,  enquiry  against  violations  of
rules  and  regulations,  and  prosecutions.
Inspections of intermediaries were carried out
directly  by  SEBI  or  by  stock  exchanges,
depositories,  etc.  SEBI  conducted  inspections
on  a  periodic  basis  to  verify  the  compliance
levels  of  intermediaries.  It  also  conducted
specific/  limited  purpose  inspections  on  the
basis  of  complaints,  references,  surveillance
reports,  specific  concerns  etc.  SEBI  also
directed  stock  exchanges  and  depositories  to
carry  out  periodic/specific  purpose
inspections  of  their  members/participants.

I.

Inspection of Market
Intermediaries

According  to  the  revised  inspection
policy,  approved  by  the  SEBI  Board,  SEBI
conducts  risk-based  inspection.  It  does  not
normally conduct routine inspections of stock

inspections  are  left  to  the  stock  exchanges
and  depositories  concerned,  which  is  in  line
with international practices. SEBI oversees the
quality  of  such  inspections  by  calling  for
periodic  reports  on  inspections  conducted,
violations  observed,  and  actions  taken  to
check  whether  the  quality,  content,  and
coverage of inspections are adequate.

i.

Inspection of Stock Brokers / Sub-

SURVEILLANCE

I. Mechanism of Market Surveillance

SEBI  monitored  market  movements,
analysed  trading  pattern  in  stocks  and
indices,  and  initiated  appropriate  action,  as
necessary,  in  conjunction  with  the  stock
exchanges and the depositories. Towards this
end, SEBI also took into account any unusual
or  suspicious  market  movements,  formal  or
informal 
information  from  the  stock
exchanges  and  the  depositories,  specific
complaints from any entities / persons, etc.

The  stock  exchanges  played  prime  role
in  detection  of  market  manipulation,  price
rigging,  and  other  regulatory  breaches
regarding stock market functioning. SEBI also
kept  constant  vigil  on  the  activities  of  the
stock  exchanges  to  facilitate  effective
surveillance  systems.

II. Surveillance  Actions

During  2006-07,  SEBI  made  44  and  95
references  for  examination/  investigation  to
NSE  and  BSE,  respectively.  NSE  completed
examination/  investigation  in  44  cases  and
BSE  completed  examination/investigation  in
112  cases  (82  cases  +  30  cases  of  last  year)
during  2006-07.

84

NSE shifted 247 stocks to trade-for-trade
segment  and  BSE  shifted  a  total  of  1,463
scrips to trade-for-trade segment. During the
year,  a  price  band  (2  per  cent  or  5  per  cent
or 10 per cent) was imposed by NSE in 2,174
instances  and  by  BSE  in  1,323  instances,  as  a
surveillance  measure.  During  the  same
period,  247  and  304  instances  of  rumours
were  verified  by  NSE  and  BSE,  respectively.
Details  of  the  surveillance  actions  taken
during 2006-07 are given in Table 3.13.

III. Surveillance  Measures

Several  preventive  and  proactive
measures  were  taken  by  SEBI  during
2006-07  for  enhancing  market  safety  and
integrity.  The  surveillance  measures  taken
during  the  year  included:  shifting  of  stocks
to  trade-for–trade  segment,  reduction  of
circuit  filter  etc.  SEBI  suo  moto  took  the
following measures to protect the interests of
investors and to safeguard market integrity.

i.

Internet  Surveillance

noticed 

that 

It  was 

various
recommendations  were  being  offered  by
analysts  on  the  internet/websites.  SEBI
advised  the  stock  exchanges  -  as  a  measure
to  enhance  investor  awareness  -  to  issue

respect 

caution  with 

advertisements  advising  the  investors  to
exercise 
to
recommendations  offered  by  analysts  on
websites.  Special  focus  was  on  those  stocks
whose  market  price  did  not  seem  justified
based  on  fundamentals  of  the  company.
Accordingly,  investors  were  alerted  to  take
informed  decision  while  investing  in  these
stocks. SEBI also advised the stock exchanges
to keep a track of recommendations made by
analysts on the websites.

ii. Relaxation of Circuit Filter

Circuit  filter  was  relaxed  by  the  stock
exchanges  in  certain  stocks  either  due  to
corporate  action  or  due  to  resumption  of
trading (in illiquid stocks). This relaxation of
price band often gave rise to volatility on the
first  day  of  trading.  To  address  this  issue,
SEBI  advised  the  stock  exchanges  to  impose
a  price  band  of  20  per  cent  in  such  cases  on
experimental  basis,  basing  final  view  on
determination  of  base  price.  Further,  a  draft
policy  for  calculation  of  base  price  for
imposition of price band was put up on SEBI
website  for  public  comments.  The  policy
envisages  fixation  of  the  base  price  based  on
recommendations  made  by  a  merchant
banker  duly  appointed  by  the  company  and
imposition  of  price  band  around  that  base
price.

iii. Surveillance to be Carried Out by the

Depositories

a) As  a  follow  up  action  of  SEBI
investigation  in  the  matter  of  misuse  of
IPO allotment in retail categories, it was
felt  that  the  depositories  should  also
carry out surveillance activities. As such,
a  group,  comprising  representatives
from  SEBI,  NSDL,  and  CDSL  was
formed  to  identify  the  areas  for
surveillance  activities  to  be  carried  out
by  the  depositories.  Based  on  the
recommendations  of  the  group,  SEBI

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

b)

decided  that  the  depositories  should
have  (i)  their  own  surveillance  system,
(ii)  alerts  generation  capability,  and  (iii)
a set up for demonstrative action.

In the past SEBI had raised concern over
the  possibility  of  multiple  demat  of
shares  in  the  existing  system  with  the
same  distinctive  numbers.  SEBI  advised
depositories  to  put  a  system  in  place  to
identify the status of the shares that are
being dematted/rematted at their end, at
the entry level itself, that is, depositories
should be able to identify whether given
distinctive  number(s)  were  dematted
earlier or not.

iv. Consolidation of Stock Exchange

Investigation  Reports

With  a  view  to  reduce  delay  in
information  processing  and  minimising
duplication  of  the  efforts  made  by  SEBI  and
the  stock  exchanges  during  the  investigation
process,  SEBI  advised  the  exchanges  (NSE
and  BSE)  to  share  information/findings  with
each other and give a consolidated report. In
order  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  reports
by making them focused in terms of findings,
both  the  stock  exchanges  were  advised  to  be
in  a  position  to  come  to  prima-facie
conclusions  about  violations,  if  any,  and  to
give  specific  findings  for  future  course  of
action,  while  preparing  their  investigation
reports.

v. Display of Shareholding Pattern on

the Website of Stock Exchanges

a)

take  place, 

SEBI  noted  the  fact  that  though  several
off-market  deals 
the
information relating to such deals is not
reflected  in  the  shareholding  pattern
which  is  often  not  disseminated  on  a
quarterly  basis.  SEBI,  therefore,  advised
the  stock  exchanges  to  display  the
shareholding  pattern  on  their  websites
on a monthly basis.

85

Annual Report 2006-07

b)

SEBI  also  observed  that  there  was  no
effective  mechanism  to  verify  the
authenticity  of  the  information  posted
by the company/registrar with regard to
the shareholding pattern and quantity of
shares in demat and physical form. This
non-availability of information may give
rise to misuse by the company/registrar.
Thus,  to  eliminate  the  scope  for  any
misuse and to bring transparency in the
disclosures,  SEBI  advised 
stock
exchanges  (i)  to  modify  the  format  for
display  of  shareholding  pattern  by  the
company/registrar,  (ii)  to  include  the
details  of  holding  by  the  shareholders
(both  in  physical  and  demat  form),  and
(iii)  to  direct  the  company/register  to
provide  the  information,  such  as:  total
issued  capital,  total  listed  capital,  total
shares  in  physical  form,  total  shares  in
demat form with depositories, etc.

vi.

Increased Vigilance on Realty Stocks

any 

SEBI  observed  that  some  of  the  realty
stocks  were  showing  sharp  increase  in  price/
volume  bereft  of 
substantial
fundamentals.  SEBI  advised  the  stock
exchanges  to  examine  the  issue  and  to
enhance  vigilance  on  such  stocks.  SEBI  also
conducted  independent  inquiry  on  some
realty  stocks.  It  was  observed  that  certain
entities  were  subscribing  to  a  very  large
amount  of  the  shares  (in  some  cases,
subscription  was  almost  equal  to  the  entire
issue  size)  and  there  seemed  to  be
recirculation  of  funds  among  the  entities.
SEBI  referred  the  matter  to  Income  Tax
Department  and  other  enforcement  agencies,
for  further  investigation.

IV. Enforcement

Based  on  surveillance  inputs,  SEBI
initiated  expeditious  enforcement  action  and
passed  interim  ex  parte  orders  in  the
following  cases,  while  final  investigation  is
in  process.

i.

SEBI order dated April 27, 2006 on
IPO  Irregularities

SEBI  initiated  probe  and  advised  BSE
and  NSE  to  look  into  the  dealings  in  the
shares, issued through IPOs, before the shares
were  listed  on  the  stock  exchanges.  For  the
purpose of examination, information relating
to off-market transactions was obtained from
the  depositories  and  the  same  was  provided
by  SEBI  to  the  stock  exchanges.  In  October
2005,  the  stock  exchanges  submitted  their
preliminary  observations  on  the  IPO  of  Yes
Bank  Ltd.  (YBL),  which  hinted  at  the
possibility  of 
large  scale  off-market
transactions,  immediately  following  the  date
of allotment and prior to the listing of shares
on the stock exchanges.

SEBI, 

therefore, 

carried  out  a
preliminary scrutiny, by calling for data from
the  depositories  and  the  registrars  to  the
issues.  It  was  found  that  a  large  number  of
multiple  dematerialised  accounts,  with
common  addresses,  were  opened  by  some
entities.  SEBI  acted  against  the  entities  that
were  responsible  for  the  irregularities,  by
passing  interim  order  restraining  them  from
participating  in  all  future  IPOs  and  also
directing the depositories to effectively freeze
their  dematerialised  accounts.

SEBI 

examined 

Thereafter, 

the
irregularities in the IPO of IDFC. It was found
that  the  very  same  players  had  played  a
major  role  in  cornering  the  shares.  Based  on
preliminary  scrutiny,  SEBI  passed  an  interim
order  in  the  case  of  IDFC  on  the  same  lines,
as in the case of Yes Bank Ltd.

Since,  some  of  the  dematerialised
accounts that were used for cornering the IPO
shares  were  opened  during  2003,  SEBI
broadened  its  investigations  to  the  IPOs  that
came during 2003-2005. Based on the findings
of  investigation,  vide  interim  order  dated
April 27, 2006, SEBI directed 24 key operators
and  82  financiers  not  to  buy,  sell  or  deal  in

86

the  securities  market,  including  in  IPOs,
directly  or  indirectly,  till  further  directions.
Besides,  directions  were  also  issued  against
the concerned DPs and the depositories.

ii. Disgorgement of Profits in the Matter

of Misuse of IPO Allotment

SEBI  Regulations  prescribe  a  quota  for
small  investors  wishing  to  invest  in  the
market.  A  small  investor  is  defined  as  one
who  applies  for  shares  worth  Rs. 1,00,000  or
less  (earlier,  the  limit  was  Rs. 50,000).
Typically,  over-subscription  in  the  retail
segment  of  an  IPO  is  substantially  less  than
the  over-  subscription  in  the  non-retail
segment for a few sought after IPOs.

During preliminary scrutiny, SEBI found
that  certain  entities  had  cornered  IPO  shares
reserved  for  retail  applicants  by  making
applications in the retail category through the
medium  of  thousands  of  fictitious/benami
applicants,  with  each  application  being
submitted  for  a  small  value  so  as  to  be
eligible  for  allotment  under  the  retail
category.  Subsequent  to  the  receipt  of  IPO
allotment  these  fictitious/benami  allottees
transferred  shares  to  their  principals,  who  in
turn  transferred  the  shares  to  the  financiers
(either  directly  or  through  a  web  of
transactions),  who  had  originally  made
available  the  funds  for  executing  the  game-
plan.  The  financiers,  in  turn,  sold  most  of
these  shares  on  the  first  day  of  listing,
thereby  realising  a  windfall  gain  equivalent
to the price difference between IPO allotment
price  and  listing  price.  The  gains  made  by
the  financiers  and  key  operators  were  at  the
expense  of  genuine  retail  investors,  who
either  failed  to  get  an  allotment  or  got
allotment of fewer number of shares because
of  the  large  number  of  applications  made  in
the  name  of  fictitious/benami  demat  account
holders.

The entire scheme of cornering the retail
portion  of  IPOs  would  not  have  succeeded

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

without  the  active  role  played  by  the
depositories  and  DPs.  The  depositories  and
DPs  facilitated  the  opening  of  numerous
demat  accounts  in  fictitious/benami  names.
These  accounts  were  subsequently  used  for
making  applications  in  various  IPOs,
receiving  allotment,  and  thereafter  pooling
the  same  in  the  demat  accounts  of  the  key
operators  through  off-market  transfers  prior
to  or  immediately  after  the  listing  and
commencement  of  trading  on  the  stock
exchanges.  SEBI  held  the  Depositories  and
DPs  who  enabled  the  opening  of  numerous
demat  accounts  (afferent  accounts)  in
fictitious/benami  names,  liable  for  the  loss
caused  to  retail  investors.  Accordingly,  SEBI
vide order dated November 21, 2006, directed
the two depositories and eight DPs to jointly
and  severally  disgorge  an  amount  of
Rs. 115.82  crore.

iii. Directions in the Case of Nissan

Copper  Ltd.

SEBI  observed  an  unusual  pattern,  in
terms  of  trading  volume  and  price  rise,  in
many  stocks  on  the  first  day  of  its  listing. A
preliminary  analysis  was  undertaken  of  the
trading  in  the  stocks.  It  was  observed  that
the percentage of price variation between the
issue  price  and  the  close  price  on  the  first
day  of  the  listing  was  highest  in  Nissan
Copper  Ltd.  as  compared  to  16  other  stocks
which were listed after IPOs in the past three
months.  Further,  about  90  per  cent  of  the
issue  size  of  the  company  was  delivered  on
the  day  of  listing.  Some  clients  sold  heavily
on  the  day  of  listing,  though  they  did  not
appear to be in the list of top 100 allottees in
the IPO.

As  such,  the  exchanges  were  advised  to
withhold  the  pay-out  of  securities  and  funds
for  the  trading  carried  out  on  the  first  and
the  second  day  of  listing,  that  is,  December
29, 2006 and January 02, 2007 for a period of
15  days  and  the  trading  in  the  stock  to  be

87

Annual Report 2006-07

shifted  to  trade-for-trade  segment  with
immediate  effect,  till  further  communication.
The  exchanges  accordingly  carried  out  the
above  directions.

c)

The  exchanges  were  also  advised  to
release  the  pay-out  for  the  clients  who  were
original  allottees  under  retail  category  upon
confirmation  of  their  status  as  retail  clients.
The  exchanges  were  asked  to  give  sufficient
time for the funds pay-in of the stock brokers
whose  pay-out  was  affected.  Also,  with
regard  to  the  clients  who  had  sold  on  the
second  day  as  against  the  purchase  position
on the first day of listing, their securities pay-
in  position  was  adjusted  without  releasing
the funds pay-out.

The  preliminary  analysis  of  trading
pattern  in  Nissan  Copper  revealed:  (i)
cornering  of  shares  by  a  group  of  entities,
(ii) entry of one share limit orders of buy and
sell  orders  wherein  most  of  such  orders
translated into trades by stock brokers Matrix
Equitrade  Pvt.  Ltd.,  (iii)  creation  of  artificial
demand by entering very large order quantity
at unrealistic prices by RSS Investments Ltd.,
(iv) involvement of company related entities,
(v)  sales  by  FIIs  of  the  entire  holding  on  the
first  day  of  trading,  and  (vi)  suspicious
activities  of  Ahmedabad  based  Vora  group
of  entities.  In  this  case,  after  preliminary
examination, an interim order was passed on
January 17, 2007, directing:

a)

b)

BSE  and  NSE  to  withhold  the  profits/
gains  of  39  entities,  including  one  FII
and  its  two  sub-accounts,  and  300
entities  of  Bhansali  group,  who  got
allotment  through  multiple  applications
in the IPO of the company;

The  exchanges  to  release  the  funds  and
securities  pay  out  of  December  29,  2006
and  January  02,  2007  immediately,  and
also to ensure withholding of the profit/
gains  of  the  clients  mentioned  in  the
order;

The  stock  brokers  -  Matrix  Equitrade
Pvt.  Ltd.,  RSS  Investments  Ltd.,  Park
Light  Securities  Ltd.,  Dimensional
Securities  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Religare  Securities
Ltd.,  and  H.  Nyalchand  Financial
Services  Ltd.  -  not  to  buy,  sell  or  deal,
directly or indirectly, in the shares of the
company.

Detailed  investigation,  in  this  case,  is  in

progress.

iv. Orders  against  Recommendations
Given  by  Shri  Anirudh  Sethi  and  the
business  name 
‘Stock  Market
Navigator’  (SMN)

Preliminary  examination  carried  out  by
SEBI revealed that Shri Anirudh Sethi and the
business  name  ‘Stock  Market  Navigator ’
(SMN),  disseminated  company  specific
information  through  advertisements  in  print
and  electronic  media.  It  was  found  that  the
company had not sent any notice to the stock
exchanges  as  required  under  Listing
Agreement.  Further,  Shri  Anirudh  Sethi  and
SMN  did  not  confirm  that  they  were
disseminating  information  to  investors.  In
this case, after completion of the preliminary
examination,  the  following  directions  were
passed:

a) Anirudh  Sethi  and  the  business  name
‘Stock Market Navigator’ (SMN) to cease
and  desist  from  giving  investment
advice  to  a  client  including  any
recommendations  containing  company
specific  news.

b) Anirudh  Sethi  and  the  business  name
‘Stock  Market  Navigator’  (SMN)  were
also  directed  to  cease  and  desist  from
acting  as  an  unregistered  portfolio
manager,  until  they  are  registered  with
SEBI.

v. Orders in the Matter of Atlanta Ltd.

SEBI 

conducted 

a  preliminary

88

examination  in  the  matter  of  Atlanta  Ltd.  It
was  prima  facie  found  that  the  company,  its
promoters,  and  the  entities  connected  with
them  have  abused  the  stock  exchange
mechanism,  the  listing  agreement,  and  the
regulations  related  to  preferential  issue  of
securities  to  unfairly  maximize  their  wealth
at  the  cost  of  common  investor.  It  was  also
observed that Manish Marwah/ Dilip Nabera
group  were  prima  facie  known  to  the
company/promoters  and  these  entities  had
cornered a large chunk of shares. In this case,
after  completion  of 
the  preliminary
examination,  the  following  orders  were
passed:

a)

b)

The  promoters  and  entities  connected
with  the  company, 
its  directors,
company secretary of the company were
directed  not  to  buy,  sell  or  deal  in
securities  of  the  company,  directly  or
indirectly,  till  further  directions  in  this
regard.

The  company  was  directed  not  to  issue
any  equity  shares  or  any  other
instruments  convertible  into  equity
shares, in any manner, or not give effect
to  any  alteration  in  its  capital  structure,
in  any  manner,  till  further  directions  in
this  regard.

c) Manish  Marwah  /Dilip  Nabera  and  the
entities  connected  with  them  were
directed  not  to  buy,  sell  or  deal  in
securities  of  M/s.  Atlanta  Ltd.,  directly
or indirectly, till further directions in this
regard.

d)

e)

The  exchanges  were  directed  neither  to
approve  the  listing  of  convertible
warrants  nor  to  list  shares  issued  on
conversion  till  further  directions.

Further,  the  depositories  were  directed
neither  to  de-materialise  the  convertible
warrants  and  shares  issued  upon
conversion  nor  to  give  effect  to  stock

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

split,  till  further  directions.  Also,  the
depositories  were  directed  not  to  give
effect  to  any  transfer  of  shares  of  the
company  lying  in  the  beneficial  owner
accounts  of  the  entities  connected  with
the  company,  its  Directors,  Company
Secretary  of  the  Company,  and  Manish
Marwa / Dilip Nabera.

Detailed  investigation,  in  this  case,  is  in

progress.

V.

Integrated  Market  Surveillance
System  (IMSS)

Effective  surveillance  mechanism  is  one
of  the  primary  requirements  of  a  well
functioning  capital  market.  As  an  integral
part  in  the  regulatory  process,  effective
surveillance  can  help  in  achieving  investor
protection,  market  integrity  and  safety;  thus,
facilitating  overall  securities  market
development. According to IOSCO, “the goal
of  surveillance  is  to  spot  adverse  situations
in  the  markets  and  to  pursue  appropriate
preventive  actions  to  avoid  disruption  to  the
markets” (Report of the Technical Committee
of IOSCO, May 2000)

In  India,  the  stock  exchanges  have  been
entrusted  with  the  primary  responsibility  of
undertaking  market  surveillance.  The
regulatory  oversight,  exercised  by  SEBI,
extends  over  the  stock  exchanges  through
reporting  and  inspections.  In  exceptional
circumstances,  SEBI  also  initiates  special
investigations on the basis of reports received
either  from  the  stock  exchanges  or  on  the
basis  of  specific  complaints  submitted  by
stakeholders.

SEBI  decided  to  put  in  place  a  world-
class  comprehensive  Integrated  Market
Surveillance  System  (IMSS)  across  stock
exchanges (NSE and BSE) and across market
segments  (cash  and  derivative  markets)  to
enhance  efficacy  of  surveillance  function  to
protect  investors’  interests.

89

Annual Report 2006-07

IMSS  was  made  operational  with  effect
from  December  01,  2006.  The  primary  job  of
IMSS is to detect abnormalities, if any, in the
trading  patterns  and  market  behaviour  in  a
timely  manner,  and  to  assist  in  taking
corrective  action.  The  system  is  also  an
effective tool available to SEBI to oversee the
performance  of  stock  exchanges,  so  far  as
surveillance  activities  being  performed  by
them are concerned. This system also helped
in  sharing  significant 
findings  and
observations for taking corrective action.

i.

Analysis  of  Information

The  IMSS  was  put  to  effective  use  in  a
number  of  cases  and  orders  were  passed  by
SEBI, in recent times. The timely action taken
in  such  cases  has  led  to  significant  positive
impact  in  ensuring  orderly  conduct  of  the
market  players  and  improving  market
integrity.  Information  requirement  and
analysis  carried  out  thereafter  also  led  to
significant  improvement  and  upgradation  of
system architecture of stock exchanges, which
are primary source of data for IMSS.

ii.

Issuance of Caution Letters/
Explanation  Seeking  Letters

Since  operationalisation  of  IMSS,  more
than  120  caution  letters/explanation  seeking
letters  were  issued  to  various  market
intermediaries and clients cautioning/ seeking
explanation  about  their  trading  patterns.
These  letters  were  issued  based  on  an
analysis  of  trading  behavior,  as  observed
from  various  functionalities  made  available
by  the  system.  The  proactive  steps  taken  in
this  regard  had  a  salutary  and  significant
impact towards achieving the twin objectives
of ensuring market integrity and professional
conduct.

iii. Sharing of Information with Stock

Exchanges

abnormal behavior patterns were shared with
stock  exchanges  for  appropriate  action.  This
fulfilled  the  regulatory  objective  of  ensuring
that  stock  exchanges  continue  to  act  as  the
first  level  regulator.  This  also  kept  the  stock
exchanges  always  on  alert  to  proactively
detect  and  examine  abnormal  trading
patterns on their own.

It  may,  however,  be  emphasised  that
IMSS is in no way expected to be a substitute
for  regular  and  on-going  surveillance
activities  being  carried  out  by  the  stock
exchanges.  The  primary  responsibility  for
surveillance vests and would continue to vest
with  the  stock  exchanges.  IMSS  is  intended
to  help  SEBI  supplement  surveillance
activities undertaken by the stock exchanges.

VI. RBI-SEBI Joint Group on Integrated

System of Alerts

The  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee
(JPC) on stock market scam and other related
matters had recommended that an integrated
system  of  alerts  should  be  set  up,  which
would  piece  together  disparate  signals  from
different segments of financial market to spot
any unusual activity anywhere in the system
that might have a bearing on integrity of the
stock market. Accordingly, a SEBI-RBI Group
on  integrated  system  of  alerts  was  set  up  to
share information and to recommend suitable
measures, so that co-ordinated action may be
taken. 
the
recommendations  made  by  the  Group,
appropriate  alerts  have  been  identified.  The
alerts,  such  as,  pay-in  alerts  at  the  stock
exchange  level  involving  top  stock  brokers
accounting  for  large  pay-in,  bank  guarantee
details  of  top  25  stock  brokers  (based  on
turnover) as well as information on securities
pledged  by  such  stock  brokers,  are  being
shared.  A  system,  making  use  of  the  same,
was put in place in February 2004.

accordance  with 

In 

A  large  number  of  observations  were
made  and  many  instances  indicating

Further, during 2006-07, it was decided
that in addition to the details of top 25 stock

90

brokers, the bank details of the top 25 non-
institutional trading clients (on net buy basis,
across all securities in cash market, for the pay-
in alert dates) would also be provided to the
RBI. Accordingly, based on the information
available from the stock exchanges, SEBI
furnished relevant alerts to RBI.

In  addition,  SEBI  regularly  kept
informed  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of
India. Apart from these two authorities, SEBI
shared  special  references  and  information
with  other  enforcement  agencies  such  as
Income  Tax  Department,  Enforcement
Directorate, and CBI.

VII. Workshops and Trainings
Conducted by Integrated
Surveillance  Department

program, 

In collaboration with U.S. Securities and
Exchange  Commission  (USSEC),  under  the
USAID-FIRE 
Integrated
Surveillance Department organised/facilitated
several  training  programmes  and  workshops
to  enhance  the  skills  and  efficiencies  of  staff
members  of  SEBI,  stock  exchanges,  and
depositories  in  the  area  of  investigation  and
surveillance.  During  2006-07,  about  120
participants  attended  such  workshops  and
training  programs.

5.

INVESTIGATION

Investigations  are  undertaken 

to
examine  alleged  or  suspected  violations,  to
gather  evidence,  and  to  identify  persons/
entities  behind  irregularities  and  violations,
such  as:  price  manipulation,  creation  of
artificial market, insider trading, public issue
related irregularities, takeover violations, any
other misconduct, etc.

I.

Trends in Investigation Cases

Since 1992-93, SEBI has undertaken 1200
investigation cases. In 938 cases investigations
are completed. The experience gained during

91

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

investigations has contributed significantly to
evolution  of  policies  and  procedures  in
strengthening  regulatory  and  enforcement
environment.  During  2006-07,  127  new  cases
were taken up and 102 cases were completed
(Table 3.14 and Chart 3.3).

investigations.

i. Nature of Investigation Cases

During 2006-07, about 80 per cent of the
cases  taken  up  for  investigation  pertained  to
market  manipulation  and  price  rigging,  as
against about 83 per cent of such cases in the
previous  year.  Other  cases  pertained  to
insider 
takeover  violations,
irregularities  in  public  issues,  and  other
miscellaneous 
trend  of
investigation cases taken up remained almost
the  same  during  the  last  two  years.  Since,
several  investigation  cases  are  taken  up  on

issues.  The

becomes difficult. Such cases are classified on
the basis of main charge/violations.

ii.

Investigation  Cases  Completed

During  2006-07,  out  of  the  cases  in
which investigation was completed, about 75
per  cent  pertained  to  market  manipulation
and  price  rigging.  Other  cases  in  which
investigation  was  completed  pertained  to
insider 
issue  related

trading,  public 

irregularities, takeover violations, misleading
advertisements,  unfair  practices,  etc.  The
break  up  of  cases  in  which  investigations
taken  up  and  completed  during  the  years
2005-06 and 2006-07 is given in Table 3.15.

II. Regulatory  Action

After  completion  of  investigation,
further  action  is  initiated  by  Enforcement
Division  as  per  the  recommendations  of  the
approving authority. The action may include:
issuing  warning  letters,  initiating  enquiry

initiating  adjudication  proceedings  against
levy of monetary penalties, passing directions
under  Section  11  of  SEBI  Act,  and  initiating
prosecution.

Based  on  the  investigation  reports  and
with  a  view  to  enhancing  regulatory
effectiveness,  consistency,  and  uniformity,
prompt  action  was  taken  during  the  year,
against  various  entities.

During  2006-07,  345  prohibitive
directions  were  issued  under  Section  11  of
SEBI  Act  against  various  entities.  A  total  of
52 intermediaries were suspended during the
year as given in Table 3.16.

The  number  of  entities  against  whom
action  was  initiated  during  2006-07  went
down as compared to the previous year. This
decrease  was  mainly  due  to  a  number  of
interim  orders  passed  in  the  previous  year
in  various  cases  to  prevent  malpractices  in
the markets (Chart 3.4).

ENFORCEMENT  OF
REGULATIONS

It  is  well  accepted  that  enforcement
makes  a  regulatory  system  effective.  Active
follow-up of cases of misconduct sends right
signals 
the  market  participants.
Disciplinary  actions  in  the  form  of  justified
penalties are indispensable tools for ensuring
market  integrity.

III. Regulatory Actions Against Stock

Exchanges under Delegated Powers
and Functions
