SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET
 
Price behaviour in the secondary securities markets in 1996-97

The Indian stock markets witnessed high price volatility during 1996-97. The 30 stock Sensitive Index of The Stock Exchange, Mumbai, dropped marginally from 3,366.61 on March 29, 1996 to 3,360.89 on March 31, 1997, a decline of 5.72 points. The broad based BSE 100 index, which represents 100 scrips, decreased from 1,549.25 to 1,463.69, a decline of 85.56 points.
 
The early part of the year witnessed a sustained upward trend in the prices, in tandem with the positive expectations from the Budget of the year 1996-97 and also increased investments by FIIs. The Sensex peaked at 4,069.26 on June 18, 1996 and dropped to 2,745 on December 4, 1996. This was also a three year low of the Sensex. Tight liquidity conditions, high interest rates and poor results of the corporate sector were some of the main reasons of the depressed sentiment in the stock markets.
The markets however, improved after touching the lowest of the year and remained steady till the Budget for 1997-98. The favourable announcements for the capital market in the Budget of 1997-98, boosted market sentiment, and the Sensex again touched an intra-day high level of 4,000. On March 31, 1997, prices fell sharply and the Sensex fell to 3,360.89 (a decline of 302 points) as political developments endangered the implementation of the proposed Budget. Table 7 below gives details of movement in equity prices in 1996-97.
