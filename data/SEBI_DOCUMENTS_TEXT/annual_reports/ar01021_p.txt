PART I   
POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES 
 
This Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) presents a review of 
its policies and programmes, its working and operations during the financial year, 2001-02. The 
Report also gives an account of the operations of the SEBI and describes the manner in which it 
has been discharging its functions and exercising powers in terms of the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India Act, 1992; the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956; the Depositories Act, 
1996; as well as in terms of the delegated powers under the Companies Act, 1956.  The Report 
also provides details of the developments in Indian securities market during 2001-02 and their 
bearing on and relation with the work of the SEBI.  The Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the format prescribed in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Annual Report) Rules, 
1994, notified in the Official Gazette on April 7, 1994. 
 
The SEBI operates within the legal framework of the SEBI Act, 1992.  The statutory objectives 
of the SEBI enshrined in the SEBI Act are fourfold-  
?  Protection of investors interests in securities 
?  Promotion of the development of the securities market 
?  Regulation of the securities market and 
?  Matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. 
 
In keeping with these statutory objectives, the SEBI has set for itself strategic aims for each of 
the  four  key  spheres  which  encompass  SEBI’s  activities  in  relation  to  the  investors,  issuers, 
intermediaries and the regulatory regime.  To the investors, the SEBI strives to assure that their 
rights  are  protected,  they  are  enabled  to  make  informed  choices  and  decisions  and  a  market 
which is fair in the financial dealings. 
 
To the issuers, the SEBI strives to provide a transparent and  efficient market where they are 
enabled to raise resources at low cost, but conduct themselves in accordance with the highest 
standards  of  corporate  governance  and  that  they  are  conscious  of  and  meet  their  regulatory 
obligations. 
 
To the intermediaries, the SEBI strives to render a market in which they can compete freely and 
operate in a manner which gives the investors and market participants the confidence that the 
market is efficient, orderly and fair. In the regulatory regime, the SEBI seeks to ensure that it 
always  remains  appropriate,  proportionate  and  effective  in  which  all  “stakeholders”  have  the 
confidence. 
 
With  these  strategic  aims  in  view  the  SEBI  has  been  constantly  reviewing  and  reapprising  it 
existing  policies  and  programmes  formulating  new  policies  and  regulations  to  nurture  areas 
hitherto unregulated / inadequately regulated and to implement them in a manner to promote the 
growth of the market with transparency, fairness, efficiency and integrity. 
  
 
The major reforms and developments in the securities market during 2001-02 are enumerated in 
Box 1.1.

them  in  taking  well  informed  investment  decision;  the  SEBI  revised  and  simplified  the  present  format  for  un-
audited half-yearly results. The mutual funds were asked to disclose performance in terms of rise/fall in NAV, 
yield, investment made in associate companies, details of large holding etc. 

 
?  All Mutual Funds were directed to post their half-yearly results in the prescribed format on their web sites and for 
investors the same may be displayed on AMFI web site before the expiry of one month from the close of each 
half-year.   

 
?  To make the monitoring more broad based, the Mutual Funds were required to disclose the portfolios on their 
web sites in the prescribed format before the expiry of one month from close of each half-year and a copy of the 
portfolio is required to be filed with SEBI at the time of submission of half-yearly results. 

 
?  To provide the investors objective analysis of the performance of the mutual funds schemes in comparison with 

the rise & fall in the securities market, the mutual funds were advised to disclose benchmark indices. 

 
?  To ensure that all personal securities transactions are conducted consistent with the Mutual Funds guidelines 
and  in  such  manner  so  as  to  avoid  any  actual  or  potential  conflict  of  interest  or  any  abuse  of  an  individual's 
position  of  trust  and  responsibility,  the  SEBI  issued  detailed  guidelines  for  investment/trading  in  securities  by 
employees  of  AMCs  and  mutual  fund  trustee  companies.    Further  more,  Boards  of  AMCs  and  trustees  are 
required to review the compliance of guidelines periodically. 

 
?  The  SEBI  decided  that  mutual  funds  should  disclose  large  unit  holdings  in  the  scheme,  which  are  above  25 
percent of the NAV.   The information on the number of such investors and total holdings by them in percentage 
terms, shall be disclosed in the allotment letters after the initial public offerings and also in the annual and the 
half-yearly results. 

 
?  To implement the regulations in regard to independent functioning, the SEBI decided that relatives of sponsors 
or  directors  of  sponsor  companies  or  relatives  of  associate  directors  of  the  AMCs  and  Trustee  Companies 
should  be  considered  as  associate  directors.    The  nominees  of  the  companies  who  are  stakeholders  in  the 

Sponsor Company or AMC shall be considered as associate directors.  Further, a person who is an "associate" 
in  accordance  with  definition  in  the  regulations  cannot  be  appointed  as  independent  director  even  after  he 
ceases  to  be  an  "associate"  unless  a  cooling  off  period  of  three  years  has  elapsed  from  the  date  of  his 
disassociation. 

 
?  To  bring  uniformity  in  calculation  of  NAVs  and  to  have  proper  valuation  of  Government  Securities,  all  mutual 

funds were advised to use the prices for government securities released by an authorised agency.  

 
Investment in Foreign Securities by Mutual Funds 
 
?  To  broaden  the  avenues  for  investments,  Mutual  Funds  as  per  the  Union  Budget  2002-03  proposals,  were 
permitted to make investments in foreign debt securities including government securities in the countries with 
fully convertible currencies, short term as well as long term debt instruments with highest rating (foreign currency 
credit rating) by accredited/registered credit rating agencies. The mutual funds may also invest in units/securities 
issued by overseas mutual funds or unit trusts, which invests in aforesaid securities or are rated and registered 
with overseas regulators. 

 
The important measures indicated above and also the steps discussed later in the Report have 
helped  the  SEBI  in  discharging  its  statutory  responsibility  of  developing  and  regulating  the 
market and protecting the investors.  Besides, the securities market in India has become more 
modern in terms of infrastructure, adoption of international practices in accounting standards as 
well  as  disclosure  norms,  settlement  cycle  through  rolling  settlement,  derivatives  trading, 
implementation  of  corporate  governance  etc.    The  SEBI  has  been  striving  to  enhance  fund 
mobilisation  in  primary  market  thus  efficiently  utilising  the  domestic  savings,  diligently 
protecting  the  interest  of  investors  and  other  stakeholders  and  minimising  or  eliminating  the 
obstacles and problems particularly resulting from the interpretations of law and regulations that 
hinder the development and investment in the securities market.   The investors’  education has 
been given a priority programme of the SEBI with the objectives to provide the public across the 
country with the knowledge on basic principles of investment, stimulate domestic savings and to 
promote  understanding  on  the  role  and  responsibility  of  regulatory  authority  in  the  securities 
market.  
 
While  aiming  at  achieving  such  targets,  the  SEBI  has  continuously  followed  open  and 
transparent  policy  and  a  consultative  approach.  It  also  maintained  a  close  interface  with  the 
market participants and professionals, and the feedback, as well as expert advice obtained from 
them in framing its policies and programmes. 
 
The developments in the securities market following the announcement of the Union Budget for 
2001-02,  a  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee  has  been  set  up  and  is  in  progress.  In  response  to 
these developments, the SEBI also took the following measures to further enhance the safety, 
transparency and efficiency of the market -  
 
a.  Steps  were  also  taken  to  implement  the  program  of  corporatisation  and  demutualization 
announced by the Government, which would result in the segregation of ownership, trading 
rights and management.  

b.  The rolling settlement on  T+5 basis was extended to 200 stocks in the erstwhile  ‘A’  group 
and  to  those  in  which  any  deferral  products  such  as  ALBM,  BLESS  and  MCFS  were 

permitted.  This  list  was  further  extended  to  cover  all  listed  securities  from  December  31, 
2001.  

c.  It was also announced that the settlement cycle was to be further shortened to T+3 from April 

1, 2002 for all the listed securities which has been done. 

d.  All deferral products were abolished.  

 
This constituted a set of far reaching reforms for the securities market in India.      

In the Annual Report for the year 2000-01, the SEBI had set for itself certain goals in the short 
and the medium term. The Table 1.1 below shows the performance of the SEBI against these 
goals.

94  prices,  was  4.0  per  cent  in  2000-01  and  5.4  per  cent  in  2001-02.  Though  the  growth  rate 
during 2001-02 marked some recovery over the growth of 2000-01, it remained noticeably lower 
than the average growth rate of 6.3 during 1994-1995 to 2000-01. The GDP growth of 5.4 per 
cent during the year under review was contributed by agriculture and allied sectors by registering 
an increase of 5.7 per cent, services by 6.5 per cent and industry by 3.3 per cent. The services 
sector  despite  the  fall  in  its  growth  during  2000-01 (7.5 per cent) and 2001-02 (6.5 per cent) 
continued to have a share of more than 50 per cent in GDP.  
 
Domestic savings, however, improved marginally from 23.2 per cent of GDP in 1999-2000 to 
23.4  per  cent  in  2000-01.  The  saving  ratio,  however,  compares  unfavourably  with  the 
achievement  of  25.1  per  cent  in  1995-1996.  Consequently  domestic  investment  has  shown 
declining trend from 26.9 per cent in 1995-1996 to 22.7 per cent in 1998-1999. The ratio was 
somewhat higher at 24.3 per cent in 1999-2000 but declined marginally to 24.0 per cent in 2000-
01. Sector-wise, the public sector investment improved from 6.6 per cent in 1998-1999 to 7.1 per 
cent in 1999-2000 and remained at the same level in 2000-01, but the private sector investment 
declined from 16.1 per cent in 1999-2000 to 15.8 per cent in 2000-01. (Table 1.2)

There was a structural change in the composition of financial assets of households. It would be 
observed from Table 1.3 that share of investment in shares and debentures which had increased 
from 2.9 per cent in 1997-98 to 6.4 per cent in 1999-2000 declined to 2.7 per cent in 2000-01. 
On the other hand, the share of contractual savings increased from 30.1 per cent to 33.4 per cent 
during  the  same  period.  When  comparison  is  made  between  2000-01  and  1999-2000, 
investments  in  shares  and  debentures  registered  a  decline  from  6.4  per  cent  to  2.7  per  cent 
whereas share of deposits increased from 39.1 per cent to 44.3 per cent, respectively, and share 
of currency decreased from 8.5 per cent to 6.4 per cent.  
 
India has gained further in external sector as foreign inflows during 2001-02 aggregated to US$ 
11.8 billion and as a result foreign exchange reserves increased to US$ 54.1 billion at end March 
2002  from  US$  42.2  billion  at  end  March  2001.  This  is  the  evidence  of  strong  domestic  and 
international  confidence  in  the  economic  management  of  India.  On  exchange  rate  front,  the 
foreign exchange markets experienced considerable uncertainty with the rupee depreciating by 
6.7 per cent between end-April and end-October 2000 from Rs.46.775.  Since November 2000, 
the situation had shown large improvement and the forex markets were relatively stable.  Overall 
stability  in  exchange  rate  and  growing  amount  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  has  kept  up  the 
confidence of foreign investors and the tempo of inflows of foreign portfolio investment.   
The economy experienced easy liquidity conditions and softer interest rate environment during 
the year under review.  The overall comfortable monetary conditions and liquid funds available 

with the banking system as reflected in decline in interest rates on a wide spectrum of financial 
instruments and low level of call money rates were some positive factors visible in the financial 
markets.   
 
Investment Climate 
 
The  primary  market  recorded  a  modest  increase  in  investment  activity.  In  absolute  terms,  the 
total  capital  raised  during  2001-02  was  Rs.7,544  crore  through  35  issues  as  compared  to 
Rs.6,108 crore through 151 issues in 2000-01. The average size of issues increased from Rs. 40.5 
crore in the previous year to Rs.215.5 crore in 2001-02. However the number of IPOs declined 
significantly to 7 in the financial year 2001-02 as against 114 IPOs in the financial year 2000-01. 
The funds mobilized through IPOs also decreased drastically by 55.8 per cent to Rs.1,202.3 crore 
in 2001-02 from Rs.2,722.4 crore during the previous financial year. The IPOs amounted to 15.9 
per cent of the total resource mobilized i.e. Rs.7543.07 crore  during the year.  
 
Bearish  sentiment,  however  dominated  the  stock  market  through  2001-02.  Almost  all  major 
stock market indicators like market capitalisation, turnover, P/E ratio showed declining trends 
during 2001-02. However, the fall in major indices and other market indicators was substantially 
less than that noticed during 2000-01.  The BSE Sensex on a point to point basis decreased from 
3604 as on March 30, 2001 to 3469 as on March 28, 2002, a fall of 3.7 per cent, the S&P CNX 
Nifty witnessed a decline of 1.6 per cent from 1148 as on March 30, 2001 to 1129 as on March 
28, 2002. On the contrary, the other indices e.g. the BSE Natex, the S&P CNX 500 and the BSE 
Dollex registered a rise of 1.5 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively, during the 
current  year  under  review.  However,  the  stock  prices  suffered  several  reversals  on  some 
occasions  during  the  year  precipitated  by  stock  market  crash  in  USA  following  the  terrorist 
attack on September 11, 2001 and attack on Indian Parliament on December 20, 2001. The BSE 
Sensex dropped to 2641 as on September 17, 2001 and further to 2600 on September 21, 2001 
from 3181 as on September 10, 2001, recording a loss of 540 points and 581 points respectively. 
Following  the  steps  taken  by  both  the  government  and  regulatory  authority  and  recovery  of 
perceptions of investors, the Sensex picked up slowly and reached 3287 by November 21, 2001 
and to 3443 by December 10, 2001, before coming down sharply to 3132 by December 27, 2001 
on account of  the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. However, the Sensex reached the 
level of 3469 by March 28, 2002. These trends were visible in the movement of other indices 
also. 
 
The gross mobilisation by the mutual funds increased sharply from Rs.92,957 crore in 2000-01 
to Rs.1,64,523 crore in 2001-02. But the net mobilisation sharply declined during 2001-02 to Rs. 
7175  crore  from  Rs.  9128  crore  in  the  previous  year  due  to  increase  in  level  of 
repurchases/redemption compared to 2000-01 . This fall was on account of heavy disinvestment 
in  equity  segment.  The  total  disinvestment  in  this  segment  amounted  to  Rs.3,796  crore  as 
compared to net purchases in debt segment of the order of Rs.10,959 crore. A large part of the 
decline  in  the  net  amount,  on  account  of  the  problems  encountered  by  the  UTI  resulting  in 
significant net outflow for UTI. 
 
Net FIIs investment was positive almost for all the months during 2001-02 except the month of 
September 2001 when net investment was negative at US $ 113 million on account of sudden 

increase in sales which exceeded purchases by about 16 per cent following the terrorist attacks 
on the USA.  However, there has been a gradual increase in the FIIs investment in the country 
reflecting continued confidence of the FIIs in the Indian securities market .   
 
 
B] REVIEW OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES 

 

 Primary Securities Market 

The major policies and programmes adopted by the SEBI during 2001-02 have been reviewed 
below: 
 
i. 
 
During 2001-02, the SEBI took a number of policy initiatives to strengthen and streamline the 
procedures for raising the resources from the primary market by listed and unlisted companies 
and allocation of issues to various categories of investors. In order to facilitate the investment 
activity,  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  issues,  disclosure  norms,  accounting  standards  and 
conduct  of  the  intermediaries  in  the  primary  market,  the  SEBI  issued  several  guidelines  and 
amended rules and regulations related to securities market .  These policy changes were affected 
broadly to protect the interests of investors and to promote more healthy and vibrant primary 
market. The major policy changes relating to primary market are set out below: 
 
Issues Through Book-Building  
 
The SEBI issued further guidelines to be followed by the issuers for raising of capital through 
book-building and for allocation of these issues among various categories of investors. In case an 
issuer company makes an issue of 100 per cent of the net offer to public through 100 per cent 
book-building process, the guidelines stipulated that not less than  25 per cent of the net offer to 
the public shall be available for allocation to retail individual investors i.e. investors applying for 
upto 1000 securities and not less than  15 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available 
for allocation to non-institutional investors i.e. investors applying for more than 1000 securities.  
The guidelines also stipulated that not more than 60 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be 
available for allocation to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs).  See Para F (II) section (VI) of 
Part I for details of amendments.

Debt Securities Convertible into Equity After Allotment 
 
An unlisted company  making a public issue of debt securities convertible into equity (DSCE)

(Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 and the SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors), 
Regulations, 2000 and any amendment thereto, in this regard, shall be applicable. 
 
Post-issue monitoring reports 
 
SEBI laid down the revised requirements for filing the post-issue monitoring reports with the 
Board for both book-built portion and fixed price portion. 
 
Offer to public 
 
Clause (b) to sub-rule (2) of Rule 19 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 has 
been amended vide Government notification no. G.S.R. 415(E) dated June 7, 2001, providing for

unlisted  companies  which  have  allotted  shares  to  holders  of  securities  in  a  listed  company 
pursuant  to  a  scheme  of  reconstruction  or  amalgamation  sanctioned  by  the  appropriate  High 
Court, have been approaching the Board for seeking exemption from making a public offer for 
listing their shares. Exemptions, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions have already being 
granted by way of communication to the Stock Exchanges. For the sake of greater transparency, 
the requirements in this regard have been specified by the SEBI. 
 
Research report  
 
The following stipulations were laid down by the SEBI regarding the publication of  research 
reports by intermediary firms, analysts etc. : 
? 

the  research  report  should  be  prepared  only  on  the  basis  of  published  information  as

?  no selective or additional information or information extraneous to the offer document shall 
be made available by the issuer or any member of the issue management team/ syndicate to 
only  one  section  of  the  investors  in  any  manner  whatsoever  including  at  road  shows, 
presentations, in research or sales reports or at bidding centres etc.  

?  no  report  or  information,  other  than  the  contents  of  the  draft  offer  document  shall  be 
circulated  by  the  issuer  or  any  member  of  the  issue  management  team/  syndicate  or  their 
associates, after the date of receipt of observations from SEBI.  

? 

the advertisement code is observed while circulating the research reports, and that the risk 
factors are reproduced wherever highlights are given, as in case of an advertisement 

 
Corporate Governance 
 
The  Accounting  Standards  Committee  of  the  SEBI  as  well  as  the  Kumar  Mangalam  Birla 
Committee on Corporate Governance had recommended the following financial disclosures for 
listed companies: 

 

?  Consolidation of Accounts 
?  Segment Reporting 
?  Deferred Taxes 
?  Related Party Transactions 
?  Earning per Share 
 
As part of SEBI’s efforts to enhance financial disclosure standards, the SEBI has been closely 
interacting with the ICAI. The issuance of the accounting standards on the above areas was taken 
up by the SEBI with ICAI, which is represented in the SEBI’s Accounting Standards Committee. 

  

 

The ICAI stated that standards have been issued in the above areas.  They also informed that 
ICAI  would  be  issuing  Accounting  Standards  in  respect  of  other  areas  such  as  ‘Intangible 
Assets’, ‘Impairment of  Assets’, ‘Discontinuing Operations’, ‘  Accounting for Investments in 
Associates’, etc. by December 2001. The Committee also noted that the issue and adoption of the 
above Accounting Standards would help to bridge the gap that now exist between International 
Accounting  Standards  and  Indian  Accounting  Standards  and  will  raise  the  level  of  financial 
disclosures to the international standards.    The Committee was of the view that the impact of 
the Accounting Standards issued by the ICAI on the above five subjects would be visible in the 
annual accounts of the companies from the financial year 2001-02.   

Consolidated financial results

disclosure requirements, the Accounting Standard Committee recommended that the following 
additional disclosures may be prescribed in the quarterly un-audited financial results.    

 

 

While ICAI has prescribed that Accounting Standard on Segment Reporting would be applicable 
from  the  financial  year  2001-02,  companies  were  required  to  furnish  segment-wise  revenue, 
results  and  capital  employed  in  the  quarterly  un-audited  financial  results  with  effect  from  the

Disclosures and Accounting for “Dot Com” Companies 

The  Accounting  Standard  Committee  adopted  the  report  of  the  Accounting  Standards  Sub-
Committee on “dot com” Companies. The Sub-Committee was of the view that the traditional 
valuation  models  applicable  to  “brick  and  mortar”  companies  may  not  be  applicable  to  “dot 
com”  companies  in  view  of  their  uncertain  revenue  streams  and  unpredictable  and  rapidly 
changing business models.   Hence, it was felt that instead of prescribing models for valuation of 
“dot com” companies, sufficient amount of information should be made available to the investors 
to take well informed investment decision.    

The Sub-Committee  recommended  that “dot com”  companies  shall  be  required  to  disclose  all 
relevant  qualitative  and  quantitative  business  information.    These  requirements  may  also  be 
made applicable to all other companies wherever it is relevant.  SEBI’s Committee on Disclosure 
on  Offer  Documents  which  is  also  chaired  by  Shri  Y  H  Malegam  would  consider  the 
recommendations  of  the  Sub-Committee    for  additional  disclosures  in  the  offer  documents 
applicable to dot com and other companies.   

The  Sub-Committee  also  recommended  that  the  Guidance  Note  on  Accounting  by  Dot  Com 
Companies  issued  by  ICAI  shall  be  made  mandatory  for  dot  com  companies  and  they  are 
required to give a declaration in the offer document confirming their complete compliance with 
the Guidance Note. 
 

ii.  Secondary Securities Market 
         
Trading  of  all  Scrips  in  Rolling  Settlement  Made  Compulsory  –  from  Account  Period  to 
T+5 and T+3 Settlement 
 
One of the far reaching changes for the Indian Securities market in 2001-02 was the introduction 
of compulsory T+5 rolling settlement for all scrips listed and traded  in any Stock exchange in 
India. Rolling settlement was introduced on voluntary T+5 basis in the Demat segment of the 
Stock Exchanges on January 15,1998 to expedite the trading and settlement process and improve 
efficiency of the securities  market. Based on the recommendations of the Committee on rolling 
settlement it was decided that trading would be compulsory in rolling settlement by all investors 
in 163 scrips from May 08, 2000. Thereafter, from July 2, 2001 compulsory rolling settlement  
was applicable to an additional 251 scrips which were having the settlement deferral facility such 
as ALBM / BLESS/ MCFS of any exchange and those in BSE 200 went into compulsory rolling 
settlement  w.e.f.  July  02,  2001.  Thus,  the  total  number  of  scrips  traded  on  rolling  settlement 
increased to 414. By December 31, 2001 rolling settlement had been extended to the remaining 
scrips listed on all exchanges. It was subsequently decided to further shorten the settlement cycle 
to T+3 for listed scrips from April 1, 2002. 
 
Deferral Products 
 
All deferral products namely ALBM / BLESS / MCFS/ CNS were ceased to be available for all 
scrips  except  for  transitional  measures.  In  order  to  give  market  adequate  time  for  orderly  un-
winding of positions, a transitional mechanism was put in place:  
All  outstanding  deferral  positions  as  on  May  14,  2001  were  required  to  be  compulsorily 
liquidated by September 03, 2001 
 
Any additional deferred positions taken on or after May 15, 2001 in addition to point (a) above 
were  required  to  compulsorily  liquidated  by  July  02,  2001.  No  new  deferred  positions  were 
permitted from July 02, 2001 onwards. 
 
In the interim period between July 02, 2001 and January 02, 2002 all the stocks which were not 
under compulsory rolling settlement were traded on uniform settlement cycle from Monday to 
Friday with effect from July 02, 2001 on all exchanges. All scrips in all stock exchanges were 
traded in rolling settlement system on T+5 basis with effect from December 31, 2001.  
 
Settlement Cycle  from T+5 basis to T+3 basis 
 
Further to derive benefits of increased efficiency of the Rolling Settlement, the rolling settlement 
cycle was shortened from T+5 to T+3 basis with effect from April 01, 2002.  
 

 

Unique Client Identification (ID) 
 
 SEBI made mandatory for all brokers and sub-broker to use uique client codes for all clients. 
For this purpose, brokers would collect and maintain in their back office the Permanent Account 
Number  (PAN)  allotted  by  Income  Tax  Department  for  all  their  clients.  Sub-brokers  would 
similarly maintain for their clients. If a client does not have PAN number, such a client would 
furnish passport number and place and date of issue.  If the client does not have a PAN number 
or a passport, such a client would furnish driving licence number, place and date of issue. If none 
of the above are available, the client would give his voter ID number. These requirement have 
become  applicable  for  clients  having  order  value  of  Rs.1  lakh  or  more  and  shall  be  enforced 
w.e.f. August 1, 2001. This would help in easing audit trail.  
 
Risk Containment Measures 
 
Margins  
 
a.   Value at risk  (VaR) margin 

The  equity  markets  moved  to  margins  based  on  Value  at  Risk  (VaR)  as  prevalent  in  the 
derivatives  market.  The  modalities  for  the  implementation  of  the  margins  based on VaR were 
informed to the stock exchanges. The margins based on VaR replaced all the margins prescribed 
by SEBI except for mark to market margin.  
 
For the scrips in the compulsory rolling settlement, the 99 per cent VaR based margin system 
was introduced with effect from July 02, 2001 in the following manner: 
 
?  The Stock Exchanges would calculate scrip wise VaR and index based VaR and apply the 
higher of the two as the margin percentage. Scrip wise daily volatility calculated using the 
same exponentially weighted moving average methodology that is used in the index futures 
market  and  the  scrip  wise  daily  VaR  would  be  calculated  as  3.5  times  the  volatility  so 
calculated. 

?  The  index  based  VaR  calculated  as  the  index  VaR  times  a  suitable  multiplier  i.e.  the 
multiplier  factor  for  each  of  stocks  would  be  calculated  on  the  first  trading  day  of  every 
calendar  month  based  on  average  stock  volatility  during  previous  six  months  on  a  rolling 
basis. The higher of Sensex and Nifty VaR would be used. The multiplier shall not in any 
case be less than 1.75.  

?  The  multiplier  will  be  rounded  upto  two  decimals  and  the  margin  percentage  would  be 

rounded upto next integer. 

?  The minimum daily index VaR shall be 5 per cent as in the index futures market at present. 

The higher of Sensex and Nifty VaR would be used. 

?  The VaR based margin would be capped at 100 per cent 
 

b.   Additional level of margin  
 
While the above calculations would address 99 percent of the cases, it would be necessary to 
have an additional level of margin to address the 1 per cent of the cases to supplement the VaR 
based margins. Therefore, additional 12 per cent margin was imposed to address 1 percent of the 
cases. The VaR calculations would be based either on BSE Sensex or S&P CNX Nifty. Other 
stock exchanges could make their own VaR calculations based on BSE Sensex and S&P CNX 
Nifty or freely adopt the VaR calculations available on the sites of BSE and NSE.  
 
c.   Margins on institutional trades 
 
In VaR based margin, institutions like the financial institutions, FIIs, Banks and Mutual Funds 
etc. would be required to pay margin on the sale side calculated on the basis of differential i.e. 
positive differential between the minimum VaR (1.75 times index VaR) and the actual margin 
percentage calculated. 
 
d.   Gross margins in the cash market 
 
The  margins  in  the  cash  markets  were  mandated  to  be  calculated  on  the  a  gross  basis  across 
clients w.e.f.. September 03, 2001.  
 
Market wide circuit breakers 
 
SEBI introduced the index based market wide circuit breaker system from July 2, 2001. These 
circuit breakers would apply at three stages of the index movement either way at 10 per cent, 15 
per cent and 20 per cent and would bring about a coordinated halt trading in all equity and equity 
derivative markets nationwide.  
 
? 

In case of a 10 per cent movement of either of these indices, there would be a 1 hour market 
halt if the movement takes place before 1 pm.  In case the movement takes place at or after 1 
pm but before 2:30 pm there will be a trading halt for ½ hour. In case the movement takes 
place at or after 2:30 p.m. there will be no trading halt at the 10 per cent level and the market 
will continue trading.  
In case of a 15 per cent movement of either index, there will be a 2-hour halt if the movement 
takes place before 1 p.m. If the 15 per cent trigger is reached on or after 1 p.m. but before 2 
p.m., there will be a 1 hour halt. If the 15 per cent trigger is reached on or after 2 p.m. the 
trading will halt for the remainder of the day.  
In case of a 20 per cent movement of the index, the trading will be halted for the remainder 
of the day.  

? 

? 

 
Movement of either BSE Sensex or the NSE S&P CNX Nifty, whichever is breached earlier, 
would trigger the market wide circuit breakers. 
 

These percentages will be translated in to absolute points index variations on quarterly basis and 
at the end of each quarter would be revised and be applicable for the next quarter. The above 
mentioned  percentages  would  be  translated  into  absolute  points  would  be  calculated  on  the 
closing level of the index on the last day of the trading in a quarter and rounded off to nearest 25 
points in case of BSE Sensex and nearest 10 points in case of S&P CNX Nifty.  
 
Scrip-wise price bands 
 
In addition to the market wide index based circuit filters, there would be individual scrip wise 
price bands of 20 per cent either way, for all scrips in the compulsory rolling settlement except 
for scrips on which derivatives products are available or scrips including in indices on which 
derivatives products are available. For scrips that are not in compulsory rolling settlement, the 
existing  price  bands  would  continue.  However  as  temporary  measure  following  the  market 
conditions post-September 11, 2001, circuit filters were also introduced for the shares on which 
derivative products were available.  
 
Enhancement of Financial Disclosure by the Listed Companies 
 
In order to enhance the level of disclosure by the listed companies in the light of new Accounting 
Standards  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (ICAI),  the  Accounting 
Standards  Committee  (ASC)  of  SEBI  recommended  the  following  which  were  implemented 
through the amendment to the Listing Agreement. 
 
Demutualisation and Corporatisation of the Stock Exchanges 
 
The  Govrenment  had  announced  that  the  stock  exchanges  will    be  corporatised  by  which 
ownership, management and trading membership would be segregated from each other and that 
administrative  steps  will  be  taken  and  legislative  changes,  if  required,  will  be  proposed 
accordingly. In accordance with the above policy announcement,the  SEBI Board decided that 
henceforth  no  stock  broker  member  of  any  stock  exchange  shall  be  an  office  bearer  of  the 
exchanges i.e. hold the position of president, vice-president, treasurer etc. All recognised stock 
exchanges were also directed to amend their rules, articles etc. within a period of two months 
from the date of order i.e. January 10, 2002, to give effect to the decision taken and the policy 
decision  of  Government  in  this  regard.  Simultaneously,  the  SEBI  also  examined  the 
administrative and legal modalities for corporatisation.  
 
Corporatisation  and  demutualisation  of  stock  exchanges  are  complex  subjects  and  involve  a 
number  of  legal,  accounting,  Companies  Act  1970  and  tax  issues.  These  issues  would  need 
careful  examination.  Considering  this,  SEBI  constituted  a  Group  under  the  chairmanship  of 
Justice M. H. Kania, former Chief Justice of India, comprising of eminent personalities, in the 
fields  of  law,  accountancy,  finance,  company  law  affairs  and  taxation  to  advise  SEBI  and 
recommend  the  steps  that  need  to  be  taken  to  implement  the  announcement  of  the  Finance 
Minister.  
 
The terms of reference of this Group are as under: 
 

i. 

to review and examine the present structure of stock exchanges including stock exchanges 
which are set up as company  and  those  set  up  as  un-incorporated  bodies  and  in  this  light 
examine  the  legal,  financial  and  fiscal  issues  involved  to  corporatise  and  demutualise  the 
stock exchanges,  

ii.  to recommend the specific steps that need to be taken for implementation, and  
iii.  to advise on the consolidation and merger of the stock exchanges.  
 
Major Amendments to Provisions of the Listing Agreement 
 
Non-promoter holding on a continuous basis and minimum number of shareholders 
 
For  the  first  time,  minimum  floating  stock  was  made  a  condition  for  continuous  listing. 
Following  the  recommendations  of  Secondary  Market  Advisory  Committee  on  the    issue  of 
compliance of quantitative continuous listing conditions by the listed companies to maintain a 
minimum  floating  stock  post  listing  and  approval  of  SEBI  Board  on  the  requirement  of 
quantitative continuous listing conditions as a measure of investor protection as it would ensure 
availability of floating stock on a continuous basis, the stock exchanges were directed to amend 
their Listing Agreement .For details see Para G (i) and (ii) of Section [VI] of Part I.  
  
Adoption of Model Rules by the Stock Exchanges 
 
SEBI  had  constituted  a  Committee  for  examining  the  existing  Articles  and  Memorandum  of 
Association, Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of Stock Exchanges and framing a uniform set of 
Rules and Bye-laws to be followed by all the stock exchanges. The Committee had submitted the 
model rules for Stock Exchanges to SEBI for implementation across the stock exchanges. 
 
In order to bring about uniformity among stock exchanges and taking into account uniformity 
already  brought  about  by  SEBI  through  the  directives/circulars  so  far  issued  to  the  stock 
exchanges, the stock exchanges were advised to suitably adopt these rules. Some of the Model 
Rules  have  already  been  implemented  by  the  Stock  Exchanges  through  SEBI  Circulars  and 
directives. For some rules suitable provisions already exist in SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 
1957 or in the GOI directives/Circulars and SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 
1992 etc. Some of the Model Rules are new amongst which some are related to corporatisation 
of Stock Exchanges and can be implemented only after all exchanges are corporatised.  
 
Delay in transfer of shares by the companies  
 
SEBI has given the direction to the stock exchanges for speedy redressal of grievances pertaining 
to  pending  transfer  of  shares,  dealing  with  objection  memos  in  future  and  duplicate  share 
certificates.  
 
Grant of trading terminals 
 
SEBI  had  advised  the  Stock  Exchanges  to  grant  trading  terminals  only  at  the  members’ 
registered  office,  branch  offices  and  their  registered  sub-brokers’  offices.  Trading  terminals 
granted earlier in places other than locations mis-utilised for unregistered sub-broking activities 

should be withdrawn immediately. The Stock Exchanges were also advised to amend their bye-
laws  to  take  action  against  the  broker  who  mis-utilises  or  lets  misutilisation  of  their  trading 
terminals for unregistered sub-broking activities. 
 
No-delivery period 
 
The  stock  exchanges  were  advised  that  in  case  of  any  short  delivery  by  any  member  in  the 
previous  settlement  where  the  delivery  of  securities  is  to  be  given  on  cum  basis,  then  the 
Exchange may close out to the extent of the short delivery if the shares cannot be acquired in 
auction  on  cum  basis  and  there  would  be  no  “no  delivery”  period  on  account  of  book 
closure/record dates for corporate actions such as issue of dividend and bonus shares in respect 
of the scrips which are traded in the compulsory dematerialised mode. 
 
Reference price for close out  
 
Since in the rolling settlement the auction and the close out takes place during trading hours, hence 
the reference price in the rolling settlement for close out procedures would be taken as the previous 
day’s closing price.  
 
Fees payable by stock brokers 
 
Following the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the issue of fees payable by Stock 
Brokers and directing SEBI to amend the regulations incorporating the recommendations of the 
R. S. Bhatt Committee Report, SEBI has amended the regulations on February 20, 2002.  
 
Disclosure of the scrip wise delivery ratio 
 
For transparency purpose, the stock exchanges were advised to disclose scrip wise deliverable 
positions grossed across clients for that day’s trading session. 
 
Practice of granting conditional listing permission 
 
The stock exchanges were advised to desist from the practice of granting conditional listing to 
the  companies  since  Section  73  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956  does  not  envisage  any  qualified 
conditional listing permission 
 
 
 
 
 
Group on Risk Management  Recommends to Review Corporate Governance  
and Response to Market Rumors 
 
While  discussing  market  related  disclosure  issues,  the  Group  felt  that  the  corporate  governance 
standards being in place for quite sometime, it was time to take a review of the standards of corporate 
governance and implementation thereof. Very often, rumors appear about companies listed on stock 

exchanges, which affect their prices.  Some of the rumors are price sensitive.  Exchanges are required 
to take steps to verify rumors and check with companies.  The Group felt it is important to further 
strengthen the existing framework to help determine the role of exchanges and corporate in verifying 
and  responding  to  rumors  with  regard  to  price  sensitive  information  in  order  to  enhance  the 
transparency and integrity of market.  In view of the above issues, it was decided to set up a group 
under the Chairmanship of Prof. J.R. Varma to look into the above issues.  The Committee comprised 
of  representative  of  Chambers  of  Commerce,  ICSI,  ICAI,  AMBI,  BSE,  NSE,  CSE  and  DSE.    The 
Group could also invite senior representatives of the press and other experts. 
 
The Securities Lending Scheme, 1997 
 
The  Securities  Lending  Scheme  was  introduced  by  SEBI  in  1997.  The  scheme  provides  for 
lending of securities through an approved Intermediary to a borrower under an agreement for a 
specified period.  It also provides for mobilisation of idle stock in the hands of lenders such as 
FIs, MFs, FIIs and large investors.  This also gives an additional income to the lender. 
 
Securities  lending  is  an  essential  ingredient  element  for  well  functioning  of  modern  securities 
market.  Securities lending contributes to the liquidity in the market.  It smoothens the settlement 
system  and  improves  efficiency    of  the  settlement  system  by  facilitating  timely  delivery  of 
securities and correcting temporary imbalances between demand and supply. 
 
Two  entities  viz.  Kotak  Securities  Ltd.  and  M/s  Infrastructure  Leasing  and  Financial  Services 
Ltd.  (IL  &  FS)  were  registered  as  Approved  Intermediary  under  Securities  Lending  Scheme, 
1997 during the year 2001-02. 
 
Amendments to SEBI (Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 
 
The  SEBI  constituted  a  committee  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  Kumarmangalam  Birla  to 
strengthen  the  existing  Insider  Trading  Regulations  and  create  a  framework  for  prevention  of 
insider trading.  The recommendations of the committee were considered and approved by the 
SEBI  Board.    Details  of  amendments  to  insider  trading  regulations  are  given  in  Para  E  (8), 
Section (VI) of Part I. 
 

Derivatives Trading, Risk Management and New Derivatives Products 
 
The SEBI has been constantly pursuing the promotion of derivatives market in India.  It has made 
efforts  to  widen  the  market  by  introducing  derivative  trading,  derivative  products  and  risk 
management associated with derivative trading.  The policy inititatives of SEBI taken in 2001-02 are 
given below: 
 
Technical group on new derivative products  
 
The SEBI Technical group on new derivative products discussed the eligibility criterion and risk 
containment measures for options on individual stocks and decided that stocks to be eligible for 
options trading should meet the following criteria: 
 
?  Stock should figure in the list of top 200 scrips, on the basis of average market capitalization, 
during the last six months and average free float market capitalization should not be less than 
Rs. 750 crore.  

 
As per the above criteria, it was estimated that initially 30 to 35 scrips would qualify for options 
trading. Final selection of the scrips, for the options trading, would be made by the exchanges 
with the approval of SEBI. The eligibility criteria would be reviewed after a period of six months 
to examine whether in the light of the experience, the list of eligible stocks could be expanded.  
 
It was also decided by the group that for initial period of six months, stock options would be cash 
settled and after that exchanges would move to physical settlement.  
It was also decided to impose limit on the overall open interest in stock options. It was decided 
that open interest in terms of number of stocks should not exceed twenty times of the average of 
daily shares traded, during the previous calendar month, in the underlying cash market. 
 

?  Stock should appear in the list of top 200 scrips, based on the average daily volume, during 
the last six months. Further, average daily volume should not be less than Rs. 5 crore in the 
underlying cash market;  

?  Stock has to be traded at least on 90 per cent of the trading days, during the last six months;  
?  Non-promoters holding in the company should be at least 30 per cent; and 
?  Ratio of daily volatility of the stock vis a vis daily volatility of index should not be more than 
4, at any time during the previous six months. Volatility estimates would be computed as per 
the Prof. J. R. Varma Committee report on risk containment measures for index futures. 

Derivatives trading  
 
The Advisory Group on Derivatives discussed the modalities for the introduction of stock futures 
in the Indian securities market and recommended to : 
 
?  Device a detailed scheme for the introduction of stock futures on 31 stocks on which options 

have been permitted. 

?  Specify  a  timeframe  within  which  futures  on  individual  stocks  could  be  introduced  after 

assessing the preparedness of the exchanges in terms of infrastructure. 

?  Specify  the  risk  containment  measures,  which  could  include  cash  settlement  of  individual 

? 

? 

? 

stock futures. 
Introduce the risk containment measures and the surveillance measures, which need to be in 
place before trading in stock futures is permitted. 
Include,  equal  access  and  level  playing  field  to  all  category  of  investors  and  market 
participant in the securities markets, margin trading, reduction in the minimum contract size 
of derivative contracts and  developing  a  vibrant  stock  lending  /  borrowing  mechanism  for 
healthy growth and development of stock futures. 
Introduce  cash  settled  stock  futures  contracts,  which  would  become  delivery  settled  after 
three to four months. On the risk containment measures, the committee agreed to adopt the 
existing  risk  management  framework  in  the  derivative  market  for  stock  futures  also.  The 
committee also proposed imposition of stricter position limits at client / customer level and 
trading member level.  

 
Individual stock futures 
 
The SEBI approved the introduction of individual stock future contract on 31 stocks on which 
options  contracts  were  permitted  by  the  SEBI.  Earlier,  the  SEBI  had  granted  in-principle 
approval  for  the  introduction  of  futures  on  31  stocks.  It  was  decided  that  the  Advisory 
Committee on derivatives should,  
 
?  devise a detailed scheme for the introduction of this product,  
? 

specify  the  risk  containment  measures  which  could  include  cash  settlement  of  individual 
stock futures, and  
specify  the  time  frame  in  which  futures  on  individual  stocks  could  be  introduced  after 
assessing the preparedness of the exchanges in terms of infrastructure.   

? 

 
Following the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Derivatives, the SEBI approved 
the  scheme  and  risk  containment  measures  for  the  individual  stock  future  contract  which  are 
summarized as under : 
? 

Initially, the individual stock futures contracts shall be settled in cash. The individual stock 
futures contracts shall have the same multiplier as the lot size for the option contracts in the 
same underlying stock. The contract shall have maximum maturity of 12 months, however, 
initially the contracts for a maturity of three months shall be introduced. In the beginning, 
three  contracts  of  the  maturity  of  one,  two  and  three  months  shall  be  introduced 
simultaneously such that at any point in time atleast three individual stock futures contract on 
a particular underlying would be available for trading.  

 
?  The 'Initial Margin' on the individual stock future shall be computed on the basis of portfolio 
based margining approach which takes an integrated view of the risk involved in the portfolio 
of each client consisting of all futures and options contracts. The initial margin requirements 
are based on worst scenario loss of a portfolio of an individual client to cover 99 per cent 
VaR over a one day horizon across various scenarios of price change and volatility shifts. 
The prices can range in the case of individual stock futures would be 3.5 standard deviation 
(3.5 sigma) and the minimum margin shall not be less than 7.5 per cent of the value of the 
contract.  

 
?  The  exchanges  shall  also  monitor  the  exposure  limits  and  in  the  case  of  individual  stock 
futures contracts the value of gross open position at any point in time in all the individual 
stock futures contract shall not exceed 20 times the available liquid networth of a member.  

 
?  The calendar spread positions in the individual stock futures contract shall be counted for the 
purpose  of  margin  and  exposures  in  the  same  manner  as  in  the  case  of  index  futures 
contracts.  

 
?  The exchanges shall collect mark to market margin in cash settlement in the case of stock 

futures contract before start of the next day’s trading.  

 
? 

In order to deter and detect concentration of positions and market manipulations, the SEBI 
has prescribed position limits at the client level, trading member level and market level.   

 
Client level position limits 
 
The gross open position of a client across all derivative contract on a particular underlying shall 
not exceed higher of  
 
?  1 per cent of the free flow market capitalization (in terms of number of shares) or; 
?  5 per cent of the open interest in derivatives contracts in a particular underlying stock (in 

terms of number of contracts) 
 

This position limit would be applicable on the combined position in all derivatives contracts on 
an underlying stock at an Exchange.  
 
Trading member level positions limits  
 
At trading member level, the position limits in derivative contracts on individual stocks would be 
at 7.5 per cent of the open interest or Rs.50 crore whichever is higher for the derivative contract 
in a particular underlying at an Exchange.  
 
Market-wide limits 
 
The  market-wide limit of open positions on all derivative contracts on a particular underlying 
stock would be lower of  

?  30 times the average number of shares traded daily during the previous calendar month in 

cash segment of the Exchange or; 

?  10 per cent of the number of shares held by non promoters ie. 10 per cent of the free float 

market cap. 

 
FIIs allowed to trade in derivative products 
 
FIIs were, hitherto, allowed to trade only in index futures to the extent of their exposure in the 
cash  market  according  to  restrictions  laid  down  by  the  RBI.    In  order  to  encourage  FIIs  to 
participate in the derivative market in all products, it was decided that FIIs might be allowed to 
trade in all derivative products subject to the position limits now applicable to a trading member.  
These  position  limits  would  be  monitored  by  the  exchanges  as  in  case  of  any  other  trading 
member.    The  SEBI  took  up  the  matter  with  RBI  and  Government  of  India  to  issue  suitable 
instructions to allow FIIs to trade in all derivative products.  Accordingly the RBI has issued the 
instructions and permitted the FIIs to trade in all derivatives product. 

 
Margin trading 
 
The committee discussed the issue of introduction of margin trading. In this context the proposal 
on  margin  trading  submitted  by  the  newly  constituted  ‘Securities  Industry  Association’(under 
incorporation) was discussed and further clarifications were sought on the proposal.  Suggestions 
of  other  models  of  margin  trading  were  also  considered.  Proposals  have  been  discussed  with 
RBI, at the SEBI-RBI Standing Technical Committee meeting.  
 
Registration Fees Payable by Stock Brokers 
 
Pursuant to the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court on February 01, 2001, SEBI has been 
receiving  representations  from  individual  brokers,  the  Brokers’  Forums and the Exchanges on 
various  issues  related  to  interpretation  of  the  term  turnover.  Legal  advice  from  the  Solicitor 
General of India was sought on the issues raised in these representations. Based on his opinion, a 
circular clarifying the issues raised was issued. 
 
The brokers in the cash segment have been given a facility of payment of atleast 50 per cent  of 
the registration fees payable by them as per Schedule III to the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-
Brokers) Regulations, 1992 and balance fees along with interest @ 15 per cent p.a. can be paid 
within a period of two years.  
 
Further,  SEBI  has  appointed  a  Committee  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Dr.  D.C.Anjaria  for 
considering revision of fee structure laid down in the R.S.Bhatt Committee Report. Revision, if 
any,  recommended  by  the  Committee  and  approved  by  SEBI  would  be  made  applicable 
prospectively. 
Depositories, Paperless Trading and Other Related Issues 
 
Dematerialisation of securities is one of the major steps for improving and modernising market 
and enhancing the level of investor protection through elimination of bad deliveries, forgery of 
shares and expediting the transfer of shares. Recognizing the far reaching benefits to accrue to 
the market and investors through the elimination of trading in physical securities, the speeding 

up of dematerialisation process has been high on the agenda of SEBI. During 2001-02 also the 
SEBI continued its policy to enhance the growth of paperless trading and electronic book entry 
transfer but in a phased manner so as to allow time for required infrastructure to develop and to 
gain acceptance of the investors and the market. The following measures were taken by the SEBI 
during the year under review:  
 
?  To  achieve  the  goal  of  complete  dematerialisation,  the  SEBI  issued  directive  to  all  the 
companies  to  establish  connectivity  with  both  the  depositories  by  September  30,  2001. 
Companies  which  failed  to  sign  the  agreements  and  establish  connectivity  with  both  the 
depositories by that deadline, the shares of such companies can now be traded only on  "trade 
for trade settlement" window of the exchanges. 

 
?  The exit route to small investors to sell 500 shares in physical form was continued in respect 

of shares included in the list of compulsory rolling settlement and dematerialised trading.   

 
?  To facilitate the instant distribution of dividend or other cash benefits, to the investors, it was 

made mandatory for all the issuers to use ECS facility wherever available.   

 
?  To  avoid  fraudulent  encashment  of  dividend  and  other  cash  benefits,  wherever  distributed 
through warrants, it was made mandatory for all the issuers to print the bank accounts details 
as furnished by the depositories.  

 
?  The SEBI set up a Committee chaired by the Managing Director of NSDL to suggest the 
various ways to reduce the cost to investors in the depository system. The other members of 
the  committee  are  CDSL,  representatives  of  Depository  Participants,  representatives  from 
RAIN and investor associations.  

 
iii.  Mutual Funds 
 
Policy Initiatives, 2001-02 

 

During 2001-02, the SEBI took a number of policy decisions in consultation with mutual funds 
industry to protect the interests  of  investors  in  mutual  funds  and  to  develop  and  regulate  the 
mutual  funds  industry.  The  regulations  were  amended  accordingly  and  necessary  guidelines 
were also issued to the mutual funds. The details of major policy decisions taken are as follows: 
 

Disclosure of half-yearly un-audited results and portfolios by mutual funds 

In  order  to  provide  the  investors  with  meaningful  and  relevant  information  on  mutual  fund 
schemes,  the  SEBI  simplified  the  format  for  the  half-yearly  un-audited  results  published  by 
mutual  funds.  Though  the  format  has  been  simplified,  a  lot  of  information  which  was  not 
available to investors earlier is now required to be given. The mutual funds are now required to 
disclose performance in terms of rise/fall in NAV during the half-year period, yield for the last 1 
year, 3 years, 5 years period and since inception of the scheme, percentage of management fees 
and recurring expenses to the net assets, investment made in associate companies, payment made 
to associate companies, details of large holdings, etc.  Thus, the investors will get all relevant 
information in a concise format. Further, the mutual funds are required to publish the disclosures 
within one month from the close of each half-year instead of earlier requirement of 2 months.  

All mutual funds are also required to display their half-yearly financial results on their web sites 
and also on the web site of the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) so that the investors 
may access and compare the performance of different mutual fund schemes at one place. It was 
also made mandatory for mutual funds to disclose the half-yearly scheme portfolios on their web 
sites, in the prescribed format before the expiry of one month from the close of each half-year.  
 
Disclosure of large unitholdings in scheme 

The SEBI directed mutual funds to disclose large unitholdings (holding of over 25 per cent of 
the net assets of a scheme by an investor) in their schemes so that the investors are aware of 
concentration of holdings. The number of such investors and total holdings by them are required 
to be disclosed in the allotment letter after the initial public offerings and also in the annual and 
half-yearly results.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brokerage payment not to be made to sponsor’s investments in the  
mutual fund schemes 

The  mutual  funds  were  advised  not  to  make  payment  of  brokerage/commission  on  the 
subscription of units received from their sponsors in their schemes.  

Guidelines for investment / trading in securities by employees of AMCs and  
mutual fund trustee companies 
 
SEBI issued detailed guidelines for investment/ trading in securities by employees of AMCs and 
mutual fund trustee companies so as to avoid any conflict of interest and instances of self-dealing 
or  front  running  by  the  employees.  Guidelines  require  prior  approval  by  certain  category  of 
employees  before  making  personal  investment  transactions  and  also  prescribe  reporting 
requirements. Boards of AMCs and trustees are required to review the compliance of guidelines 
in their periodical meetings. 

 

Certification programme for agents/distributors of mutual funds units  
and employees of mutual funds 
 
Recognising the need for developing well-trained agents and distributors and to professionalise 
the  distribution  channel,  the  SEBI  made  it  mandatory  for  all  mutual  funds  to  appoint  agents/ 
distributors who have obtained certification by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).  
Also  the  existing  agents/  distributors  were  expected  to  pass  the  certification  programme  by 
March 31, 2003.  

All mutual funds were advised to direct their agents/ distributors to follow the provisions of the 
SEBI regulations and guidelines pertaining to mutual funds with specific focus on regulations / 
guidelines  on  advertisements  /  sales  literature  and  code  of  conduct.  Mutual  funds  were  also 
advised to monitor the activities of their agents/distributors so that they may not indulge in any 
kind  of  malpractice  or  unethical  practice  while  selling/  marketing  mutual  fund  units.  Mutual 
funds  were  also  advised  to  encourage  their  employees  to  undertake  the  same  certification 
programme by December 2002. 

Revising the definition of independent directors 

 

 

 

 

 

According to the SEBI Regulations, 50 per cent of directors of AMC and two-third trustees are 
required  to  be  independent  i.e.  who  are  not  associates  of  the  sponsors.  With  an  objective  to 
improve corporate governance and to bring about transparency in the operations of the mutual 
funds, the definition of independent directors has been revised. As a result, certain categories of 
persons can be considered as ‘associates’  and not as independent directors.  
 
Strengthening the role of the compliance officer 

With a view to improving corporate governance, the Compliance Officers of the mutual funds 
are  now  required  to  immediately  and  independently  report  to  SEBI  of  any  violation  of 
regulation, guidelines or instructions issued by the SEBI. 

 
Investor education programme 

In order to educate the investors to understand the basics of mutual funds and their operations, 
the  SEBI  prepared  a  brochure  in  question-answer  format  explaining  the  fundamental  issues 
pertaining to mutual funds. This has been put on the SEBI web site. The mutual funds have been 
advised  to  circulate  copies  of  the  brochure  among  their  distributors  and  agents  (including 
brokers, banks, post offices) and the investors. They have also been advised to publish the same 
as small booklets and also to display it prominently on their web sites.  These brochures have 
also been circulated to investor associations and various other self-regulatory and professional 
bodies. 
 

Introduction of benchmarks 

In  order  to  provide  the  investors  objective  analysis  of  the  performance  of  the  mutual  fund 
schemes in comparison with the rise and fall in the markets, the mutual funds were advised to 
disclose  the  performance  of  benchmark  indices  also.  They  were  advised  to  disclose  the 
performance of the benchmark indices in case of equity oriented schemes while disclosing the 
yields  of  the  schemes  in  the  format  for  half-yearly  results.  These  benchmark  indices  can  be 
decided by the AMCs and trustees and any change at a later date is required to be recorded and 
reasonably justified. Subsequently, the disclosure of performance of benchmark indices in case 
of debt oriented schemes and balanced fund schemes has also been made mandatory.  

The SEBI advised that the boards of AMCs and trustees should review the performance of their 
schemes on periodical basis and compare the performance of their schemes with benchmarks in 
all of their meetings. They are also required to review the performance of their schemes in the 
light of performance of the mutual funds industry as published from time to time by independent 
research agencies and financial newspapers and journals and to take corrective action in case of 
unsatisfactory performance.  

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines for investments in foreign securities  

Based on the announcement in the Union Budget, 2002-03, mutual funds were permitted to make 
investments  in  foreign  debt  securities  in  countries  with  full  convertible  currencies.  They  can 
invest in short-term as well as long-term debt instruments with highest rating (foreign currency 
credit  rating)  by  accredited  /  registered  credit  rating  agencies  say  A-1/AAA  by  Standard  and 
Poor, P-1/AAA by Moody’s, F1/AAA by Fitch IBCA etc. They can also invest in government 
securities  where  the  countries  are  AAA  rated.  Detailed  guidelines  for  such  investments  were 
issued to mutual funds which prescribe disclosure and reporting requirements. 

There  is  an  upper  limit  of  US  $  500  million  for  the  entire  mutual  funds  industry  for  making 
investments in ADRs/GDRs and foreign securities. The investment in foreign securities may be 
made by existing mutual funds schemes or new schemes launched for this purpose. The mutual 
funds can also invest in the units/ securities issued by overseas mutual funds or units trusts which 
invest in aforesaid securities or are rated as mentioned above and are registered with overseas 
regulators.

Developments of International Co-operation 
 
The  SEBI  continued  to  play  an  important  role  at  the  international  forum  by  extending  co-
operation to international regulatory bodies and other international organisations.   

 
The SEBI signed a memorandum of understanding with the Securities Commission, Malaysia in 
May  2001.  The  Memorandum  of  Understanding  sets  forth  a  statement  of  intent  of  both  the 
regulatory bodies to establish a framework for mutual assistance and to facilitate the exchange of 
information between the Authorities to enforce compliance with their respective securities and 
futures laws or regulatory requirements.    
During the year the following international meetings were attended by SEBI representatives: 
 
? 

International  Organisation  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  Annual  Conference  In 
Stockholm, Sweden 

IOSCO Executive and Technical Committee Meeting at Rome  

?  Financial Stability Forum (FSF)  meeting at London. 
? 
?  FSF  Asia-Pacific Regional Meeting  In Tokyo 
? 
? 

IOSCO Executive and Technical Committee Meeting in Hong Kong  
IOSCO  Asian  Pacific  Regional  Committee  (APRC)  meeting  and  APRC  Enforcement 
Director's conference at Bali, Indonesia. 

 
The theme of current year’s IOSCO Annual Conference, "Securities Markets in the Information 
Age," provided a platform for regulators and industry participants to address issues inherent in 
the relationship between technology and the securities markets. In this context IOSCO issued a 
new report on securities activity on the Internet.  The IOSCO members also agreed to undertake 
new areas of activity, including: an assessment of experiences in implementing full cooperation 
among  securities  regulators;  an  evaluation  of  the  role  and  conduct  of  securities  analysts;  a 
consideration of the application of fair value accounting for all financial instruments; a study of 
cross-  border  issues  relating  to  trading  halts;  and  a  review  of  investor  education  techniques 
relating to collective investment schemes in Emerging Markets Committee jurisdictions. 
 
At its meeting held at London in September 2001, the FSF reviewed how key financial systems 
and  markets  are  responding  to  the  world  economic  slowdown.  The  FSF  reviewed  the  actions 
taken so far to address the concerns raised in the March 2000 FSF Report on Offshore Financial 
Centres (OFCs).  The FSF members re-iterated the importance of OFCs disclosing assessment 
results and their plans for addressing areas that need improvement. The concern of EMC on the 
issue of Offshore Financial Centres was conveyed to the Forum. The Forum was informed that in 
the absence of a prudent regulatory and supervisory setup, the OFCs might become centres for 
nefarious financial activities, which may have a bearing on the securities markets  The Forum 
concurred that the OFCs need to improve their supervisory and co-operation practices.  
At the IOSCO Executive and Technical Meeting held in Rome in October, 2001, the members 
discussed their respective regulatory reactions relating to the September 11, 2001 events. They 
also  discussed  their  co-operation  on  related  enforcement  matters.  As  part  of  this  discussion, 
IOSCO identified two areas for further enquiry: 
?  Contingency Planning 
?  Expanded Co-operation and Information Sharing 
 
The  members  also  agreed  to  the  formation  of  a  special  Project  Team  to  explore  actions  that 
securities regulators should take in view of the events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath. 
 

The FSF held its first regional meeting in the Asia-Pacific region, in Tokyo, in October 2001. 
During  this  meeting  the  participants  exchanged  views  on  vulnerabilities  in  domestic  and 
international  financial  systems  in  the  current  conjuncture.  Against  the  backdrop  of  a  weak 
prospect for the world and regional economies, especially following the events of 11 September, 
participants felt that domestic financial systems have displayed resilience but that vigilance on 
the  soundness  of  the  financial  sector  in  individual  jurisdictions  remains  warranted.  They  also 
discussed changing patterns of capital flows in the region and noted that the decrease in inflows 
to  the  region,  if  sustained,  could  constrain  the  region’s  growth  prospects.  Participants  also 
discussed structural issues in the global financial system. They discussed ways to strengthen the 
domestic and regional financial systems. 
 
The  IOSCO-  APRC  Meeting  held  in  February  2002  in  Bali  focused  upon  the  issues  of 
international co-operation and enforcement, most notably the latest developments in fighting the 
proliferation  of  "cold-calling"  scams  in  the  region.    The  members  reiterated  their  resolve  to 
enhance co-operation in enforcement action against illegal securities activities 
 
vi.  Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers  

Consequent to the attack on the twin towers of World Trade Centre in USA on September 11, 2001, 
the stocks in Indian market had fallen steeply. In view of the extra-ordinary market situation and to 
propel purchase activity, amendment to Regulations was notified on October 24, 2001 providing for 
an increase in creeping acquisition limit from 5 per cent to 10 per cent for persons holding 15 per 
cent and above but less than 75 per cent. This enhanced limit is available upto September 30, 2002, 
subject to review, as and when required depending upon the experience. The amended Regulations 
also provide for disclosures regarding the acquisition and shareholding of the acquirer when such 
acquisition aggregates 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the voting rights.

viii.  Assessment and Prospects 
 
The SEBI has been taking measures to modernise the securities market to enhance its fairness, 
transparency and efficiency.  The SEBI had also stepped up its efforts to protect the integrity of 
the  market  through  various  risk  containment  measures,  surveillance  system  and  enforcement 
actions.   
 
Besides,  the  developments  in  the  securities  market  immediately  following  the  Union  Budget 
announcement for the year 20001-2002, have highlighted several concerns  about market design 
and effectiveness for speedy detection and deterrent action in the case of market frauds.  In the 
area of market design, the change of settlement cycles from account period to T+5 rolling and 
then to T+3 rolling for the entire market constitute a measure with far reaching consequences.  In 
contrast to the rapid pace of change in the equity market, the debt market both for government 
debt and corporate debt have seen less changes and as a result have suffered from weakness of 
market design.  The fledgling derivatives market in equities is now offering a new opportunity to 
investors  and  market  participants  for  hedging,  managing  risk  and  as  a  vehicle  for  speculation.  
Growth  of  this  segment  will  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  the  entire  securities  market.  
Keeping all these aspects and new developments in view, the SEBI has laid down its objectives 
and initiatives in the short and medium term as follows :
