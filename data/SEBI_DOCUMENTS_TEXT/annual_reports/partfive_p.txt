in  pursuance  of  an  announcement  made
during  the  budget  speech  in  February  2005.
There  are  six  different  schools  in  NISM

constituencies  in  the  securities  markets,  viz.,
investors,  issuers,  intermediaries,  regulator,
professionals  aspiring  to  enter  the  securities
industry  and  key  segments  that  influence
public  opinion.

acres  was  purchased  from  the  Maharashtra
Industrial  Development  Corporation  at
Patalganga  ,  about  60  km  from  Mumbai  on
the  Mumbai-Pune  Express  Highway  to
construct  a  residential  campus  for  NISM.  It
is estimated that the cost of the project would
be  about  Rs.  275  crore.  With  a  view  to
positioning  NISM  as  a 
for
development of quality of securities markets,
it  is  envisaged  that  financial  participation  in
NISM  would  be  open 
leading
organisations in the securities industry. NISM
would  be  a  public-private  partnership  in
terms of its funding as well as governance.

PROMOTION  OF  OFFICIAL
LANGUAGE  IN  SEBI

During  2007-08,  SEBI  continued  to
promote  the  official  language  relating  to
Indian  securities  market.  This  was  done  in
consonance  with  the  objectives  of  the  Board
and the Rajbhasha Mission.

In  order  to  facilitate  education  and
guidance  for  investors,  SEBI  has  made
available  the  material  not  only  in  Hindi
language  but  also 
in  other  regional
languages,  enabling  the 
investors  to
understand  various  capital  market  activities
and  accordingly  to  take  well-informed
decisions.  In  addition,  various  programmes
were  conducted  across  the  country  for
investors’ education and guidance exclusively
in  Hindi.  All  the  regulations  framed  by  the
Board  from  time  to  time  are  available  in
diglossic  form.

During  the  year,  induction  programmes
were  organised  for  the  newly  recruited
officers. The officers were made aware of the
various  requirements  of  official  language
policy of the Government of India and issues
relating  to  the  implementation  of  official
language. They were also made aware of the
various  infrastructural  facilities  available  in
SEBI for implementation of official language.

Recently,  SEBI  launched  its  Hindi
website. The main objective of Hindi website
is to provide the relevant information related
to  various  capital  market  activities,  for

of  executive  education  programmes  for
the  regulatory  staff  in  SEBI  and  other
jurisdictions  as  well  as  to  officers  from
the Government of India.

iv. NISM  is  discussing  with  leading
universities  to  design  and  offer  a
specialised  post-graduate  programme
titled as “Masters in Securities Markets”
(MSM).  NISM  intends  to  incubate  the
programme  and  subsequently  take  up
the  requisite  extension  work 
to
popularise MSM among universities and
colleges. It is expected that such strategy
would  provide  a  steady  stream  of
specially  qualified  professionals  to
manage the various complex tasks in the
securities  industry.

v. NISM has taken up the task of imparting
financial  literacy  to  various  segments  of
the  population.  This  involves  content

in  multiple  Indian  languages  and
offering
