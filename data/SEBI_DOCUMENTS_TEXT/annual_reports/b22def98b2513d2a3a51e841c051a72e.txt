Research and Other Studies
As the primary regulatory body for the securities markets, SEBI has been entrusted with fostering the development of Indian securities markets and for ensuring investor protection. It is of vital importance that the process of creating an institutional and policy framework for Indian securities markets that is being undertaken by SEBI be continuously informed by and evaluated through research and analysis of market conditions and practices which is of the highest quality.
In order to ensure that such research and analysis are specifically tailored to the needs of various departments, and are available at relatively short notice, it is necessary that these functions be carried out by a suitably staffed and equipped (with computer and library facilities) division within SEBI. At the end of 1996-97 SEBI was in the processing of strengthening its research staff through recruitment of professional economists.
