PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

Part One: Policies and Programmes

The Annual Report of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) presents the
policies  and  programmes  of  SEBI  and  its
working  and  operations  during  the  financial
year  2004-05  in  accordance  with  the  format
prescribed  in  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Board  of  India  (Annual  Report)  Rules,  1994
notified in the Official Gazette on April 7, 1994.
The  Report  articulates  the  manner  in  which
SEBI discharged its functions and exercised
its  powers  in  terms  of  the  Securities  and
Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992;  the
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956;
the Depositories Act, 1996; and the delegated
powers under the Companies Act, 1956. The
Report also reviews the developments in the
Indian  securities  market  during  the  financial
year  2004-05  within  the  evolving  regulatory
framework provided by SEBI. As enshrined in

the  SEBI  Act,  it  has  been  the  continuous
endeavour on the part of SEBI to achieve its
statutory objectives such as (a) protection of
interests  of  the  investors  in  securities,  (b)
development  of  the  securities  market,  (c)
regulation  of  the  securities  market,  and  (d)
matters  connected  therewith  and  incidental
thereto. SEBI, as a statutory body, has sought
to  balance  these  objectives  by  constantly
reviewing  and  assessing  its  policies  and
programmes,  initiating  new  guidelines  and
regulations  to  nurture  areas  hitherto
unregulated  or  inadequately  regulated  and
implementing  them  in  a  manner  so  as  to
promote  the  orderly  growth  of  the  capital
market with transparency, fairness, efficiency,
safety, and integrity. The major policy initiatives
and  developments  in  the  securities  market
during 2004-05 are furnished in Box 1.1.

Box 1.1: Major Policy Initiatives and Developments

in the Capital Market during 2004-05

Allocation of Shares to Retail Individual Investors
L Allocation of shares to retail individual investors has been increased from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of the
total issue of securities in case of book-built issues. The retail individual investor has been redefined as one
who  applies  or  bids  for  securities  of  or  for  a  value  not  exceeding  Rs.1  lakh,  as  against  the  earlier  limit  of
Rs. 50,000.

Issue Advertisement
L The  SEBI  Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection  (DIP)  Guidelines,  2000  were  amended  in  order  to  ensure
better  readability  of  the  issue  advertisements  appearing  on  television  and  to  reduce  the  cost  incurred  in
publishing pre-issue advertisements. The pre-issue advertisement which was mandatory for all public issues
(fixed and book-built) should now contain minimum details.

Introduction of Shelf Prospectus
L The facility of shelf prospectus was introduced for public sector banks, scheduled banks and public financial
institutions. They can file a draft shelf prospectus in the first instance disclosing the aggregate amount they
intend to raise through various tranches. Any amount of over-subscription can be retained by the issuer in
each tranche subject to the overall limit set for the year.

Green Shoe Option
L With an objective to widen the facility of Green Shoe Option, the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 were amended
to make it available in case of all public issues,  viz.,  initial public offerings, follow-on offerings, public issues
either  through  book  building  or  fixed  price  route.  All  pre-IPO  shareholders  (including  promoters)  in  case  of
IPOs  and  pre-issue  shareholders  holding  more  than  5  per  cent  shares  (including  promoters)  in  case  of
follow-on offerings can lend their shares for the purpose of green shoe option.

Issue Norms
L The SEBI (DIP) Guidelines 2000 on issue norms were amended to provide for a floor face value of Re.1 per
share  in  order  to  restrict  the  pre-IPO  splitting  of  shares.  The  face  value  has  to  be  necessarily  Rs.10  per
share  for  issue  price  below  Rs.500  and  in  cases  where  the  issue  price  is  Rs  500  or  more,  the  issuer
companies can fix the face value below Rs. 10 per share.

in the Capital Market during 2004-05 (Contd.)

L The  definition  of  the  minimum  application  lot  has  been  changed  from  Rs.2,000  to  a  band  of  Rs.5,000-

Rs.7,000. The applications can be made in multiples of such value.

L The  DIP  Guidelines  for  preferential  allotment  were  amended  to:  a)  restrict  sale  of  shares  by  shareholders
who are allotted shares on preferential basis; b) impose lock-in period on pre-preferential shareholding from
the relevant date till six months after the date of allotment; c) reduce the period for allotment from 30 to 15
days; and d) facilitate corporate debt restructuring.

Corporate Governance
L To improve the standards of corporate governance, SEBI amended Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement. The
major  changes  in  the  new  Clause  49  include  amendments/additions  to  provisions  relating  to  definition  of
independent  directors,  strengthening  the  responsibilities  of  audit  committees,  improving  quality  of  financial
disclosures, including those pertaining to related party transactions and proceeds from public/rights/preferential
issues,  requiring  Boards  to  adopt  formal  code  of  conduct,  requiring  CEO/CFO  certification  of  financial
statements  and  improving  disclosures  to  shareholders.  Certain  non-mandatory  clauses  like  whistle  blower
policy and restriction of the term of independent directors have also been included.

L The  implementation  schedule  of  the  amended  Clause  49  which  was  initially  proposed  to  be  effective  from

April 1, 2005 for listed companies has been extended to December 31, 2005.

Debt Listing Agreement
L In order to further develop the corporate debt market, SEBI prescribed a model debenture listing agreement

for all debenture securities issued by an issuer irrespective of the mode of issuance.

Rationalisation of Dematerialisation Charges
L The  existing  structure  of  dematerialisation  charges  has  been  rationalised  to  provide  benefits  to  investors.
With effect from February 1, 2005, certain charges paid by investors were removed which include charges
towards  opening  of  a  Beneficiary  Owner  (BO)  account,  credit  of  securities  into  BO  account  and  custody
charge  for  BO  account  opened  on  or  after  February  1,  2005.  With  effect  from  April  1,  2005,  the  custody
charges are not levied on any investor.

IndoNext
L The  first  phase  of  BSE  IndoNext  trading  platform  was  inaugurated  by  the  Honourable  Finance  Minister  on
January 7, 2005 to provide for a nation-wide trading platform for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Implementation of STP
L Mandatory processing of all institutional trades executed on the stock exchanges through the Straight Through
Processing (STP) was introduced with effect from July 1, 2004. This was in continuation of the efforts made
by  SEBI  to  ensure  the  inter-operability  between  the  STP  Service  Providers  through  the  setting  up  of  STP
Centralised Hub.

SEBI (STP Centralised Hub and STP Service Providers) Guidelines, 2004
L In order to regulate the STP service, SEBI issued the SEBI (STP Centralised Hub and STP Service Providers)
Guidelines,  2004  which  also  prescribed  the  model  agreement  between  the  STP  centralised  hub  and  the
STP  service  providers.  The  STP  Guidelines  prescribe  the  eligibility  criteria  and  conditions  of  approval,
obligations and responsibilities and code of conduct for the STP centralised hub and the STP service providers.
L In consonance with the internationally accepted ISO 15022 messaging standards, standardised transaction

work flow and messaging format for the STP system in India was specified by SEBI.

Derivatives
L In order to encourage the trading and clearing members of stock exchanges to use infrastructure of special
electronic  fund  transfer  (SEFT)  facility  as  laid  down  by  RBI  to  the  extent  possible,  the  members  are  now
given a choice to opt for payment of mark-to-market margins, either before the start of trading next day  i.e.,
on T day, or on the next day  i.e., T+1. In case the members opt to pay mark-to-market margin on T day, no
scaling up of initial margin would be applicable.

L Units  of  money  market  mutual  funds  and  units  of  gilt  funds  were  permitted  to  be  accepted  towards  cash

equivalent as part of the liquid assets of a clearing member.

L The eligbility criteria for indices on which futures and options are permitted to be introduced was modified to

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)
L The Union Government announced, within an overall External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) ceiling of US $
9 billion, a sub-ceiling of US $ 1.75 billion for FII investment in dated Government securities and Treasury
Bills, both under 100 per cent debt route and normal 70:30 route. Further, a cumulative sub-ceiling of US $
500 million for FII investment in corporate debt was announced over and above the sub-ceiling of US $ 1.75
billion. Both the sub-ceilings are separate and not fungible.

L FII  position  limits  in  the  equity  index  derivative  contracts  were  revised.  Accordingly,  FII  position  limit  in  all
index  options  and  futures  contracts  on  a  particular  underlying  index  shall  be  Rs.250  crore  (separately  for
futures  and  options)  or  15  per  cent  of  the  total  open  interest  of  the  market  in  index  futures  and  index
options, whichever is higher per exchange.

L The frequency of reporting of offshore derivative instruments by registered foreign institutional investors has

been made monthly.

L The  mutual  funds  and  FIIs  have  been  advised  to  enter  the  Unique  Client  Code  (UCC)  pertaining  to  the
parent  entity  at  the  order  entry  level  and  enter  the  UCCs  for  their  individual  schemes/sub-accounts  on  the
post-closing session.

SMILE Task Force
L A  Securities  Markets  Infrastructure  Leveraging  Expert  Task  Force  (SMILE  Task  Force)  was  constituted  by
SEBI to carry out a thorough ‘health check’ on the securities markets infrastructure encompassing all segments
of the markets (viz. equities, debt, derivatives, fund products) and covering all market participants such as
exchanges, trading platforms, clearing and settlement systems, payment systems, depositories, issue houses
(registrars) and other intermediaries, The Task Force has submitted reports on “Infrastructure and Process
Flow for the Primary Market” and “Infrastructure and Process Flows for Enhancing Distribution Reach in the
Mutual Fund Industry”. The Reports are under consideration of SEBI for implementation.

1. GENERAL MACRO-ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT
According  to  the  advance  estimates  of
the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the
real GDP at factor cost grew by 6.9 per cent
in  2004-05  as  compared  to  8.5  per  cent
(revised  estimates)  during  the  previous
financial  year  (Table  1.1).  The  deceleration
in  the  real  GDP  growth  was  mainly  due  to
uneven  and  deficient  monsoon  which  pulled
down  the  growth  rate  of  agricultural  sector
from 9.6 per cent in 2003-04 to 1.1 per cent
in  2004-05  (Table  1.2).  Notwithstanding
unfavourable monsoon and high base effect,
growth in the agricultural sector turned out to
be  better  than  anticipated  signifying  its
resilience  against  erratic  monsoon.  The
industrial sector grew by 8.3 per cent in 2004-
05 as against 6.5 per cent in 2003-04, partly
mitigating  the  setback  to  agriculture.  The
service  sector,  which  has  been  the  main
driver of growth in India, continued to sustain
high growth rate  i.e, 8.6 per cent in 2004-05
as  compared  with  8.9  per  cent  in  2003-04.
The average growth rate of real GDP during

the  first  three  years  (2002-05)  of  the  Tenth
Plan  period  was  higher  at  6.5  per  cent  than
that of 5.5 per cent achieved in the Ninth Plan
period  (1997-2002).  With  acceleration  in  the
growth rate, India is one of the fastest growing
economies of the world.

One  of  the  important  features  of  the
macro-economic  developments  in  2004-05
was  the  resurgence  of  the  industrial  sector.
Led by ‘manufacturing’ and ‘electricity, gas and
water supply’, recovery in the industrial sector
was  further  strengthened  and  broadened
during 2004-05. As a result, the contribution
of  the  industrial  sector  to  the  overall  GDP
growth went up to 26 per cent in 2004-05 from
17 per cent in 2003-04. Major factors behind
the  high  growth  of  the  manufacturing  sector
were buoyant exports, encouraging domestic
investment  climate,  increased  confidence
among  the  investors,  and  significant
improvement in domestic demand.

The services sector continued to remain
the  main  engine  of  growth  in  India  with  its
contribution  to  GDP  growth  reaching  a  high

Annual Report 2004-05

of 71 per cent in 2004-05 as compared with
59  per  cent  in  2003-04.  Within  the  services
sector,  the  growth  rate  in  2004-05  was
consolidated  in  case  of  ‘trade,  hotels,
restaurants,  transport  and  communication’
(11.3  per  cent),  maintained  in  case  of
‘financing, insurance, real estate and business
services’  (7.1  per  cent),  and  accelerated  in
case  of  ‘community,  social  and  personal
services’ (6.0 per cent) over the previous year.
The shares of services and industrial sectors
in GDP improved from 56.7 per cent and 21.6
per cent in 2003-04 to 57.6 per cent and 21.9
per  cent,  respectively  in  2004-05,  while  that
of  agricultural  sector  declined  from  21.7  per
cent to 20.5 per cent during the same period
(Chart 1.1).

According  to  the  CSO,  gross  domestic
savings  (GDS)  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  at
current  prices  increased  significantly  to  28.1
per  cent  in  2003-04  from  26.1  per  cent  in
2002-03  (Table  1.3).  Notwithstanding  low
interest  rates  prevailing  in  the  financial
markets,  household  savings,  particularly  in
financial  assets,  rose  considerably  in  2003-
04  over  the  previous  year.  Improvement  in

the  personal  disposable  income  emanating
from high GDP growth, modest inflation rate
and uncertainty in the financial markets seem
to have contributed to high rate of saving by
the  households.  Savings  by  the  private
corporate sector increased modestly reflecting
improvement  in  the  financial  results  of  the
joint stock companies, co-operative banks and
societies  etc.  Significant  reduction  in  the
public sector dis-saving also contributed to a
rise  in  aggregate  savings,  indicating  better
performance  in  government  administration,
PSUs and commitment of the government for
augmenting  revenue  and  reducing  deficit
under  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget
Management Act.

The  household  savings  in  financial
assets as proportion of GDP rose from 10.3
per  cent  in  2002-03  to  11.4  per  cent  in
2003-04.  Within  the  financial  savings  by
households,  ‘deposits’  continue  to  dominate
with  its  share  in  financial  assets  rising  from
41.5 per cent in 2002-03 to 42.9 per cent in
2003-04 (Chart 1.2). Other major components
of financial savings were contractual savings,
mainly life insurance (14.5 per cent), followed

by  small  savings  (13.7  per  cent),  provident
and  pension  funds  (13.0  per  cent),  and
currency (10.1 per cent). Investment in shares
and debentures in 2003-04 constituted 1.4 per
cent of the total household savings in financial
assets  which  was  lower  than  that  of  1.6  per
cent  in  the  previous  year.  Bulk  of  such
investment  was  in  mutual  funds.  In  terms  of
ratio  to  GDP,  investment  in  shares  and

debentures  in  2003-04  continued  to  remain
unchanged at the previous year’s level of 0.2
per cent.

A  notable  feature  of  macro-economic
developments during 2004-05 was the sharp
increase  in  non-food  credit.  Reflecting  a
robust  and  broad-based  industrial  recovery,
the  non-food  credit  disbursed  by  the

%

Annual Report 2004-05

scheduled commercial banks went up by 26.5
per cent in 2004-05 as compared to 18.4 per
cent  in  2003-04.  Food  credit  also  increased
during 2004-05 to support higher procurement
operations,  unlike  the  declining  trend
witnessed  during  the  previous  two  years.
Credit flow to industries also surged from the
non-bank  sources.  The  external  commercial
borrowings  and  equity  issues  were  much
higher in 2004-05 than those in the previous
year  in  consonance  with  the  resurgence  in
industrial activities and buoyancy in the stock
markets.  Resource  mobilisation  through
private  placements  was  also  impressive
during 2004-05. Mainly triggered by the capital
inflows,  the  liquidity  condition  was,  by  and
large,  comfortable  throughout  the  year.
Keeping  in  view  the  inflationary  pressure  on
the economy, the Reserve Bank mopped up
excess  liquidity  from  the  market  through  the
Market  Stabilisation  Scheme  (MSS)  and  the
Liquidity Adjustment Facility and thereby kept
the supply of broad money (M3) at 13.1 per
cent (net of conversion) which was well within
the projected trajectory of 14.0 per cent.

The price situation, after showing upward
trend  during  April-August  2004,  was  under
control  by  the  end  of  2004-05.The  inflation
rate,  measured  in  terms  of  changes  in  the
Wholesale  Price  Index  (WPI),  was  5.0  per
cent  on  a  point-to-point  basis  in  2004-05  as
compared to 4.6 per cent in 2003-04. On an
average  basis,  the  inflation  rate  at  6.4  per
cent  in  2004-05  was  much  higher  than  that
of  5.4  per  cent  in  the  previous  year.  The
supply  side  factors  were  mainly  responsible
for  inflationary  pressure  during  the  first  half
of the year. Increase in the international prices
of crude oil and metals led to the hardening
of  domestic  prices  of  coal,  petroleum
products,  iron  and  steel  and  other  metals.
Inadequate South-West monsoon also pushed
up  the  prices  of  food  items  and  non-food
commodities such as oilseeds and cotton. As
a  result,  inflation  rate  accelerated  to  a  peak
of  8.7  per  cent  by  the  end  of  August  2004.
The inflationary pressure has largely receded
since  September  2004.  Government’s
initiatives to cut the excise and customs duties
in June and August 2004 moderated the pass

&

through of the increase in international crude
oil prices to domestic inflation. Monetary policy
measures by the Reserve Bank such as the
hike  in  the  cash  reserve  ratio  (CRR)  and
increase  in  the  reverse  repo  rate  brought
down the inflation expectations. Prospects of
a bumper rabi crop and gradual easing of the
fear  of  drought  softened  the  prices  of
agricultural products like cotton, oilseeds and
edible oils.

The escalation of international crude oil
prices  dominated  the  external  sector
developments.  According  to  the  Directorate
General  of  Commercial  Intelligence  and
Statistics (DGCI&S), merchandise exports in
terms  of  US  dollar  witnessed  an  impressive
growth  of  24.1  per  cent  in  2004-05  as
compared with 21.1 per cent in the previous
year. The merchandise export growth was the
highest in three decades. Reflecting surge in
the international crude oil prices, total imports
in dollar terms increased sharply by 37.0 per
cent  in  2004-05  as  compared  with  27.3  per
cent in 2003-04. Merchandise import growth
was  the  highest  since  1980-81.  As  a  result,
the  gap  in  the  merchandise  trade  account
widened to a historic peak of US $ 27.8 billion
in  2004-05  compared  to  that  of  US  $  14.3
billion  in  the  previous  year.  Net  invisible
receipts,  mostly  in  terms  of  workers’
remittances,  software  exports  and  travel
earnings  bridged  the  trade  gap  to  a  large
extent. Unlike in the previous three years, the
external  current  account  is  likely  to  end-up
with  a  modest  deficit  in  2004-05  signaling
higher  domestic  investment  activities  and
reversal of net capital exports.

Net capital inflows continued to maintain
its  momentum  in  2004-05,  and  were
dominated by portfolio investment by FIIs. An
increased  appetite  for  foreign  direct
investment was also observed. This reflected
the on-going reforms in the capital market and
the  overall  liberalisation  programme.  During
April-December  2004,  net  capital  flows  at

US  $  20.7  billion  were  significantly  higher
than  US  $  16.6  billion  recorded  in  the
corresponding  period  of  the  previous  year.
Reflecting the innate strength of the external
sector, an accretion of US $ 28.6 billion during
2004-05 on top of an unprecedented accretion
of  US  $  36.9  billion  in  2003-04  took  India’s
foreign  exchange  reserves  to  US  $  141.5
billion as on March 31, 2005. India’s foreign
exchange reserves (excluding gold) were the
fifth largest in the world and the fourth largest
among  the  emerging  market  economies
(EMEs).  The  present  level  of  foreign
exchange  reserves  is  higher  than  India’s
external  debt  and  provides  import  cover  for
about 15 months. With sustained capital flows
and  a  general  weakening  of  the  US  dollar
vis-à-vis other major currencies, Indian rupee
appreciated  by  6.6  per  cent  against  the  U.S
dollar.

2. REVIEW OF POLICIES AND

PROGRAMMES
SEBI  pursued  several  policy  initiatives
during  2004-05  in  consultation  with  the
Government  of  India  to  achieve  its  statutory
objectives.  These  policies  and  programmes
are  reviewed  in  this  section  under  six  major
heads of primary securities market, secondary
securities  market,  mutual  funds,  foreign
institutional investors, corporate restructuring,
investor  awareness/education/protection  in
addition  to  ‘retrospect  and  prospects’
indicating the unfinished agenda for the future.

I.

Primary Securities Market
Primary  securities  market  continued  to
play a crucial role in the process of resource
mobilisation.  Wide-ranging  reforms  in  the
primary market undertaken by SEBI over the
years  improved  confidence  of  the  domestic
as well as foreign investors. The momentum
of  resource  mobilisation  from  the  primary
market  witnessed  in  2003-04  accelerated
further in 2004-05. The response of the FIIs,

'

Annual Report 2004-05

other institutional investors and retail investors
to  the  public  issues  has  been  highly
encouraging.  This  was  evident  from  over-
subscription  to  such  issues.  A  detailed
description of the number of issues, amount
mobilised,  variety  of  investors  and  their
response to public issues has been analysed
in  Part  Two  of  this  Report.  The  policy
initiatives  relating  to  primary  market  are
presented below.

a. Higher Allocation for Retail

Individual Investors
SEBI  amended  the  Disclosure  and
Investor  Protection  (DIP)  Guidelines,  2000
relating to the allocation of shares in case of
book-built  issues.  Earlier  the  allocation  of
shares to the Retail Individual Investors (RIIs),
the Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and the
Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) has been
in  the  ratio  of  25:25:50,  respectively.  The
allocation  to  RIIs  was  enhanced  to  35  per
cent  of  the  total  issue  of  securities  while  it
was  reduced  to  15  per  cent  in  case  of  NIIs.
Allocation to QIBs remained unchanged at 50
per  cent.  However,  in  case  of  book-built
issues  that  are  made  pursuant  to  the
requirement of mandatory allocation of 60 per
cent  to  QIBs  in  terms  of  Rule  19(2)(b)  of
SC(R)R,  RIIs  and  NIIs  would  receive  an
allocation  of  30  per  cent  and  10  per  cent,
respectively.  Moreover,  the  definition  of  RIIs
has  been  modified.  According  to  the  new
definition,  a  retail  individual  investor  (RII)  is
one  who  applies  or  bids  for  securities  of  or
for  a  value  not  exceeding  Rs.  1  lakh  as
against the existing limit of Rs. 50,000.

b.

Issue Advertisement

The extant market practice for all issues
including book-built issues was to publish an
advertisement  in  the  newspaper  having
contents  of  Form  2A  under  the  Companies
Act,  1956.  However,  the  cost  involved  in
publishing the entire Form 2A,  i.e., abridged

prospectus in the newspaper was very high.
As  the  abridged  prospectus  is  otherwise
available  to  the  investors  along  with  the
application  forms,  SEBI  amended  the  (DIP)
Guidelines, 2000 to ensure better readability
of the advertisement and stipulated that pre-
issue advertisement would be mandatory for
all  public  issues  (fixed  or  book-built)  and  it
would  contain  the  minimum  details,  thereby
reducing the issue expense.

c. Order of Presentation of

Disclosures in Prospectus
To make the offer documents more user-
friendly, SEBI prescribed a standard order of
presentation  of  disclosures  in  the  offer
documents.  Over  and  above  the  previous
requirements of disclosures while issuing the
format,  a  few  requirements  /  sections  like
summary,  table  of  contents,  and  industry
review  have  been  added  to  make  the
prospectus more effective. The standard order
of presentation did not, however, reduce the
flexibility given to the issuer to include other
disclosures, not mentioned in the guidelines.

d. Data Reporting at Websites of

Stock Exchanges on Book-
Building
In order to ensure availability of relevant
information  in  the  public  domain,  it  is  now
mandated to (i) improve the contents of and
to ensure uniformity in data dissemination on
the  websites  of  the  concerned  stock
exchanges  and  (ii)  to  ensure  availability  of
such data for a further period of 3 days after
the closure of the bids/issue.

e. Disclosure of Price Band/ Floor

Price and Bidding Period in Case
of Listed Companies
The existing guidelines require all issuers
(whether  listed  or  unlisted),  making  a  public
issue  through  book  building  process,  to
disclose the price band/ floor price in the Red
Herring  Prospectus  (RHP)/application  form.



Part One: Policies and Programmes

The  listed  issuers  have  now  been  permitted
to disclose the price band/floor price at least
one  day  before  bid  opening.  Moreover,  the
bidding  period,  which  was  5-10  days
(including holidays), has been reduced to 3-
7 working days.

f.

Introduction of the Facility of
Shelf Prospectus
As per Sec. 60A of the Companies Act,
1956,  the  facility  of  shelf  prospectus  can  be
availed  by  specific  entities  like  public  sector
banks, scheduled banks and public financial
institutions. The SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000
have been amended to provide for the same.
These entities can file a draft shelf prospectus
with SEBI in the first instance disclosing the
aggregate amount the issuer intends to raise
through various tranches.

g. Retention of Over-subscription by

DFIs in Tranche Issues
Financial institutions, which come out with
public issue of unsecured redeemable bonds,
regularly file a shelf prospectus with SEBI
stating the total amount to be raised during the
year through various tranches. These bonds
are usually used by investors as a tax-planning
mechanism. Over-subscriptions up to 100 per
cent in each tranche have been allowed to be
retained by the issuers. The Development
Financial Institutions (DFIs) often receive
heavy over-subscriptions, which exceed the
maximum target amount mentioned in the
prospectus. In such a scenario, returning the
excess subscription to the applicants adversely
affects the tax planning drive of the investors.
In  view  of  this,  SEBI  has  changed  the
guidelines so that the issuers can retain any
amount of over-subscription subject to the total
amount specified in the shelf prospectus for the
whole year.

h. Guidelines for Preferential Issues
The guidelines pertaining to preferential

allotment have been amended to restrict sale
of  shares  by  shareholders  who  are  allotted
shares  on  preferential  basis.  This  had  been
done,  inter  alia,  by  imposing  lock-in  period
on  pre-preferential  shareholding  from  the
relevant date till six months after the date of
allotment,  and  by  reducing  the  period  for
allotment  from  the  existing  30  days  to  15
days.

i.

just  before  an 

Restriction on Splitting of Shares
The  issuers  were  found  to  be  splitting
IPO.  On
shares 
recommendation  of  the  Advisory  Committee
on Primary Market, the guidelines have been
amended to restrict splitting of shares before
an IPO. The amendments,  inter alia, provide
for a floor face value of Re.1 per share. For
issue price below Rs.500 per share, the face
value would be necessarily Rs.10 per share.
However,  the  issuer  companies  have  been
permitted  to  fix  the  face  value  below  Rs.  10
per  share  in  those  cases  where  the  issue
price is Rs. 500 or more.

j.

Terms of the Issue
SEBI  has  now  changed  minimum
application  lot  from  Rs.  2,000  to  a  band  of
Rs.5,000- Rs.7,000. The applications can be
made in multiples of such value.

k. Green Shoe Option (GSO) Facility
As GSO is essentially a device to ensure
post-issue price stability, the guidelines have
been  amended  to  clarify  that  this  facility  is
available in all public issues, viz., initial public
offerings,  follow-on  offerings,  public  issues
either  through  book  building  or  fixed  price
route. Further, the guidelines have also been
amended to permit all pre-IPO share holders
(including promoters) in case of IPOs and pre-
issue share holders holding more than 5 per
cent shares, (including promoters) in case of
follow-on offerings to lend their shares for the
purpose of GSO.

Corporate Governance
SEBI  constituted  a  Committee  on
Corporate Governance headed by Shri N. R.
Narayana Murthy, which submitted its report
on  February  8,  2003.  Taking  a  cue  from  the
same, SEBI amended Clause 49 of the Listing
Agreement  to  revise  the  requirements  of
corporate  governance  as  mandated  by  the
listing agreement. For entities seeking listing
for  the  first  time,  the  corporate  governance
requirements are to be complied at the time
of  seeking  in-principle  approval  for  such
listing.  However,  for  listed  entities  having  a
paid-up  share  capital  of  Rs.  3  crore  and
above  or  net  worth  of  Rs.  25  crore  or  more
at  any  time  in  the  history  of  the  company,
corporate  governance  requirements  were
proposed  to  be  complied  by  April  1,  2005.
Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  many
companies  are  still  not  in  a  state  of
preparedness  to  be  fully  compliant  with  the
requirements, 
for  ensuring
compliance  with  the  corporate  governance
requirements  of  the  listing  agreement  has
been extended up to December 31, 2005.

the  date 

m. Debt Listing Agreement

In  order  to  develop  the  corporate  debt
market,  SEBI  prescribed  a  model  debenture
listing  agreement  for  listing  of  all  debenture
securities issued by an issuer irrespective of
the mode of issuance. The model agreement
has  three  parts.  Part  (I)  of  this  agreement
contains clauses which shall be complied by
all  issuers  irrespective  of  the  mode  of
issuance.  Part  (II)  contains  clauses  which
shall be complied only if the debentures are
issued  either  through  public  issue  or  rights
issue  and  Part  (III)  contains  clauses  which
are  required  to  be  complied  only  if  the
debentures  are  issued  on  private  placement
basis. In case of issuers whose equity shares
are listed and which have already entered into
a  listing  agreement  for  its  equity  shares,
clauses of equity listing agreement shall have

 

an overriding effect over the debenture listing
agreement, in case of inconsistency, if any.

II. Secondary Securities Market

a. BSE IndoNext Trading Platform

In the Union Budget 2004-05, the Central
Government  proposed  to  set  up  a  trading
platform  to  enable  the  small  and  medium
enterprises (SMEs) to raise capital, both debt
and equity, as well as provide liquidity to the
securities.  This  trading  platform  is  expected
to  provide  the  much  needed  avenue  for
financing  the  SMEs  and  help  redress  the
present  imbalance  in  this  regard.  SEBI  took
the  initiative  to  encourage  the  BSE  and  the
Regional Stock Exchanges (RSEs) to set up
this market (Box 1.2). The Government also
amended  Section  13  of  the  Securities
Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956 to facilitate
trading by brokers of RSEs on this market.

b. Securities Transaction Tax (STT)

In 

the  Union  Budget  2004-05,
Government  proposed  a  package  of  tax
measures  relating  to  securities  transactions.
The  tax  on  long  term  capital  gains  from
securities  transactions  was  abolished  while
the short-term capital gains tax was reduced
to a flat rate of 10 per cent. Moreover, it was
proposed to levy a tax on buyers at the rate
of  0.15  per  cent  of  the  value  of  securities
transacted on the stock exchanges in the form
of securities transaction tax (STT).

Pursuant to the representations received
from  the  market  participants,  the  STT  was
modified  by  the  Government  in  consultation
with  SEBI.  The  revised  STT  includes  inter
alia, the following:
 The  delivery-based  transactions  would
attract STT of 0.15 per cent (i.e., 15 basis
points) to be shared equally between the
buyer and the seller;

 For day traders and arbitrageurs, the STT
of 0.015 per cent (1.5 basis points) would

Box 1.2: BSE IndoNext

The  BSE  IndoNext  has  been  set  up  as  a
separate trading platform under the present Bombay
On  Line  Trading  System  (BOLT)  of  the  BSE.  It  is  a
joint initiative of the BSE and the Federation of Indian
Stock Exchanges (FISE) of which 18 Regional Stock
Exchanges  (RSEs)  are  members.  The  members  of
the RSEs have been allowed to trade in this market.
The BSE IndoNext trading platform has introduced the
concept of single order book for a security as against
multiple listings permitted in other securities. Once a
security  is  eligible  for  trading  in  the  BSE  IndoNext
market, it will not be available for trading on any other
exchange  and  orders  from  brokers  of  all  exchanges
in  that  security  will  flow  only  to  this  market.  The
objectives  of  the  BSE  IndoNext  trading  platform  are:
a)  to  provide  a  nation-wide  trading  platform  for  the
SMEs  already  listed  with  the  participating  RSEs  and
BSE;  b)  to  create  liquidity  in  eligible  securities  listed
on the participating RSEs; c) to create an avenue for
the  existing  and  new  SME  companies  from  various
regions of the country to raise fresh capital, both equity
and debt, which would help achieve balanced regional
growth;  and  d)  to  use  the  available  infrastructure  of
the participating RSEs for productive purposes.

The  BSE  IndoNext 

trading  platform  is  being
implemented in phases. Honourable Finance Minister
has  inaugurated  the  BSE  IndoNext  trading  platform

on January 7, 2005 and operationalised the first phase
of the BSE IndoNext platform. The BSE would transfer
eligible  securities  within  the  range  of  paid-up  capital
between Rs.3 crore and Rs.20 crore, currently traded
in the B1 and B2 groups in BSE against which there
is  no  regulatory  action.  Similarly,  the  participating
RSEs  will  also  transfer  eligible  securities  to  BSE
IndoNext  to be traded as permitted securities. At this
stage,  the  entire  responsibility  for  monitoring  and
surveillance  is  vested  with  BSE  as  the  brokers  who
would  be  trading  on  the  BSE  IndoNext  will  be
members of BSE. For this purpose, SEBI has already
granted necessary approvals.

The second phase when implemented will allow
participation  of  all  brokers  of  RSEs  in  the  BSE
IndoNext  taking  benefit  of  the  recent  amendment  to
the SC(R)A. For this, the BSE and the RSEs will have
to  amend  the  respective  Bye-laws  as  well  as  enter
into MoUs. These legal requirements are in progress.
Once the Bye-laws are approved by SEBI, the second
phase  will  be  implemented  and  the  responsibility  for
surveillance, monitoring and compliance will be jointly
shared  between  BSE  and  RSEs.  In  the  third  phase,
the  BSE  as  well  as  the  RSEs  will  have  to  work  out
an  effective  marketing  and  business  development
strategy.

be  imposed  on  sellers  of  equities  and
settled on net basis;

In  the  Union  Budget  2005-06,  the  STT

was further revised as under (Table 1.4).

 For units of equity oriented mutual funds,
the STT of 0.15 per cent (15 basis points)
would be imposed on sellers;

 The  rate  of  STT  on  sale  of  derivatives
(Futures and Options) would be 0.01 per
cent (1 basis points); and

 No  STT  would  be  levied  on  buying  and
selling  of  bonds,  including  government
bonds,  units  of  MFs  other  than  equity
oriented funds.

The STT was notified on September 28,
2004.  The  stock  exchanges  have  been
advised  to  levy  and  collect  STT  on  all
transactions done by their members and remit
the  same  to  the  Government  of  India  with
effect from October 1, 2004.

c. SEBI (Central Database of Market

Participants) Regulations, 2003

The  SEBI  (Central  Database  of  Market
Participants) Regulations, 2003 were notified
on  November  20,  2003.  The  regulations
provide  for  the  creation  of  a  centralised
database of market participants and investors
(MAPIN  database)  for  the  registration  of  all
the  participants  i.e.,  intermediaries,  listed
companies,  investors,  etc.,  in  the  Indian
securities  market  by  allotting  a  Unique
Identification  Number  (UIN).  SEBI  has
appointed  National  Securities  Depository
Limited  (NSDL)  as  the  Designated  Service
Provider  for  creating  and  maintaining  the
MAPIN database.

SEBI has been issuing notifications from
time to time specifying various intermediaries
and  the  related  persons  to  obtain  an  UIN
under  the  aforesaid  regulations.  The  list  of
various  intermediaries  has  been  notified  for
this purpose and the date by which they have
to obtain the UIN has also been notified. Up
to  March  31,  2005,  as  many  as  2,94,925
UINs have been allotted (Table 1.5).

Keeping  in  view  the  various  repre-
sentations  and  feedback  received  from
“specified investors”, viz. “all resident investors
not being bodies corporate who enter into any
securities  market  transaction  (including  any

transaction  in  units  of  mutual  funds  or
collective  investment  schemes)  of  value  of
one  lakh  rupees  or  more”,  on  the  difficulties
faced by them in adhering to the time line of
March  31,  2005,  the  “notified  date”  was
extended from March 31, 2005 to December
31,  2005.  Further,  a  Committee  has  been
constituted  to  look  into  the  coverage  of
MAPIN and other related matters.

The  terms  of  reference  for  the  said

committee are as follows:

i) To  re-examine  the  coverage  of  the
MAPIN,  i.e.,  the  category  of  market
participants and investors who would be
required  to  obtain  unique  identification
number (UIN);

ii) To  suggest  future  implementation

schedule based on the coverage; and

iii) To review the cost of obtaining the UIN
for the market participants and investors.

Investor Protection Measures

(i) Risk Management Framework for the

the  various 

Cash Market
A  comprehensive  risk  management
framework in T+2 rolling settlement scenario
was  specified  for  the  cash  market  providing
for 
types  of  margins,
categorisation of stocks for margin purposes
and collection of margins on an upfront basis.
Value at Risk (VaR) based margining system
was put in place based on the categorisation
of  stocks  into  Groups  I,  II  and  III  depending
on  the  stocks’  liquidity  and  volatility.  It
addresses  99  per  cent  of  the  risks  in  the
market. Additional margins were specified to
address the balance 1 per cent risks. Further,
provisions were specified for shortfall of pay-
in of funds/margin, collections of margins by
members  from  the  client  etc.  The  revised
framework when implemented will be a step
forward in achieving cross-margining between
cash and derivative markets.

Protection Fund (IPF)/Customer
Protection Funds (CPF) at the Stock
Exchanges
Comprehensive  guidelines  were  issued
for constitution and management of IPF/CPF
and disbursement of the funds out of the IPF/
CPF towards settlement of legitimate investor
claims against the defaulter members of the
stock  exchanges.  The  exchanges  are  in  the
process of amending the Trust Deeds for IPF.

(iii) Duration for Transfer of Funds and

Securities
It was mandated that the brokers should
transfer  funds  and  securities  to  the  clients
within one working day after the pay-out day.

e. Matters Relating to Depositories

(i) Review of Dematerialisation Charges

Investors have been representing to SEBI
seeking  a  reduction  in  the  charges  paid  by
them for dematerialisation of securities. As a
first  step,  it  was  decided  to  rationalise  the
existing charge structure. Accordingly, effective
February 1, 2005, (a) no investor is required
to  pay  any  charge  towards  opening  of  a
Beneficiary  Owner  (BO)  account  except  for
statutory  charges  as  may  be  applicable;  (b)
no investor is required to pay any charge for
credit  of  securities  into  his/her  BO  account;
and (c) no custody charge is to be levied on
any investor opening a BO account on or after
February  1,  2005.  With  effect  from  April  1,

* Plus service tax as applicable.

2005, the custody charges are not levied on
any investor. However, the depositories may
levy and collect the charges towards custody
from the issuers, on a per folio (ISIN position)
basis  as  at  the  end  of  the  financial  year.
Issuers  have  to  pay  at  the  rate  of  Rs.5.00
(plus  applicable  service  tax)  per  folio  (ISIN
position) in the respective depositories, subject
to a minimum amount (Table 1.6). The issuers
are  required  to  pay  custody  charges  to  the
depository with whom they have established
connectivity based on the total number of folios
(ISIN  positions)  as  on  31st  March  of  the
previous  financial  year  or  the  minimum
amount, as the case may be, by 30th April of
each financial year failing which depositories
may  charge  penal  interest  subject  to  a
maximum of 12 per cent per annum.

(ii) Proof of Identity (PoI) and Proof of

Address (PoA) for Opening a BO
Account

The list of documents as PoI and/or PoA
for  opening  a  BO  account  has  been
broadened  to  include  MAPIN  card,  identity
card  issued  by  Central/State  Governments,
Statutory/Regulatory authorities, Public Sector
Undertakings (PSUs), Scheduled Commercial
Banks, Professional Bodies etc.

signature, as governed under the Information
Technology  Act,  2000,  subject  to  the  DP
entering into a legally enforceable agreement
with the BO for this purpose.

(v) Shifting Securities from Trade-for-Trade
Segment to Normal Rolling Segment on
a Regular Basis

Based on the information provided by the
depositories  regarding  the  establishment  of
connectivity by the listed companies with both
the  depositories,  the  stock  exchanges  have
been advised on a regular basis to shift such
companies  which  had  not  established  dual
connectivity from the Trade-for-Trade segment
to  normal  rolling  segment  of  the  stock
exchanges,  upon  their  establishing  dual
connectivity,  provided  there  are  no  other
specific grounds for continuation of the trading
in  these  scrips  in  the  Trade-for-Trade
segment.

Policy Initiatives for Market
Intermediaries

In  order  to  bring  about  uniformity  in
documentary  requirements  across
different  segments  and  exchanges  and
also to avoid duplication and multiplicity
of documents, SEBI in consultation with
stock  exchanges  (BSE  and  NSE)  has
formulated  uniform  set  of  broker  client
registration  and  agreement  documents.
The  same  have  been  made  applicable
from April 1, 2005.

In  order  to  disseminate  information
regarding  cancellation  of  registration  of
brokers  and  cautioning  the  investing
public not to deal with 70 brokers whose
registration has been cancelled by SEBI
during  2003-04,  a  public  notice  was
published  in  the  newspapers.  In  the
interest of investors, it has been decided
to  publish  such  information  at  periodic
intervals.

In  order  to  promote  greater  disclosure
of information in the interest of investors
and from the point of view of measuring
the  adequacy  of  systems  and  controls
to  meet  internal  as  well  as  external
compliance requirements, a draft concept
paper  on  the  professional  rating  of
market  intermediaries  (viz.,  stock
brokers, initially to start with) was placed
on SEBI website for public comments.

(iii)

(iv) SEBI  has  requested  credit  rating
agencies  to  develop  an  appropriate
rating model for stock brokers, based on
the  parameters  set  out  in  the  concept

Considering  the  public  response  and
market acceptance to the rating concept
for  stock  brokers,  the  concept  may  be
extended 
other
intermediaries as well.

g. Policy Initiatives for Derivatives

Currently, a variety of derivative products
are available for trading in India. Index based
derivatives are traded on BSE Sensex on the
derivative segment of BSE and on S&P CNX
Nifty and CNX IT Index on the F&O segment
of NSE. Single Stock Options and Single Stock
Futures  are  also  available  on  a  number  of
individual  stocks  at  both  the  derivative
segment  of  BSE  and  the  F&O  segment  of
NSE. Interest rate derivatives were introduced
on a notional 10-year bond and 91 days T-bill
at the F&O segment of NSE.

(i) Risk Containment Measures

The  initial  margins  on  derivatives  are
computed  to  cover  the  probable  loss  over  a
time horizon. Therefore, in the event that the
mark  to  market  margins/  settlements  are
being  made  after  the  beginning  of  trade  on
next day (T+1), the initial margins are scaled
up  by  the  square  root  of  the  days  by  which
margins  are  actually  collected.  With  the
functioning  of  Special  Electronic  Fund
Transfer  facility  (SEFT)  with  many  bank
branches,  members  are  now  given  a  choice
to opt for payment of mark to market margins
either before the start of trading next day, i.e.,
T+0  or  on  the  next  day,  i.e.  T+1.  If  the
member opts for the payment of the mark to
market margins on T+1, then correspondingly
higher  initial  margins  are  collected  to  cover
the potential for losses over the time elapsed
in the collection of mark to market margins.

Another  risk  containment  measure
relates to alignment of collaterals in cash and
derivatives  market.  Two  liquid  asset
requirements were included in the derivatives
market:  (a)  units  of  money  market  mutual
funds  and  units  of  gilt  funds  were  permitted
to be accepted towards cash equivalents as

part of the liquid assets of a clearing member;
and  (b)  equity  securities  classified  under
Group  I  in  the  underlying  cash  market  were
permitted  to  be  accepted  towards  the  non-
cash  component  (securities)  of  liquid  assets
in the derivative markets. Further, units of all
equity mutual funds are also accepted as the
securities under the liquid assets.

(ii) Eligibility Criteria of Stocks on which

Futures and Options Contracts may be
Permitted

Pursuant  to  the  recommendation  of  the
Advisory  Committee  on  Derivatives  and
Market  Risk  Management,  SEBI  revised  the
requirement of the stock’s quarter sigma order
size  from  Rs.  5  lakh  to  Rs.  1  lakh  and  the
market-wide position limit of the ‘eligible stock’
was prescribed at a minimum of Rs. 50 crore.
This  provision  was  introduced  to  prevent
stocks  with  a  low  market  capitalisation  from
becoming eligible for derivative trading.

(iii) Eligibility Criteria for Selection of Indices

for Futures and Options Contracts

In order to encourage the introduction of
derivative  contracts  on  sectoral  indices,  the
eligibility criteria for indices on which futures
and  options  are  permitted  to  be  introduced
was also modified. It had earlier been specified
that derivative contracts on a new stock index
shall  be  permitted  if  the  stocks  contributing
80 per cent weightage (earlier 90 per cent) in
the index are individually eligible for derivatives
trading as per the eligibility criteria. However,
no  single  ineligible  stock  should  have  a
weightage of more than 5 per cent in the index.
Additionally,  the  eligibility  criteria  for  indices
were also made into a continuous requirement
similar to that of stocks.

(iv) Market-wide Position Limits for Single

Stock Derivatives

In order to avoid frequent triggering of

%

Annual Report 2004-05

market wide position limits, the market wide
position limits for single stock derivative
contracts was modified to be the lower of 30
times the average number of shares traded
daily during the previous calendar month, in the
relevant  underlying  security  in  the  cash
segment; or 20 per cent (instead of 10 per cent
earlier) of the number of shares held by non-
promoters in the relevant underlying security.

(v) Enforcement of Market-wide Position

Limits through Administrative Measures

According  to  the  extant  guidelines,  the
exchanges were required to double the price
scanning  range  when  80  per  cent  of  the
market-wide  limit  was  reached.  Such  a
measure was adopted due to technical issues
involved in implementing market wide position
limits.  It  was  felt  that  the  margining  system
should be used only to address the solvency
risk  of  the  market  and  not  for  any  other
purpose,  such  as  enforcing  market-wide
position limits. Therefore, the doubling of price
scanning  range  was  done  away  with  and  it
was stipulated that market-wide position limits
may  be  enforced  administratively  by  the
exchanges / Clearing Corporation / House.

(vi) FII Position Limits in Index Derivatives

Index  based  derivative  contracts  are
mainly  used  by  large  portfolio  investors  to
manage 
their  portfolio  risk.  Further,
considering the growth in the index derivative
markets,  and  considering  that  a  limit  linked
to  the  value  of  the  portfolio  of  investment  in
the underlying cash market in addition to an
absolute  figure  would  serve  better,  the  FII
position  limits  in  index  derivatives  were
increased  as  follows:  (a)  FII  position  limit  in
all  index  options  contracts  on  a  particular
underlying index has been modified to Rs.250
crore or 15 per cent of the total open interest

of  the  market  in  index  options,  whichever  is
higher, per exchange; and (b) FII position limit
in  all  index  futures  contracts  on  a  particular
underlying index has been modified to Rs.250
crore or 15 per cent of the total open interest
of  the  market  in  index  futures,  whichever  is
higher, per exchange.

In  addition  to  the  above,  the  FIIs  have
been allowed to take positions in equity index
derivatives in designated accounts subject to
the following limits:

(a) Short positions in index derivatives (short
futures, short calls and long puts) in the
designated  account  not  exceeding  (in
notional value) the FII’s holding of stocks
in the designated account.

(b) Long positions in index derivatives (long
futures, long calls and short puts) in the
designated  account  not  exceeding  (in
notional value) the FII’s holding of cash,
government securities, T-Bills and similar
instruments in the designated account.

(vii) Trading Member Position Limits in Index

Derivatives

It  was  earlier  specified  that  the  trading
member  limit  in  index  derivatives  on  a
particular underlying index would be Rs. 100
crore or 15 per cent of the total open interest
on the market in index derivatives, whichever
is  higher,  per  exchange.  This  limit  was
increased as follows:



The trading member position limit in near
month  contracts  of  all  index  options
contracts on a particular underlying index
was stipulated to be Rs.250 crore or 15
per cent of the total open interest of the
market  in  index  options,  whichever  is
higher, per exchange.



The trading member position limit in near

&

Part One: Policies and Programmes

month  contracts  of  all  index  futures
contracts on a particular underlying index
was stipulated to be Rs.250 crore or 15
per cent of the total open interest of the
market  in  index  futures,  whichever  is
higher, per exchange.



Trading  members  were  allowed  to  take
an  exposure  of  Rs.500  crore  or  15  per
cent  of  total  open  interest  whichever  is
higher,  in  interest  rate  derivative
products.

(viii) Alignment of Contract Sizes of Existing

Derivative Contracts

SEBI  prescribed  the  methodology  for
alignment  of  contract  sizes  of  existing
derivative contracts to Rs. 2 Lakh. SEBI, vide
letter  dated  March  17,  2005,  delegated  the
authority  to  the  exchanges  to  align  the
contract  sizes  of  derivative  contracts
whenever necessary, in consultation with each
other.

h.

Implementation of STP
The Straight Through Processing (STP)
was launched in India on November 30, 2002.
To  start  with,  STP  was  insisted  upon  to  be
adopted  by  the  domestic  institutions,
investors,  fund  managers,  brokers  and
custodians.  However,  it  was  observed  that
though the market participants had joined the
STP services, the system could not be widely
used due to various issues like lack of inter-
operability  between  the  STP  Service
Providers,  lack  of  message  handshake
protocols,  lack  of  common  authentication  of
digital  signatures  across  the  STP  Service
Providers,  lack  of  end-to-end  compliance  to
ISO  messaging  formats  from  sender  to  the
recipient  and  absence  of  standardisation  of
file 
for  client’s  back  office
development etc.

formats 

To  resolve  the  issue  of  inter-operability
between the STP Service Providers and other
issues,  SEBI  in  consultation  with  the  stock
exchanges  and  the  STP  Service  Providers
decided  that  a  STP  Centralised  Hub  would
be set up. Currently, this STP Centralised Hub
has  been  set  up  and  made  operational  by
NSE. NSE obtained the necessary approvals
from the Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) as an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Subsequently,  this  STP  Centralised  Hub
would be further developed jointly with BSE.

Mandatory Use of STP for all Institutional
Trades

SEBI  mandated  the  use  of  the  Straight
Through  Processing  (STP)  system  for  all
institutional  trades  with  effect  from  July  1,
2004. SEBI had prescribed a detailed system
flow and the regulatory framework of the STP
system by issuing the SEBI (STP Centralised
Hub and STP Service Providers) Guidelines,
2004. SEBI also outlined the transaction work
flow  for  the  system  of  Straight  Through
Processing  (STP)  and  prescribed  the
messaging  formats  based  on  internationally
accepted  ISO  15022  messaging  standards.
There are currently four STP service providers
and STP centralised hub has been set up by
NSE.  There  has  been  a  steady  increase  in
number  of  messages  passing  through  STP
network with approximately 2,500 STP users
registered in the system.

SEBI  is  the  first  and  perhaps  the  only
regulator in the world to have prescribed and
mandated  a  market-wide  STP  system,
prescribe  a  regulatory  framework  along  with
the  system  flow,  transaction  work  flow  and
detailed  messaging  standards  for  the  STP
system.

Corporatisation and
Demutualisation (C and D)
of Stock Exchanges
Corporatisation  and  Demutualisation
enables  the  exchanges  to  transform  from  a
mutual  entity  to  a  for-profit  demutualised

company  with  the  separation  of  ownership,
trading  rights  and  management  (Box  1.3).
To enable the exchanges to corporatise and
demutualise,  the  Government  amended  the
SC(R)A  encouraging  SEBI  to  approve  the
schemes.

Box 1.3: Corporatisation and Demutualisation (C and D) of Stock Exchanges in India

The  stock  exchanges  world  over  have  been
generally formed as ‘mutual’ organisations. The trading
members not only provide broking services, but also
own,  control  and  manage  such  exchanges  for  their
mutual  benefit.  They  don’t  generally  distribute  profit
among themselves and therefore, termed as ‘not-for-
profit’  organisations.  Stock  exchanges  owned  by
members may work towards the interest of members
alone which may be detrimental to the rights of other
stakeholders. There could also be conflict of interest
between  ownership  and  management.  In  order  to
eliminate  conflict  of  interest,  there  is  a  need  to
segregate the management functions from ownership
and trading rights through demutualisation. Moreover,
stock  exchanges  should  ideally  work  as  body
corporate  similar  to  any  other  ‘for-profit’  corporate
entity.

In India, there are 23 stock exchanges of which
one was derecognised in August 2004. Three of them
namely,  The  Stock  Exchange,  Mumbai  (BSE),
Ahmedabad  Stock  Exchange  (ASE)  and  Madhya
Pradesh Stock Exchange (MPSE) are ‘Association of
Persons’.  The  remaining  19  are  registered  as
companies, either limited by guarantees or by shares.
Except  NSE,  all  stock  exchanges  are  ‘not-for-profit’
organisations.  Moreover,  all  exchanges  are  ‘mutual’
organisations  except  NSE  and  OTCEI  where
ownership, management and trading rights are in the
hands  of  three  different  sets  of  people  from  the
inception.

Pursuant  to  the  announcement  made  by  the
Honourable  Finance  Minister  in  the  Parliament  on
March  13,  2001  that  the  stock  exchanges  would  be
corporatised  and  demutualised,  SEBI  constituted  a
Group  on  Corporatisation  and  Demutualisation  of
Stock Exchanges under the Chairmanship of Justice
M. H. Kania, former Chief Justice of India, for advising
SEBI  on  corporatisation  and  demutualisation  of
exchanges and to recommend the steps that need to
be  taken  to  implement  the  same.  Based  on  the

recommendations  of  the  Group,  all  the  stock
exchanges were advised to submit their proposals for
C and D to SEBI for approval.

In  the  meantime,  the  Securities  Laws
(Amendment)  Ordinance,  2004  was  promulgated  on
October  12,  2004,  which  amended  the  Securities
Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956  to  facilitate  the
corporatisation  and  demutualisation  of  Stock
Exchanges.  The  Ordinance  was  subsequently
replaced  by  the  Securities  Laws  (Amendment)  Act,
on January 7, 2005. The Act makes it mandatory that
all  stock  exchanges,  if  not  already  corporatised  and
demutualised, shall be corporatised and demutualised
on  and  from  the  appointed  date  so  notified  in  the
official gazette by SEBI. It obligates the non-corporate
and mutual exchanges to submit, within such time as
may  be  specified  by  SEBI,  a  scheme 
for
corporatisation  and  demutualisation  to  SEBI  for
approval.

Following the promulgation of the Ordinance, a
meeting of all stock exchanges and the Depositories
was  convened  by  SEBI  on  November  9,  2004  to
evolve  the  road  map  for  corporatisation  and
demutualisation  and  a  tentative  time  schedule  of  its
implementation.  Exchanges  were  advised  to  adhere
to  the  time  schedule.  A  press  release  indicating
tentative time schedule of C&D was issued on January
7,  2005.  Thereafter,  SEBI  had  several  rounds  of
discussions with all the stock exchanges to clarify and
sort  out  their  specific  issues  and  to  guide  them  to
prepare their schemes in compliance with the SCRA.
The discussions were quite protracted as there were
several  legal  issues  involved.  The  exchanges  were
advised  to  submit  their  final  schemes  to  SEBI  for
approval  latest  by  January  31,  2005.  With  the
submission of the scheme by BSE on March 9, 2005,
the  schemes  from  all  the  exchanges  were  received.
The Corporatisation and Demutualisation of the BSE
was notified on May 20, 2005.

 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

As  provided  in  the  SC(R)A,  SEBI  vide
notification  dated  March  23,  2005,  has
specified  that  the  National  Stock  Exchange
of India Limited, which is already corporatised
and  demutualised  would  not  be  required  to
submit  a  scheme  to  SEBI  for  approval,
subject to the following conditions:





The  National  Stock  Exchange  of  India
Limited  shall  not  change  its  current
corporate  and  demutualised  structure,
without prior approval of SEBI; and

The  National  Stock  Exchange  of  India
Limited  shall  comply  with  further
conditions as may be imposed by SEBI
in this regard from time to time.

The process of C and D involves transfer
of  assets  from  the  exchanges  which  are
Associations of Persons / Companies limited
by  Guarantee  /  Not-for-profit  Companies  to
the  emerging  corporate  demutual  exchange
and  such  transfer  attracts  stamp  duty.  To
facilitate  the  process  of  corporatisation  and
demutualisation and to make it tax-neutral, the
Honourable  Finance  Minister,  in  the  current
year’s  Budget,  has  proposed  a  one-time
exemption  from  payment  of  stamp  duty  on
notional transfer of assets from the exchanges
which are Association of Persons/Companies
limited  by  Guarantee  /  Not-for-profit
Companies  to  the  emerging  corporate
demutual exchange.

j. Other Developments





Detailed  guidelines  have  been  issued
specifying  the  disclosures  to  be  made
by  listed  companies  which  resort  to
changing of names frequently.

The  stock  exchanges  have  been
advised  to  include  the  value  of  the
membership card as liquid assets for the



purposes  of  net  worth  calculation  of
members.

The  Mutual  Funds  and  FIIs  have  been
advised to enter the Unique Client Code
for  the  parent  entity  at  the  order  entry
level  and  enter  the  UCCs  for  their
individual  schemes/sub-accounts  in  the
post closing session.

III. Mutual Funds

a. Key Information Memorandum

(KIM)
Considering  the  developments  in  the
securities market in India and abroad and also
keeping in view the interests of the investors,
SEBI  initiated  a  dialogue  with  the  industry
including  AMFI  for  a  standardised  format  of
Key Information Memorandum (KIM). Taking
into  account  the  inputs  received,  a  revised
standardised format of KIM was introduced.

b. Compliance Test Report (CTR)

In  order  to  facilitate  smooth  operational
flow  and  synchronise  the  frequency  of
submission of two different documents by the
mutual  funds,  guidelines  were  issued  to
mutual  funds  for  submitting  the  Compliance
Test Report (CTR) from the next financial year
(2005-06) to SEBI once in every two months
(instead of once in three months).

c. Minimum Number of Investors and
Maximum  Percentage  of  Corpus
held  by  the  Investors  in  Scheme/
Plan of Mutual Funds
SEBI issued guidelines and clarification,
that  the  mutual  fund  schemes/plans,  which
existed  on  December  12,  2003  (the  date  of
the  issue  of  circular)  and  did  not  have  a
minimum  of  20  investors  or  where  one
investor  was  holding  more  than  25  per  cent
of  the  corpus  of  the  schemes/plans,  were

 

Annual Report 2004-05

required to be wound up by January 31, 2005.
All the schemes/plans are required to comply
with  both  the  aforementioned  conditions
stipulated  in  the  guideline.  However,  the
guideline  is  not  applicable  to  Exchange
Traded Funds.

d. Enhancing the Reach of Mutual

Funds
In order to carry out a complete ‘health
check’ of the securities market infrastructure,
SEBI had constituted a High Level Task Force
namely  Securities  Markets  Infrastructure
Leveraging  Expert  Task  Force  (SMILE  Task
Force)  which  has  submitted, 
inter  alia,  its
report to SEBI on “Infrastructure and Process
Flow  for  Enhancing  Distribution  reach  in  the
Mutual  Fund  Industry”.  The  report  of  the
SMILE  Task  Force  is  under  consideration  of
SEBI.

of  FIIs  from  countries  like  Denmark,  Italy,
Belgium, Canada, Sweden, Ireland etc., went
up  in  2004-05.  Category–wise,  foreign
institutional  investors  such  as  mutual  funds,
investment  trusts,  managers  of  such  funds,
banks have been in dominance. In the current
year, foreign pension funds, widely accepted
as  long  term  investors,  showed  increased
interest in Indian securities markets and many
of  them  got  registered  as  FIIs.  Some  of  the
important pension funds, registered during the
financial  year  as  FIIs  were  CalPERS,  UN
Employees’  Pension  Fund,  General  Motors
Employees’  Pension  Fund,  US  State  Govt.
Pension  Funds,  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment
Trust,  Public  School  Retirement  System  of
Missouri,  Lonmodtagernes  Dyrtidsfond,
Stichting  Gemeenschappelijk  Beheer
En  Administratie  Beroepspensioenfondsen
Artsen etc.

investment 

Earlier,  the  limit  for  FII  investments  in
debt securities was US $ 1 billion. The Union
Government  announced,  within  the  overall
External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) ceiling
of US $ 9 billion, a sub-ceiling of US $ 1.75
billion 
in  dated
Government  securities  and  Treasury  Bills,
both  under  100  per  cent  debt  route  and
normal  70:30  route  for  2004-05.  Further,  a
cumulative  sub-ceiling  of  US  $  500  million
was  announced  for  FII  investment  in
corporate  debt,  over  and  above  the  sub-
ceiling  of  US  $  1.75  billion.  Both  the  sub-
ceilings are separate and not fungible.

b. FII Registrations

Traditionally,  most  of  the  institutions
registered as FIIs have been from the United
States  of  America  and  the  United  Kingdom.
Though  the  trend  continues,  the  registration

  

Certain  amendments  to  the  SEBI
(Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and
Takeovers)  Regulations,  1997  were  notified
on  August  30,  2004.  These  amendments
were  made  to  further  safeguard  the  interest
of  investors  and  to  eliminate  operational
difficulties  faced  in  implementation  of  the
regulations. These include:

(i) Reduction in the Time Period of Open

The current time cycle of the open offer
has been reduced from 120 days to 90
days.

(iii) Restriction on the Participation of

Merchant Bankers in the Open Offer
and its Disclosure Requirement
Merchant bankers are restricted to deal in
the scrip of target company during the period
commencing from the date of their appointment
in terms of Regulation 13 till 15 days from

also have to disclose their shareholding in the
target  company,  if  any,  in  the  public
announcement as well as in the letter of offer.

b. SEBI (Buy-Back of Securities)

Regulations, 1998
Taking 

into 

consideration 

the
development in the field of buy-back activities
and  continuous  development  in  the  market
and  in  order  to  further  strengthen  the
disclosures as made in the existing Letter of
Offers,  certain  additional  disclosure
requirements  were  specified.  Accordingly,  a
standard  format  of  the  letter  of  offer  along
with  the  general  instructions/guidelines  was
prepared and issued on May 7, 2004. Further,
in order to reduce the cost of buy-back offers
and  to  keep  pace  with  the  development  in
the  field  of  buy-back  activities,  the  following
amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Buy-Back  of
Securities) Regulations, 1998 were notified on
June 18, 2004. These include:

(i) The time period for issuing advertisement
on daily basis under sub-regulation (i) of
regulation 15 of the aforesaid regulations
was  changed  to  fortnightly  basis  and
every  time  an  additional  5  per  cent  of
the  buy-back  has  been  completed.  The
requirement  of  advertisement  was
dispensed  with  where  there  is  no  buy-
back during the period.

(ii) Open  market  buy-backs  are  allowed  to
be carried out only on stock exchanges

 !

having nationwide trading terminals.

(iii) The  extinguishment  of  shares  was
allowed  within  15  days  of  acceptance/
credit to demat account and the reporting
to stock exchanges and SEBI was to be
made  on  a  monthly  basis  by  7th  of  the
next  month.  Extinguishment  of  shares
within 15 days of date of acceptance of
shares was also accepted subject to the
condition  that  in  case  of  the  last  lot  of
deliveries  received,  the  shares  have  to
be  extinguished  within  7  days  from  the
last  date  of  completion  of  buy-back  in
compliance with sub-section 7 of Section
77A of the Companies Act, 1956.

(iv) Specified date was changed to not later
than  30  days  from  the  date  of  public
announcement.

(v) A provision was made in the regulations
that  the  buy-back  shall  not  be  used  for
the purpose of delisting of the shares or
other specified securities.

(vi) A  provision  in  the  said  regulations  was
made whereby the transfer of funds shall
not  exceed  90  per  cent  of  the  amount
in  the  escrow  account  to  the  special
account for payment of the consideration
under  regulation  11(1)  of  the  said
regulations. Remaining 10 per cent shall
be released only on completion of all the
formalities  laid  down  in  the  said
regulations.

c. Delisting of Securities

Currently, the delisting of securities from
the  stock  exchanges  is  governed  by  SEBI
(Delisting  of  Securities)  Guidelines,  2003.
These  guidelines  came  into  effect  on
February 17, 2003. The aforesaid guidelines
recognised  two  forms  of  delisting  namely,
voluntary  delisting  by  the  company  and
compulsory delisting by the stock exchange.
Under  these  provisions  the  securities  may
either  be  (i)  completely  delisted  from  all  the

Annual Report 2004-05

stock  exchanges,  in  which  case  an  exit
opportunity  to  the  existing  shareholders
through  the  book  building  mechanism  is
required to be given; or (ii) delisted only from
the smaller stock exchanges while remaining
listed at stock exchanges having nation wide
trading  terminals  (BSE/NSE),  in  which  case
no exit opportunity is required to be provided.
The  guidelines  introduced  provisions  for
compulsory delisting by the stock exchanges
for  non-compliance  of  its  listing  agreements
by  the  corporates  and  also  introduced
provisions  of  relisting  of  securities  after  a
cooling-off period of 2 years.

As  per  the  information  provided  by  the
stock  exchanges  up  to  February  5,  2005,
securities  of  569  companies  have  been
delisted  by  the  stock  exchanges  under  the
provisions of compulsory delisting. Under the
provisions of voluntary delisting, 758 delistings
have  taken  place.  These  delisting  includes
those cases where exit opportunity need not

be  given  (as  these  securities  continue  to  be
listed at stock exchanges having nation wide
trading  terminals  viz.,  NSE  and  BSE).
Moreover, 11 companies have sought to get
their  securities  delisted  from  the  stock
exchanges under the provisions of voluntary
delisting  after  having  given  exit  opportunity
to the shareholders through the book building
mechanism.

Investor Awareness/Assistance
and Investor Education/Protection

a. Redressal of Investor Grievances

SEBI  has  a  comprehensive  investor
grievances processing mechanism. The Office
of Investor Assistance and Education (OIAE)
is  the  single  window  interface  of  SEBI  with
the  investors.  The  OIAE  accepts  grievances
of  all  investors  who  prefer  to  file  their
complaints with SEBI for matters falling within
its  jurisdiction.  A  standardised  complaint

format is available at all SEBI offices and on
the  SEBI  website  for  the  convenience  of
investors.  Complaints  are  taken  up  with  the
concerned entities either directly by OIAE or
by  the  Investor  Complaint  Cell  of  the
concerned  department.  SEBI  officers  also
hold  meetings  with  the  company  officials  to
impress upon them their obligations to redress
the  grievances  of  investors.  Action  under
Section  11B  &  15C  of  SEBI  Act  is  initiated
against recalcitrant companies.

During  the  period  1991-92  to  2004-05,
SEBI has received 28,40,095 grievances from
investors.  Of  this,  a  total  of  26,85,993
grievances  were  redressed  by  respective
entities,  which  indicates  a  redressal  rate  of
94.57  per  cent.  The  cumulative  status  of
investor grievances received by SEBI is given
in Table 1.7.

b.

Internet-based Response System
As  a  new  endeavour  in  investor
assistance,  a  simple  and  effective  internet-
based  response  system 
investor
complaints  has  been  set  up.  Under  this
system, on filing of a complaint electronically,
a system generated acknowledgement letter
is issued to the investor.

c. Securities Market Awareness

Campaign (SMAC)
SEBI  launched  a  comprehensive
education  campaign  aimed  at  investors  in
securities market, which has been christened
-  “Securities  Market  Awareness  Campaign”
(SMAC). The motto of the campaign is – ‘An
Educated Investor is a Protected Investor.’

Following  the  national  launch,  the
campaign  has  already  been  extended  to  20
States  and  Union  Territories.  While  in
Bangalore,  Kolkata  and  Chennai,  the
Governors of the respective States launched
the campaigns, in Hyderabad and Rajkot, the
Chief  Ministers  of  the  concerned  States
inaugurated the programme.

 #

While  the  national  as  well  as  the  state
level launches were aimed at generating wide
and adequate publicity for the campaign, the
structural foundation of the campaign is based
on  the  continued  and  active  participation  of
market  participants,  market  intermediaries,
investors’ associations etc., who have, under
the  aegis  of  SEBI,  undertaken  to  organise
workshops at various cities/medium and small
towns  in  the  country  to  spread  SEBI’s
message  of  “Invest  with  knowledge”.  The
details of the campaign are enumerated below:

(i) Workshop

the 

The  workshops  are  aimed  at  reaching
out  to  the  common  investors  and  are  being
held primarily in small and medium towns and
cities all over the country. At the workshops,
the aim is to educate the investors about the
functioning of the securities market, the basic
fundamentals  of  investment  and  risk
management  and 
rights  and
responsibilities  of  an  investor.  The  message
is made simple, with lectures and discussions
conducted in the local/regional language. For
the workshops, SEBI has enlisted the support,
directly  as  well  as  indirectly,  of  investors
associations, market participants, ICAI, ICSI,
reputed banks etc., and the attempt is made
to decentralise the campaign keeping in mind
the  geographical  spread  of  the  investors  in
the country.

To  further  accelerate  the  speed  and
coverage of the programme and to increase
the  number  of  workshops  to  be  conducted
each month, a meeting of market participants/
stock  exchanges  was  held  wherein  it  was
decided to conduct at least 1500 workshops
across  all  the  states  by  March  2005.  It  was
also decided to allocate each state to market
participant(s),  who  would  be  responsible  for
conducting the agreed number of workshops
in each of those states. Till April 2005, 1949
workshops  were  conducted  in  around  480
cities/towns in the country.

Annual Report 2004-05

(ii) Audio-Visual Clip

At the time of the national level launch,
SEBI had prepared a 4 ½ minute audio-visual
clip  depicting  some  of  the  concerns  of  the
common investor and detailing the theme of
the Securities Market Awareness Campaign.
The  thematic  audio-visual  is  played  at  the
various workshops being organised across the
country.  This  short  but  extremely  effective
audio-visual  clip  helps  to  set  the  tone  at  all
the workshops.

(iii) Distribution of Educative Materials

SEBI has prepared standardised reading
materials  and  presentation  materials  for  the
workshops.  In  addition,  reference  guides  on
the  following  topics  have  been  prepared  for
distribution:







Rights and responsibilities of investors,
Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and
Takeovers,
Simple  “dos  and  dont’s”  relating  to
various aspects of the securities market,

 Mutual funds.

These  guides/booklets  have  been
translated  into  Hindi  and  the  workshop
material  has  also  been  translated  into  10
major regional languages. It is felt that along
with  Hindi,  the  10  regional  languages  would
cover  a  substantial  portion  of  the  investor
base in the country.

(iv)

Investor Website
In order to make the information relevant
to the investors and available at one place, a
dedicated 
(http://
investor.sebi.gov.in) has been operationalised
and  the  information  content  on  this  website
is augmented on a periodic basis.

investor  website 

All  the  booklets/pamphlets  prepared  by
SEBI have been posted on this website and
appear in a bilingual form. In response to the
feedback received from investors, frequently
asked  questions  (FAQs),  pertaining  to  the

 $

important  regulations  framed  by  SEBI  has
been  posted  on  this  website.  In  addition,  a
glossary of commonly used terms relating to
capital market also appears on this site.

(v) Advertisements

SEBI  has  prepared  simple  “dos  and
don’ts”  for  investors  relating  to  various
aspects of the securities market. While these
simple  messages  have  been  put  on  the
investor website and have been printed in the
form  of  leaflets  to  be  distributed  across  the
country, it was felt that these messages could
be  spread  across  the  investor  base  by  way
of  advertisements  in  newspapers,  especially
in the regional newspapers. Keeping the cost
constraint in mind, it was decided that these
advertisements  could  be  released  in
association with market participants, with the
name  and  logo  of  the  market  participants
appearing  in  the  advertisements  along  with
the  name  and  logo  of  SEBI.  This  provided
inducement to the market participants to bear
the  cost  of  these  advertisements  and  the
response  has  been  overwhelming.  Till  date,
over  700  advertisements  relating  to  various
aspects  of  securities  market  appeared  in  48
different  newspapers/  magazines,  covering
approximately  111  cities  and  9  regional
languages, apart from English and Hindi.

(vi) All India Radio

With  regard  to  educating  investors
through the medium of radio, All India Radio
was  requested  to  allot  free  slots  to  SEBI  on
their various programmes. AIR allotted 5 free
slots  in  the  month  of  January  2004  in  its
programme “People’s Corner”. Further, 8 free
slots  were  allotted  in  the  programme  -
Business  Pulse  -  in  the  months  of  May  and
June  2004.These  programmes  are  aimed  at
creating  awareness  among  the  common
public  regarding  the  functioning  of  various
public  service  departments.  SEBI  officials

VII. Retrospect and Prospects

a. Retrospect

The  activities  in  the  capital  market
continued  to  remain  buoyant  for  the  second

economic  activities  along  with  strong
macroeconomic 
fundamentals,  better
corporate results, revival of reform initiatives
by the government from the new perspectives,
strong  FII  investment,  and  most  importantly
market friendly regulations by SEBI. While the
market  sentiment  was  buoyant  in  the
beginning  of  the  financial  year,  the  political
uncertainty prevalent in May 2004 resulted in
market crash of 11.1 per cent in a single day
i.e.,  on  May  17,  2004.  The  crash  was  not
only  one  of  the  largest  in  India  but  also  in
the  world.  It  was  also  unique  in  the  sense
that  it  was  also  the  most  short-lived  of  the
market  crashes.  The  crash,  however,
demonstrated  the  resilience  of  the  risk
management  system.  The  stock  market
bounced  back  and  rose  steadily  thereafter
with BSE Sensex reaching a peak of 6915.09
and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  2168.95  on  March  8,
2005. The market capitalisation of both BSE
and  NSE  also  reached  a  historic  high
reflecting greater confidence of the investors
in  the  Indian  capital  market.  The  market
capitalisation  as  a  percentage  to  GDP
reached an all time high of 54.6 per cent by
end-March 2005.

Primary  market  activities  accelerated
particularly during the second half of the year.
During  2004-05,  Rs.  28,256  crore  was
mobilised  from  the  primary  market  out  of
which  Rs.  24,640  crore  was  through  public
issues and the rest was through rights issues.
Private  sector  dominated 
resource
mobilisation  in  the  primary  market,  with  61
per  cent  share  in  the  total  resource
mobilisation, while the share of public sector
got  reduced  due  to  slowdown  in  the
disinvestment  process.  The  dominance  of
private sector may be attributed mainly to the
resurgence of industrial activities, fresh capital
formation  and  transparent  and  efficient
regulatory  system.  Banks/ 
financial
institutions,  power  and  IT  sector  mobilised
large  amounts  of 
resources.  Large

mobilisation of resources by these sectors do
not  spring  any  surprise,  because  the
contribution of services sector to GDP growth
has been impressive during the recent years.

increased 

Mutual  funds  industry  experienced
growth  in  terms  of  the  assets  under
management  which 
from
Rs. 1,39,676 crore in 2003-04 to Rs. 1,49,600
crore in 2004-05, a rise of 7.2 per cent over
the previous year. Economic resurgence along
with  more  liberalisation  of  capital  market,
rise  in  financial  savings  of  households,
privatisation  of  the  pension  system  and
permission  to  more  private  players  provide
great potential for the mutual fund industry to
flourish in India.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) with
their  expertise  and  experience  of  operating
in  global  markets  look  for  several  factors
which  help  them  maximise  their  returns  on
investment.  Some  of  these  factors  relate  to
continuation of market reforms, prevailing tax
system, higher returns, low inflation, high and
sustained  growth  of  the  economy  etc.
Considering  all  these  factors  vis-à-vis  those
in  the  other  emerging  economies,  India  is
considered  as  a  favoured  destination  for
portfolio investment by the FIIs. The number
of  FIIs  registered  in  India  went  up  from  540
in 2003-04 to 685 in 2004-05.

b. Prospects

India’s  financial  system  is  at  a  critical
stage of transformation. While banking system
is  being  consolidated,  the  term-lending
institutions,  better  known  as  Development
Financial  Institutions  (DFIs),  are  converted
into  banks/NBFCs.  In  view  of  this,  the
responsibility  of  financing  the  long-term
projects, which also includes development of
infrastructure, corporate projects etc., falls on
the  securities  market.  As  this  transition  may
affect  the  growth  prospects  of  the  economy,
Government  felt  the  urgent  need  to  develop

 &

Part One: Policies and Programmes

the  securities  market  in  general  and  debt
market  in  particular  so  that  the  needs  of
Indian  corporate  world  are  met.  For  orderly
development of the capital market, Honorable
Finance  Minister  announced  a  package  of
measures in 2005-06 Budget, which include,
inter alia, the following:

















All  stock  exchanges  have  to  be
corporatised.  Those  stock  exchanges
which  are  not  yet  corporatised,  will  get
one time exemption from stamp duty for
the same;

Government to provide equity support of
Rs. 14,040 crore and loans of Rs.3,554
crore to central PSUs.

FIIs  will  be  permitted  to  submit
appropriate  collateral,  in  cash  or
otherwise,  as  prescribed  by  SEBI  for
trading in derivatives;

Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,
1956  will  be  amended  to  change  the
definition of ‘securities’ so as to provide
a  legal  framework  for  trading  of
securitised debt;

Appointment  of  a  high  level  Expert
Committee  on  corporate  bonds  and
securitisation is proposed;

Proposal  to  allow  Mutual  Funds  to
introduce Gold Exchange Traded Funds
(GETFs),  with  Gold  as  the  underlying
asset;

Proposal  to  set  up  a  National  Institute
of  Securities  Markets  for  providing
training to intermediaries in the securities
market and promote research;

Proposal to amend the Income Tax Act,
1961  to  provide  that  income  from  F&O
operations  will  not  be  treated  as
speculative income. It was also proposed
to  provide  that  trading  in  derivatives  in

specified stock exchanges would not be
treated as ‘speculative transaction’; and



To  appoint  a  high  powered  Expert
Committee to advise the Government on
how to make Mumbai a regional financial
centre.

The  above  proposals  are  at  different
stages  of  implementation.  The  scheme  for
corporatisation  and  demutualisation  of  the
BSE has been approved by SEBI. Guidelines
have  been  amended  for  the  submission  of
appropriate  collateral  by  FIIs  for  trading  in
derivatives.  Actions  have  been  initiated  to
implement the remaining Budget proposals.

In the backdrop of the Budget proposals
and also to pursue the on-going projects, the
major  agenda  for  SEBI  for  2005-06  are  as
under:




















