SEBI  ANNUAL  REPORT  2007-08:  A  SUMMARY

The Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI)  for  2007-08  delineates  the  policies  and  programmes  of  SEBI
and  its  working  and  operations  during  the  financial  year  as  per  the
format  prescribed  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India
(Annual  Report)  Rules,  1994.  During  the  year,  SEBI  continued  to  its
endeavour to remain committed to achieve three statutory objectives,
namely:  (a)  protection  of  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities;  (b)
development  of  the  securities  market  and  (c)  regulation  of  the
securities  market.

In  alignment  with  these  objectives,  this  Report  provides  the
manner in which SEBI accomplished its responsibilities and exercised
its powers during the year. The Report also provides a review of the
developments  in  the  Indian  securities  market  during  2007-08,  in  the
context of changing dynamics of market regulations.

Against  the  backdrop  of  an  increasing  integration  of  global
financial markets, SEBI channelised its efforts to bring out regulations
to  handle  the  domestic  and  global  developments.  Steps  were  taken
to strengthen the regulatory framework by reviewing existing policies
and  programmes  and  issuing  new  guidelines  and  regulations  to
promote  orderly  growth  of  securities  market.  The  underlying
objectives were to ensure transparency, efficiency, fairness, safety, and
integrity  of  the  securities  market  in  India.  The  Annual  Report  is
divided  into  five  parts.  Part  One  presents  the  initiatives  and
programmes  pursued  by  SEBI  during  2007-08.  Part  Two  reviews
trends  and  operations  of  the  Indian  securities  market.  Part  Three
provides  a  detailed  account  of  regulation  of  the  securities  market.
Part Four presents the regulatory changes including significant court
pronouncements. Part Five presents organisational matters. Part-wise
summary of the SEBI Annual Report 2007-08 is presented below:

1

Part One: Policies and Programmes

A developed primary market is crucial for resource mobilisation
by  corporates  to  meet  their  investment  needs  for  growth.  A  number
of  companies  entered  the  primary  market  for  resource  mobilisation.
Response  of  investors  to  public  issues  was  encouraging.  Major
initiatives taken by SEBI during 2007-08 were:

Grading  of  all  Intial  Public  Offerings  (IPOs)  was  made
mandatory. The grading would be done by credit rating agencies,
registered  with  SEBI.  It  would  be  mandatory  to  obtain  grading
from  at  least  one  credit  rating  agency.  The  issuer  would  be
required  to  disclose  all  the  grades  obtained  by  it  for  its  IPO  in
the  prospectus,  abridged  prospectus  and  all  other  places  where
the issuer advertised for the IPO.

In order to facilitate government companies / corporations/
statutory authorities/ any special purpose vehicle set up by any of
them, which are engaged in infrastructure sector, to raise funds in
the Indian primary market through IPOs, SEBI relaxed certain
provisions of SEBI(DIP) guidelines related to a) minimum dilution
requirements, b) minimum period of holding of pre-issue capital
to be issued in an offer for sale and c) eligibility of shares for the
purpose of computation of promoters’ contribution etc.

To  enable  well  compliant  listed  companies  to  access  primary
securities  market  in  a  time  effective  manner  through  follow-on
public  offerings  and  rights  issues,  SEBI  introduced  fast  track
issue mechanism. This would enable listed companies to proceed
with  follow-on  public  offering  /  rights  issue  by  filing  a  copy  of
the  Red  Herring  Prospectus  (in  case  of  book  built  issue)  /
Prospectus  (in  case  of  fixed  price  issue)  with  the  Registrar  of
Companies  or  the  letter  of  offer  filed  with  designated  stock
exchange,  as  the  case  may  be.  Now  such  companies  need  not
file a draft offer documents with SEBI and the stock exchanges.

Amendment  was  done  with  respect  to  the  eligibility  criterion
for  a  company  desirous  of  making  a  Qualified  Instituions’
Placement  (QIP).  In  addition  to  the  criteria  specified  in  the
guidelines  governing  QIP,  such  a  company  would  also  be
required  to  have  a  listing  history  of  at  least  one  year  on  the
date  of  issuance  of  notice  to  its  shareholders  for  convening  a
general  meeting  in  terms  of  Section  81(1A)  of  the  Companies
Act, 1956 to consider the QIP.

In  order  to  facilitate  development  of  a  vibrant  primary  market
for  corporate  bonds  in  India,  SEBI  amended  SEBI  (DIP)
Guidelines  concerning  Issuance  of  Debt  Securities.  The
amendments  were  related  to  the  following:  a)  requirement  of
credit  rating,  b)  below  investment  grade  debt  instruments  and
c) removal of structural restrictions.

Amendments  were  made  with  respect  to  Indian  Depository
Receipts (IDRs) to permit all categories of the investors to apply
in IDR issues, subject to (i) at least 50 per cent of the issue being
subscribed  by  Qualified  Institutional  Buyers  (QIBs)  and  (ii)  the
balance being made available for subscription to other categories
of  investors  at  the  discretion  of  the  issuer,  which  should  be
disclosed  in  the  prospectus.  Further,  the  minimum  application
value was reduced from Rs. 2,00,000 to Rs. 20,000.

Amendments  were  made  to  preferential  allotment  guidelines  to
enable companies with listing history of less than six months to
raise money through preferential allotment, subject to complying
with  the  modified  pricing  and  disclosure  norms.  Further,  the
listed companies intending to make preferential allotment would
be  required  to  obtain  PAN  from  each  applicant  before  making
the  allotment.

SEBI  decided  to  phase  out  EDIFAR  gradually  in  view  of  a  new
portal,  viz.,  Corporate  Filing  and  Dissemination  System  (CFDS)

3

put  in  place  jointly  by  BSE  and  NSE,  which  offers  a  Extensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL) enabled common platform
for  listed  companies  to  file  their  returns  with  stock  exchanges
and  also  a  common  place  for  investors  to  view  information
related  to  listed  companies.  A  new  clause  viz.,  Clause  52  was
introduced  in  Equity  Listing  Agreement.  This  clause  requires
listed companies to file information with the stock exchange only
through  CFDS.

Amendments  were  made  pertaining  to  the  issue  process  with
respect to the following: a) quoting of PAN was made mandatory
in  issue  application  form,  b)  discount  in  issue  price  for  retail
investors/retail  shareholders  was  introduced,  c)  definition  of
“Retail  Individual  Shareholder ”  for  listed  companies  was
introduced, d) clarification was provided on the term CEO/CFO,
e)  monitoring  of  issue  proceeds  and  f)  eligibility  of  pledged
shares for computation of minimum promoters’ contribution.

Clause  41  of  the  Listing  Agreement  was  revised  to  provide  an
option  to  the  listed  companies  to  furnish  either  unaudited  or
audited  quarterly  and  year-to-date  financial  results  to  the  stock
exchange  within  one  month  of  the  end  of  each  quarter  (other
than the last quarter).

Clause  49  of  the  Listing  Agreement  was  amended  to  provide
for  a  monitoring  agency  on  utilisation  of  issue  proceeds,  the
report  of  which  would  be  placed  before  the  Audit  Committee
of the issuer company.

SEBI  stipulated  that  PAN  would  be  the  sole  identification
number  for  all  participants  in  the  securities  market,  irrespective
of  the  amount  of  transaction  with  effect  from  July  02,  2007.  The
objective was to strengthen the ‘Know Your Client’ (KYC) norms
through a single identification number for all participants in the
securities market for facilitating sound audit trail.

SEBI  specified  the  broad  regulatory  framework  for  short  selling
by  institutional  investors  and  a  full-fledged  securities  lending
and borrowing scheme. Accordingly, relevant amendments were
made  to  SEBI  (FII)  Regulations,  1995  and  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)
Regulations, 1996, enabling FIIs and Mutual Funds to participate
in short selling and SLB.

SEBI  mandated  that  all  institutional  trades  in  the  cash  market

trades  would  be  margined  on  a  T+1  basis  with  margin  being
collected from the custodian upon confirmation of the trade.

comments/ suggestions received were being examined.

SEBI introduced. (i) mini contracts in equity indices, (ii) options

In  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  SEBI  notified  Securities

Foreign  Direct  Investment  (FDI)  policy,  16  stock  exchanges  had
completed  demutualisation  process  by  diluting  at  least  51  per
cent  of  their  equity  shareholding  to  public  other  than

to  USD  five  billion  and  within  the  overall  limit,  mutual  funds

300 million per mutual fund.

The limit on investment and advisory fee for index fund schemes
was reduced to 0.75 per cent and the total expenses of the scheme

or collection centre/ Investor Service Centre that were not routed
through any distributor/ agent/ broker.

In  order  to  bring  in  more  transparency  and  clarity  to  the
investors  in  terms  of  expenses  charged  in  close-ended  Schemes,

6

SEBI decided that there would not be any provision of charging

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

The  upward  trend  in  primary  market  activities  continued  in
2007-08.

The  buoyancy  in  the  secondary  market  coupled  with  strong
macro-economic  fundamentals,  active  institutional  support  led
by  FIIs  and  mutual  funds  encouraged  large  number  of
companies to raise resource from the primary market.

During  2007-08,  124  companies  accessed  the  primary  market
through  public  and  rights  issues  and  raised  Rs.  87,029  crore
compared  to  Rs.  33,508  crore  mobilised  by  124  companies  in
2006-07.

Of  the  total  92  public  issues  in  2007-08,  85  were  initial  public
offerings  (IPOs)  (Rs.42,595  crore)  and  7  were  follow-on  public
offerings  (FPOs)  (Rs.11,916  crore).

About 87.8 per cent of resource mobilisation was through public
issues of above Rs.500 crore.

institutions  occupied  the  highest  position  with  35.6  per  cent  in
total  resource  mobilisation.

Equity  markets  witnessed  unprecedented  buoyancy  as  well  as

was  steep  correction  in  the  indices  on  account  of  concerns  over
