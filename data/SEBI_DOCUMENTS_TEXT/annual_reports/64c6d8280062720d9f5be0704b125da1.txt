Primary Securities Markets
While  the primary market has become an important source  of  mobilising  funds for Indian issuers since the  commencement  of  the  economic reform process in 1991-92, the ability  of  the  primary  market  to provide resources  to  issuers  has  varied.  The amount raised from the primary market increased  from Rs. 6,214.84 crore in 1991-92 to Rs. 27,632.50 crore in  1994-95.  The  primary market remained dull in  1995-96  and  1996-97  and  the  funds  raised  from  the  primary  market  declined  to Rs. 20,803.63 crore in 1995-96 and  further  to  Rs.14,284.31  crore in 1996-97. In addition to  the  general  economic  and investment environment the level  of  issuance  has also depended on the eligibility criteria and disclosure  norms   which  have  been  made  stringent  to  ensure   the  availability of quality paper. Developments in  the  primary  market  are further discussed in Part II of the Report.  The  measures  taken  by  SEBI  in  1996-97  to  strengthen   the  disclosure requirements and eligibility norms for  accessing  the markets for capital are discussed below.
