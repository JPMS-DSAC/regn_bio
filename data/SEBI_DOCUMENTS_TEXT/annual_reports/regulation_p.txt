PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

In  a  market  economy,  primary  securities
market  of  capital  market  plays  a  significant
role  in  helping  mobilsation  of  capital  and
investment  formation.  Many  types  of
intermediaries  carry  out  this  role  very
effectively. Some of the major intermediaries
in  this  segment  are:  merchant  bankers,
underwriters,  bankers  to  an  issue,  registrars
to  an  issue  and  share  transfer  agents  and
debenture trustees. Table 3.1 provides details
of  various  classes  of  intermediaries  as  on
March  31,  2004  and  also  as  on  March  31,
2003. A close examination of the total number
brings  out  two  important  revelations.
Traditionally, the number of intermediaries has
gone  down  substantially.  This  is  led  by
registrars  to  an  issue  and  share  transfer
agents  category.  Their  number  fell  by  65  –

from 143 to 78 and in terms of per centage,
it  declined  by  about  45  per  cent.  The  next
category in this class includes bankers to an
issue,  whose  number  has  come  down  to  55
from  67,  a  decline  of  12.  The  other  two
categories - merchant bankers and debenture
trustees, also registered a decline of one per
cent to stand at 123 and 34 respectively. Only
two  categories  of  intermediaries;  portfolio
managers  and  underwriters  showed  positive
growth  of  six  and  four  at  60  and  47
respectively.  The  overall  decline  can  be
attributed  to  the  excessive  supply,  i.e.,  the
large  number  of  intermediaries  who  have
entered the market. Compared to many of the
international  markets,  the  number  of
intermediaries  registered  in  India,  in  certain
categories,  still  continues  to  be  on  the  high
side.

Part-III Regulation of Securities Market

SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

2.
Brokers  play  a  significant  economic  role  in
the secondary securities market of the capital
market. They bring investors, both buyers and
sellers, together to make aggregate demand
and  supply  at  any  point  of  time.  The
aggregate  demand  and  supply  decide  the
price  discovery  and  the  level  of  transaction
costs. Therefore, brokers have a crucial role
to  play  in  the  functioning  of  stock  markets.
As  on  March  31,  2004,  the  total  number  of
brokers  stood  at  9,368,  which  was  at  9,519
as  on  March  31,  2003  -  a  decline  of  15  per
cent. In the year, there were 141 new brokers
registered  while  292  existing  members  went
out of the system. This registered a fall of 15
per  cent.  Several  structural  changes  have
taken place in the Indian broking industry over
the  past  few  years.  Consolidation  and
restructuring  have  assumed  considerable
importance  in  this  segment.  Table  3.3
provides details of corporate brokers and total
brokers for both the previous and the current
year  for  all  the  23  stock  exchanges.  The
Calcutta  Stock  Exchange  has  the  highest
number of brokers (980). However, the figure
declined  by  seven  from  the  previous  year.
NSE with 970 brokers ranks second in terms
of number of brokers, followed by OTCEI and
BSE.  For  the  past  few  years,  many  brokers
converted themselves into corporate brokers.
Out  of  the  total  brokers,  89  per  cent  of  the
brokers on NSE are corporate brokers (863),
which ranks first, followed by OTCEI – 78 per
cent, BSE –71 per cent and the Delhi Stock
Exchange – 58 per cent. The Gauhati Stock
Exchange with about 3 per cent came last in
terms  of  corporatisation  of  its  broking
community.  Compared  to  the  previous  year,
there  is  a  slight  increase  in  terms  of
corporatisation  of  broking  industry  and  the
figure rose marginally from 40.29 per cent in
the  previous  year  by  one  per  cent  to  40.42
per  cent.  A  close  look  at  the  table  suggests
almost no significant change in any exchange
over the previous year.

78

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

There  are  three  classes  of  brokers,  namely
proprietary, partnership and corporate. Table
3.4  provides  details  of  brokers  on  the  basis
of ownership. In the old exchanges, most of
the brokers are proprietary in nature, whereas
in  the  new  exchanges,  they  are  corporate
members.

Prior to screen based trading and the spread
of trading network across the country, brokers
in  some  of  the  exchanges  acquired
membership  in  more  than  one  exchange
(multiple  membership)  to  expand  their
business and serve clients spread across the
country.  With  the  on-set  of  screen-based
trading and expansion of networking to almost
400  cities  and  towns  of  the  country,  the
concept of multiple partnerships has become
irrelevant.  This  also  became  irrelevant  as
most  of  the  trading  takes  place  on  the  two
major  stock  exchanges  and  most  of  the
companies  traded  are  listed  on  these  two
exchanges.

Table  3.5  presents  details  of  multiple
membership.  Multiple  membership  ranges
from two to six. There are several interesting
facts  that  emerge  from  the  table  for  these
two  years.  There  is  a  sharp  fall  in  the
category of bi-membership. In the past year,
there  were  854  brokers  having  dual
membership  of  stock  exchanges,  which  has
fallen to 798. Except in one category, i.e., five
memberships, in rest of the categories there
is  a  decline.  These  developments  could  be
attributed to the availability of trading facilities
throughout  the  country  by  members  of  both
the NSE and the BSE.

Sub-broker Registration

I.
Sub-brokers  are  considered  to  play  useful
economic  role  between  the  broker  and  the
investor.  In  buoyant  market  conditions,
sometimes,  brokers  do  not  entertain  small
investors.  As  a  result,  they  could  not  carry
out  their  transactions  effectively.  In  order  to

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

fill  this  void,  this  class  of  intermediaries
emerged  on  the  scene.  Once  again,  in  the
several  structural  changes  that  have  taken
place  in  the  Indian  capital  market,  the  sub-
broking  community  appears  to  be  on  the
wane.  Table  3.6  provides  information  on  the
number  of  sub  brokers  of  each  exchange
and  as  a  percentage  of  the  total.  The  two

major  exchanges  top  the  sub-brokers
registration.    Between  them,  they  (BSE  and
NSE) share almost nine-tenth of the number
of sub brokers. Some stock exchanges have
almost  no  sub  brokers,  while  the  remaining
share  about  one-tenth  of  the  sub-broking
industry.  Further  details  are  contained  in
Table 3.6.

II. Anjaria Committee on Broker

Turnover Fees

The  fee  structure  for  brokers  as  prescribed
in  1992  is  not  in  tune  with  the  level  of
brokerage  prevailing  after  a  decade.  This
necessitated a review of the fee structure for
stock brokers. Accordingly, a Committee was
constituted  under  the  Chairmanship  of
D.C.Anjaria to consider a revision of the fee
structure for the brokers as laid down in the
R.S.Bhatt Committee report. The Committee
had representations from broker associations,

Exchanges,  the  Institute  of  Chartered
Accountants of India, the Investor Grievance
Forum and SEBI.

The  Committee  held  six  meetings  to
deliberate  on  what  would  constitute  a
reasonable  level  of  fees  in  the  three  market
segments  –  cash  equity,  cash  debt  and
derivatives,  so  that  fees  payable  by  brokers
are  fair  in  the  light  of  the  present  level  of
brokerage  charged  by  the  brokers  to  their
clients. The Committee has finalized its report
and the same is under consideration.

III. Registration of Stock Exchanges
Some  exchanges  have  been  granted
permanent  recognition,  few  are  granted  a
tenure  period  renewal  and  most  other
exchanges  have  been  granted  yearly
renewals. During the current year, registration
of thirteen exchanges has been renewed. Of
these  thirteen,  National  Stock  Exchange  of
India (NSE) has been granted for renewal a
five  year  period  from  April  26,  2003  to  April
25,  2008  and  the  registration  of  remaining
twelve exchanges has been renewed for one
more  year.  The  details  of  the  renewals  are
provided in Table 3.7.

IV. Registration of FIIs
Foreign  Institutional  Investors  have  started
playing  a  very  significant  role  in  the  Indian
capital  market.  They  have  been  setting
standards  in  the  market  place.  Their  role  in
the  primary  market  has  also  gained
momentum.  As  on  March  31,  2004,  there
were  540  FIIs  and  1,542  sub-accounts,
operating in the Indian market. These figures

respectively.

V. Corporate Restructuring
Indian  corporates  have  started  responding
positively  to  global  challenges.  SEBI,  in  its
initiative  to  enable  the  Indian  corporates  to
face  competition  and  to  strengthen  their
operations  worldwide,  has  made,  several
reforms  to  substantial  acquisition  of  shares
and takeover regulations.

In response to the regulations and corporate
developments,  there  were  sixty-five  public
offers  during  the  year.  One  hundred  and
seventy one reports were filed for exemptions
from  open  offer  obligations.  The  offers  that
are  not  covered  under  the  exemptions
category  are  required  to  be  referred  to
Takeover  Panel  for  exemption  from  open
offers.  During  the  year  2003-04,  thirty-five
applications  were  forwarded  by  SEBI  to  the
Takeover Panel for its consideration, of which
eighteen  cases  were  granted  exemptions.
Details of these are provided in Table 3.8.

for their failure to wind up their schemes
and make repayments to investors:
a. Orders passed under section 11B of
the  SEBI  Act,  1992,  debarring  the
entities and their concerned officials

and/or  from  accessing  the  capital
market  for  a  period  of  5  years  from
the date of the Orders;

b. The  concerned  State  Governments
have been requested to initiate civil/

Act.

Prosecution  under  Section  24  of  SEBI  Act,
1992  has  been  filed  by  SEBI  against  520
erring CIS entities.

Requests  have  been  made  to  police
authorities to file the First Information Reports
against 70 CIS entities.

SEBI  has  cautioned  the  investors  about
Collective  Investment  Schemes  through  its
web-site.  Members  of  the  public  have  been
cautioned  that  they  should  not  invest  in  CIS
entities which are not registered with SEBI.

In Writ Petition no. 51911 of 1999 (Paramount

Part-III Regulation of Securities Market

court  imposed  a  fine  of  Rs.  5000/-  each  on
the accused.

VIII. Registration and Regulation of

Mutual Funds

Competition  in  the  mutual  fund  industry  has
become intense and many small mutual funds
have  been  striving  to  achieve  critical  mass
over  the  past  few  years.  There  was  initial
exuberance  and  enthusiasm  for  getting
licenses  to  start  a  mutual  fund.  Many
sponsors and asset management companies
were registered to start mutual funds. Over a
period  of  time,  the  sponsors  can  achieve
break-even  point  only  if  they  cross  hurdle
assets under management. Global as well as
domestic factors have also contributed to the
consolidation  in  the  mutual  fund  industry.
Small mutual funds have been taken over by
some of the big mutual funds and new mutual
funds are also getting licenses.

As on March 31, 2004, there were 37 mutual
funds  operating,  one  less  than  that  of  the
previous  year.  The  distribution  between  the
public sector and private sector is 8:29 as on
March 31, 2004 as against 9:29 as on March
31, 2003 (see Table 3.9).

IX. Registration of Venture Capital

Funds

Fast  economic  growth  requires  speedy
availability of risk capital. Before the issue can
be  supported  by  the  capital  market
participants,  they  expect  the  companies  to
show commercial performance and only then
do  they  support  them.  Many  a  time,
innovators,  incubators  and  other  first
generation  entrepreneurs  need  capital  to

86

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

exploit  their  ideas.  Venture  capital  plays  a
very  significant  and  useful  economic  role  in
promoting,  developing  and  sustaining  the
ideas of entrepreneurs. Many countries have
framed  regulations  to  encourage  venture
capital  financing  and  India  has  been  on  the
forefront for the past few years in responding
to the needs of this class of entrepreneurs.

There  are  different  variations  of  venture
capital  funding  –  private  equity,  venture
capital, etc. As on March 31, 2004, there were
45  venture  capital  funds  and  nine  foreign
venture capital investors registered with SEBI.
These numbers are higher by two and three
respectively  compared  to  the  previous  year.
In  terms  of  percentage,  they  have  grown  by
about  five  per  cent  and  50  per  cent
(See Table 3.10).

SEBI receives money from different sources
under different heads, which are provided in
Table 3.11, for the current year as well as for
the  previous  year.  The  sources  are  divided
broadly into two categories namely, Recurring
and Non-recurring. About 85 per cent of the
income comes from recurring sources and the
balance  from  non-recurring  sources.  The
classification  indicates  that  recurring  income
has  declined  from  Rs.  108  crore  in  2002-03
to  Rs.  73  crore  in  2003-04.  However,  there
is  a  marginal  increase  in  respect  of  non-
recurring income by about Rs. 3 crore. In the
year 2003-04, SEBI received Rs.87.89 crore
under  various  heads  as  compared  to
Rs.120.19  crore  in  the  previous  year,  a  fall
of 25 per cent. There are certain areas under
which  the  amount  received  has  gone  up
substantially, while in many others they have

come down. Fees received from brokers and
sub-brokers  amounted  to  Rs.63.43  crore,
compared to Rs.100.04 crore in the previous
year, a fall of about 37 per cent. Yet another
significant fall has taken place in the amount
received  from  merchant  bankers,  from
Rs.2.13  crore  to  Rs.1.05  crore,  a  decline  of
about  51  per  cent.  One  area  which  has
registered  substantial  appreciation  is  fee
received from takeover documents filed with
SEBI. Under this head, the fee received has
gone up from Rs.2.53 crore to Rs.5.89 crore,
an  appreciation  of  132.81  per  cent.  Fee
received  from  debenture  trustees  also  went
up  substantially  from  Rs.10  lakh  to  Rs.  63
lakh,  a  530  per  cent  increase  albeit  with  a
low base.

SUPERVISION

Promotion and Regulation of Self –
Regulatory Organizations

in 

Arguments 
favour  and  against
decentralized  versus  one  source  regulation
have  been  put  forward  by  analysts,
academicians,  regulators  and  policy  makers
for  several  years.  However,  there  is  no
consensus  on  this  issue.  One  school  of
thought  believes  that  self-regulation  brings
more  effectiveness  and  improvement
governance  standards.  Another  school  of
thought forwards that one source of regulation
is  very  effective  and  responsive  to  the
changing nature of the market structure and
that  the  regulator  will  have  an  integrated
approach to the problems in the market place.
SEBI,  in  its  efforts  to  make  regulation  more
effective and responsive to the fast changing
market requirements has thought of promoting
self-regulatory  organizations  in  the  Indian
capital  market.  Several  steps  have  been
initiated towards this objective.

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

intermediaries. Stock exchanges are already
acting as SROs and the SRO structure needs
to be strengthened further. The objective for
promoting intermediaries like stock exchanges
as SRO is that since they have a better feed
on  the  ground  reality,  they  should  take  care
of  the  micro  aspects  of  regulations.  The
several  inherent  conditions  of  self-regulation
are:

A. Self-regulation 

becomes 

the
responsibility  of  the  market  and  may
result in greater acceptance of rules by
the members of SRO;

B.

C.

It  also  provides  market  players  with
greater flexibility to respond to securities
market;

It  avoids  duplication  of  responsibility:  It
is  observed  that  over  the  years  that  if
the  regulatory  body  gets  into  micro
regulation,  it  looses  sight  of  the
fundamentals,  which  in  turn  results  in
duplication of responsibilities; and

D. Besides, SROS are expected to have a
better  understanding  of  the  ground
realities.

However,  for  any  organization/body  like  a
stock  exchange  to  function  effectively  as  an
SRO,  it  is  necessary  for  it  to  enforce
compliance of bye-laws, rules and regulations
laid  down  by  itself.  Further,  these  SROs
should be able to enforce and establish rules,
which  prevent  manipulative  trade  practices
and  permit  just  and  equitable  principles  of
trade.  Presently,  such  powers  are  conferred
on  the  stock  exchanges  by  Section  9  of  the
SC(R) Act, 1956, whereby they have to make
bye-laws  for  the  conduct  of  business,
regulation and control of contracts.

SEBI  is  contemplating  the  development  of
self-regulatory organizations (SRO) for market

Further, developing stock exchanges as self-
regulatory organizations and enhancing their

Part-III Regulation of Securities Market

effective  regulatory  role,  puts  additional
responsibility  on  SEBI  to  ensure  that  SROs
are  efficiently  carrying  out/conducting  their
mandatory responsibilities.

II. Development of Stock Exchanges as

Self-Regulatory Organisations

There  are  23  stock  exchanges  recognized
under  Section  4  of  the  Securities  Contracts
(Regulations)  Act,  1956.  These  exchanges
were recognized/set up over a period of time
to stimulate the growth of the capital market
by  channelising  the  savings  of  households
and  others.  These  exchanges  are  suitably
empowered by Section 9 of SC(R) Act, 1956
to make bye-laws for the conduct of business,
regulation and control of contracts.

III.

Inspection of Primary Market Entities

Section 11(2) of SEBI Act 1992 provides that
SEBI shall register and regulate the working
of  intermediaries.  In  fulfillment  of  the  above,
SEBI  has  completed  the  inspection  of  the
books  and  records  of  39  depository
participants and three registrars to an issue.
Further,  based  on  the  investors’  complaints,
regarding  delay  in  dematerlisation  of  shares
and  also  on  the  basis  of  reports  submitted
by both the depositories, show cause notices
(SCNs)  under  Depositories  Act  1996  were
issued  to  45  companies.  These  have  been
issued  after  examination  of  the  records
submitted by the depositories.

regulation. SEBI annually inspects a sample
of stock exchanges.

The  objectives  of  the  inspections  are  to
ensure that:

A.

B.

The exchange provides a fair, equitable
and growing market to investors;

The  exchange  has  complied  with  the
conditions,  if  any,  imposed  on  it  at  the
time  of  renewal/grant  of  its  recognition
under Section 4 of the SC(R)Act, 1956;

C. The  exchange’s  organization,  systems
and practices are in accordance with the
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,
1956 and rules framed thereunder;

D. The  exchange  has  implemented  the
directions,  guidelines  and  instructions
issued by the SEBI from time to time;

E.

There are adequate control mechanisms
and risk management systems.

During  the  year  2003-04,  stock  exchanges
have been inspected and a thorough review
of  operations,  organizational  structure  and
administrative control of each exchange have
been examined.

Indian  stock  markets  have  been  buoyant
during  the  year  2003-04  and  indices
registered significant growth. Because of this,
special  inspection  of  risk  management  of
NSE,  BSE,  CSE,  ASE  and  UPSE  has  been
conducted.  Follow-up  inspections  have  also
been  conducted  by  procuring  periodical
compliance reports from the stock exchanges
and conducting regular meetings with senior
management of exchanges.

Follow-up of inspection reports was done by
obtaining  periodic  compliance  reports  from
stock  exchanges  and  through  meetings  with
the senior management of stock exchanges.

Part-III Regulation of Securities Market

V. Action Taken against Illegal Stock

Exchanges

SEBI has for some time been coming across
information  regarding  illegal  trading  in
securities by unregistered entities outside the
stock  exchanges.  Illegal  trading  is  a
cognizable  offence  under  section  19  of
Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956
within  the  meaning  of  Code  of  Criminal
Procedures  which  does  not  fall  into  the
regulatory  competence  of  SEBI.  Therefore,
SEBI  has  written  several  letters  to  Chief
Ministers of all states and Governors of Union
Territories  apprising  them  of  such  activities
and  requesting  them  to  put  the  police  on  a
continuous  alert  and  to  take  suitable  action
against  any  person/entity  violating  the
provisions  of  SC(R)A.  Further,  specific
information regarding illegal trading received
by  SEBI  as  well  as  press  articles  in  this
regard  have  been  forwarded  to  Chief
Ministers from time to time seeking their help
to look into the matter and take action against
those  found  to  be  involved  in  the  illegal
trading of securities.

A public notice was issued in the newspapers
in  English,  Hindi  and  major  regional
languages warning the investors against the
functioning  of  illegal  stock  exchanges  and
advising investors not to deal, in any manner
whatsoever, with the entities providing illegal
trading  facilities  in  contravention  of  the
provisions of law.

There were some complaints regarding illegal
trading outside stock exchanges by registered
entities  also.  In  July  2003,  SEBI  in  a
nationwide operation carried out an inspection
of  a  broker(BSSL),  who  was  a  member  of
several  stock  exchanges  and  was  involved
in illegal trading in securities, simultaneously
at  his  offices  located  in  Kolkata,  Bangalore,
Bhuj,  Mathura  and  Mumbai.  SEBI  also
conducted  a  search  and  seizure  operation
against  BSSL.  The  inspection  revealed  the

90

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

involvement  of  the  alleged  broker  in  illegal
trading  in  securities.  The  broker  and  its
associated  entities  were  prohibited  from
buying,  selling  or  dealing  in  securities  till
completion of post-inspection action. An FIR
was also filed with the state police.

A  surprise  inspection  of  a  registered  broker
in  Kolkata  in  August  2003  revealed  that  he
was  involved  in  illegal  trading  activities  by
using unauthorized stock exchange terminals
provided  by  a  sub-broker  and  a  broker.  An
inspection was carried out and all the involved
entities  have  been  debarred  from  the
securities  market  till  completion  of  post-
inspection action.

VI.

Inspection of Broking/Sub Broking
Entities

A. SEBI  has  directed  the  exchanges  to
carry out comprehensive inspection of at
least  20  per  cent  of  the  active  brokers
every  year  beginning  from  the  financial
year  2003-2004  in  place  of  the  existing
requirement  of  10  per  cent.  It  has  also
been  stipulated  that  these  inspections
shall  invariably  include  the  subsidiaries
of  other  stock  exchanges  registered  as
brokers.

B. SEBI  has  directed  stock  brokers/  sub-
brokers of an exchange not to deal with
brokers/sub  brokers  of  the  same
exchange  either  for  proprietary  trading
or for trading on behalf of clients, except
with  the  prior  permission  of  the
exchange,  in  order  to  avoid  taking
excessive  exposure,  executing  pro
account trading from multiple locations.
C. SEBI  has  initiated  cancellation  of
registration of broker declared defaulter
or  expelled  from  the  exchange  since
1992 as an one-time exercise.
In order to ensure transparency and fair
play  in  the  securities  market  and  to

initiated,  so 

that  all 

With  a  view  to  enhancing  the  compliance
standards  of  stock  brokers,  the  scope  of
annual audit of books of accounts and other
records  of  stock  brokers  is  proposed  to  be
enhanced  so  as  to  include  key  regulatory
requirements  which  may  be  verified  at  the
time  of  annual  audit  and  instances  of  non
compliance/violations may be reported in the
form  of  annexure  to  the  audit  report.  Some
of  the  areas  identified  in  this  regard  include
requirements relating to maintenance of books
of accounts, collection of margins from clients,
maintaining segregation between clients funds
and  own  funds,  payment  and  deliveries  to
clients  and  details  of  related  party
transactions.

VII.

Inspection of Subsidiaries of the
Stock Exchange

Many stock exchanges floated subsidiaries to
become members of major stock exchanges
such  as  NSE  and  BSE.  These  subsidiaries
function as brokers of the major exchanges.
During  the  year,  15  subsidiaries  have  been
inspected.  The  inspection  of  the  books  and
records  of  the  subsidiaries  were  verified  to
find out if:

A. Books  of  accounts,  records  and  other
documents have been maintained in the
manner  specified  by  the  Securities
Contracts (Regulations) Rules, 1957 and

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

SEBI  (Stock  Brokers  and  Sub-brokers)
Regulations, 1992;

B. Provisions of the SEBI Act, the Securities
Contracts  (Regulations)  Act,  1956  and
the  provisions  made  thereunder  are
being  complied  with  by  the  subsidiary;
and

C. Provisions  of  the  bye-laws  to  business
rules,  etc.  of  the  exchange  and  the
subsidiary are adhered to.

In  case  of  subsidiaries  too,  follow-up
inspections  were  conducted  by  obtaining
periodical  compliance  reports  from  the
subsidiaries and holding regular meetings with
the  senior  management  of  the  subsidiaries
and their respective parent exchanges.

VIII. Inspection of Depositories
Depositories  play  an  important  role  in  the
Indian  capital  market.  They  are  the
depositories of securities and the confidence
of  the  investors  depends  on  the  healthy
functioning  of  depository  system.  During  the
year, there has been an inspection of Central
Depository Services Ltd. (CDSL) to examine
its functioning and compliance.

IX. System Audit
Securities  transactions  and  subsequent
clearing  and  settlement  system  is  now
technology driven. Exchanges depend largely
on the state-of-the art technology and reliable
software.  Relevance  of  technology  and
functional algorithm of software are crucial for
the efficient trade execution and clearing and
settlement processes. In order to ensure the
quality  of  systems  used  by  the  stock
exchanges,  SEBI  has  advised  all  the  active
stock exchanges to carry out a system audit.
After  examining  the  audit  reports,  SEBI
advised  the  stock  exchanges  to  rectify  the
deficiencies  mentioned  in  the  system  audit
report.

SURVEILLANCE

I. Market Surveillance Mechanism
Market  Surveillance  plays  a  key  role  in
ensuring safety and integrity of the market. It
also  ensures  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of
the  regulatory  system.  The  separate  market
surveillance  department  has  been
strengthened to monitor market movements,
identify price volatility, analyse its causes and
take prompt action in close coordination with
stock  exchange  and  depositories.  While  the
front line responsibility for market surveillance
lies with the stock exchanges, SEBI keeps a
constant  oversight  on  the  surveillance
activities  of  stock  exchanges  as  well.

Periodical  meetings  are  held  with  market
intermediaries  to  gather  information  and
exchange  views.  Any  unusual  market
movement arousing suspicion of any possible
wrong  doing  on  the  part  of  the  participants,
even informal alerts and rumours from various
sources,  formal  data  and  reports  from  stock
exchanges  and  specific  complaints  trigger
data analysis and preliminary enquiry by the
surveillance department. Based on findings of
such analysis, surveillance action is taken in
close co-ordination with stock exchanges and
depositories  and,  if  called  for,  full-scale
investigation is launched.

II.

Sophisticated and Integrated
Surveillance System

In  the  wake  of  growing  size  and  complexity
of the market, the market surveillance system

was  reviewed  keeping  in  view  the  present
environment of T+2 rolling settlement and risk
management system. Pursuant to the review
and  in  recognition  of  the  need  for  an
integrated  and  futuristic  surveillance  system
to  generate  early  alerts  and  facilitate  quick
action,  SEBI  commissioned  a  study  under
USAID  assistance  as  part  of  Financial
Institutions  Reform  &  Expansion  (FIRE)
Project to design an appropriate structure for
the  proposed  sophisticated  surveillance
model.  It  has  been  decided  to  have  state  of
the art technology-based system, capable of
automatic alert generation in respect of price
rigging,  creation  of  artificial  volumes,  insider
trading  etc.  by  accessing  and  analysing
variegated  data  from  multiple  sources  -
exchanges,  clearing  houses,  depositories,
EDIFAR/  listed  companies  and  market
participants. A technical committee of experts
constituted by SEBI is engaged in guiding on
the implementation of the project.

III.

Interim Surveillance Arrangement

Pending completion of the said sophisticated
automated integrated surveillance mechanism,
an interim enhanced surveillance mechanism
has been put in place since late June 2003.
As  a  coordinated  surveillance  platform,  a
group  of  top  executives  of  two  major  stock
exchanges,  depositories  and  SEBI  meet
regularly  every  week.  These  meetings,
attended  by  Whole  Time  Members  of  SEBI
and  usually  chaired  by  Chairman  of  SEBI
provide  a  standing  forum,  for  exchange  of
information/  data,  views  and  perceptions  on
market  movement  during  the  week,  and  to
discuss  emerging  concerns  or  surveillance
issues,  if  any,  and  to  consider  possible,
appropriate  surveillance  actions,  called  for.
Accordingly,  action  is  taken  in  coordination
with all concerned. On many occasions during
the  year,  such  surveillance  meetings  were
held  more  than  once  in  a  week,  if  situation

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

demanded.  45  surveillance  meetings  were
held  during  the  period  July  03  to  March  04.
The  interim  surveillance  mechanism  was
instrumental  in  taking  a  number  of  pre-
emptive  actions  and  policy  measures  /
procedural changes.

Inter Regulatory Alert System

IV.
SEBI-RBI  Group  on  Integrated  System  of
Alerts  was  set  up  to  recommend  suitable
measures  for  co-ordinated  action.  As
recommended  by  the  Group,  the  required
alerts  and  information/  data  have  been
identified and the system was put in place in
February 2004 and is operative.

Surveillance Actions

V.
Pursuant to the deliberations and decisions at
the weekly surveillance meetings, regulatory
actions  have  been  taken  from  time  to  time.
The surveillance action taken during the year
include placing select scrips on trade to trade
basis  for  such  period  as  was  considered
necessary,  based  on  certain  predetermined
objective  criteria,  so  as  to  arrest  suspected
manipulative/ speculative price rise in certain
scrips. The prompt action was found to have
had  softening  effect  on  the  price  rise  of  the
scrips. The objective criteria was also reviewed
as  circumstances  warranted.  Similarly,
calibration of margining was also done as and
when considered necessary.

The surveillance department was instrumental
for  a  surprise  inspection  on  certain  reported
dabba  trading  operators  at  multi  locations.
The  inspections  were  conducted  for  the  first
time,  in  close  co-ordination  with  other
regulatory/ enforcement agencies, making use
of  search  and  seizure  powers.  Entities
concerned  have  been  banned  from  carrying
out  operations  in  the  market  and  further

their  own  administrative  action  to  prevent/
curb such activities.

Unusual  movements  in  the  price  of  penny
stocks  and  the  shares  of  loss  making
companies came under the scrutiny of SEBI
and appropriate action was taken.

Whenever  there  were  abnormal  sudden
movements  in  index  level,  probing  analysis
was made of the time slot data relating trade
log  and  order  log  and  some  of  the  market
participants were called for discussions on a
few occasions.

Preferential  allotments  to  promoters,  bulk
deals,  margin  funding,  cash  payments  for
share deals, proprietary trading of brokers at
more  than  one  specified  location,  use  of
unauthorised  software  by  brokers  and
issuance  of  participatory  notes  by  foreign
institutional investors were some of the areas
which  came  under  surveillance  during  the
year.  These  triggered  changes  in  policy

the  exchanges  provide  for  benchmarking  of
parameters  and  prioritization  of  alert
generation.  During  the  year  NSE  (85)  and
BSE (24) had taken up 109 cases based on
the  alerts  generated  by  their  system.

Additionally, Surveillance Department of SEBI
referred  88  cases  to  Stock  Exchanges  for
detailed investigations during the year. During
the year, NSE completed investigations in 82
cases  and  BSE  92  cases.  Based  on  the
findings,  actions  were  required  and  initiated
in  respect  of  52  cases  by  NSE  (17)  and
BSE (35).

INVESTIGATIONS

5.
SEBI is empowered to investigate the affairs
of  any  securities  market  intermediary  or
persons  associated  with  security  market  or
any other persons suspected to have violated
any regulatory provisions, if it has reasonable
grounds  to  believe  that  transactions  in
securities  are  being  dealt  with  in  a  manner
detrimental to the investors or the market or
that the intermediary or person concerned has
violated  any 
regulatory  provisions.
Investigations  are  undertaken  to  probe  into
possible  or  suspected  or  alleged
infringements  of  security  market  regulations
such as price-manipulation, artificial volume-
creation, insider-trading. violation of takeover
code  or  any  other  regulations,  public  issue
related irregularities or any fraudulent or unfair
trade  practices.  Investigations  are  initiated
based  on  evidence  available  from  various
sources  including  SEBI’s  own  surveillance
activities  and  its  other  divisions,  stock
exchanges  and  other 
intermediaries,
complaints  from  various  sources  and  even
press  reports.  As  a  prelude  to  full-fledged
investigation, preliminary probe is carried out.
If the findings of the preliminary investigations
warrant,  a  case  is  taken  up  for  formal
investigation.

investigation, SEBI, as it is empowered, calls
for  information,  compels  production  of
documents, 
for

In  carrying  out 

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

actions  are  taken  through  quasi-judicial
process  of  enquiry,  personal  hearing  etc.
Depending  on  the  nature  and  the  gravity  of
offences,  penal  actions  are  taken.  These
include warning, suspension of activities, and
cancellation  of  registration,  prohibition  of
dealing in securities, denial of access to the
capital  market  for  a  specified  period  and
imposition of monetary penalties. And, where
appropriate, prosecution proceedings are also
launched.

Measures  have  been  taken  to  expedite  the
process  of  investigation  and  enhance  the
quality and effectiveness thereof. With a view
to  ensuring  objectivity,  uniformity,  coverage
and  consistency,  two  internal  committees
comprising  of  Division  Chiefs  deliberate  on
main  findings  of  all  investigation  reports,
evaluate  evidence  available  and  suggest
appropriate  course  of  action.  A  benchmark

time  limit  has  been  set  at  four  months  for
completion  of  preliminary  investigations  and
eight  months  for  completion  of  formal
investigations.

Details  of  investigations  taken  up  and
completed year-wise during the period 1992-
93  to  2003-04  are  given  below.  [See  Table
3.12 and Chart 3.5]

As  may  be  seen  from  Table  3.12,  the  focus
on  and  intensity  of  investigation  have  gone
up  during  the  last  two  years.  During  2003-
04,  152  investigation  cases  were  completed
as  against  106  cases  in  the  previous  year,
registering  a  substantial  increase  of  42  per
cent. As on March 31, 2004, there were only
31  cases  pending  for  more  than  one  year.
The  investigations  of  the  cases  were
expedited  so  as  to  bring  down  pendency  of
the cases to below one year.
