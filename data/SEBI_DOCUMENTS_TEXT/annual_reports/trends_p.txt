PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

1.
The  market  for  primary  securities  has
undergone  several  major  reforms  during
2003-04. The buoyant economic environment
has  also  contributed  substantially  for  the
deepening  and  broadening  of  the  primary
market. The number of issues that accessed
the market doubled in 2003-04 compared to
the  previous  year.  For  the  first  time  in  the
history of Indian capital market, a single issuer
has  raised  Rs.10,695  crore  which  is  more
than US$ 2.5 billion. In March 2004, the total
amount mobilized was Rs.13,418 crore, a little
over three times the full year mobilization of
2002-03. All sectors; private, joint and public
have accessed the capital markets during the
year.  Small,  medium  and  large  issues  have
visited the market. Several industries including
oil  and  natural  gas,  banking  and  financial,
chemical, engineering, information technology,
health care have mobilized funds.

Instrument  wise  analysis  exhibits  a  different
picture  this  year.  Equity  issues  have
dominated compared to bond issues in 2002-
03.  This  year  public  sector  issues  (including

Table 2.1: Capital Mobilized

PSU  banks)  have  been  dominant  raising
almost 85 per cent of the total amount.

Capital Raised during 2003-04

I.
In 2003-04, a total amount of Rs.23,271 crore
has  been  raised  which  is  five  times  higher
than  the  amount  raised  in  2002-03.  It  is  a
big jump that the market could absorb without
any ripples. A noteworthy feature is that over
74  per  cent  had  been  mobilized  in  the  last
two  months  of  the  fiscal  year  and  in  March
alone  over  57  per  cent  has  been  mobilized.
Over the past few years, investor profile and
issues processes have changed. The number
of institutional investors; FIIs, Mutual Funds,
FIs,  high  networth  investors  have  increased
and the book building process has been well
accepted.  Many  procedural  aspects  have
been  cut  down.  Out  of  57  issues,  35  were
public  issues  and  22  were  rights  issues.
Within  the  domain  of  public  issues,  listed
issues  had  an  edge  in  terms  of  numbers  at
21  compared  to  last  year  wherein  issues  by
listed  companies  were  8  in  number.  Tables

Size and Composition of the Issues

II.
Tables  2.4  and  2.8  provide  information  on
interval distribution and large issues. A close
look  at  Table  2.4  reveals  a  wide  distribution
of  issues  across  sizes.  Though  there  are
clusters between Rs.100 crore and 500 crore
and Rs.10 crore and 50 crore, these clusters
are  highly  concentrated.  In  2002-03,  of  the
total amount raised, about 95 per cent of the
amount raised fell in the interval of Rs.100 to
500 crore. This shows that issues of different
sizes have accessed the market in the current
year. Large issues, that is Rs.100 crore and
above,  account  for  97  per  cent  (Rs.22,539
crore). Their number is 25 out of the total of
57. In 2003-04, equity issues have dominated

bond issues. The average issue size has also
gone up during the year.

Industrywise Mobilization

III.
Banking  and  financial  institutions  have
continued to dominate the primary market in
terms  of  number  of  issues.  However,  the
amount  mobilized  by  these  industries  has
come  down  compared  to  the  previous  year
in terms of their per centage share. The single
largest  issue  by  ONGC  has  skewed  entire
picture this year. This one alone accounts for
roughly 45 per cent of the total amount raised
in the year. Banking and finance has a share
of  23.3  per  cent  followed  by  Chemicals  (8.9
per  cent),  Engineering  (4.3  per  cent),  and

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

27

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

Information Technology (3.5 per cent). Other
industries  have  small  share  in  the  total
amount  raised.  There  have  been  two  major
public  sector  issues  namely  GAIL  (India)
Limited  and 
Indian  Petrochemicals
Corporation Limited (IPCL) which raised more
than Rs.1,000 crore each. A large automobile
company,  Maruti  Udyog  Ltd  has  also
accessed the market during the year with an
issue  of  Rs.993  crore.  Almost  all  the  mega

issues  have  been  over  subscribed  ranging
from  around  300  per  cent  to  1800  per  cent.
Even  the  biggest  issue,  ONGC  was  over
subscribed  to  the  extent  of  588  per  cent.
Traditional  visitors  such  as  IDBI  and  ICICI
also accessed the market frequently with their
bond issues. Some of the pubic sector banks
namely  UCO  Bank,  IOB,  IDBI  Bank,  Vijaya
Bank  and  Bank  of  Maharashtra  have
accessed the market successfully.

Box 2.1: Disinvestment in Public Sector Units in India
Box 2.1: Disinvestment in Public Sector Units in India

Privatization  means  transferring  the  control  of  an  enterprise  from  the  government  sector  to  the  private  sector.
The  Government  of  India  started  its  disinvestment  programme  in  the  1980s.1  The  main  objectives  behind
disinvestment are releasing large amount of resources locked up in public enterprises, reducing the public debt,
transferring the commercial risk etc2.

Indian Policy of Disinvestment
Indian  policy  of  disinvestment  in  Public  Sector  Enterprises  (PSEs)  can  safely  be  divided  into  three  different
periods3. The period from mid 1980 to 1990 constitutes the first phase. The second phase started with the balance
of  payment  crisis  of  1991.  The  third  phase  of  the  disinvestment  policy  started  from  1996  .  The  Disinvestment
Commission was set up in 1996 and a separate Ministry of Disinvestment was created in the year 1999. In the
budget speech of the year 2000-01, the government stated clearly that it was prepared to reduce its stake in the
non-strategic PSEs even below 26 per cent and the main methodology adopted will be that of strategic sales. The
budget speech of the year 2002-03 mentioned that the disinvestment proceeds would be utilized in the modernization
and upgradation of PSE’s, creation of new assets, and generation of employment and retiring of public debt. Thus
the broad objectives of disinvestment can be classified as reduction in fiscal deficit, equal distribution and increase
in efficiency. A summary of disinvestment proceeds is given in the following table. It is clear that the amount raised
by the disinvestment is usually below the target except for a few years. With growing fiscal deficit, a declining real
GDP and a declining trend in the investment (public and private), all as a per centage of GDP, it is necessary is to
increase  the  investment  in  the  economy.  Releasing  the  potential  locked  up  in  public  sector  enterprises  is  one
solution. One way to divest is strategic sale which has its own limitations.

The other approach is to go through the capital market route which has certain advantages as compared to the
former. Firstly, this increases public ownership in these units through retail participation. In the recent disinvestment
cases the government had set aside a significant portion of the issue size for retail participation and that too at a
reduced price band. Secondly it generates revenue for the government without increasing the tax burden on the
people and thirdly it helps in better price discovery, increasing the floating stock of the company and deepening the
market by accentuating the rate of participation. The success story of PSU’s disinvestment in the year 2003-04
confirms this trend. This was one of the busiest periods of the Indian capital market in which there were eight public
offers. All this was not possible without an efficient and dynamic capital market. The resurgent secondary market
prepared a background for the declining primary market. This has encouraged Government to engage in six big
disinvestments in just two weeks through the capital market route. Every issue was subscribed many times over.

Secondary Securities Market (SSM)

A transparent, efficient, fair, modern and clean
secondary  market  for  securities  is  essential
for the healthy development of an integrated
capital  market.  Worldwide  stock  exchange
trading  platforms,  clearing  houses  and
settlement  systems  have  undergone
significant  changes  during  the  year.
Globalisation  of  capital  market  appears  to
have had strong impact on the functioning of
secondary  market  of  securities.  Alliances,
mergers and cross border link have occupied
centre stage of securities industry.

The Indian stock market has performed quite
well during the year by posting a hefty annual
return  of  83  per  cent.  This  return  is  one  of
the highest among the emerging markets and
highest among developed markets. Tables 2.9
to  2.11  and  charts  2.4  and  2.5  present
information with respect to various indices, per
centage variation and other indicators. Table
2.9  exhibits  information  on  monthly  close
values of 4 indices namely Nifty, Nifty Junior,
Sensex  and  BSE  100.  From  the  table,  it  is
clear  that  during  most  of  the  months  the
returns have been positive and delivery varied
between  16.40  per  cent  to  -4.50  (Nifty)  and
15.70 to -2.90 (Sensex). A close examination
of the indices in monthly returns reveals that
popular  indices  moved  together  with  a  little
difference. December 2003 has turned out to
be one of the best months for investors with
returns of 16.4 per cent (Nifty), 15.70 per cent
(Sensex),  18.50  per  cent  (BSE  100)  and
21.60  (Nifty  Junior).  Out  of  the  12  months
the  returns  have  been  positive  for  nearly  8
months.  Returns  were  negative  only  during
the last 3 months of the fiscal year.The size
of  positive  returns  is  much  higher  than  size
of  negative  returns.  There  is  a  slight
difference  in  the  movement  in  broad  indices
as compared to popular indices.

Performance of Sectoral Indices

I.
The cyclical nature of economy has its impact
on various segments of capital markets. There
are some popular sectoral indices used in the
indian  market.  They  are  BSEteck  Index,
Bankex  Index,  BSEPSU  Index,  NSE  Fmcg
Index and CNX 500. Sectoral indices provide
additional information in terms of contribution
of  each  sector  to  the  overall  return  of  the
market.  They  are  considered  to  be  more
volatile  than  broad  based  indices.  Since  all
stocks  come  from  the  same  industry,  the
index  movements  will  be  highly  influenced
either way. These features can be seen from
Table  2.10.  The  range  of  movement  in
sectoral indices is higher than the movement
in  a  broad  based  indices.  For  example  the
PSU index posted its highest return of 30.60
per  cent  in  May  2003  and  lowest  of  -4.70
per cent in January 2004. This is higher than
the 35 per cent range. This range of variation
is  not  observed  generally  in  broad  indices.
Sectoral  indices  are  useful  for  institutional
investors,  mutual  funds  and  specialist
investors.  In  the  capital  market,  several
indicators  are  used  to  assess  whether  the
market  is  over  priced,  under  priced  and/or
correctly priced. Two important indicators are:

A) Price earning ratio (P/E); and
B) Price book ratio (PB ratio)
It is very difficult to say what is the right ratio on
the basis of which one can say whether the
market is over priced or under priced. However
participants in the market have a broad intuition
about these ratios. Table 2.11 provides these
ratios for four indices, two from NSE and two
from  BSE.  The  P/E  ratio  has  been  on  a
continuous upward movement in the past year.
It touched its peak in December 2003 for nearly
all the indices. This is a time when the returns
from the indices were also the highest. Cetris
paribus higher the growth in index, higher will
be P/E ratio. The PB ratio also touched its
highest mark in December 2003.

II.
NSE and BSE are the two major exchanges
in  terms  of  volume  traded,  delivered  and
market  capitalization.  Between  these  two
exchanges, NSE accounts for about two-thirds
of  the  turnover  and  the  remaining  is
accounted  for  by  BSE.  Tables  2.12  to  2.14
and Chart 2.6 present information on turnover
and market capitalization. Both the exchanges
have registered substantial growth in turnover
in  the  one  year  period  and  the  turnover  has
more  than  doubled  on  both  the  exchanges.
The  total  turnover  on  all  the  Indian  stock
exchanges for the year 2003-04 works out to
Rs.  16,20,497  crore.  In  terms  of  liquidity  of
Indian  market,  there  is  still  plenty  of  scope

Table 2.9: Stock Indices*

for  the  turnover  to  grow  further.  In  tandem
with  turnover  even  the  market  capitalization
on both the exchanges more than doubled in
this  12-month  period.  The  total  market
capitalization as on March 31, 2004 stood at
Rs.12,01,207 crore on BSE and Rs.11,20,976
crore on NSE. The tables also provide further
information  on  total  market  cap  on  various
indices on both NSE and BSE. The two more
popular indices namely Nifty and Sensex have
about  55  per  cent  and  25  per  cent  of  total
market  capitalization  of  the  respective
exchanges.  Sectoral  indices  constitute  a
lesser  percentage  of  the  total  market  cap
with  the  only  exception  being  the  BSEpsu
index.

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

III. Market Trends: Volatility of Sectoral

Indices

Volatility is an important indicator of the stock
market. Wide fluctuation in prices of stock can
scare  away  the  investor  from  the  market
place.  Therefore,  it  is  generally  desired  that
indices  and  stocks  maintain  stable  price
movement.  It  can  be  noted  that  price
movements are not in the hands of any single
individual  and  that  they  reflect  aggregate
demand and supply at a given point of time.
Table 2.15 and Chart 2.7 provide monthwise

daily  volatility  for  various  indices.  It  can  be
observed  from  both  the  table  and  the  chart
that the volatility has been under control. The
broad  based  indices,  namely,  Nifty  and
Sensex exhibit comparatively less volatility as
opposed to sectoral indices.

Recently,  SEBI  conducted  a  research  study
on stock market volatilities covering 18 capital
market  jurisdictions  drawn  from  mature  and
emerging markets. Box 2.2 presents summary
of the research findings.

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

Box 2.2: Stock Market Volatility – An International Comparison
Box 2.2: Stock Market Volatility – An International Comparison

The  issues  of  volatility  and  risk  have  become  increasingly  important  in  recent  times  to  financial  practitioners,
market participants, regulators and researchers. Statistically, the term volatility implies standard deviation around
the  mean  value  of  the  stock  or  index  return.  Since  volatility  is  a  standard  measure  of  financial  vulnerability,  it
plays a key role in assessing risk/return trade-offs.
The asset-return variability is generally characterised through statistical distributions. Generally, a normal distribution
is used to characterise asset returns, where the distribution is centered around the mean and its width is measured
by the standard deviation (volatility). But again, there are many return series which are not normally distributed and
tend to exhibit excess kurtosis, so that extreme values become more likely than what the normal distribution would
suggest. Such fat-tailed distributions are common among financial parameters, where returns are highly concentrated
towards extreme values in either direction (positive or negative). Skewness, which is another higher order moment,
is also common with equity returns, where big down-moves are typically more likely than comparable big up-moves.
In recent times, intra-day volatility has assumed considerable significance because of its influence on the decision
of the market participants and its impact on other instruments such as derivatives. The intra-day volatility estimators
use  indicators  like  open,  high,  low  and  close  to  characterise  the  distribution  since  most  of  the  asset  pricing
models  are  based  on  continuous  time.  These  extreme-value  estimators  are  more  efficient,  because  they  use
additional  information  about  movements  throughout  the  period  that  snapshots  at  the  end  of  a  period  cannot
hope to summarise. There are four measures which capture intra-day volatility (i) open-close volatility, (ii) high-
low volatility, (iii)open-open volatility and (iv) close-close volatility. Recently, SEBI has carried out a study "Stock
Market  Volatility:  An  International  Comparison  and  its  Methodology"  and  the  summarized  findings  are
presented here in brief.
To measure high-low volatility, the Parkinson’s (1980) model is used, which is as follows:

where k = 0.601 and Ht and Lt denote intra-day high and low respectively. Open-close volatility is measured using
German-Klass Model (1980) and that is as follows: 
where Ht , Lt , Ct, and Ot denote intra-day high, low, close and open respectively. The close-close volatility and

open-open volatility uses the standard volatility estimation model, i.e., 

where r denotes

open to open returns or close to close returns and denotes mean returns of either open to open returns or close to
close returns. The major findings of the study are provided below:

1) The inter-day close to close Sensex daily volatility during 2003 is more than half of 2000 and almost one-third
of peak volatility of the decade achieved during the1992 scam. The 2003 close to close daily volatility is
marginally higher than the 2002 daily volatility, which is the lowest since 1991.

2) The inter-day close to close S&P CNX Nifty daily volatility during 2003 is almost 62% of 2000 daily volatility. The
2003 close to close daily volatility is marginally higher than the 2002 daily volatility, which is the lowest since 1991.
3) The inter-day open to open Sensex daily volatility during 2003 is 42 per cent of 2000 daily volatility and more
than one-third of the peak volatility of the decade achieved during 1992 scam. The 2003 open to open daily
volatility is marginally higher than the 2002 daily volatility, which is the lowest since 1991.

4) The inter-day open to open S&P CNX Nifty daily volatility during 2003 is 62 per cent of 2000 daily volatility. The
2003 open to open daily volatility is marginally higher than the 2002 daily volatility, which is the lowest since 1991.
5) The intra-day Sensex volatility during 2003 is almost half of 2000 intra-day volatility. The lowest intra-day volatility

is registered during 1995 and then onwards it continuously increased till 2000.

6) The intra-day S&P CNX Nifty volatility during 2003 is 60 per cent of 2000 intra-day volatility. The lowest intra-
day volatility is registered during 1995 and then onwards it continuously increased till 2000 and then started
falling.

IV. Turnover
There  are  23  exchanges  in  the  country.  As
far as business is concerned two exchanges
dominate  the  entire  market  -  the  NSE  and
BSE. In the year 2003-04, the total turnover
of  all  exchanges  amounted  to  Rs.16,20,497

crore  of  which  NSE  accounted 
for
Rs.10,99,533  crore  and  BSE  Rs.5,02,618
crore.  These  two  exchanges  account  for
about 99 per cent of the total turnover. Both
NSE and BSE have recorded 78 per cent and
60  per  cent  growth  over  previous  year

respectively. Most other exchanges recorded
decline  though  there  are  few  exception  like
OTCEI.  14  stock  exchanges  had  almost  nil
turnover. A close look at the time series data

on  turnover  reveals  that  the  other  21
exchanges have been on a decline and many
of them do not appear to attract any turnover.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

stock  exchange  still  continues  to  have  the
largest  number  of  stock  brokers  followed  by
NSE, OTCEI and BSE in that order. In terms
of  active  brokers,  NSE  ranks  number  one.
BSE and CSE score second and third position
respectively.  About  90  per  cent  of  NSE
brokers are active while the percentage is 72
at  BSE.  In  some  other  exchanges  less  than
25  per  cent  of  the  brokers  are  active  and  in
many exchanges, not even a single broker is
active.  The  activity  of  the  brokers  has  come
down  on  almost  all  exchanges  compared  to
the  previous  year.  This  is  very  surprising,
considering the performance of the market in
2003-04. Generally it is perceived that when
the  volume  goes  up  and  the  market
performance is better, more and more brokers
are  expected  to  take  interest  in  the  activity.
Unexpected  performance  may  be  indicative
of  consolidation  and  concentration  of  the
broking industry.

Many  exchanges  floated  subsidiaries  and
became  members  of  the  NSE  and/or  BSE.
Table  2.19  provides  the  details  of  stock
exchanges’  subsidiaries  and  their  turnover.
Some  of  the  subsidiaries  are  doing  slightly
better.  The  year  2003-04  appears  to  be  a
much  better  one  for  the  subsidiaries
compared to the previous year. The turnover
of all subsidiaries amounted to 10.12 per cent

of  total  turnover  and  it  is  much  higher
compared  to  6.15  per  cent  of  the  previous
year.  The  subsidiaries  of  ICSE,  Bangalore
Stock  Exchange,  Ahmedabad  Stock
Exchange,  Ludhiana  Stock  Exchange
recorded higher turnover.

Trading Frequency

In  an  ideal  situation  all  the  securities  listed
must be traded at any given point of time but
it  seldom  happens  in  any  market.  Some
companies have high liquidity and others have
low liquidity. The year 2003-04 appears to be
a  better  one  compared  to  the  previous  year
in  terms  of  trading  frequency.  A  greater
percentage of companies traded on more than
100  days  during  the  year  compared  to  the
previous  year.  About  92.2  per  cent  of  NSE
companies  and  75.1  per  cent  of  BSE
companies  traded  for  more  than  100  days.
The  trading  frequency  up  to  90  days  and
above  has  also  risen  compared  to  the
previous 
interesting
development  is  that  the  percentage  of
companies that traded on 30 days or less has
come  down.  This  is  a  positive  development.
The  total  number  of  companies  that  traded
on  both  the  exchanges  however,  has  come
down compared to the previous year.

Equities to T+1
Equities to T+1

Background
Currently,  Indian  secondary  market  for  equities,  clears  and  settles  all  the  transactions  on  trade  plus  two  days
(T+2 rolling settlement). There is a proposal to reduce this to T+ 1. A study has been conducted to identify cost-
benefits of migration to T+1.

Methodology
The  secondary  source  for  this  study  was  not  appropriate,  as  there  was  no  published  information  to  rely  on  to
arrive  at  costs  and  benefits.  Hence,  the  primary  technique  of  questionnaire  was  employed.  The  questionnaire
broadly  contained  two  sections  -  one  dealing  with  incremental  costs  and  the  second  dealing  with  incremental
benefits. Each section further contained detailed elements of incremental costs and benefits. Costs and benefits
so obtained are discounted by using the net present value technique.

Constituents
There are four categories of constituents - stock exchanges, depositories, clearing corporation/house and stock
brokers,  who  are  supposedly  affected  by  the  change.  Though,  there  are  23  stock  exchanges,  nearly  all  the
trading volume takes place on the NSE and the BSE. Therefore, these two exchanges have been considered for
the  study.  NSDL  and  CDSL  represented  the  depositories  while  the  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation
Limited  of  NSE  and  BOI  Shareholding  Limited  of  BSE  were  selected  as  sample  representatives  for  clearing
function. Five broking firms were also covered.

Major Findings of the Study
Cost benefit ratio works to 0.85. This means for every likely expense of 0.85 paise, there will be benefit of Re.1.
The total estimated cost roughly amounts to Rs. 45.40 crore and benefits Rs.53.50 crore.
The major class of beneficiaries are investors as they are able to save in the form of interest on margin money.·
Brokers as a group are the second biggest beneficiaries.
Incremental costs and benefits are negligible to the depositories and to the brokers.·
Clearing  Corporation/
house  being  only  a  conduit  do  not  have  much  of  incremental  cost  and  benefit.Thus,  it  can  be  said  that  the
benefits  exceed  the  costs  of  migrating  to  T+1.  However,  caution  needs  to  be  exercised,  as  there  are  many
unquantifiable issues and the introduction of T+1 is expected to change the microstructure substantially.

VI. Dematerialization

in 

any 

Price and default risk are two very important
aspects 
capital  market.
Dematerialization has speeded up the transfer
and ownership of securities and many related
risks have been almost eliminated. Table 2.21
provides  information  on  various  aspects  of
dematerialization for the past two years both
at NSDL and CDSL. All the parameters have
registered  a  significant  growth  during  the
previous  period.  The  number  of  companies
signed  for  dematerialization  has  gone  up  to
5216  and  4810  at  NSDL  and  CDSL
respectively.  The  number  of  companies
available  for  demat  have  also  gone  up.  The
number  of  shares  dematerialized  has  also
risen  to  8,36,935  lakh  and  1,40,100  lakh  at
NSDL  and  CDSL  respectively.  The  value  of
shares settled under the demat form has gone

44

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

up by 2.8 per cent and 11.0 per cent at NSDL
and CDSL. Market capitalization of companies
admitted for dematerialization and that of the
listed  companies  are  nearly  the  same.
Depository participants have been spreading
their  presence  to  more  and  more  places.
Depository participants of NSDL are available
at 242 locations while depository participants
of CDSL have their facilities at 108 locations.
The location of Depository participant of NSDL
has gone up by one whereas in the case of
CDSL,  it  has  come  down  by  two.  Large
number  of  bond  and  commercial  paper
instruments  have  also  been  dematerialized.
NSDL  is  far  ahead  of  CDSL  in  this  respect
also. The total value of demated bonds works
out to Rs.2,47,268 crore and Rs.5,623 crore
at NSDL and CDSL. The size of commercial
paper demated stood at Rs.10,455 crore and
Rs.396 crore at NSDL and CDSL respectively.

VII. Derivatives Market in India

require 

Investors 
risk  management
instruments  for  the  purpose  of  effective
investment management. Financial derivatives
such  as,  index  futures,  index  options,  stock
options, stock futures, interest rate derivatives
and  others  are  considered  to  be  effective
instruments  for  managing  various  types  of
financial risks. The Indian capital market has
had  several  of  these  financial  derivatives  in
use  for  the  past  few  years.  Both  the  NSE
and  the  BSE  allowed  trading  in  financial
derivatives.  Between  these  two  exchanges,
NSE  has  a  lion’s  share  in  terms  of  number
of trades, open interest and notional value of
contracts traded. BSE is far behind NSE.

A. Derivatives

Single  stock  futures  continue  to  dominate
derivatives  market  with  a  percentage  share
of about 55- 65 per cent during 2003-04. One
important  development  is  that  index  futures
started picking up during the year. Percentage
of  number  of  contracts  traded  to  the  total
number of derivatives contracts traded in the

market has increased steadily from about 14
per cent to 34 per cent (a growth of 150 per
cent).  Both  index  options  and  stock  options
recorded  decline  in  terms  of  number  of
contracts as well as percentage share. Single
stock futures share slid in 2003-04 compared
to the previous year. Futures contract appear
to be predominant when compared to option
contracts.  Single  stock  futures  recorded
continuous growth month after month except
for  three  months  i.e.  November  2003,
February  and  March  2004.  The  growth  rate
also has been very high.

Though  the  BSE  has  a  very  small  share  of
the total volume of derivatives segment, one
important feature is that index futures not only
dominate but also account for almost over 60
per  cent  of  the  volume  traded.  Yet,  another
specialty  is  that  BSE  recorded  zero  volume
turnover in the index option segment. In many
months even stock options remained dormant.
This is in sharp contrast with NSE trading in
derivatives where single stock futures are the
most dominant segment. Tables 2.23 to 2.30
and  Charts  2.8  to  2.11  give  more  details  on
exchange traded financial derivatives in India.

VIII. Volatility of Stock Markets
Trend  of  movements  in  stock  prices/indices
represent  historical  movements.  An  analysis
of  such  trend  indicates  the  economic
fundamentals  of  the  scrip/index.  Judgments
are  made  based  upon  conclusions  drawn
from a set of variables derived from the trend
in  the  scrip/index.  Such  technical  indicators
afford  a  quick  view  on  the  next  likely  move
by markets.

Table 2.31 and Charts 2.12 and 2.13 provide
detailed  information  on  the  daily  volatility
behaviour  of  various  stock  indices  from

different  countries  in  different  regions,
representing  mature  as  well  as  emerging
markets. Additionally, annualized volatility has
also  been  provided  for  each  country.  From
the  table  and  the  charts,  it  is  evident  that
volatility,  by  and  large,  is  lower  in  mature
markets  compared  to  that  in  emerging
markets.  Amongst  the  developed  markets,
Germany has highest volatility and the United
States has the lowest volatility. Amongst the
emerging  markets,  Brazil  has  the  highest
volatility  while  Malaysia  has  the  lowest
volatility. India has an annualized volatility of
22.7 per cent (NSE) and 21.4 per cent (BSE).

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

3. MUTUAL FUNDS (MFs)
As  in  mature  markets,  mutual  funds  in
emerging markets have been among the
fastest growing institutional investors. Indeed,
mutual funds assets under management in
emerging  markets  grew  by  96  per  cent
between the end of 1997 and June, 2003 and
as a result, it rose from 8 per cent of GDP to
15 per cent. One key difference between
mutual funds of mature and emerging markets
has been the relative importance of bond and
equity funds. In the mature markets, the asset
under equity funds are often much larger than
those of bond funds (particularly in Japan, the
United  Kingdom,  the  United  States).  In
contrast, emerging market bond funds in a
number of countries have larger assets under
management than do equity funds particularly
in Brazil, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. In part,
this reflects the difference in the relative
development of the local markets in mature
and emerging markets. This difference reflects
a search for higher yield on the part of retail
investors. As the nominal interest rates have
declined in many emerging countries since the
late 1990s, retail investors have seen an
extended  decline  in  the  interest  rate  of
traditional savings instruments. To obtain
higher yields, retail investors subscribe to bond
funds  with  investment  in  longer  term
government and corporate bonds.

Mutual funds, as a class, have become an
important segment of institutional investors.
Assets under management have gone up
substantially by Rs.46,809 crore and in per
centage terms by 1015 per cent over the past
12  months.  Private  sector  mutual  funds
mobilized Rs.5,34,650 crore with a market
share of 90.59 per cent while public sector
mutual funds and UTI together mobilized
Rs.31,548  crore  and  Rs.23,992  crore
respectively with a market share of 5.35 per
cent and 4.07 per cent respectively. Total
repurchases of the industry amounted to
Rs.5,43,382 crore of which private sector

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

mutual funds contributed Rs.4,92,104 crore
with a market share of 90.56 per cent, the rest
has been shared by public sector and UTI. Net
inflow during the year worked out to Rs.46,809
crore of which about 91 per cent has been
contributed by private sector mutual funds
whereas  the  public  sector  and  UTI  have
contributed 5.55 per cent and 3.56 per cent
respectively. From these figures, it is clear that
the  private  sector  in  each  of  the  three
segments accounted for 91 per cent showing
their overwhelming dominance in the market.
Tables 2.33 to 2.38 and Charts 2.15 to 2.17
provide detailed statistics and pictorial situation
of the mutual fund industry in 2002-03 and
2003-04.

Analysis on the basis of nature of schemes like
income, growth and balanced scheme throws
further light on the industry. Income funds
dominate the entire scene, in terms of number
of  schemes,  gross 
funds  mobilized,
repurchases and net inflow. There are 197
income funds, 169 growth funds, and 37
balanced schemes as on March 31, 2004. The
significance of income funds is revealed if one
looks at the money figures of this category.
The total funds mobilized by income schemes
have amounted to Rs.5,60,973 crore, while
that  of  growth  and  balanced  schemes
amounted to Rs.26,695 crore and Rs.2,523
crore respectively. These two classes account
for less than 5 per cent of the total mobilization.
Income schemes also dominate repurchases
at Rs.5,21,368 crore with a 95 per cent share.
When analyzed in terms of net inflow, these
three classes have received Rs.39,603 crore,
Rs.7,219 crore and a negative amount of
Rs.13 crore respectively. In terms of net inflow,
income funds have a larger share of the cake.

Mutual funds play a significant role in the
purchase and sale of equity shares and debt in
the secondary market. The details of their
monthly purchases and sales are presented in
Tables 2.34 and 2.35 and Chart 2.17. A close
examination of the tables at disaggregate level

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

57

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

provides no clear-cut pattern in the equity
segment. There is some amount of random
behavior in their purchase and sale of equity
shares. In the debt market except in the month
of February 2004, they were the net buyers.
On the whole, they were the net buyer of
equity and debt to the extent of Rs.1,307 crore
and Rs.22,701 crore respectively.

The break up of schemes between close-end
and open-end and on the basis of objectives is
provided in Table 2.37. The Indian market, like
any other developed market is dominated by
open-end schemes, with close-end schemes
playing a distant second role. Of the total 403
schemes,  363  are  open-ended  and  the
balance 40 are close-end. Of the open-end
schemes, income oriented schemes dominate
with 186 of the total 363. This is closely
followed by growth schemes with 143.

Two classes of institutional investors that play
a significant role in the capital market are
mutual funds and foreign institutional investors.
Between these two, FIIs are significantly ahead
of mutual funds in India. FIIs have been net
buyers of equity and debt throughout the year.
FIIs have invested more in equity and less in
debt due to regulatory restrictions. Table 2.38
provides comparative investment picture of
MFs and FIIs. During the year, total investment
of FIIs have worked out to Rs.45,767 crore
(US$ 9.950 bn) whereas total investment of
mutual funds worked to Rs.24,009 crore. This
picture may mislead to some extent, because
out of the total investment of Rs.24,009 crore,
Rs.22,701 crore was in the debt market and
the remaining Rs.1,307 crore was in the equity
market. In equity markets, investments of FIIs
far outweigh the investments of mutual funds.

Box 2.4: Fund of Funds (FoFs)
Box 2.4: Fund of Funds (FoFs)

Fund  of  funds  (FoFs)  is  a  mutual  fund  scheme,  which  invests  in  the  schemes  of  same  mutual  funds  or  other
mutual  funds,  instead  of  investing  in  securities.  These  funds  can  invest  in  equity  oriented,  debt  oriented  and
liquid  schemes  or  sector  specific  schemes.  Depending  on  the  investment  style  of  the  fund  managers,  fund  of
funds schemes can be broadly classified into:

Sector specific funds Such type of funds invest in different sectors of the economy and thus hedge themselves
against the under performance of any sector by taking the advantage from the rise in another sector.

Asset allocation funds These funds diversify investment by holding several different asset classes at the same
time. By varying the stocks to bonds proportion, the fund endeavors to endow the investors, with an appropriate
asset allocation in different stages of their lives. They are also known as life cycle funds.

A Typical Fund of Funds

BOARD OF INDIA

The various benefits of fund of funds scheme are presented below.

Diversification  As  a  fund  of  funds  invests  in  the  schemes  of  other  funds,  it  provides  a  greater  degree  of
diversification.

Uncomplicated Instead of investing in different stocks/units of mutual funds and keeping a track record of all of
them, it will be much easier to invest in and track only one fund, which in turn invests in other mutual funds.

Cheap  While  entering  into  the  capital  markets  it  is  difficult  to  diversify  because  of  limited  funds.  Fund  of  funds
provide an opportunity to go for diversification with comparatively limited amounts.

Risk  Investors  can  trim  down  the  risk  by  choosing  this  route.  Because  of  diversification,  even  if  one  stock/
scheme is not performing well risk level comes down.

Expertise of Various Managers  As  in  the  case  of  schemes  of  mutual  funds,  fund  of  funds  scheme  also  work
under  the  due  diligence  of  a  fund  manager.  This  gives  the  scheme  additional  expertise  as  compared  to  other
mutual funds schemes. These schemes also provide access to information which may be difficult to obtain for an
investor on a case by case basis.

However, just like any other investment, fund of funds is not free from shortcomings. Few of the disadvantages
are specified below.

1. Additional  Fees  The  more  diversified  the  fund  is,  the  greater  the  likelihood  that  the  investor  will  incur  an

incentive fee on one or more of the constituent managers, regardless of overall FoF performance.1

2. Associated Risks Risks associated with all the underlying funds get added at this level. Following are the

type of risks associated with fund of funds scheme.

 Management Risks Every fund manager has a particular style of diversification. This diversification style
will  be  in  perfect  correlation  with  the  number  of  managers  involved.  The  views  of  a  manager  may  be
altogether  different  from  the  market.  As  pointed  out  by  Harry  Kat2  that  once  a  fund  of  funds  reached  a
certain number of managers, adding more flattens the returns curve and diversifies away alpha.

 Operational Risks Due diligence of a scheme in itself gives rise to operational risks. Continuous monitoring
is required for knowing about performance of the funds, any possibility of a fraud and to know about the
investment style of the funds and any desirable or undesirable changes in it.

 Qualitative Risks These include risks associated with the management environment of the fund such as

organizational structure, infrastructure, investment process, operational issues etc.

Realizing  the  benefits  of  the  scheme  and  the  potential  of  the  Indian  mutual  fund  industry  SEBI  had  decided  to
allow fund of funds from May 29, 2003.

Regulations in India

The  fund  of  funds  scheme  was  introduced  in  the  Indian  market  by  making  suitable  amendments  in  the  SEBI
(Mutual Funds) (Amendment) Regulations, 2003.

Fund of Funds Schemes in India
Prudential ICICI was the first to introduce fund of funds in India in November 2003. Till the end of this financial
year, total of eight fund of funds schemes have mobilized Rs.1,189 crore and have assets worth Rs.816 crore.
Up  to  March  2003,  there  were  about  120  fund  of  funds  operating  in  the  global  market  having  assets  size  of
approximately US $ 130 billion.

higher yield by going out along the credit risk
spectrum.

Strong risk adjusted returns of Indian market
have  led  FIIs  to  make  more  allocations  to
India.  Institutional  Investors  have  a  superior
capacity  to  absorb  and  process  information
and their ability to conduct a large volume of
transaction, lowers the cost of intermediation
and  benefits  investors  and  issuers  alike.
Institutional investors also contribute to better
transparency  and  governance  for  the
improvement of market micro- structure.

Low  short  term  interest  rates  in  the  major
financial  sector  has  contributed  to  the
resurgence in economic growth and to higher
corporate  earnings.  This  in  turn  has
strengthened  corporate  performance,  thus
improving the fundamental economic output.
The  combination  of  improved  fundamentals
and  abundant  liquidity  buoyed  global  asset
prices.  Appetite  for  risk  recovered  and
investment  flow  suggested  allocation  away
from  relatively  low  yielding  asset  in  favor  of
risk  investment.  Equity  market  worldwide
staged  strong  rallies  in  2003  following  three
successive years of decline. A complimentary
catalyst  of  improved  credit  quality  and
abundant liquidity also pushed credit spread
to  mature  and  emerging  markets  bonds  to
low levels.

This  combination  created  a  favourable
external  financial  environment  for  emerging
market borrowers in 2003 and in 2004. Gross
and  net  issuance  by  emerging  market
countries  recovered  strongly  in  2003.  Bond
issuance  in  January  2004  was  exceptionally
high.  These  developments  have  helped  to
improve the outlook for the stability of financial
markets.

Low  short-term  interest  rates  and  a  steep
yield curve provide powerful incentive to boost

International  portfolio  theory  suggests  that
institutional investors can achieve better risk
return  profile  by  diversifying  abroad,  mainly
because  of  additional  diversification  of  non
systemic  country  risk.  Moreover,  the  dismal
performance  of  mature  market  stocks  in  the
aftermath of the bursting of technology, media
and telecommunication (TMT) bubble and the
low interest rate environment have increased
institutional  investors’  interest  in  alternative
investments.  Investors  are  provided  equity,
real  estate,  hedge  funds  and  special  debt
offerings  (such  as  credit  derivatives  and
distressed  debt).  These  provide  more
investment opportunities with new sources of
excess  return  as  well  as  diversification  in
comparison  to  traditional  bond  and  equity
investment.  Institutional  investors’  asset  and
management are also growing rapidly in most
emerging  markets,  with  the  enactment  of
pension  funds  reforms  and  the  growing
popularity  of  mutual  funds.  The  growth  in
assets under management has contributed to
the development of local securities market.

Investment  in  stocks  by  foreign  portfolio
investors  is  a  signal  of  global  recognition  of
economic performance of nations. While lack
of  similar  investment  destinations  elsewhere
may  rope  in  FIIs  for  a  short  duration,  long-
term  sustenance  of  inflows  hinges  upon
prospects of real sector growth.

Foreign  institutional  investors  (FIIs)  have
come  to  occupy  an  important  role  in  Indian
capital market. Yearly investment transaction
value and cumulative investment by FIIs have
gone  up  substantially  during  the  year.  Their
stake in some of the bell-weather stocks has
also  gone  up  and  they  have  become  an
important  segment  of  shareholders.  Table
2.39 provides information on purchases, sales

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

and  cumulative  position  of  FIIs’  investment.
From  the  table,  it  is  clear  that  in  2003-04,
FIIs’ gross purchase has grown up by about
208 per cent, compared to the previous year
and  their  sales  have  also  gone  up,  by  123
per  cent.  Under  investment,  it  registered  a
whopping 1,602 per cent growth. It is a record
in the history of FII investments in India. The
total investment during the year amounted to
Rs.45,767  crore/US  $  9.95  billion.  The
cumulative  investments  of  FIIs  stood  at
Rs.1,07,089  crore/US  $  25.76  billion  as  on
March 31,2004.

Foreign  institutional  investors  have  been
permitted  to  invest  in  financial  derivatives
traded  on  the  exchanges  for  various
purposes.  During  the  year,  they  have  taken
active interest in derivatives trading.

Tables  2.40  and  2.41  and  Charts  2.18  and
2.19  provide  investment  details  of  FIIs.  A
closer look at the tables and the charts reveals
that  their  open  interest  in  stock  futures  is
higher,  accounting  for  about  80  per  cent  of
the total open interest and their investment in
index  options  is  the  lowest.  Index  futures
scored  a  distinctive  second  position,  while
stock options attracted a negligible investment.
Table 2.41 and Chart 2.20 provide information
on  monthly  purchases,  sales  and  net
investments  of  FIIs  for  the  year  2003-04.  In
all the 12 months, purchases are higher than
sales indicating positive net investment in all
the months during the year. Highest amount
of  purchases  were  made  in  March  2004  at
Rs.19,224 crore, while highest sales took place
in January, 2004 at Rs.13,783 crore.

5. DEVELOPMENTS IN DEBT MARKET

I.

Bond Markets – Global Picture

A. Financing Conditions in Bond

Markets

Bond yields, which had dropped to historical
lows in the middle of last year, have retraced
the  declines  partially,  but  remain  low  by
historical  standards.  The  yields  of  10-year
government bonds are now hovering slightly
above  four  per  cent  in  the  United  States  as
well as in the Euro area, and above one per
cent in Japan.

Corporate spreads over the past few months
have  also  decreased.  Investment-grade  as
well as high-yield spreads in the United States
and the Euro area declined to historical lows
in  the  second  half  of  January,  where  they
virtually remained thereafter.

These  favorable  financing  conditions,
combined with the expectations that they may
not last much longer, contributed to a pickup
in  issuance.  In  Europe,  according  to  some

68

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

observers, the junk bond market has become
more  risky  as  companies  with  lower
investment ratings have come into the market.
The  market  is  still  buoyant  and  yields  of
European high-yield bonds reached historical
lows in January, as spreads over higher rated
bonds have continued to narrow considerably.

B.

Issuance, specially of Government
Bonds, Remains High

Government  issuance  also  has  increased
over  the  past  year,  particularly  in  the  United
States,  reflecting  the  financing  needs  of  the
US  government.  Asian  governments  have
been major purchasers of these securities and
now  hold  an  estimated  one-quarter  of
outstanding  marketable  US  Treasury
securities.  Issuance  by  financial  as  well  as
non-financial corporations has also increased
during  the  last  year,  led  by  issues
denominated in Euro.

C. Policy Rates Remain Low
At the short end of the yield spectrum, major

central banks have kept their policy rates low,
as  inflationary  pressures  have  not  yet  been
seen  as  jeopardising  any  targets  for  price
increases  in  the  near  future.  The  low  rates
have added support to the economic upswing.
In the US, the Federal Funds target rate has
remained at its historical low of one per cent
since  late  June  2003,  and  an  additional
easing  of  monetary  conditions  has  occurred
with  the  steep  decline  of  the  dollar.  The
European  Central  Bank  (ECB),  which  had
lowered  its  main  refinancing  rate  to  two  per
cent in early June 2003, has not changed its
rate since then. However, the rising Euro has,
in effect, tightened monetary conditions. The
Bank  of  Canada  lowered  its  target  for  its
overnight  rate  in  two  steps  of  0.25  per
centage points, on January 20 and on March
2,  to  2.25  per  cent.  Besides  low  pressures
on  core  inflation  and  a  larger-than  expected
output gap, the appreciation of the Canadian
dollar,  which  had  effectively  tightened
monetary  conditions,  was  one  of  the  main
arguments attributed to this move. While rates
at  the  short  end  moved,  yield  curves  had
remained  relatively  steep,  reflecting  a
generally  positive  outlook.  Among  major
central  banks,  only  the  Bank  of  England
raised its repo rate by 0.25 per centage points
to  four  per  cent  early  in  February  2004,
arguing  that  output  growth  in  the  United
Kingdom had been above trend in the second
half  of  last  year,  and  expected  continued
growth  was  likely  to  pick  up  gradually  over
medium term.

D. Expectations that Rates would Rise

in the Near Future

Market participants expect short-term rates to
rise  in  the  major  economies.  According  to
information  on  implied  forward  rates  and
futures contracts, a rise in short-term rates is
expected some time in the second quarter of
this year in the United States, and somewhat

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

later this year in the euro area – in line with
the  lag  in  the  economic  recovery  there
vis-à-vis  the  US  economy.  For  the  United
Kingdom,  markets  give  a  high  probability  to
short-term rates rising again in the first quarter
of  this  year.  Canadian  short-term  rates  are
not  expected  to  turn  around  before  the  end
of  the  year.  In  Japan,  due  to  the  extremely
low rates, interest rate data are more difficult
to  interpret.  However,  futures  contracts  and
implied  forward  rates  give  some  indications
that  markets  expect  rates  to  pick  up  slightly
this year, and more strongly during the next,
reflecting the positive outlook of the Japanese
economy.

II. Activity in the Indian Wholesale Debt

Market

On the WDM segment, net traded value and
the  number  of  trades  during  the  year  2003-
04 increased by 23 per cent and 13 per cent
respectively. As illustrated in Chart 2.21, there
was  a  rise  in  the  net  traded  value  till  the
month of October 2003, (except the temporary
fall observed during the month of September
and  the  beginning  of  October).  During  this
period, the net traded value was higher than
that of the previous year. Maximum value was
observed  in  the  month  of  August  when  it
touched a high of Rs.1,62,737 crore.

A  similar  trend  is  observed  for  number  of
trades  (Table  2.42).  In  fact,  correlation
between the two that is net traded value and
number of trades turns out to be one for both
the  years.  This  indicates  that  the  average
value  of  trade  remained  constant  and  only
the  number  of  trades  led  to  rise  and  fall  in
total value.

However,  from  November,  2003  onwards  a
sharp decline in the variable was witnessed.
The  amount  fell  below  that  of  the  previous
year’s noted value. Slight recovery is apparent
from the month of February, 2004 onwards.

An examination of instrument-wise share of
securities reveal that percentage share of
government dated securities has fallen by a
few hundred basis points. From 95.24 per cent

in 2001-02, it gradually fell down to 92.6 per
cent in 2003-04. The treasury bills and PSU
bonds witnessed a corresponding increase
with the former garnering a large share.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

Despite  the  fall  in  the  share  of  the
government-dated securities, the government
securities  still  dominated  the  segment
(Treasury bill and government-dated securities
together constitute the government securities
market).  Share  percentage  of  PSU/
Institutional bonds and others, when taken as
a  proxy  for  share  percentage  of  corporate
debt  market,  on  the  WDM  segment  show
shrinkage  from  3.37  per  cent  in  2002-03  to
3.17 per cent in 2003-04.

During  the  year,  there  were  variations  in
participation  rate  of  various  categories  of
members.  While  the  trading  members  and
financial institutions/ mutual funds/ corporates
increased their trading activity, banks- Indian
as well as foreign and primary dealers saw a
decline  in  their  share.  However,  for  all
categories  except  trading  members  the  rise/
fall  was  restricted  to  a  maximum  value  of  5
percentage. Trading members have witnessed
a rise of ten per cent in their share.

of 

behavior 

Informed  decision  making  and  knowledge
based  regulations  have  assumed  and
occupied  a  significant  place  in  policy
formulation.  In  many  mature  and  elite
jurisdictions, research is conducted widely to
understand 
issuers,
intermediaries, investors and markets so that
the regulations become effective and directly
beneficial to all the stakeholders. SEBI in its
endeavor to make regulations more scientific
and  evidence  based,  has  started  research
activities in a big way. During the year, several
research studies have been conducted on the
Indian capital market. The details are provided
in the following paragraphs.

Stock Market Volatility

SEBI  has  published  the  Eighth  Working
Paper,  "Stock  Market  Volatility  –  An
International comparison". Mature markets/
developed  markets  continue  to  provide  high
return with low volatility over a long period of
time.  Amongst  emerging  markets,  except
India and China, all other countries exhibited
low returns (sometimes negative returns with
high volatility). India and China with long and
short  history  of  capital  market  respectively,
provided  high  return  with  relatively  high
volatility while the mature markets of both the
US and the UK showed high return with low
volatility. The third and fourth order moments
exhibit  considerable  asymmetry  in  some  of
the  developed  markets.  Comparatively,  the
Indian  market  shows  less  of  skewness  and
kurtosis.  Indian  markets  have  started
becoming informationally more efficient. Intra
day volatility is also very much under control
and has came down compared to past years.

Cost Benefit Analysis of T+1

A  study  was  conducted  to  measure  various
cost  and  benefits  of  migrating  from  T+2  to

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

T+1,  to  various  constituents  of  the  market.
The major findings of the study are as follows:

G Cost  benefit  ratio  works  to  0.85.  This
means  that  for  every  likely  expense  of
0.85 paise, there will be benefit of Re. 1.
The total estimated cost roughly amounts
to  Rs.45.40  crore  and  benefits  to
Rs.53.50 crore;

G The  major  class  of  beneficiaries  are
investors as they are able to save on in
the form of interest on margin money;

G Brokers as a group are the second most

beneficiaries;

G Incremental  costs  and  benefits  are
negligible to the depositories and to the
brokers; and

G Clearing  Corporation/  house  being  only
a  conduit  do  not  have  much  of
incremental cost and benefit.

SEBI  constituted  a  high  level  committee
‘Market  Development  Advisory  Committee’
chaired  by  Dr.  Rakesh  Mohan,  Deputy
Governor, Reserve Bank of India to advise it
on  various  policy  issues.  During  the  year,
many  major  issues  have  been  identified  for
discussion  and  Research  Department  has
presented  papers  on  various  themes.  Some
of  the  papers  and  their  summary  are  as
follows:

Development of Corporate Debt Market in
India

This  paper  seeks  to  examine  the  nature  of
development  of  the  ‘Indian  Debt  Market’.  It
reviews  the  status  of  corporate  debt  market
in  India,  analyses  market  microstructure  –
Primary and Secondary, discusses impact of
recent  initiatives  by  SEBI,  identifies  issues
affecting  development  of  corporate  debt
market  and  recommends  steps  required  to
develop the market.

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

Regional Financial Centre

This paper espouses various reasons for India
to  become  a  "Regional  Financial  Centre"  It
argues and develops on the strengths of the
Indian securities market in particular, and the
Indian  economy  in  general.  For  any  place/
country  to  become  a  financial  centre  there
are certain minimum necessary and sufficient
conditions to be fulfilled. These are identified
in  this  paper.  The  strengths  of  Indian
securities  market  are  enumerated  and  they
are mapped against necessary and sufficient
conditions to examine India’s capability as a
regional  financial  centre.  Analysis  strongly
suggests that the time is opportune for India
to  develop  itself  as  a  "Regional  Financial
Centre". It also recognizes certain direct and
indirect, economic and non-economic, benefits
that  are  expected  to  accrue  to  the  country.
Possible  short-term  and  medium-term  costs
(benefits  extended)  to  the  country  while

awaiting  medium  to  long-term  benefits  are
also  identified.  Finally,  a  road  map  is  drawn
to achieve the goal of becoming a "Regional
Financial Centre."

Small and Medium Enterprises

Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (SMEs)  play
a significant developmental role in the overall
growth of any economy. It has been observed
that  SMEs  contribute  largely  to  the  GDP  in
many developed economies. The paper thus
focuses  on  the  steps  that  need  to  be  taken
in  order  to  promote  the  role  of  SMEs  in
fostering rapid economic growth in India.

Securitisation

Securitisation  has  been  embraced  by  a
number  of  countries  because  of 
its
overwhelming  benefits.  In  India,  however,  it
is  a  relatively  new  concept.  The  study

Capital Market jointly conducted by SEBI and FICCI

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

attempts  to  identify  the  status  and  scope  of
securitisation  in  India.  For  this,  it  has  been
divided  into  three  sections.  The  first  section
discusses the basic concepts associated with
securitization,  the  second  section  details  its
status  in  India  and  the  last  section  muses
over  some  new  products  that  can  be
introduced in the Indian market.

Behavioral Economics: Case of Irrational
Behavior of Market Agents

The  study  discusses  the  emergence  of
behavioral  economics  in  understanding  the
irrational behavior of investors in selecting the
stocks.  The  existing  efficient  market
hypothesis based on rational decision models
failed  to  explain  the  booms  and  busts.
Cognitive psychology, a branch of behavioral
economics  explains  the  behaviour  of  the
investors under different circumstances. It also
elicits  the  possible  role  of  a  regulator  in
limiting  the  irrational  behavior  of  market
agents  and  its  possible  spillover  on  other
investors who are saddled by cognitive errors
and  imperfect  self-control.  The  lessons
learned  from  these  thoughts  give  us  new
ideas about educating the investors to protect
themselves from bubbles. Further, this theory
also  cautions  one  about  the  validity  of  the
existing rationalist models for valuing stocks.

Disclosures Standards in Indian Stock
Market: A Cross-Country Comparison

The study is an attempt to compare disclosure
standards in Indian capital market with those
in  various  other  countries.  It  is  found  that
disclosure  standards  in  India  are  very  high
and  comparable  to  those  in  any  developed
stock  market.  Disclosure  standards  have
improved significantly over the last few years
and  are  at  par  with  the  best  in  the  world.  In
the  case  of  offer  document  of  Initial  Public
Offer(IPOs),  there  seems  to  be  scope  of

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

improvement  in  the  form  of  additional
disclosures such as prioritization of risk, past
performance of lead merchant banker and so
on.  For  continuous  disclosures  of  listed
companies, the issue lies in the accessibility
and delivery of information to investors.

IPO Analysis: Shareholding Pattern in the
Immediate Post- Listing Phase

The analysis attempts to identify trends, if any,
in the shareholding behavior of the investors
in  the  immediate  post-listing  phase  of  a  few
select  Initial  Public  Offerings  (IPOs).  The
result indicates three distinct trends. First, the
Non  –Institutional  Buyers  (NIBs)  offload
heavily, sometimes up to 88% after the issue
is  listed.  Consequently,  their  share  holding,
in  most  cases,  is  less  than  that  of  the  other
two  categories.  Secondly,  oversubscription
seems  to  be  a  common  phenomenon  for  all
the  issues  under  study.  Lastly,  the  QIBs
demand  the  highest  number  of  shares  and
hold their allocation for maximum number of
days.

Liquidity in Listed Stocks on Indian Stock
Exchanges

Liquidity  in  listed  stocks  in  Indian  stock
exchanges  was  primarily  a  data  analysis  of
the  trading  frequency  of  listed  stocks  drawn
from three exchanges – BSE, MSE, and HSE.
The  number  of  non-traded  companies  was
quite a significant figure when analysed on a
selected non tradability time period. The study
argues  that  stock  exchanges  should  evolve
an  alternative  mechanism  wherein  stocks
which are not traded for years together would
qualify for automatic delisting.

Short Selling: Overview, Review and
Issues

The study reviews the historical roots of short
selling practices around the world for various

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

incidents and developments over the past few
centuries. The analysis further elaborates the
benefits and risks of short sales coupled with
international and Indian regulatory framework
on  short  sales.  It  throws  several  issues  of
consideration for policy makers when drawing
an  effective  regulatory  framework  for  short
sales.

Corporate Governance: A Brief Account
of the Major Developments

The  study  attempts  to  put  in  place  major
developments  in  the  sphere  of  corporate
governance in major countries. It identifies the
significant contribution of various codes world-
wide besides enlisting the Indian scenario in
the  realm  of  corporate  governance.  Various
issues  prominent  in  debates  of  corporate
governance such as dichotomy of controlling
and minority shareholders and whistle blower
policy  etc  of  the  Indian  market  are  also
discussed.

Assessment of Securities Settlement
System in India

The Financial Sector Assessment Programme
(FSAP), a joint IMF and World Bank initiative
introduced  in  May  1999,  aims  at  increasing
the  effectiveness  of  efforts  to  promote  the
soundness  of  financial  systems  in  member
countries.  Detailed  assessments  of
observance  of  relevant  financial  sector

standards and codes are a key component of
the FSAP. The FSAP inter alia assesses the
securities  markets  on  the  basis  of  the  thirty
principles of securities regulations enunciated
by  IOSCO.  In  this  background  this  article
assesses the securities settlement system in
India  in  the  FSAP  format  which  follows  the
CPSS-IOSCO  assessment  methodology  for
securities  settlement  systems.  The  purpose
of  this  paper  is  to  examine  where  Indian
Securities Settlement System stand in terms
of  those  standards  and  also  to  highlight  our
findings that Securities Settlement System in
India  observes  all  the  norms  set  forth  in  the
methodology  except  for  those  which  are  not
applicable in the case of India.

In  December  2003,  the  Department  of
Research  brought  out  yet  another  edition  of
the  Glossary  of  Capital  Market  –  a  revised
version  of  the  glossary  published  in  June
2001. This was in essence the implementation
of  one  of  the  objective  of  SAP  namely  to
publish  the  definition  of  key  terms  and
concepts  related  to  capital  market.  In
accordance with the alterations in the market
scenario and regulatory framework, constant
revisal  and  updation  of  terms  and  definition
were  deemed  extremely  relevant.  The
Glossary  of  Capital  Market  covered
terminology from finance, financial economics,
stock  market,  related  laws,  economics  and
others.
