This part of the Report delineates the functions of SEBI as specified in

Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992

1.

PRIMARY  SECURITIES  MARKET

2.

SECONDARY  SECURITIES
MARKET

The  market  intermediaries  play  an
important  role  in  the  development  of
securities market by providing different types
of  services.  Major  intermediaries  in  the
securities  market  regulated  by  SEBI  are
brokers,  sub-brokers,  portfolio  managers,
merchant  bankers,  depository  participants,
bankers to an issue and share transfer agents.

During  2007-08,  there  was  an  increase
in  the  number  of  intermediaries  registered.
As  on  March  31,  2008,  the  highest  increase
in  absolute  terms,  was  observed  in  case  of
depository  participants  (DPs)  of  CDSL  (52)
followed  by  portfolio  managers  (47).  A
decline  was  witnessed,  in  the  number  of
underwriters followed by registrar to an issue
and  share  transfer  agent  and  debenture
trustees  as  compared  to  2006-07.  The  details
are provided in Table 3.1.

Some of the intermediaries’ applications
for  registration  were  in  the  process,  the
details of which are provided in Table 3.2.

V. Registration of Foreign Institutional
Investors  and  Custodians  of
Securities

The total number of Foreign Institutional
Investors (FIIs) registered with SEBI increased
to  1,319  as  on  March  31,  2008,  compared  to
997 a year ago, showing a net increase of 322
over the year.

As  on  March  31,  2008,  there  were  15
custodians  registered  with  SEBI,  under  SEBI
(Custodian  of  Securities)  Regulations,  1996.
One  new  custodian,  Axis  Bank  Ltd.  (earlier
known as UTI Bank Ltd.) was registered with
SEBI, during 2007-08.

VI. Registration  of  Collective  Invest-

ment Schemes (CIS)

During  2007-08,  it  was  found  that  some
entities were raising money by launching Art
Fund  schemes.  Under  these  schemes,  money
was collected from the investors and invested

in the art work, painting, etc. The funds were
mainly  in  the  nature  of  close-ended  funds
ranging  from  three  to  five  years  and  the
schemes  were  found  to  be  collective
investment  schemes.  However,  none  of  the
collective investment schemes/art funds were
registered  under  the  SEBI  (CIS)  Regulations,
1999. Therefore, SEBI issued a press release:

i.

ii.

Advising the investors that “Art Funds”
are  “Collective  Investment  Schemes”  as
defined  under  the  SEBI Act. At  present,
no  entity  was  registered  with  SEBI,
under  the  SEBI  (Collective  Investment
Schemes)  Regulations;  and

Launching/floating  of  “Art  Funds”  or
Schemes  without  obtaining  registration
from  SEBI  amounts  to  violation  of  SEBI
Act and Regulations.

Appropriate  actions,  civil  and  criminal,
under  the  SEBI  Act  may  be  taken  by  SEBI
against  such  funds/companies.

Funds

Venture capital funds play an important
role in development of entrepreneurship and
help  in  the  technological  progress  of  an
economy  by  providing  the  seed  capital
required  for  various  industries  with  limited
access to conventional sources of finance. The
number  of  domestic  venture  capital  funds
increased  to  106  in  2007-08  from  90  in  2006-
07  whereas  the  number  of  foreign  venture
capital  funds  rose  to  97  from  78  during  the

SUPERVISION

Enforcement  of  the  regulations  requires
effective supervision through on-site and off-
site inspections, enforcement, enquiry against
violations  of  rules  and  regulations,  and
prosecutions.  SEBI  conducts  inspections
either  directly  or  through  Self  Regulatory
Organisations  (SROs)  like  stock  exchanges,
depositories,  etc.  Inspections  on  a  periodic
basis  are  conducted  to  verify  the  compliance
levels  of  intermediaries.  Specific/  limited
purpose  inspections  were  conducted  on  the
basis  of  complaints,  references,  surveillance
reports,  specific  concerns,  etc.  Stock
exchanges  and  depositories  were  also
directed by SEBI to carry out periodic/specific
purpose  inspections  of  their  members/
participants.

SURVEILLANCE

I. Mechanism of Market Surveillance

An  effective  surveillance  mechanism  is
one  of  the  prime  requirements  for  well
functioning  of  securities  market.  The  stock
exchanges  are  the  first-level  regulators  and
are  charged  with  the  primary  responsibility
of  safe-guarding  the  integrity  of  the  market
and  ensuring  that  the  market  is  performing
in accordance with the stipulated norms and
practice.

The  Integrated  Surveillance  Department
of  SEBI  is  in  charge  of  overall  market
surveillance  and  scope  of  its  activities
includes  monitoring  market  movements  and
detecting  potential  breaches  of  Regulations,
analysing  the  trading  pattern  of  scrips  and
indices  and  initiation  of  appropriate  action
wherever  warranted.  To  enhance  the  efficacy
of  the  surveillance  function,  SEBI  has  put  in
place  a  comprehensive  Integrated  Market
Surveillance  System  (IMSS)  which  generates
alerts  arising  out  of  unusual  market
movements. SEBI also keep a continuous vigil
on  the  activities  of  the  stock  exchanges  to
promote an effective surveillance mechanism.

II. Surveillance  Actions

During  2007-08,  Integrated  Surveillance
Department  of  SEBI  made  32  and  116
references  to  NSE  and  BSE,  respectively,  for
examination  /  investigation.  NSE  initiated
preliminary examination and investigation in

a  total  123  cases  and  BSE 
initiated
examination and investigation in 1,855 cases.
NSE  and  BSE  completed  investigation  in  105
and  193  cases,  respectively,  including  the
cases initiated on the basis of alerts generated
by  themselves.

During  the  year,  as  a  surveillance
measure, NSE shifted 244 scrips to trade-for-
trade  segment  and  BSE  shifted  1,582  scrips
to  trade-for-trade  segment.  NSE  imposed  a
price band (2 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per
cent)  in  1,098  instances  and  BSE  in  3,971
instances.  Further,  NSE  and  BSE  verified  184
and 253 rumours, respectively (Table 3.19).

III. Surveillance  Measures

SEBI  took  a  range  of  pre-emptive  and
pro-active measures to enhance market safety
and  integrity.  The  surveillance  measures
taken  during  the  year  include  shifting  of
scrips  to  Trade  for  Trade  segment,  reduction
of price band, taking up trading in scrips for
examination  etc.  Further,  in  order  to  protect
the  interests  of  investors  and  to  enhance
transparency  in  the  markets,  SEBI  took  the
following  measures  during  2007-08:



SEBI  observed  that  there  had  been  a
marked 
the  market

increase 

in 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

participation  of  domestic  institutional
investors  (DIIs)  such  as  mutual  finds,
banks,  insurance  companies  and  Indian
Financial  Institutions.  In  order  to  reflect
such  increased  participation  and  to
provide  investors  with  meaningful
information  for  taking  well-informed
decisions,  SEBI  advised  the  stock
exchanges  to  disseminate  daily  trading
data  of  DIIs  as  a  separate  category  on
their  website.  Exchanges  have
commenced  disseminating  the  trading
data with effect from April 16, 2007.

SEBI  observed  repetitive  instances  of
violations  of  similar  nature  by  stock
brokers.  In  order  to  discourage  brokers
from repeating similar violations and to
present  an  effective  deterrent,  the  stock
exchanges  were  advised  to  take  strict
action against such brokers.

During the course of investigations, SEBI
noticed  that  trade/exposure  limits  given
by brokers to their clients was excessive
and  not  commensurate  with  the  income
disclosed by the client in the Know Your
Client  (KYC)  documentation  to  the
brokers. It was also noticed that the KYC
documentation was outdated. In view of
this, the KYC norms for the clients were
strengthened  and  SEBI  advised  the
brokers, through the stock exchanges, to
periodically  update  the  KYC  forms  and
also  retain  proper  documentation  of
financial  strength  of  their  clients  based
on  which  clients  were  granted  trade/
exposure  limits

SEBI  observed  that  the  Open  Interest
(OI)  data  for  trading  in  the  F  &  O
segment  was  generally  disseminated  in
value 
terms.  This  presented  an
incomplete  picture  of  the  trading,
especially  in  times  of  unusual  volatility
since  the  change  in  OI  could  either  be
due to price variation or due to variation
in  the  number  of  traded  contracts.







97

Annual Report 2007-08







Further, it was noted that internationally,
data  of  OI  is  disseminated  in  quantity
terms.  In  order  to  present  a  complete
picture of trading and also to serve as a
meaningful  basis  for  comparison,  SEBI
advised  the  exchanges  to  report  F&O
trades in terms of number of contracts.

In  order  to  enhance  transparency  in
broker–client  dealings,  SEBI  advised
stock  exchanges  to  ensure  that  brokers
provide  daily  report  to  each  of  their
clients,  clearly  bringing  out  the  client
trades and margin liability.

SEBI  observed  that  on  days  of  unusual
volatility,  certain  sections  of  the  media
had  reported  that  (according  to  some
investors),  the  stock  exchanges  had
unilaterally  increased  the  margins  and
this had adversely affected the investors.
SEBI  took  up  the  matter  with  the  stock
exchanges  who  clarified  that  there  was
no  change  in  the  margin  structure  or  in
the  methodology  followed  in  margin
computation. SEBI also advised the stock
exchanges  to  clarify  the  same  to  the
media / public at large.





During  the  course  of  inquiries,  SEBI
noticed  that  several  market  participants
as  well  as  the  general  public  were  not
aware  about  the  calculations  and
imposition  of  Value  at  Risk  (VaR)
margins  /  SPAN  margins  by  the  stock
exchanges, analysis of open interest, put
call  ratio  and  other  key  concepts  in  the
F&O segment. This led to misconception
and  hampered  the  making  of  well-
informed  investment  decisions  which  is
very  vital  in  this  segment.  SEBI,
therefore,  advised  the  stock  exchanges
awareness
to 
programmes  across 
the  market
addressing  the  above  issues  so  as  to
create  awareness  of  key  concepts,
especially  margin  computation  and

conduct

imposition, their interpretation and their
implications on investment decisions. In
this  regard,  stock  exchanges  also  issued
advertisement  as  well  as  distributed
booklets 
for
communication to their clients.

Trading and investment in the securities
market is always associated with the risk

periodically advised the stock exchanges
to  issue  a  cautionary  list  of  ‘Do’s  and
Don’ts’  to  the  investing  community  at
large 
and
advertisements  in  various  media,  so  as
to  highlight  the  risks  associated  with

that  the  surveillance  committee  of  the

Board.  SEBI  also  advised  that  the

that  the  report  of  the  committee

Companies Act  and/or  as  sanctioned  by
the  Courts,  in  cases  of  rehabilitation
packages  approved  by  the  Board  of
Industrial  and  Financial  Reconstruction
under  Sick  Industrial  Companies  Act
and 
in  cases  of  Corporate  Debt
Restructuring  (CDR)  packages  by  the
CDR cell of the RBI.

SEBI  received  suggestions  for  further
improvement in sales practices followed
by  brokers  of  the  stock  exchanges.  The
matter  was  internally  examined  in
consultation  with  the  stock  exchanges.
Subsequently,  a  draft  prepared  by  stock
exchanges  for  improvement  in  sales
practices by brokers was put up on SEBI
website for public comments.

IV. Significant  Market  Movements

during  2007-08

 On  October  17,  2007,  the  Nifty  fell  by
524.15  points  from  the  previous  day’s
close  of  5668.05  thereby  hitting  market-
wide  circuit  filter  of  10  per  cent.  This
resulted  in  halt  in  trading  on  NSE  and
BSE.  The  BSE  Sensex  was  down  by
1743.96  points  from  previous  day’s  close
of  19051.86.  The  market  had  recovered
during  the  day  and  Sensex  and  Nifty
closed at 18715.82 points & 5559.3 points,
respectively.

 On  January  22,  2008,  Sensex  fell  by
2029.00  points  (from  previous  days
closing  of  17605.35),  thereby  hitting
market-wide  circuit  filter  of  10  per  cent.
Nifty fell by 630.45 points (from previous
days  closing  of  5208.80).  After  this  sharp

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

fall during the early morning session, the
market had recovered during the day and
Sensex  and  Nifty  closed  at  16,729.94
points & 4,899.30 points, respectively.

 The  risk  management  system,  real-time
monitoring  of  the  broker  terminals  and
market-wide  circuit  filter  got  tested  and
the  market  withstood  a  fall  of  this
magnitude  without  any  disruption  in
settlement  process.  During  the  above
market  fall,  the  SEBI  was  in  constant
touch with the stock exchanges to ensure
smooth  functioning  of  the  market.  The
situation  was  also  monitored  in  co-
ordination  with  the  RBI  so  as  to  ensure
smooth settlement by market participants.

V. Enforcement

On  the  basis  of  surveillance  alerts,  SEBI
initiated  enforcement  actions  and  passed
interim ex-parte orders in the following cases:

i. Orders in the matter of GHCL Ltd.

A  preliminary  examination  of  the  IMSS
alerts  and  the  trading  activities  in  the  scrip
of  GHCL  revealed  certain  abnormal  dealings
in  the  shares  of  GHCL  by  entities  related  to
Jalco Financial Service Pvt. Ltd. (Jalco Group).
It  was  observed  that  the  Jalco  Group  entities
who  were  also  enlisted  as  promoter  group
entities  of  GHCL  traded  among  themselves
in  the  shares  of  GHCL  and  created  artificial
market  to  mislead  genuine  investors.  It  was
observed  that  seven  entities  of  Jalco  Group
traded  in  the  shares  of  GHCL  through  70
accounts  with  38  brokers  of  BSE  and  NSE.
The  Jalco  group  entities  were  having  145
beneficial  accounts  with  NSDL  and  CDSL
from a single address. SEBI passed following
directions on April 25, 2007, after completion
of  the  preliminary  examination:

a)

14 entities belonging to Jalco Group and
promoter  group  entities  shall  not  buy,
sell or deal in shares of GHCL., directly
or  indirectly;

99

Annual Report 2007-08

b)

c)

9  directors  of  the  Jalco  Group  shall  not
buy,  sell  or  deal  in  shares  of  GHCL,
directly or indirectly; and

The  Depositories  shall  not  give  effect  to
any transfer of shares of GHCL lying in
the  beneficial  owner  accounts  of  the
entities  belonging  to  Jalco  Group  and
their  directors.

ii. Orders  in  the  matter  of  Order  Book
Manipulation  on  the  First  Day  of
Listing

SEBI  observed  that  the  prices  of  certain
stocks  witnessed  dramatic  upsurges  on  the
day of listing or soon thereafter. Based on the
alerts  received  from  the  IMSS  of  SEBI,
preliminary  analysis  was  carried  out  in  the
dealings of shares on their first day of listing
of  select  companies.  The  preliminary
examination  revealed  the  following:

a)

b)

c)

The orders were placed much below the
prevailing  market  price  on  the  day  of
listing  of  the  shares  of  the  companies,
thereby  rendering  them  as  frivolous  or
non-serious 
orders  making  no
commercial  sense.

The  entire  large  order  quantity  was
revealed  to  the  market  in  one  stroke,
which  is  an  uncommon  practice  in  the
market.

The  likely  financial  exposure  that  such
large  orders  would  have  entailed  in  the
event  of  execution,  which  was  liable  to
be  borne  by  the  identified  entities,  was
disproportionate  to  the  annual  income
disclosed  by  these  entities  in  the  KYC
forms  submitted  to  their  respective
brokers.  Their  trading  history  over  the
preceding  six  months  suggested  that
these entities had not executed any trade
remotely  close  to  the  large  numbers
under  scrutiny.

d)

The likely purpose of placing such large
orders  seemed  to  be  providing  artificial

depth to the order book thereby seeking
to  sub-serve  their  own  interest  in  the
market  besides  misleading  the  lay
investors.

Based  on  the  above  findings,  SEBI
passed  directions  on  April  26,  2007,  to  the
effect  that  the  identified  entities  shall  cease
and  desist  from  dealing  in  shares  in  the
manner  described  in  the  order  as  would
impart artificiality to the order book with the
concomitant  impact  on  the  market.  It  was
also directed that these entities shall not buy,
sell or deal in securities, directly or indirectly,
on  the  day  of  listing  of  any  securities  on  the
stock exchanges, till further directions in this
regard.  Further,  the  brokers  through  whom
these  identified  entities  had  dealt  in  the
shares  of  the  companies  were  directed  to  be
cautious  and  exercise  due  diligence  while
dealing on behalf of their clients in future.

Subsequently, all the entities and brokers
initiate  Consent

to  SEBI 

applied 
Proceedings.

to 

iii. Orders  in  the  matter  of  dealings  in

F&O  Segment

SEBI  observed  some  unusual  and
inconsistent  trading  pattern  in  the  futures
and  options  segment.  A  preliminary
examination  was  carried  out  with  the  help
of the Integrated Market Surveillance System
(IMSS) of SEBI. The preliminary examination
revealed  that  the  brokers  and  clients  at  NSE
were  buying  and  selling  almost  equal
quantities of contracts in F&O segment within
the  day  and  such  buy/sell  was  synchronised
in  nature.  In  most  of  the  cases,  the  same
quantity  and  in  few  cases  substantially  the
same  quantity  of  the  original  trade  was
closed out /reversed during the day at a price
which  was  significantly  above  or  below  the
price  at  which  the  first/original  transaction
was  executed,  without  significant  variations
in  the  traded  price  of  the  underlying.  The
entities /brokers had indulged in non-genuine

100

transactions  to  create  false  and  misleading
appearance  of  trading.  Based  on  the  above
findings,  SEBI  passed  orders  against  15
brokers  and  10  clients  on  June  18,  2007,
directing  them  to  cease  and  desist  from
indulging  in  futures  &  options  contracts  in
the above manner

Subsequently, several brokers and clients
initiate  Consent

to  SEBI 

applied 
Proceedings.

to 

iv. Orders  in  the  matter  of  M/s  Jaybharat
Textile  and  Real  Estate  Ltd.  and
M/s KSL & Industries Ltd.

The  Integrated  Market  Surveillance
System  (IMSS)  of  SEBI  generated  alerts
relating to dealings in the shares of M/s. KSL
& Industries Ltd. (KSLIL) and M/s. Jaybharat
Textile  &  Real  Estate  Ltd.  (JTREL).  It  was
observed  that  some  entities  had  been  found
to  be  dealing  in  the  shares  of  both  these
companies  with  a  strategic  shift  viz.,  first
dealing  in  KSLIL  followed  by  similar
concerted activity in the shares of JTREL and
contributing  significant  rise  in  the  price  and
volume.  In  the  case  of  KSLIL,  these  entities
had subsequently sold substantial number of
shares.  The  trading  by  these  entities  prima
facie  appeared  to  be  carried  out  with  an
intention  to  artificially  inflate  the  price  and
volume  in  the  scrips,  thereby  inducing  lay
investors  to  deal  in  the  shares  of  these
companies.

In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an
ad  interim  ex-parte  order  on  September  07,
2007,  directing  six  entities  not  to  buy,  sell  or
deal  in  shares  of  M/s.  KSL  &  Industries  Ltd.
and M/s. Jaybharat Textile & Real Estate Ltd.,
directly  or  indirectly,  in  any  manner,  till
further  directions  in  this  regard.  The
Depositories were also directed not give effect
to any transfer of shares of KSL & Industries
Ltd. and Jaybharat Textile & Real Estate Ltd.
lying  in  the  beneficial  owner  accounts  of  the
above-mentioned  entities.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

v. Orders  in  the  matter  of  M/s  Atlanta

Ltd.

SEBI had passed an order on September
27,  2007,  in  respect  of  Atlanta  Ltd.  and  its
promoters  in  the  matter  of  Atlanta  Ltd.
confirming  the  directions  in  the  ad-interim
Order  dated  February  22,  2007,  against
Atlanta  Ltd.  and  promoters  with  certain
conditions  for  the  promoters.  Subsequently,
several  entities  applied  to  SEBI  to  initiate
Consent  Proceedings.

vi. Orders  in  the  matter  of  M/s  Ballarpur

Industries  Ltd.

Analysis  of  the  trading  pattern  in  the
shares of M/s. Ballarpur Industries Ltd. (BILT)
during the period November 01, 2006 to June
13,  2007,  brought  out  that  a  set  of  clients,  all
registered  with  one  broker  as  well  as  a
director of another broking firm were dealing
in the shares of BILT around the time of large
sell  orders  by  a  foreign  institutional  investor
(FII).  The  FII  was  observed  to  be  selling  its
holdings  in  BILT,  through  its  broker  on
different  dates  within  this  period.  On  each
of  these  dates,  a  few  from  amongst  these
identified clients sold prior to the FII sale and
bought almost an identical quantity after the
sell  order  was  placed  on  behalf  of  the  FII.
This trading strategy adopted by these clients
appears  to  be  in  the  nature  of  ‘customised
front  running’.  Front  running  is  an  activity
in  which  a  trader  takes  a  position  of  unfair
advantage  in  advance  of  a  large  buy  or  sell
order  that  the  trader  knows  will  move  the
price of that equity in a predictable fashion.

Prima-facie  it  appeared  to  be  a  clear
pattern  of  passing  information  to  a  group  of
apparently set up clients. The pattern of order
placement  by  the  identified  clients  in  order
to  benefit  from  the  spread  in  prices  at  the
time  of  short  selling  and  short  covering,
indicated  that  the  timing  and  quantity  of
orders  of  the  FII  was  well  within  the
knowledge of the identified clients who were

101

Annual Report 2007-08

observed to be ‘customised front running’. In
view of the above, SEBI passed an ad interim
ex-parte order in the matter of dealing in the
shares  of  Ballarpur  Industries  Ltd.  (BILT)  on
October 01, 2007 as under

a) Directing  34  client  entities  not  to  buy,
sell  or  deal  in  any  securities,  directly  or
indirectly  till  further  directions  in  this
regard.

b)

c)

d)

Further,  the  34  clients  were  directed  to
deposit  the  profits  made  by  them,  with
the  National  Stock  Exchange  of  India
Ltd. (NSE) within 15 days from the date
of issue of the order.

The  34  identified  clients  were  also
directed  to  cease  and  desist  from
indulging  in  any  such  trading  activity,
directly  or  indirectly  which  amounts  to
violation  of  Section  12A  (a),  (b)  and  (e)
of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  or  Regulations  3
(a) to (d) and Regulation 4(q) of the SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair
Trade  Practices  Relating  to  Securities
Market)  Regulations,  2003.

The  concerned  brokers  were  ordered  to
conduct  an  internal  enquiry  into  the
above  matter  and  initiate  appropriate
actions against their employees or agents
named  in  this  order  and  submit  an
action  taken  report  within  30  days  of
this  order  to  SEBI.  Further,  the  brokers
were also advised to take steps to ensure
that  their  trading  systems,  client
information  and  other  facilities  are  not
misused to the detriment of their clients
or  market  integrity  and  that  they  fulfil
their  fiduciary  obligations  to  their
clients.  They  were  also  advised  to
exercise  due  diligence  in  supervising
their dealers and other employees to the
above  end.

All  these  entities  have  applied  for  an

opportunity  for  Consent  Proceedings.

VI. Prevention of Money Laundering

Rapid  developments  and  integration  of
financial markets coupled with improvements
in  technology  and  communication  channels
pose  serious  challenges  to  authorities  and
institutions dealing with prevention of money
laundering  and  combating  financing  of
terrorism.  SEBI  is  committed  to  the  global
and  national  initiatives  and  efforts  are  being
made  in  the  direction  to  counter  the  threat
of  money  laundering.

The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering
Act,  2002  (PMLA)  and  rules  framed  there-
under,  brought  into  force  with  effect  from
July 01, 2005, is a testimony to India’s joining
the global war against money laundering and
financing  of  terrorism.  While  the  necessary
guidelines  and  requirements  as  enshrined
under  PMLA  and  rules  have  already  been
issued  by  SEBI  to  market  intermediaries,  a
greater emphasis was laid during the year to
further  sensitize  the  market  participants
about their key obligations and requirements
to be fulfilled.

i.

Conferences, Workshops and Seminars

SEBI  organised/  participated  in  a
industry
number  of  meetings  with 
associations,  stock  exchanges,  depositories,
mutual  funds  and  custodians  wherein  key
requirements  of  the  reporting  entities  were
highlighted  and  necessary  guidance  to  the
industry  was  provided  for  going  ahead  with
operationalising  the  legislative  requirements.
Officers  of  SEBI  also  participated  in
interactive  seminars  and  workshops
organised  jointly  by  stock  exchanges  (NSE
and BSE) and depositories (NSDL and CDSL)
for  creating  awareness  amongst  brokers  and
depository  participants  about 
their
obligations  under  various  Act,  rules  and
circulars  issued  by  SEBI.  During  2007-08,
three such seminars were organised at major
centres  such  as  Mumbai,  Delhi  and  Kolkata

102

and  were  attended  by  more  than  1,100
securities  market  professionals.

ii.

Fulfilling  of  Reporting  Obligations  by
Entities

With  the  joint  efforts  of  SEBI,  Financial
Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND), Association
of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) and mutual
funds industry, uniformity has been achieved
in  the  process  flow  for  generation  of  alerts,
based  on  certain  pre-defined  parameters,
detailed analysis of these alerts and reporting
of transactions based on such analysis by the
industry. Similar exercise was carried out for
depositories’  transactions  and  the  process  is
under  further  fine-tuning.

iii. Guidance  to  Stock  Exchanges  and

Depositories

inputs 

SEBI  provided  the  necessary  guidance
and 
to  stock  exchanges  and
depositories  for  issuance  of  directives  for
compliance  by 
their  members  and
participants.  These  directives  further
highlighted  the  requirements  of  reporting
entities  along  with  typologies  for  possible
generation  of  suspicious  transactions  reports
(STR) for reporting to authorities.

iv.

International  Initiatives

SEBI  hosted  a  high  level  delegation  led
by  the  President  of  Financial  Action  Task
Force (FATF), Sir James Sassoon on February
14,  2008.  Sir  James  Sassoon  had  a  detailed
and  fruitful  discussion  with  the  Chairman,
Whole  Time  Member  and  other  senior
officers  regarding  efforts  made  by  India  in
general  and  SEBI  in  particular  in  the  area  of
Anti-Money  Laundering  and  Combating
Financing of terrorism (AML and CFT).

VII. Integrated  Market  Surveillance

System

The  integrated  market  surveillance
system  (IMSS)  continued  to  help  SEBI  in

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

effective discharge of its regulatory functions.
The  system  was  put  to  effective  and  timely
use  for  analyzing,  detecting,  identifying  and
taking preventive action in a number of cases
where abnormal trading pattern or aberration
was  observed.  The  timely  action  taken  in
such  cases  led  to  significant  positive  impact
on  ensuring  orderly  conduct  of  the  market
players  and  market  integrity.  IMSS  is  being
used for carrying out investigation into cases
as  well  as  issuing  necessary  directives  to
stock  exchanges  and  market  participants  to
keep up the vigil on happenings in the stock
exchanges. In a number of cases, observations
made  possible  from  the  system  were  also
shared  with  stock  exchanges  for  appropriate
action. This fulfils the regulatory objective of
ensuring that stock exchanges continue to act
as  the  first  level  regulator  for  proactively
detecting  and  examining  abnormal  trading
pattern.

Based  on  an  analysis  made  possible
through  IMSS,  several  letters  were  issued
during  2007-08  to  stock  exchanges/market
intermediaries/investors  regarding  trading
pattern  and  behaviour  seen  across  various
securities.  Communications  sent  across  to
different  segments  of  the  market,  based  on
functionalities  provided  by  the  IMSS  were
intended  to  obtain  necessary  clarifications  as
also  to  ensure  market  integrity  and  promote
professional standards of participants, which
is  vital  for  smooth  and  vibrant  functioning
of the securities markets.

5.

INVESTIGATION

Investigations  are  undertaken 

to
examine  alleged  or  suspected  violations,  to
gather  evidence,  and  to  identify  persons/
entities  behind  irregularities  and  violations,
viz.,  price  manipulation,  creation  of  artificial
market, insider trading, primary issue related
irregularities,  takeover  violations,  non-
compliance  of  disclosure  requirements  and

In  1,107 

Since 1992-93, SEBI has undertaken 1,212
investigation 
cases
investigations  have  been  completed.  The
experience  gained  during  investigations  had
contributed  significantly  to  evolution  of
policies  and  procedures  in  strengthening
regulatory  and  enforcement  environment.
During  2007-08,  25  new  cases  were  taken  up
for  investigation  and  169  cases  were
completed  (Table  3.20  and  Chart  3.3).  The
number of investigations completed had gone
up  substantially  from  102  during  2006-07  to
169 in 2007-08.

i. Nature of Investigation Cases Taken Up

During 2007-08, about 50 per cent of the
cases  taken  up  for  investigation  pertain  to
market  manipulation  and  price  rigging,  as
against about 79 per cent of such cases in the
previous  year.  Other  cases  pertain  to  insider
trading,  takeover  violations,  irregularities  in
capital issues, and other miscellaneous issues.

104

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

Since,  several  investigation  cases  were  taken
up  on  the  basis  of  multiple  allegations  of
violations,  strict  classification  under  specific
category  becomes  difficult.  Such  cases  were
classified  on  the  basis  of  main  charge/
violations.

ii. Nature  of 

Investigation  Cases

Completed

During  2007-08,  of  the  169  cases  in
which investigation were completed about 68

per  cent  pertain  to  market  manipulation  and
price  rigging,  misleading  advertisements  by
the  companies  and  unfair  practices.  Other
cases  in  which  investigation  were  completed
pertain to insider trading, capital issue related
irregularities,  takeover  violations,  non-
compliance  of  disclosure  requirements  etc.
The  number  of  cases  in  which  investigation
were  taken  up  and  completed  is  given  in

II. Regulatory  Action

After  completion  of  investigation,
further  action  was  initiated  as  per  the
recommendations  made  in  the  investigation
reports  and  as  approved  by  the  competent
authority.  Action  was  decided  based  on  the
principles  of  objectivity,  consistency  and
evidence  available.  The  action  included
issuing  warning  letters,  initiating  enquiry
proceedings  for  registered  intermediaries,
initiating  adjudication  proceedings  against
levy of monetary penalties, passing directions
under  Section  11  of  SEBI  Act  and  initiating
prosecution.

with  a  view  to  enhancing  regulatory
effectiveness,  prompt  actions  were  taken
during the year, against various entities.

During  2007-08,  544  prohibitive
directions  were  issued  under  Section  11  of
SEBI  Act  against  various  entities  as  against
345  in  the  previous  year.  A  total  of  44

ENFORCEMENT  OF
REGULATIONS

Effective  enforcement  is  essential  to
make  a  regulatory  system  effective.  Active
follow-up  of  cases  of  misconduct  and

106

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

disciplinary  actions  in  the  form  of  justified
penalties  are  indispensable  for  ensuring
market  integrity.

I.

Enquiry and Adjudication

During 2007-08, 218 orders were passed/
reports  submitted,  of  which,  62  pertained  to
enquiries and 156 pertained to adjudications.
During  the  same  period,  hearings  for  317
cases were conducted; of which, 39 belonged
to  enquiries  and  278  to  adjudications.
However, 918 show-cause notices were issued
to  different  entities,  of  which,  60  pertained
to  enquiries  and  858  cases  pertained  to

Designated  Court  for  SEBI  cases  at
Kurla,  convicting  the  accused  for  one
year imprisonment and Rs. 5,000 fine for
each of the two offences under SEBI Act

cases  filed  under  SEBI  Act,  the  Ld.
Sessions  Court,  Mumbai  upheld  the
stand  of  SEBI  that  pursuant  to  the
amendment  in  SEBI  Act  w.e.f.  October
10,  2002,  all  the  cases  whether  offences
committed  and/or  complaints  filed
before  or  after  the  said  amendments
shall  be  triable  by  the  Sessions  Court
