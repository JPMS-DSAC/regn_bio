1. GENERAL  MACRO-ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT

India  continued  to  maintain  its  pre-
eminence  as  one  of  the  fastest  growing
economies of the world. The Indian economy
remained firm during 2006-07, mainly driven
by continued growth in industry and services
sectors.  According  to  advance  estimates  of
Central  Statistical  Organisation  (CSO),  real
GDP  at  factor  cost  at  1999-00  prices  (New

Series)  grew  by  9.4  per  cent  in  2006-07  on
top of 9.0 per cent (quick estimates) achieved
in  the  previous  year  (Table  1.1).  The
industrial  sector  performed  well  (11.0  per
cent),  mainly  led  by  manufacturing  activities
which  recorded  a  growth  of  12.3  per  cent  in
2006-07  compared  to  9.1  per  cent  in  2005-06
(Table  1.2).  The  services  sector  continued  to
be  the  main  driver  of  growth  in  India  with
double  digit  growth  (11.0  per  cent)  for  the

third  year  in  succession.  Following  a  tepid
South-West  monsoon  and  an  average  North-
East monsoon, the agricultural sector clocked
a growth of 2.7 per cent in 2006-07 as against
6.0  per  cent  in  2005-06.  This  was  reflected  in
the  fact  that  the  share  of  ‘agriculture  and
allied  activities’  in  the  overall  GDP  declined
from  19.7  cent  in  2005-06  to  18.5  per  cent  in
2006-07  (Chart  1.1).  In  contrast,  the  share  of
services  sector  improved  from  60.9  per  cent
to 61.9 per cent and that of industry increased
from  19.4  per  cent  to  19.7  per  cent,  during
the  same  period.  During  the  Tenth  Plan
(2002-07) period, India’s real GDP grew at an
average  rate  of  more  than  7.6  per  cent
compared  to  5.5  per  cent  in  the  Ninth  Plan
period  (1997-2002).

Major factors contributing to acceleration
in the manufacturing activities were buoyant
exports, increase in domestic demand, rise in
capacity  utilisation,  encouraging  outlook  on

industries’  and 

business  expectations,  congenial  investment
climate  etc.  Along  with  investment  growth,
capital  goods  and  consumer  goods  sectors
performed well. ‘Textile products’, ‘beverages,
tobacco  and  related  products’,  ‘basic  metals
and  alloy 
‘transport
equipment and parts’ witnessed double digit
growth  in  2006-07.  However,  growth  in  the
intermediate  goods  and  infrastructure  sector
was  sluggish.  According  to  business
expectations  surveys,  conducted  by  various
agencies,  India’s  industrial  sector  is  likely  to
continue  its  strong  performance  in  the  near
future.

Services  sector  continued  to  remain  the
largest  contributor  to  overall  GDP  growth.
Within  the  services  sector,  ‘construction’,
‘trade,  hotel,  transport  and  communication’
maintained  double  digit  growth  in  2006-07.
Community,  social  and  personal  services
grew marginally during 2006-07.

Annual Report 2006-07

Latest  data  on  India’s  savings  and
investments  are  available  upto  2005-06.
According  to  CSO,  India’s  Gross  Domestic
Savings  (GDS)  as  proportion  of  GDP  at
current market prices (New Series) increased
from 31.1 per cent in 2004-05 to 32.4 per cent
in  2005-06.  Public  sector  savings  declined
from  2.4  per  cent  in  2004-05  to  2.0  per  cent
in  2005-06  mainly  on  account  of  decrease  in
savings  of  public  authorities.  Private
corporate 
improved
moderately  from  7.2  per  cent  in  2004-05  to
8.1 per cent in 2005-06, on the back of robust
corporate profits. Savings of household sector

savings 

sector 

increased  by  0.8  per  cent  to  22.4  per  cent  in
2005-06 after witnessing a decline in the same
period during 2004-05. Household savings in
the  form  of  financial  assets  increased  while
it  decreased  for  physical  assets.  The  Gross
Domestic  Capital  Formation 
(overall
investment),  exceeded  GDS  by  1.4  per  cent
to  33.8  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2005-06  reflecting
net inflow of foreign savings (Table 1.3).

‘Deposits’ continued to dominate as a
major  component  of  the  gross  financial
savings  by  the  households.  The  share  of
deposits in total financial savings increased
from 37.0 per cent in 2004-05 to 47.4 per cent

in  2005-06  (Chart  1.2).  On  the  contrary,
households’ claims on Government declined
substantially from 24.4 per cent in 2004-05 to
14.7 per cent in 2005-06. Thus, there was a
visible  shift  in  the  pattern  of  household
financial savings from claims on Government
to deposits due to higher returns available to
them from various types of fixed deposits
offered by banks and equity investments.

During 2005-06, other major components
of financial savings were contractual savings,
mainly insurance (14.2 per cent), followed by
provident and pension funds (10 per cent) and
currency (8.8 per cent). Investment in shares
and  debentures  by  the  households  as  a
proportion of gross total financial savings
increased significantly from 1.1 per cent in
2004-05 to 4.9 per cent in 2005-06. Shares and
debentures as proportion to GDP (at current
market prices) improved significantly from 0.2
per  cent  to  0.8  per  cent  during  the  same
period.

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Lending activities by commercial banks
further accelerated during 2006-07. For the
third year in succession, the non-food credit
witnessed expansion reflecting pick-up in
GDP  growth,  in  general  and  industrial
activities, in particular. Credit to services
sector  also  accelerated  during  2006-07,
including  retail  lending,  particularly  to
personal  loan  and  housing  sector.  In
consonance with the high GDP growth, there
was a sizeable credit pick-up in respect of
petroleum, basic metals and metal products,
textiles,  food  processing,  infrastructure,
engineering and chemicals. During 2006-07,
credit growth outpaced the deposit growth.
The liquidity condition remained tight during
the greater part of the year following monetary
tightening  and 
imposition  of  strict
provisioning norms by Reserve Bank of India
(RBI).

Amidst  a  rally  in  stock  prices,  financial
markets  remained,  by  and  large,  stable

Annual Report 2006-07

during  the  year  under  review,  except  for  the
month of May 2006 and February 2007, when
corrections took place in stock market.

High  credit  demand  coupled  with
inadequate  growth  in  deposits,  exerted
pressure  on  interest  rates,  particularly  at  the
short-end of the market. As a result, the yield
curve  flattened  reducing  the  spread  between
short  and 
long  yields.  Corporates
restructured  their  debt  profile  and  also
resorted  to  external  commercial  borrowings
(ECBs).  Moreover,  they  mobilised  sizeable
amount  of  resources  through  the  issue  of
ADRs and GDRs in addition to accessing the
domestic markets through a number of public
issues, rights issues, and private placements.

Inflation  on  a  point  to  point  basis,
measured by variation in the Wholesale Price
Index  (WPI),  was  5.7  per  cent  at  the  end  of
March  2007  compared  to  4.1  per  cent  a  year
ago.  On  an  average  basis,  the  inflation  rate
was  5.4  per  cent  in  2006-07  compared  to  4.4
per  cent  in  the  previous  year.  Prices  of
manufactured products (weight: 63.8 per cent
in WPI) rose by 5.8 per cent compared to 1.9
per  cent  a  year  ago.  Following  the  softening
of  international  crude  oil  prices,  fuel  group
recorded  a  rise  of  1.0  per  cent  in  2006-07
which  was  lower  than  that  of  8.3  per  cent  in
the  previous  year.  As  a  part  of  deliberate
policy,  in  order  to  contain  the  inflation,  the
Union Government did not pass on the entire
burden of rise in international crude oil prices
to the consumers.

India’s import bill increased significantly
during  2006-07.  The  major  share  was
contributed  by  oil.  The  non-oil  imports  also
rose  due  to  high  growth  rates  and  buoyancy
in  the  industrial  activities.  As  a  result,  trade
deficit widened during 2006-07. Bulk of trade
deficit  was  financed  through  net  receipts
under  invisibles,  particularly  through
remittances from the Indian migrant workers
abroad  and  earnings  from  exports  of  IT-
enabled  services.  The  capital  flows,  which
more  than  offset  the  current  account  deficit,

contributed  to  the  accumulation  of  foreign
exchange  reserves  of  RBI.  India’s  foreign
exchange  reserves  rose  by  USD  47.6  billion
during  2006-07,  on  account  of  rising  inflow
of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  and
external  commercial  borrowings  by  Indian
companies  overseas.

2. REVIEW OF POLICIES AND

PROGRAMMES

SEBI  initiated  a  number  of  policies
during  2006-07  in  consultation  with  the
Government  of  India.  These  policies  and
programmes  are  presented  in  this  section
under six major heads viz. primary securities
market,  secondary  securities  market,  mutual
investors,
funds,  foreign 
corporate  restructuring  and 
investor
awareness  and  investor  protection.  The
section  is  concluded  with  ‘retrospect  and
prospects’.

institutional 

I.

Primary  Securities  Market

A  developed  primary  market  is  crucial
for  resource  mobilisation  by  companies  to
raise  funds  for  expansion  and  growth  plans.
Indian  primary  market,  which  witnessed  an
increased  activity  in  2005-06,  showed  further
strength  in  2006-07.  The  ongoing  reforms  in
the primary market improved the confidence
of  the  investors  as  well  as  the  issuers.  A
number  of  companies  entered  the  primary
market  for  resource  mobilisation.  Response
of  various  categories  of  investors  to  public
issues was encouraging. A detailed discussion
on  number  of  issues,  amount  mobilised,  size
and  composition  of  issues  and  industry-wise
resource  mobilised  is  given  in  the  Part  Two
of  this  report.  Major  policy  initiatives  taken
by  SEBI  during  2006-07  relating  to  the
primary market are:

i.

Continuous  Listing  Requirement:
Minimum Level of Public
Shareholding

As  a  pre-condition 

to  maintain
continuous  listing,  now  listed  companies  are

10

Part One: Policies and Programmes

desirous  of  issuing  IDR  in  India.  The  issuer
company  must  be  listed  in  its  home  country
and  has  to  satisfy  conditions  relating  to
minimum 
issue  size  and  minimum
subscription to the issue amongst others. SEBI
also  prescribed  the  listing  requirements  for
entities  issuing  IDRs,  by  way  of  a  model
listing  agreement.

iv. Qualified  Institutions’  Placement

(QIP)

SEBI facilitated a fast and cost-effective
way of raising funds from the Indian securities
market  by  way  of  private  placement  of
securities or convertibles (but not warrants)
with the Qualified Institutional Buyers. This is
termed as Qualified Institutions’ Placement
(QIP) (Box 1.2). In case of QIP, the issuer is not
required to file a draft offer document with
SEBI, which saves both time and cost.

v.

Corporate Bond Market – Launch of
Reporting  Platform

To 

implement  the  Union  Budget
proposal on creation of a unified platform for
trading  of  corporate  bonds,  SEBI  stipulated
that  an  authorised  reporting  platform  be
established to capture all information related
to  trading  in  corporate  bonds  as  accurately
and  as  close  to  execution  as  possible.  SEBI
mandated that both BSE and NSE should set
up  and  maintain  a  reporting  platform  for
corporate  bonds.

vi. Publicity  Restrictions

SEBI  amended  DIP  Guidelines  to
specifically prohibit an issuer company to go
for  any  kind  of  publicity,  prior  to  filing  the
draft  offer  document  with  SEBI,  if  the
advertisement/publicity is not consistent with
the  past  practices  of  the  company.  The
company  can,  however,  undertake  such
publicity  provided,  there  is  a  prominent
disclosure  about  their  intention  to  come
forward  with  an  issue,  in  terms  of  the
guidelines.

required  to  maintain  a  minimum  level  of
public shareholding at 25 per cent of the total
shares issued. The exception being companies
which are required to maintain more than 10
per  cent  but  less  than  25  per  cent  in
accordance  with  the  Rule  19  (2)  (b)  of  the
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957
as  well  as  the  companies,  that  have  two
crores  or  more  number  of  listed  shares  and
Rs. 1,000  crore  or  more  of  market
capitalisation.

SEBI  provided  for  a  transparent
mechanism  to  graduate  to  compliance  of  the
continuous 
for
companies  which  are  currently  non-
compliant  companies  or  companies  which
might become non-compliant in future.

requirements 

listing 

Correspondingly,  SEBI  provided  for  a
revised format for shareholding pattern to be
disclosed in accordance with Clause 35 of the
equity  listing  agreement.  In  the  revised
format, shareholding pattern will be indicated
under  three  categories,  viz.  ‘shares  held  by
promoter  and  promoter  group’,  ‘shares  held
by public’ and ‘shares held by custodians and
against  which  depository  receipts  have  been
issued.’

ii. Optional  IPO  Grading

SEBI  prescribed  Guidelines  relating  to
grading  of  the  IPO  by  issuer  company  who
may  want  to  opt  for  grading  of  their  IPO  by
the  rating  agencies.  These  Guidelines  are
recommendatory  in  nature.  As  per  the
Guidelines,  the  issuers  are  required  to  state
on  the  cover  page  of  the  offer  document
whether they have opted for an IPO grading.
In  case,  the  issuer  company  opts  for  a
grading,  then  these  grades,  including  the
unaccepted  ones,  should  be  disclosed  in  the
prospectus  and  abridged  prospectus.

iii. Guidelines for Issue of Indian

Depository  Receipts  (IDRs)

SEBI  issued  Guidelines  for  disclosures
and other related requirements for companies

11

Annual Report 2006-07

Box 1.2: Qualified Institutions’ Placement

SEBI  vide  its  circular  dated  May  08,  2006,  amended  the  SEBI  (Disclosure  and  Investor
Protection)  (DIP)  Guidelines,  2000  to  introduce  a  new  method  of  raising  funds  from  market  by
companies in the form of ‘Qualified Institutions’ Placement’ (QIP). It is a form of private placement.
It  is  an  attempt  by  SEBI  to  encourage  Indian  companies  to  raise  money  domestically  rather  than
going  outside  for  Foreign  Currency  Convertible  Bonds  (FCCBs)/  American  Depository  Receipts
(ADRs)/Global Depository Receipts (GDRs). Only those companies which are listed on stock exchanges
having nation wide trading terminals are allowed to raise funds by selling their securities directly to
Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). They may be public financial institutions as defined in section
4A of Companies Act, 1956, Scheduled Commercial banks, Mutual Funds, FIIs registered with SEBI,
VCFs,  FVCFs,  State  Industrial  Development  Corporations,  Insurance  Companies,  Provident  Funds
having minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crore and Pension Funds having minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crore.

QIP  Issue  Structure

The  placement  size  of  QIPs  shall  not  exceed  five  times  the  pre-issue  net  worth  as  per  the
audited  balance  sheet  of  the  previous  financial  year.  Minimum  of  10  per  cent  of  specified  securities
shall  be  allotted  to  mutual  funds.  If  no  mutual  fund  is  agreeing  to  take  up  the  minimum  portion  or
any  part  thereof,  such  portion  may  be  allotted  to  other  QIBs.  No  allotment  shall  be  made,  directly  or
indirectly, to any QIBs being a promoter or any person related to promoters. There should be at least
two allottes for an issue of size upto Rs. 250 crore and at least five allottes for an issue size in excess
of Rs. 250 crore. No single allotee shall be allotted more than 50 per cent of the issue size.

Pricing & Lock-in

The  pricing  requirements  shall  be  broadly  at  par  with  those  for  Guidelines  for  preferential
issues  as  specified  in  the  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines.  Minimum  price  is  higher  than  the  average  of  the
weekly  high  and  low  of  the  closing  price  quoted  during  six  months  or  two  weeks  preceding  the
relevant date. There shall be adjustment of price in case of corporate actions, right issue, stock splits,
etc.There  will  be  no  lock-in  period  for  the  securities  allotted  under  this  route.  However,  there  cannot
be off-market transaction in such securities for a period of one year from the date of allotment.

Payment  Terms

The specified securities allotted pursuant to QIP shall be made fully paid-up at the time of their

allotment.

Other  Requirements

The  placement  document  shall  contain  all  material  information,  including  the  information
specified  in  Chapter  XIII-A  of  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines.  Being  a  private  document,  it  can  be  provided
only  to  select  investors  through  serially  numbered  copies.  The  placement  document  will  be  placed  on
the website of the concerned stock exchange and of the issuer. A copy of the placement document will
also  be  filed  with  SEBI  for  record  purpose,  within  thirty  days  of  the  allotment.  A  security  which  is
convertible  into  or  exchangeable  with  equity  shares  at  a  later  date,  may  be  converted  or  exchanged
into equity shares at any time after allotment of security, but not later than 60 months from the date
of  allotment.

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Box 1.2: Qualified Institutions’ Placement  (Contd.)

The  resolution  approving  QIP  passed  under  section  81(1A)  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956  will
remain valid for a period of twelve months from the date of passing. QIP will be managed by a SEBI
registered  merchant  banker  who  will  exercise  due  diligence  and  furnish  a  due  diligence  certificate  to
stock  exchange  with  all  relevant  requirements.

An  issue  may  arise  in  this  context  that,  by  allowing  the  QIP  due  emphasis  is  not  being  given
to the retail investors. The idea behind QIP is to enable listed companies to raise funds from domestic
market  without  going  to  foreign  countries  through  ADRs  /  GDRs.  That  means  QIPs  are  giving  due
importance  to  the  growth  of  our  economy  domestically.  The  requirement  of  minimum  10  per  cent
allotment  to  mutual  funds  is  intended  to  help  the  retail  investors  indirectly  as  a  large  number  of
retail investors invest via mutual fund route.

The decision of SEBI to allow listed companies to raise funds from the domestic market through
QIP  will  encourage  corporates  to  consider  the  local  market  more  effectively.  QIP  has  an  advantage
over  FPO  in  terms  of  cost,  time  and  comparatively  simpler  procedures.  With  this,  QIP  is  poised  to
be  a  more  favourable  fund-raising  route  for  Indian  companies,  in  the  coming  days,  in  comparison  to
ADRs / GDRs / FCCBs.

vii. Common Platform for Electronic Filing
and  Dissemination  of  Information  for
Listed  Companies

In  order  to  enhance  transparency  and
efficiency  of  the  securities  market,  SEBI
advised  the  two  major  stock  exchanges,  BSE
and  NSE  to  explore  the  possibility  of  setting
up  a  common  electronic  platform  which
should  aim  at  (i)  providing  a  single  window
filing  to  listed  companies  irrespective  of
multiple  listing,  (ii)  eliminating  paper  filing
with  the  stock  exchanges,  (iii)  covering  all
listed companies (including companies listed
on stock exchanges other than NSE and BSE)
and  (iv)  being  a  one-stop  shop  for  sourcing
corporate information of listed companies by
investors.

At  the  instance  of  SEBI,  on  January  01,
2007,  BSE  and  NSE,  jointly  launched  a
common  portal  at  www.corpfiling.co.in.  This
portal  is  jointly  owned,  managed  and
maintained by the two exchanges. In the first
phase since its launch, the platform has been
disseminating  filings  made  by  companies

listed  on  these  exchanges.  Further,  it  was
proposed  to  implement  electronic  filing  in  a
phased  manner  and  to  upgrade  the
dissemination  portal  into  a  common  filing
and dissemination platform by April 01, 2007.
When  this  arrangement  will  be  fully
operational,  a  company  would  be  required
to file the information only once, irrespective
of  the  exchange(s)  where  it  is  listed.  The
investors  will  be  able  to  access  such  filings
from  a  single  source  irrespective  of  the
exchange on which the shares are listed.

viii. Advisory  Committees  for  Policy

Initiatives

SEBI  reconstituted  two  committees,
namely, Primary Market Advisory Committee
(PMAC) and SEBI Committee on Disclosures
and Accounting  Standards  (SCODA).

a)

PMAC  was  reconstituted  under  the
Chairmanship of Shri Deepak S. Parekh,
Chairman,  HDFC,  on  July  27,  2006.  In
its  meetings,  PMAC  deliberated  on
various  topics,  such  as,  IPO  grading,
systemic issues in IPO process, proposed

13

Annual Report 2006-07

b)

facility  of  on-line  application  in  IPOs,
recent  trends  in  issues  like  lock-in  of
pledged shares, filing of offer documents
-  pending  completion  of  restructuring,
role of print media companies in issues,
review  of  corporate  governance
provisions,  review  of  guidelines
governing  preferential  issues,  review  of
mechanism of refund through Electronic
Clearing Service (ECS) in IPOs, etc.

SCODA  was  created  by  merging  two
advisory  committees  of  SEBI,  namely,
SEBI  Committee  on  Disclosures  (SCOD)
and  SEBI  Committee  on  Accounting
Standards  (SCAS),  on  September  12,
2006. This Committee is chaired by Shri
Y.  H.  Malegam.  The  Committee
deliberated  upon  issues  like  disclosure
of financials pertaining to debt issued on
private placement basis, interpretation of
provisions  of  guidelines  regarding
financial  statements,  convergence  of
Indian  Accounting  Standards  with
International  Financial  Reporting
Standard  (IFRS),  use  of  Extensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL) in
financial  reporting,  etc.

II. Secondary  Securities  Market

i.

VaR Margining in Cash Market

In  cash  market,  VaR  margin  rates  were
calculated  at  the  end  of  the  trading  day  and
then  applied  to  open  positions  for  the
subsequent  trading  day.  To  ensure  market
safety, to protect the interest of investors, and
to  align  the  risk  management  framework
across  the  cash  market,  it  was  decided  that
the  risk  arrays  should  be  updated  intra-day
in  the  cash  market  as  is  being  practised  in
derivatives  market.

Accordingly,  the  stock  exchanges  were
advised to update the applicable VaR margin
rates,  at  least  five  times  in  a  day.  This  may

be  carried  out  by  taking  the  closing  price  of
the  previous  day-  at  the  start  of  trading  and
the prices at 11:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m.,
and at the end of the trading session.

ii. Mandatory Requirement of PAN for

Trading in Cash Market

In  order  to  further  strengthen  Know
Your  Client  (KYC)  norms  in  the  cash  market
and  facilitate  reliable  audit  trail,  PAN  was
made  mandatory  for  all  the  entities/persons
having transaction in cash market with effect
from October 01, 2006.

Since, certain operational issues came up
for  discussion  and  market  participants  made
representations,  the  deadline  for  compliance
of KYC norms was extended to December 31,
2006.

iii. Mandatory Requirement of PAN for

Opening and Operating Demat
Accounts

PAN  was  made  mandatory  for  all
categories of demat account holders including
minors,  trusts,  foreign  corporate  bodies,
banks,  corporates,  FIIs  and  NRIs,  in  respect
of  all  dematerialised  accounts  opened  by
them  on  or  after  April  01,  2006.  As  regards
demat  accounts  which  existed  prior  to  April
01,  2006,  time  for  furnishing  and  verification
of  PAN  card  details  was  granted  upto
December  31,  2006.  The  accounts  of  those
investors  who  could  not  comply  with  the
mandatory  PAN 
stood
suspended for debit, with effect from January
01, 2007.

requirement 

iv. Standing  Committee  for  Addressing
Problems  in  Computerised  Trading

The stock exchanges were advised to set
up  Standing  Committee  to  investigate  the
problems  of  computerised  trading  system,
such  as,  hanging  /  slowdown  /  breakdown.

14

Part One: Policies and Programmes

changes in their tariff/charge structure, as and
when the changes are made.

The depositories were further advised to
disseminate the same on their websites so as
to enable the investors to have a comparative
analysis  of  the  tariff/charge  structure  of
various  DPs.

vi. Clarification  on  Comprehensive

Investor  Protection  Fund  (IPF)/
Customer  Protection  Fund  (CPF)

It was clarified that in the case of a stock
broker,  having  multiple  memberships,  being
declared  defaulter, any amount remaining to
his  credit,  after  satisfying  the  eligible  claims
at  the  stock  exchange/SEBI/other  stock
exchanges,  shall  be  credited  to  the  IPF/CPF
of  respective  exchange.

vii. Safeguards to Address the Concerns of
the  Investors  on  Transfer  of  Securities
in  Dematerialised  Mode

Various  representations  were  received
from investors regarding transfer of securities
from  Beneficiary  Owner  (BO)  Accounts
without  proper  authorisation  by  the
concerned investor. The following safeguards
were  put  in  place  to  address  the  aforesaid
concerns:

a)

b)

c)

The  depositories  to  give  more  emphasis
on  investor  education  particularly  with
regard  to  careful  preservation  of
Delivery  Instruction  Slip  (DIS)  by  the
BOs. The depositories to advise the BOs
not to leave “blank or signed” DIS with
the DPs or any other person/entity.

The  DPs  not  to  accept  pre-signed  DIS
with blank columns from the BO(s).

The  DPs  to  issue  only  one  DIS  booklet
containing  not  more  than  20  slips  for
individual account holders and not more
than 100 slips for non-individual account
holders, at a time.

To  ensure  compliance  on  the  issue  raised
during  inspection  of  stock  exchanges
conducted  by  SEBI  and  to  bring  uniformity
in  implementation  /  compliance,  the  stock
exchanges were advised, as under:

a) All  instances  of  hanging  /slowdown  /
breakdown  and  any  other  problem  in
the  computerised  trading  system,  even
for  disruptions  less  than  five  minutes,
should be reported to the Committee for
its  consideration.

b)

c)

d)

The  Committee,  upon  examination  of
the  issue  shall  submit  a  report  to  the
Governing  Board  /  Council  of  the  stock
exchange.

The  Governing  Board  /  Council  of  the
stock  exchange  shall  deliberate  on  the
aforesaid report and take suitable action
/ remedial measure.

In case of stoppage beyond five minutes
the  exchange  should  also  explain  and
report  to  SEBI  about  the  nature  of
incident  as  well  as  the  remedial
measures  taken.  The  stock  exchange
shall  also  issue  a  press  release  in  this
regard  for  greater  transparency  and  in
the larger interest of investors.

v. Dissemination  of  Tariff/Charge

Structure  of  Depository  Participants
(DPs)

Following  the  representations  by
investors  to  SEBI  that  the  tariff/charge
structure  of  various  DPs  should  be  made
available  for  comparison  so  as  to  enable
investors  to  take  an  informed  decision  with
regard  to  availing  of  the  services  of  a
particular  DP,  SEBI  advised  DPs  to  submit
the  tariff/charge  structure  every  year,  latest
by  April  30,  to  their  depositories.  Also,  DPs
should  inform  their  depositories  about  the

If  the  DIS  booklet  is  lost  /  stolen  /  not
traceable  by  the  BO,  the  same  must  be
intimated to the DP immediately by the
BO  in  writing.  On  receipt  of  such
intimation,  the  DP  shall  cancel  the
unused DIS of the said booklet.

The  DPs  can  issue  subsequent  DIS
booklet  to  a  BO  only  after  the  BO  has
used  at  least  75  per  cent  of  the  slips
contained  in  the  previous  DIS  booklet.
The DP shall also ensure that a new DIS
booklet is issued only on the basis of the

III. Mutual  Funds

i.

Rationalisation  of 
Issue
Expenses  and  Dividend  Distribution
Procedure

Initial 

In order to contain frequent churning of
the investors in mutual fund schemes and to
clarify  expense  structure  in  SEBI  (Mutual
Funds)  Regulations,  1996  with  greater
precision,  SEBI  decided  to  rationalise  the
initial  issue  expenses.  Accordingly,  for  the
purpose  of  meeting  the  expenses  connected
with sales and distribution of schemes, close-

18

ended  schemes  were  permitted  to  charge
initial issue expenses to the scheme. Similarly,
open-ended  schemes  were  not  permitted  to
charge  initial  issues  expenses  but  can  charge
only entry load.

It  was  further  clarified  that  in  close-
ended  schemes  where  initial  issue  expenses
are  amortised,  for  an  investor  exiting  the
scheme before amortisation is completed, the
asset  management  company  (AMC)  shall
redeem  the  units  only  after  recovering  the
balance  proportionate  unamortised  issue
expenses.

Also,  as  a  step  towards  introducing
uniform  practices  in  procedure  for  dividend
distribution  by  the  mutual  funds,  the  AMCs
were  advised  to  issue  a  notice  to  the  public
within  one  calendar  day  of  the  decision  by
the trustees on dividend distribution.

ii. Undertaking  from  Trustees  for  New

Scheme  Offer  Document

To  address  the  concerns  regarding
launch  of  similar  products,  mutual  fund
trustees  were  required  to  certify  that  the
scheme  approved  by  them  is  a  new  product
and is not a minor modification of an existing
scheme/  product.  However,  the  said
certification  shall  not  be  applicable  to  fixed
maturity  plans  and  close-ended  schemes  but
shall  be  applicable  to  close-ended  schemes
with a feature of conversion into open-ended
scheme on maturity.

iii. Revised  Monthly  Cumulative  Report
(MCR)  and  Annual  Statistical  Report
(ASR)

In  order  to  capture  the  trends  in  unit
capital,  the  formats  of  MCR  and  ASR
submitted by the mutual funds were revised.

iv.

Investments  in  ADRs/GDRs/Foreign
Securities and Overseas ETFs

Part One: Policies and Programmes

to  invest  in  ADRs/GDRs  issued  by  Indian
companies,  equity  of  overseas  companies
listed on recognised stock exchanges overseas
and  rated  debt  securities  was  raised  from
USD 1 billion to USD 2 billion. Subsequently,
the limit was raised to USD 3 billion by RBI.
The  mutual  funds  were  also  permitted  to
invest in overseas ETFs.

Accordingly,  the  maximum  ceiling  of
such investments for individual mutual funds
was  raised  from  USD  50  million  to  USD  100
million and subsequently the limit was raised
to  USD  150  million.  The  mutual  funds  were
also  advised  to  appoint  a  dedicated  fund
manager for making such investments.

v.

Introduction  of  Capital  Protection
Oriented Schemes and Revision in Fees

The  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,
1996  were  amended  so  as  to  permit  the
launch  of  Capital  Protection  Oriented
schemes.  The  proposed  portfolio  structure
indicated  in  the  offer  document  and  Key
Information  Memorandum  (KIM)  must  be
rated  by  a  SEBI  registered  credit  rating
agency as per Regulation 38A of mutual fund
Regulation.  Moreover,  the  rating  should  be
reviewed on a quarterly basis. In this regard,
the trustees should also continuously monitor
the  structure  of  the  portfolio  of  the  capital
protection oriented scheme and should report
the  same  in  the  half-yearly  trustee  report.  It
should  also  be  ensured  that  the  debt
component  of  the  portfolio  structure  has  the
highest investment grade rating.

The fees payable by mutual funds to SEBI
was also revised. This would be applicable to
those schemes whose offer documents were
filed with SEBI on or after the issue of Gazette
Notification dated August 03, 2006.

of  purchases  and  redemptions  of  liquid
schemes  were  revised  and  comprehensive
Guidelines  were  issued.

vii. Dispatch of Statement of Accounts

SEBI  directed  mutual  funds  to  dispatch
the statement of accounts to the unit holders
under  Systematic  Investment  Plan  (SIP)  /
Systematic  Transfer  Plan  (STP)  /  Systematic
Withdrawal  Plan  (SWP)  once  every  quarter
ending  March, 
June,  September  and
December  within  ten  working  days  of  the
end  of  the  respective  quarter.  However,  the
first  statement  of  accounts  under  SIP/STP/
SWP shall be issued within ten working days
of the initial investment.

In case of specific request received from
investors,  mutual  funds  shall  provide  the
statement of accounts to the investors within
five  working  days  from  the  receipt  of  such
request  without  any  charges.  Further,  soft
copy of the account statement shall be mailed
to  the  investors  under  SIP/STP/SWP  to  their
e-mail  address  on  a  monthly  basis,  if  so
desired by the investors.

SEBI further advised mutual funds to
provide account statements to the unit holders
who have not transacted during the last six
months to ensure better information flow.

viii. Launch of Gold Exchange Traded

Funds

SEBI amended the SEBI (Mutual Funds)
Regulations, 1996 to specify the methodology
for  the  valuation  of  gold  for  the  purpose  of
Gold  Exchange  Traded  Funds  (GETFs).
Accordingly, the gold held by a GETF scheme
shall  be  valued  at  the  AM  fixing  price  of
London  Bullion  Market  Association  (LBMA)
in US dollars per troy ounce for gold having
a fineness of 995.0 parts per thousand, subject
to  prescribed  adjustments.  During  the  year
two GETF schemes were launched.

ix. Real Estate Mutual Fund (REMF)

Draft  Regulations  for  REMF  were
approved  by  SEBI.  REMF  Scheme  means  a
scheme  of  a  mutual  fund  which  has
investment  objective  to  invest  directly  or
indirectly in real estate property and shall be
governed  by  the  provisions  and  guidelines
under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations. The
structure  of  the  REMFs,  initially,  shall  be
close-ended.  The  units  of  REMFs  should  be
compulsorily  listed  on  the  stock  exchanges
and  NAV  of  the  scheme  should  be  declared
daily.  The  final  framework  is  being  worked
out  given  the  special  nature  of  real  estate  as
an asset class and various concerns expressed
on this issue (Box 1.3).

IV. Foreign  Institutional  Investors

The  year  2006-07  saw  SEBI  taking  a
number  of  steps  with  regard  to  foreign
institutional  investors  (FIIs).  The  steps  taken
were:  (i)  opening  of  the  Indian  securities
market  to  new  categories  of  FIIs,  (ii)
widening  the  scope  of  investment  for  FIIs,
(iii) 
registration
documentation  and  process  of  registration
and  (iv)  increase  in  the  infrastructure
facilities.  A  summary  of  the  steps  is  given
below:

Box 1.3: Real Estate Investment Schemes for Mutual Funds in India

Real estate is an important asset class, which is generally not available to investors in India, except
through direct ownership of properties. Investment in real estate provides opportunity for capital gains
as well as periodic incomes. Over a longer term real estate provides returns that are comparable with
returns on equities. The volatility in prices of real estate is lower than equities leading to a better risk-
return trade off for the investment. Real estate investments made over long periods of time provide an
inflation hedge and yield real returns. However, real estate is distinct from other assets. The real estate
investments are lumpy in nature and unaffordable to many. The specific risk is high and personal
diversification is very difficult. The legal issues and lack of transparency make the probability of a mistake
high. The illiquid nature of the markets makes the undoing of a wrong real estate investment a tedious
and painful process. Distress sales generate much lower returns than the fair value of the property.

Professional management attempts to limit the risks in real estate investment and, at the same time,
brings in such advantages as legal expertise, information on prices and regular maintenance and repairs.

Real estate investment schemes provide affordability to small investors enabling their participation
in the property market. They help investors to diversify their investment portfolio across various asset
classes and reduce the property specific risk. The benefits include professional management and liquidity
for the investment.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have been in existence in the United States of America since
1960. In the beginning, REITs were constrained because of the limited permission to own real estate and
not operate or manage it. The provisions of the tax code which made real estate investment tax shelter-
oriented also hindered the growth of REITs. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the potential for real
estate investment to generate tax shelter opportunities and permitted the REITs to also operate and
manage most types of income producing commercial properties. REITs became a popular way of accessing
the markets during the early 1990s when property values dropped between 30-50 per cent. While the
sector experienced credit crunch, REITs became the source of capital to many private real estate
companies and a convenient mode for investors to gain exposure to the sector. There are about
190 publicly traded REITs in the USA and registered with the SEC, with assets totaling over
USD 500 billion.

In the United Kingdom, real estate investments are done through pooled managed vehicles (PMVs),
which are in the form of Trusts, having a variable capital and are similar to open-ended funds. PMVs
may get tax benefits based on the investor profile. REITs are a relatively new entrant in the Asia Pacific
region in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand.

Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) had set up a Committee to study the introduction
of real estate schemes for mutual funds in India. The Committee submitted its report in October 2000.
AMFI subsequently appointed a Sub-Committee to formulate a working plan for launching of REMFs
in India, which submitted its report in August 2002. SEBI examined the proposals and took into
consideration certain concerns raised by investor associations and the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of India (ICAI). On account of the well developed stage of the mutual fund industry in India, SEBI
decided to allow the existing mutual funds in India to float real estate investment schemes. In June 2006,
the guidelines for Real Estate Mutual Funds were approved by the SEBI Board. A real estate mutual fund
scheme means a mutual fund which has investment objective to invest directly or indirectly in real estate
property and shall be governed by the provisions and guidelines under SEBI (Mutual Funds)
Regulations, 1996. Certain residual issues relating to valuation and accounting are being addressed.

FIIs  were  allowed  to  settle  their
transaction  in  the  physical  settlement
mode where the issuer of such securities
has not established connectivity with all
depositories  registered  with  SEBI.

V. Custodians

SEBI initiated the following policies and

programmes with respect to custodians:

a)

b)

c)

Three new custodians (including one for
custodial  services  of  gold  and  gold
related  instruments)  were  registered
under  SEBI  (Custodian  of  Securities)
Regulations,  1996.

Scope of custodial services was enlarged
to  include  safekeeping  of  gold  or  gold
related  instruments,  consequent  to
introduction  of  gold  and  gold  related
instruments  in  the  Indian  mutual  fund
market.

Enabling  provisions  were  made  for
existing  custodians  to  provide  custodial
services  for  gold  or  gold  related
instruments  subject  to  prior  permission
from SEBI.

d) Registration  fee  in  respect  of  custodians
was  revised  and  a  fixed  period  of
validity  of  three  years  was  introduced
for  the  certificate  of  registration  as  a
custodian.

i.

Redressal  of  Investors’  Grievances

The  Office  of  Investor  Assistance  and
Education  (OIAE)  is  the  single  window
interface  through  which  SEBI  interacts  with
the investors. Investors can seek assistance of
OIAE  in  their  endeavor  to  address  the
grievances  that  they  may  have  against
intermediaries or listed companies. OIAE also
takes  on  board,  the  views  and  opinions  of
various  investor  interest  groups  recognised
as Investors’ Associations and encourage their
participation  in  policy  formulation  process.

SEBI  has  a  comprehensive  investor
grievances  handling  mechanism.  OIAE
facilitates  redressal  of  the  grievances  of
investors  by  taking  up  these  grievances  with
the respective listed companies and registered
intermediaries.  Investors  can  submit  their
grievances  against  the  companies  and
intermediaries  in  any  of  the  four  offices  of
the SEBI i.e. Head Office at Mumbai and the
three  Regional  Offices  at  Delhi,  Chennai  &
Kolkata,  irrespective  of  the  location  of  the
intermediary/  listed  company.

The  grievances  can  be  submitted  on  a
plain  paper,  on  a  post  card,  via  e-mail  etc.
apart  from  the  standardised  printed  forms
that  are  freely  available  at  all  the  offices  of
SEBI.  SEBI  also  has  a  simple  and  efficient
internet-based  response  system  for  investors
to  file  their  grievances  for  matters  falling  in
under  its  purview.  SEBI  website  offers
investors  a  facility  of  checking  up  the  status
of their complaints lodged.

Dedicated investor helpline numbers are
also available. Dedicated personnel, manning
the  helpline,  guide  investors  in  filling  the
grievance  submission  forms  as  well  as
determining  the  appropriate  authority  as
their first recourse. Guidance is also provided
to approach the appropriate authority, if their
grievance is outside the purview of SEBI.

22

The  grievances  lodged  by  investors  are
taken up with the respective listed companies
and  registered  intermediaries.  The  status  of
the grievances is continuously monitored and
regular  follow  up  action  is  taken  based  on
the  response  received  from  the  companies
and  intermediaries.

Up  to  March  31,  2007,  38  companies
were  referred  for  adjudication  proceedings
under  Section  15C  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  for
levying  penalty  for  failure  to  redress
investors  grievances.

On  account  of  failure  of  the  companies
imposed  by  the
to  pay  the  penalty 
Adjudicating  Officers, 
prosecution
proceedings  were  initiated  against  13
companies  and  their  70  directors,  under
section 24 (2) of the SEBI Act, which provides
for  “punishable  with  imprisonment  for  a
term which shall not be less than one month
but  which  may  extend  to  both  10  years  or
with  fine  which  may  extend  to  Rs. 25  crores
or with both”.

Twelve companies and their 54 directors
were  debarred  from  accessing  the  capital
market for a period of five years. Prosecution
proceedings  were  initiated  against  41
companies  and  their  directors  for  violations
pertaining  to  non  redressal  of  the  grievances
under the provisions of the companies falling
within the jurisdiction of SEBI.

During  the  period  1991-92  to  2006-07,
SEBI  received  29,07,053  grievances  from
investors,  of  which  a  total  of  27,40,959
grievances  were  redressed  by  the  respective
entities,  indicating  a  redressal  rate  of  94.28
per cent (Table 1.4).

The  objectives  of  these  workshops  were
two  fold:  (a)  providing  enriching  experience
for  the  investors  having  a  prior  investing
experience  by  interaction  with  the  subject
experts and (b) guiding potential investors to
take first steps towards their interaction with

VII. Retrospect and Prospects

i.

Retrospect

So far, Indian economy has continued to
sustain  a  high  rate  of  growth  during  the
Tenth Plan period. There was a robust growth
of  over  9.4  per  cent  during  2006-07.  The
continued  momentum  in  manufacturing  and
service  sector  resulted  in  higher  capacity
utilisation and increased business confidence.

The  investors’  confidence  was  also
reflected in the activities in the stock market.
The  stock  market  continued  to  gather
momentum with the BSE Sensex crossing the
12,000  mark  for  the  first  time  on  April  29,
2006.  Thereafter,  it  crossed  13,000  mark  on
October 10, 2006 and 14,000 mark on January
12,  2007,  respectively.  During  2006-07,  BSE
Sensex gained 15.9 per cent. Backed by strong
macro-economic  fundamentals,  the  overall
market  sentiment  was  buoyant  throughout

Part One: Policies and Programmes

the  year,  except  in  June  2006  and  February
2007.  Reflecting  the  price  appreciation,
market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio  and  the
traded  value  to  GDP  ratio  increased  to  85.9
per  cent  and  70.4  per  cent,  respectively  in
2006-07  from  84.7  per  cent  and  67.0  per  cent
a  year  ago.  The  rally  in  stock  market  was
broad  based  with  all  the  sectors  registering
gains.  Besides  FIIs,  mutual  funds  and  retail
investors  were  also  active  in  the  secondary
market.

The  primary  market  witnessed
continued  activity  during  2006-07.  The
number  of  companies  accessing  the  primary
market  was  124  compared  to  139  during
2005-06.  The  amount  mobilised  was
Rs. 33,508  crore  during  2006-07,  higher  than
Rs. 27,382  crore  mobilised  during  2005-06.
The  number  of  IPOs  decreased  in  2006-07.
The  number  of  rights  issue  in  2006-07
increased to 39 from 36 in 2005-06.

in 

increase 

There  was  an 

the
mobilisation of resources by the mutual funds
in  2006-07.  With  private  sector  mutual  funds
dominating the resource mobilisation efforts,
the  net  resources  mobilised  by  all  mutual
funds  were  higher  at  Rs. 93,985  crore  during
2006-07 compared to Rs. 52,779 crore in 2005-
06. The exposure of mutual funds to the debt
segment  increased,  commensurate  with
higher  mobilisation  of  resources  under
various  debt schemes.

The  FIIs  continued  to  invest  in  Indian
market.  The  number  of  SEBI  registered  FIIs
went  up  to  997  by  end  March  2007  from  882
a  year  ago.  Their  net  investment  in  equities
was  USD  5,474  million  in  2006-07  as  against
USD 10,981 million a year earlier.

Prospects

In  an  integrated  market  economy,
regulating various market intermediaries on
an  individual  basis  to  ensure  investor
protection and smooth functioning of the

25

Annual Report 2006-07

market is a challenging task for a regulator.
The job of a regulator becomes relatively easy
if other organisations start to function as self-
regulated entities by framing their own laws
and bye-laws to keep a first level check on
their registered members. In this way, while
the  intermediary  organisations  take  the
responsibility of a first level regulator, the
central  regulator  acts  as  a  second  line  of
protection against fraud and manipulations.
This not only saves time but also enables the
central regulator to focus upon bigger issues of
regulating and developing a vibrant securities
market with all the safety nets in place.

SEBI,  in  an  effort  to  develop  a  well
regulated  and  orderly  securities  market,  has
been  trying  to  promote  the  idea  of  self

regulatory  organisations  for  various  market
participants  for  sometime.  In  this  direction,
SEBI 
(Self  Regulatory  Organisations)
Regulations,  2004  were  notified  on  February
19,  2004  with  the  objective  to  promote  self-
regulatory  organisations  of  intermediaries
representing  a  particular  segment  of  the
securities  market  as  a  self  regulated  entity.
Initiatives  were  taken  in  getting  entities
registered  as  an  SRO.  SEBI  held  meetings
with  the  representatives  of  Association  of
NSE Members of India (ANMI) and merchant
bankers  and  emphasised  the  need  of  having
an  SRO  which  would  act  as  first  level  of
regulator  and  provide  effective  checks  and
balances  for  developing  a  sound  and
integrated stock market (Box 1.4).

Box 1.4: Self Regulatory Organisations

A  stable  and  effective  financial  system  provides  the  foundation  for  timely  implementation  of
policies,  appropriate  pricing  of  risk  and  efficient  use  of  capital.  This  requires  proper  regulation  of  the
financial  markets  as  a  whole.  Self-regulation  is  a  combination  of  private  interests  with  regulatory
oversight.

It  is  an  effective  form  of  regulation  for  the  complex  and  dynamic  financial  markets.  As  per  the
IOSCO’s  seminal  report  (September  1998)  on  Objectives  and  Principles  of  Securities  Regulation,
“Self-regulatory  Organisations  (SROs)  can  be  a  valuable  component  to  the  regulator  in  achieving
the  objectives  of  securities  regulation.”

The scope of self-regulation varies across the developed and the emerging markets. In its absolute
sense,  self-regulation  encompasses  the  authority  to  create,  amend,  implement  and  enforce  rules  of
conduct  with  respect  to  the  entities  subject  to  the  SRO’s  jurisdiction;  and  to  resolve  disputes  either
through arbitration or through other means.

The  reason  for  promoting  intermediaries  like  stock  exchanges  as  SROs  is  that  these  entities
have  a  better  knowledge  of  the  ground  realities  and,  they  can  take  better  care  of  micro  aspects  of
regulation.  Self-regulation  not  only  minimises  the  cost  of  regulation  and  compliance  but  it  also
provides the flexibility to bring about regulatory changes in a rapidly changing business environment.
For an SRO to be credible and effective, it should be:



Independent - both in perception and in reality - from the influence of entities it regulates.

 Able to develop standards that are meaningful and broadly acceptable.
 Recognised as legitimate and relevant by the industry and by its regulators.
 Able to provide fair enforcement.

In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has primary responsibility
for  regulating  securities  markets.  The  SEC,  however,  delegates  significant  regulatory  authority  to

26

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Box 1.4: Self Regulatory Organisations  (Contd.)

SROs,  securities  industry  organisations  that  are  owned  and  operated  by  their  members.  Examples
include the National Association of Security Dealers (NASD), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and regional stocks and options exchanges.

In United Kingdom, SROs were set up to regulate companies dealing with investment business
with  the  objective  of  investor  protection  as  per  the  Financial  Services  Act,  1986.  Some  of  the  SROs
in U.K. are Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), Investment Management Regulatory organisation
(IMRO),  Personal  Investment  Authority  (PIA).  Hong  Kong  also  followed  the  concept  of  SROs  as
followed  in  U.K.  Two  important  SROs  in  Hong  Kong  are  Stock  Exchange  of  Hong  Kong  (SEHK)
and Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE).

As  the  concept  of  self  regulatory  bodies  is  becoming  increasingly  popular  in  international
jurisdictions,  the  structure,  functions  and  governance  methodology  of  these  SROs  like  NASD,  Japan
Securities  Dealers  Association  (JSDA),  Korea  Securities  Dealers  Association  (KSDA)  etc.  is  being
considered  by  SEBI.

In  India,  SEBI  is  promoting  development  of  self-regulatory  organisations.  SEBI  notified  SEBI
(Self  Regualtory  Organisation)  Regulations  2004  on  February  19,  2004.  SEBI  prescribed  certain
eligibility criteria for registration as an SRO, which include:

 The  applicant  should  be  a  company  which  has  been  granted  license  under  section  25  of  the

Companies  Act,  1956.

 The applicant has a net worth of Rupees one crore.

 The applicant has, adequate infrastructure to enable it to discharge its function as an SRO.

 The  applicant  has  in  its  memorandum  of  association  specified  admission  of  members  and

discharging the functions of an SRO as one of its main objects.

 The  applicant  and  its  directors  have  the  professional  competence,  financial  soundness,  and

general reputation of fairness and integrity to the satisfaction of SEBI.

 The  applicant,  in  all  other  respects,  is  a  fit  and  proper  person  for  the  grant  of  a  certificate;

and

 The  grant  of  certificate  to  the  applicant  is  in  the  interest  of  investors  and  the  securities

market.

The  Board  of  an  SRO  would  be  independent,  as  majority  of  directors  are  required  to  be
independent  directors.  The  SRO  would  also  provide  arbitration  mechanism  for  resolving  disputes
among members and/or between members and their constituents; and take disciplinary action against
the  members  for  breach  of  governing  norms.  The  major  functions  and  responsibility  of  an  SRO  are
as  follows:

 Ensuring  investor  protection,  education  of  investors  or  its  members,  and  observance  of

securities laws by its members.

 Specifying  standard  of  conduct  for  its  members,  and  responsibility  of  the  implementation  of

the same by its members.

27

Annual Report 2006-07

Box 1.4: Self Regulatory Organisations  (Contd.)

 Making endeavours for introduction of the best business practices amongst its members.

 Complying with the norms of corporate governance, as applicable to the listed companies.

SEBI  is  in  dialogue  with  various  associations  of  intermediaries  for  their  registration  as  SROs.
Few  associations  like  the  Association  of  NSE  Members  of  India  (ANMI)  and  Depository  Participant
Association  of  India  (DPAI)  have  shown  interest  in  getting  themselves  registered  as  SRO.  In  this
regard, SEBI is considering various models of self–regulation for intermediaries.

The  successful  implementation  of  the  elements  of  self-regulation  depends  on  maturity  and
sophistication of the market; and its regulatory environment. As an SRO demonstrates its effectiveness,
a  successful  self-regulatory  programme  can  be  implemented  over  time.  SROs  are  motivated  to  act
responsibly,  develop  best  practices  and  monitor  their  markets.  SRO  functions  should  be  developed,
retained,  and  maximized  to  the  extent  possible,  subject  to  appropriate  accountability  mechanisms  to
ensure  proper  disposal  of  regulatory  responsibilities.  When  properly  implemented,  self  regulation  can
lead  to  effective  implementation  of  rules  with  wide  compliance.  Self-regulation  is  not  “deregulation”;
it is an important part of efficient regulation.

SEBI,  with  a  mandate  to  promote  and
develop  an  orderly  and  secure  stock  market
for all classes of investors strongly promoted
the  idea  of  demutualised  stock  exchanges  in
line  with  international  best  practices,  where
the  management  functions  of  the  exchanges
were  separated  from  ownership  and  trading
rights  through  demutualisation.  Post-
demutualisation, the central problem appears
to  be  the  fate  of  various  regional  stock
exchanges  (RSEs)  where  trading  activities
have  become  minimal.  RSEs  were  created  in
the  past  to  facilitate  regional  companies  to
raise  resources  for  their  growth  objectives.  It
is  in  this  regard  a  Committee  was  formed
under 
the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  G.
Anantharaman,  Whole  Time  Member,  SEBI,
to  come  up  with  recommendations  for
productive  utilisation 
available
infrastructure  with  RSEs  and  to  provide  an
exit option for them (Box 1.5). Steps are being
taken

Committee  recommendations.

The  investment  community  in  India  got
a fillip as SEBI approved the draft Guidelines
for  real  estate  mutual  funds  (REMFs).  The
scheme  of  an  REMF  will  be  able  to  either
invest  directly  or  indirectly  in  real  estate
property. The REMF will be governed by the
provisions  and  guidelines  under  SEBI
(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations.  The  schemes
will  enable  various  classes  of  investors  to
indirectly  participate  in  the  real  estate  sector
in  India  by  providing  an  investment
opportunity.  The  schemes  will  be  initially
close-ended  where  the  units  of  REMF
schemes  shall  be  compulsorily  listed  on  the
stock exchanges and NAV of the scheme will
be declared daily.

Box 1.5: Future of the Regional Stock Exchanges: Post De-mutualisation

The basic intention of establishing the Regional Stock Exchanges (RSEs) was to enable regional
companies to raise capital and to spread the awareness about stock market investment amongst investors
across  the  country.  However,  with  emergence  of  competition  among  exchanges  aided  by  globalisation
and  technological  change,  the  survival  of  RSEs  was  threatened.  One  central  problem  with  the  RSEs
was  that  there  are  very  few  liquid  shares  traded  on  these  Exchanges.  With  the  extension  of  screen-
based  trading  network  of  NSE  and  BSE  across  the  country,  majority  of  the  RSEs  became  redundant.
Moreover,  with  a  view  to  enhancing  corporate  governance,  all  stock  exchanges  have  been  undergoing
the process of corporatisation and demutualisation.

Now,  with  most  of  the  RSEs  completing  the  process  of  corporatisation  and  demutualisation,  it
becomes  necessary  to  examine  their  role  and  relevance  in  the  changed  circumstances.  For  productive
utilization  of  the  available  infrastructure  of  these  RSEs  and  making  suitable  recommendations  about
their future, a Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri G. Anantharaman, Whole
Time Member, SEBI. The major recommendations of the Committee are:

 All the RSEs whose recognition has not been withdrawn, either voluntarily or compulsorily, must



collectively choose either the BSE model or the Inter-Connected Stock Exchange (ISE) model;
In case both of the above models are not successful for any reasons, there would be no merit in the
continuation  of  the  RSEs.  In  such  a  case  the  recognition  of  all  the  RSEs  will,  have  to  be
compulsorily  withdrawn.



 Once  the  RSEs  have  chosen  a  particular  model,  those  RSEs  which  are  unwilling  to  accept  that
model  will  have  to  face  compulsory  withdrawal  of  recognition  in  the  future  as  they  provide
neither a trading platform nor serve any public interest;
In  case  of  the  subsidiaries  of  the  RSEs  whose  recognition  is  not  withdrawn,  the  RSEs  should
preferably cease to have any shareholding in the subsidiary within a period of three years. However,
the RSEs may be allowed to retain less than 15 per cent of the shareholding in the spun off entity;
 Any  entity  other  than  exchange,  multilateral  agency,  insurance  company,  bank,  depository,  and
clearing corporation can be allowed to hold less than 15 per cent of the share capital and voting
rights  of  the  stock  exchange,  either  singly  or  collectively,  along  with  persons  acting  in  concert.
However, in case, a strategic partner is an exchange, a multilateral agency, an insurance company,
a bank, a depository, or a clearing corporation, it would be allowed to hold up to a maximum of
26 per cent of the share capital and voting rights of the stock exchange either singly or collectively,
along with persons acting in concert.

 Any strategic partner must comply with SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations,
2004. The holding by any foreign entity, including FIIs, would be subject to the overall policy of
the  Government  on  FDI.  These  recommendations  would  have  to  be  incorporated  suitably  in  the
divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI.

 Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate
exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, in case, a stock exchange
does  not  make  a  public  offer.  The  regulatory  conflicts,  which  are  likely  to  arise,  will  have  to  be
dealt  with  by  suitable  provisions  in  the  listing  agreement  of  the  stock  exchanges.  The  stock
exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in
clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has
been listed on the domestic exchange.
