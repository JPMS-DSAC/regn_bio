PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

The  Annual  Report  of  the  Securities  and
Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  for  2008-09
delineates the policies and programmes of SEBI
and  its  working  and  operations  during  the
financial  year  as  per  format  prescribed  by  the
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Annual
Report)  Rules,  1994.  During  the  year,  SEBI
continued to ensure its  commitment to fullfil its
three statutory objectives, namely: (a) protection
of  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities;
(b)  development  of  the  securities  market;  and
(c) regulation of the securities market.

In alignment with these objectives, this Report
provides  the  manner  in  which  SEBI  discharged
its responsibilities and exercised its powers during
the year in terms of: (a) the Securities and Exchange
Board  of  India  Act,  1992;  (b)  the  Securities
Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956;  (c)  the
Depositories Act, 1996; and (d) certain provisions
of  the  Companies  Act,  1956.    The  Report  also
provides a review of the developments in the Indian
securities market during 2008-09, in the context
of changing dynamics of market regulations.

Against  the  backdrop  of  increasing
integration  of  global  financial  markets,  SEBI
channelised its efforts to bring out regulations
to  make  the  systems  sufficiently  resilient  to
withstand  any  adverse  domestic  or  global
developments. SEBI in its attempt to strengthen
the existing regulatory framework, policies and
programmes,  introduced  new  guidelines  and
regulations  to  promote  orderly  growth  of
securities market while ensuring transparency,
efficiency, fairness, safety and integrity.

1. GENERAL  MACRO-ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT

Indian economy remained one of the fastest
growing  economies  in  the  world,  though  it
witnessed  moderation  in  growth  rate  during
2008-09.  According  to  revised  estimates  of
Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), real GDP
grew at 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 in comparison
to  9.0  per  cent  in  2007-08  (Table  1.1).  The
services sector continued to be the main driver
of  growth  in  India,  albeit  at  a  moderate  rate,

with  a  growth  of  9.4  per  cent  in  2008-09
compared to 10.8 per cent in 2007-08. Growth
in  the  industrial  sector  was  at  2.6  per  cent,
where  manufacturing  activities  recorded  a
growth of 2.4 per cent in 2008-09 compared to
8.2 per cent in 2007-08 (Table 1.2).  The growth
in agricultural sector decelerated to 1.6 per cent
in 2008-09 from 4.9 per cent in 2007-08. The
share  of  ‘agriculture  and  allied  activities’  in
overall  GDP  declined  from  17.8  per  cent  in
2007-08 to 17.0 per cent in 2008-09 (Chart 1.1).
However, the share of services sector rose from

62.9 per cent to 64.6 per cent while the share
of  industry  remained  stable  around  19.0  per
cent.  During the first two years of the Eleventh
Plan  period  (2007-12),  India’s  real  GDP  grew
at 7.9 per cent per annum (average) compared
to 7.8 per cent per annum (average) in the Tenth
Plan period (2002-07).

Major factors contributed to deceleration in
manufacturing  activities  were  subdued  exports,
decrease  in  domestic  demand  and  weak
investment  climate  due  to  global  financial

meltdown. A fall in growth rate for capital goods
indicated  moderation  in  industrial  activity.
Machinery  and  equipment  other  than  transport
equipment,  other  manufacturing  industries  and
beverages, tobacco and related products registered
acceleration  in  growth  in  2008-09.  Consumer
goods sector saw a minor decline in growth rate
because of slowdown in demand for non-durables
basket. Also, growth in intermediate goods, basic
goods  and  infrastructure  sector  remained
sluggish.  According  to  NCAER  business
expectations surveys, Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI)
Industrial  Outlook  Survey  and  other  surveys
conducted by various agencies, India’s industrial
sector is likely to give weak performance in the
initial quarters of 2009-10.

Services  sector  continued  to  remain  the
largest  contributor  to  overall  GDP,  where
community,  social  and  personal  services

recorded  modest  growth  rate.  Trade,  hotel,
transport  and  communication,  financing,
insurance, real estate and business services and
construction  sector  witnessed  deceleration  in
growth rate, while cargo handled at major ports,
passengers handled at airports, railway freight
traffic and arrival of foreign tourists registered
lower/negative growth.

As per the CSO data on India’s savings and
investments,  India’s  Gross  Domestic  Savings
(GDS)  as  proportion  of  GDP  at  market  prices
increased from 35.7 per cent in 2006-07 to 37.7
per cent in 2007-08 on account of improvement
in  the  saving  performance  by  the  household,
private and public sectors. Public sector savings
increased from 3.3 per cent in 2006-07 to 4.5 per
cent  in  2007-08  and  private  corporate  sector
savings also improved marginally from 8.3 per cent
in 2006-07 to 8.8 per cent in 2007-08 (Table 1.3).

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

Savings  of  household  sector  increased  by  0.26
percentage points to 24.4 per cent in 2007-08.
The Gross Domestic Capital Formation (overall
investment) at 39.0 per cent of GDP in 2006-07,
exceeded  GDS  by  1.40  percentage  points
reflecting net inflow of foreign savings.

‘Deposits’  continued  to  remain  a  major
component of financial assets of the households.
The share of deposits in total financial savings
increased to 56.5 per cent in 2007-08 from 55.3
per cent in 2006-07 (Chart 1.2). On the contrary,
households’  claims  on  Government  declined
from 5.3 per cent in 2005-06 to become negative
at 3.7 per cent in 2007-08.  There is a visible
shift  in  the  pattern  of  household  financial
savings moving from claims on Government to
deposits  due  to  better  returns  from  various
types  of  term  deposits  offered  by  banks  and
financial institutions.

During 2007-08, other major components
of  financial  savings  were  contractual  savings,
mainly  insurance  (17.5  per  cent),  followed  by
currency  (10.9  per  cent)  and  provident  and
pension  funds  (8.2  per  cent).  Investment  in
shares and debentures by the households as a
proportion  of  financial  savings  increased
significantly  from  6.6  per  cent  in  2006-07  to

10.5 per cent in 2007-08. Investment in shares
and debentures as proportion of GDP (at market
prices) improved from 1.2 per cent to 1.6 per
cent during the same period.

During  2008-09,  there  were  considerable
intra-year  changes  in  bank  credit  flow.    The
growth  in  non-food  bank  credit  (year-on-year
basis)  accelerated  in  the  first  half  reaching  a
peak    of  29.4  per  cent  in  October  2008  as
demand for bank credit increased in the wake
of reduced flow of funds from non-bank sources,
notably  the  capital  market    and  external
commercial  borrowings  and  higher  demand
from oil marketing companies due to steep rise
in oil prices.  Subsequently, it declined to 17.5
per cent by March 2009 in the wake of slowdown
in general demand conditions especially in the
industrial sector.  During the Second half, the
demand for credit  by oil marketing companies
also  moderated  and  working  capital
requirements  came  down  due  to  decline  in
commodity prices and drawdown of inventories
by  corporates.    According  to  disaggregated
provisional data released by the Reserve Bank,
the  year-on-year  growth  in  bank  credit  to
industry was similar to that in the previous year.
While credit flow to agriculture and real estate
was  significantly  higher,  it  was  lower  for

4

PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

housing.  As a result, industry’s share in total
credit flow increased in 2008-09.

The  liquidity  condition  remained  tight
during  July-October  2008-09  as  rising  bank
credit and higher forex demand from demand
from importers and oil companies increased on
account  of  a  rise  in  crude  oil  prices  besides
outflows by foreign institutional investors (FIIs).
The  thrust  of  the  various  policy  initiatives  by
the Reserve Bank has been on providing ample
rupee  liquidity,  ensuring  comfortable  forex
liquidity and maintaining a market environment
conducive  for  the  continued  flow  of  credit  to
productive  sectors.    Liquidity  condition
improved in later part of the year 2008-09 on
account  of  400  basis  points  reduction  in  the
cash  reserve  ration  (CRR),  100  basis  point
reduction in the statutory liquidity ration (SLR),
introduction  of  term  repo  facility,  special
refinance  facilities  for  banks  and  financial
institutions, unwinding of market stabilization
scheme (MSS), open market operations by the
Reserve  Bank  and  measures  relating  increase
forex liquidity through measures such as sale
of  foreign  exchange  (US  dollars)  and
introduction of a forex swap facility for banks.

Stock  prices  in  India  remained  subdued
during  2008-09  in  keeping  with  the  global
financial  markets.  Stock  prices  were  volatile,
particularly in the month of October 2008, when
global stock markets meltdown was at a peak.

With the intensification of global financial
turmoil  in  mid-September  2008,  domestic
financial markets came under stress as external
sources  of  credit  dried  up  and  liquidity
conditions  tightened  abruptly.    Corporates
withdrew  large  amount  from  mutual  funds  in
October-November  2008  and  mobilisation  of
funds  by  way  of  public  issue,  rights  issue,
private  placements  and  offerings  of  private
equities  was  also  subdued.    In  response,
monetary policy attempted to strike an optimal
balance  between  preserving  financial  stability,
maintaining price stability, anchoring inflation

expectations,  and  sustaining  the  growth
momentum. The Reserve Bank acted aggressively
on monetary policy accommodation, particularly
through  interest  rate  cuts  in  terms  of  both
magnitude  and  pace  and  augmented  both
domestic and foreign exchange liquidity through
a number of liquidity easing measures.

The measures taken since mid-September
2008  indeed  have  substantially  assuaged
liquidity  stress  in  domestic  financial  markets
arising from the contagion of adverse external
developments.  Since  October  2008,  interest
rates declined across the term structure in the
money  and  government  securities  markets.
While the secondary market yield on the 10-year
government security declined from 7.45 per cent
in October 2008 to touch an intra-year low of
5.11  per  cent  on  December  30,  2008,  it  then
increased in the wake of the enhanced market
borrowing  programme  of  the  Government,
reaching 7.08 per cent on March 30, 2009.

Inflation on a year-on-year basis, measured
by variation in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI),
was  0.3  per  cent  at  the  end  of  March  2009
compared to 7.8 per cent at the end of March
2008.  On  an  average  basis,  the  inflation  rate
was 8.4 per cent in 2008-09 compared to 4.6
per  cent  in  the  previous  year.  Prices  of
manufactured products (weight: 63.8 per cent
in WPI) rose by 1.4 per cent compared to 7.3
per cent a year ago.  Following the softening of
international  crude  oil  prices,  fuel  group
recorded  a  fall  of  6.1  per  cent  in  2008-09  as
against  a  rise  of  6.8  per  cent  in  the  previous
year.  The rise in prices was mainly attributed
to food articles.

India’s  import  bill  increased  significantly
during 2008-09 both on account of crude oil as
well as non-oil imports. As a result, trade deficit
too  widened  during  2008-09.    Bulk  of  trade
deficit was financed through net receipts under
invisibles,  particularly  through  remittances
from  the  Indian  migrant  workers  abroad.
India’s  foreign  exchange  reserves  declined  by

5

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

USD  57  billion  to  USD  252.3  billion  during
2008-09, on account of higher import cost and
also on account of liquidation of some foreign
portfolio investments. The inflow of funds from
foreign  direct  investment  and  external
commercial  borrowings  also  recorded  a  fall.
The  Rupee    depreciated  vis-à-vis  US  dollar
during  the  greater  part  of  2008-09  following
higher  demand  for  dollar  to  meet  importers’
need  and  moderate  outflow  of  portfolio
investments by FIIs.

2. REVIEW OF POLICIES AND

PROGRAMMES
SEBI  initiated  a  number  of  policies  and
programmes  during  2008-09  which  are
presented  in  this  Section  under  six  major
heads  viz.,  primary  securities  market,
secondary  securities  market,  corporate  debt
market,  mutual  funds,  foreign  institutional
investors, and investor assistance and education.
The  section  concludes  with  ‘retrospect  and
prospects’.

I.

Primary Securities Market

A developed primary market is crucial for
resource  mobilisation  by  corporates  to  meet
their  growth  and  expansion  plans.  Indian
primary  market  witnessed  high  activity  in
terms of resource mobilisation and number of
issues  during  2007-08,  but  the  same  pace
could  not  be  maintained  during  2008-09.  In
view of the meltdown in equity markets, fewer
companies  entered  the  primary  market  and
investors’  response  to  public  issues  in  2008-
09 was tepid compared to 2007-08. However,
the  ongoing  reforms  in  the  primary  market
helped 
investors’
confidence.  An  analysis  on  number  of  issues
made, amount mobilised, size and composition
of issues and industry-wise resource mobilised
is  presented  in  Part  Two  of  this  report.
Following  were  the  major  policy  initiatives
taken by SEBI relating to the primary market
during 2008-09:

in  maintaining 

the 

i. Applications  Supported  by  Blocked

Amount (ASBA)

SEBI  introduced  a  new  mode  of  payment
in public issues through book building wherein
the application money remains blocked in the
bank account of the applicant till allotment is
finalised.  The  said  process  named  ASBA  is
supplementary  to  the  existing  process  of
applying in public issues through cheque/draft.

ii. Eligibility  of  Shares  for  Promoters’

Contribution and Offer for Sale

SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines  provided  that  only
those  shares,  which  are  held  by  shareholders
for a period of at least one year at the time of
filing of draft offer document for a public issue
were  eligible  (i)  to  be  included  for  computing
promoters’ contribution (except in cases where
the shares have been issued at the same issue
price during the preceding one year) and (ii) to
be offered for sale. The shares issued pursuant
to  a  restructuring  exercise  approved  by  High
Court(s),  in  lieu  of  business  that  had  been  in
existence  for  a  period  of  more  than  one  year
prior  to  the  restructuring  exercise  were
excluded.  The  amendments  made  permitted
such shares as eligible shares for offer for sale
and for inclusion in the promoters’ contribution.

iii. Reduction in Timelines for Rights Issues

In order to mitigate  market risks faced by
issuers  and  investors  and  to  enable  listed
companies to raise funds from its shareholders
in a more time effective manner, SEBI reduced
the timelines in rights issues, starting from the
notice period for calling a board meeting to the
period  stipulated  for  completion  of  allotment
and  listing.  With  these  amendments  in  place
time taken for completion of rights issues would
reduce from 16 weeks to just about 6 weeks.

iv. Extension  of  Validity  Period  of  SEBI

Observations

The  validity  period  of  the  observations
letter issued by SEBI on draft offer documents

6

PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

filed for public/rights issues was increased from
three months to a period of twelve months. This
measure would give sufficient flexibility to issuer
to plan for launching an issue. Every issuer is
required to file an updated offer document with
SEBI and where updation includes significant
changes in the offer document, such an updated
Red  Herring  Prospectus/  Prospectus  or  Letter
of  Offer  shall  be  filed  with  SEBI  at  least  one
month before filing the same with Registrar of
Companies  (RoC)  or  with  Designated  Stock
Exchange as the case may be.

v. Announcement  of  Price  Band  before

Initial Public Offer Opens

The  provisions  in  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines
mandated disclosure of the floor price or price
band in an initial public offer through the book
building process in the Red Herring Prospectus
(RHP) filed with the RoC. Given that there is a
time lag of about two weeks between the filing
of the RHP with the RoC and issue opening date,
this exposed the price band disclosed in the RHP
to market conditions. In order to mitigate this,
issuers  making  an  initial  public  offer  were
permitted to announce the floor price or price
band at least two working days before the issue
opening  date  subject  to  fulfillment  of  certain
disclosure requirements.

vi. Strict  Enforcement  of  Rule  19(2)(b)  of
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)
Rules, 1957 (SC(R)R)

In  order  to  enable  an  unlisted  company
intending  to  list  its  shares  issued  to  the
shareholders of a listed company pursuant to a
scheme  of  arrangement  approved  by  a  High
Court,  without  making  an  initial  public  offer,
the  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines  were  amended  to
provide for relaxation from strict enforcement of
requirements of rule 19(2)(b) of SC(R)R in case of
proposal for listing of the following securities:

a) Equity shares with differential rights as to
dividend,  voting  or  otherwise,  offered
through rights or bonus issue.

b) Warrants issued along with Non Convertible
Debentures through Qualified Institutions
Placement.

vii. Pricing  of  Shares  for  Preferential
Allotment  to  Qualified  Institutional
Buyers (QIBs)

In  order  to  facilitate  eligible  listed
companies  to  raise  funds  from  Qualified
Institutional  Buyers  (QIBs)  without  going
through the elaborate documentation process,
it was prescribed that preferential allotment of
shares to QIBs shall be priced at the last two
weeks’  average  price.  This  is  subject  to  the
condition  that  the  number  of  QIB  allottees  in
such preferential allotment does not exceed five.
For  all  other  preferential  allotments  including
those  to  QIBs  exceeding  five  in  number,  the
existing  formula  of  the  higher  of  six  months’
average price or two weeks’ average price would
continue to apply.

viii. Lock-in of Shares issued against Exercise
of Warrants Issued on Preferential Basis

As per the guidelines on preferential issues,
warrants  issued  on  preferential  basis  were
subjected to lock-in for a period of one year or
three  years,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  lock-in
period  of  shares  allotted  on  exercise  of  such
warrants  was  adjusted  to  the  extent  of  such
period  for  which  these  warrants  had  already
been locked-in. It was clarified that the shares
so  allotted  pursuant  to  exercise  of  warrants
would be subject to lock-in period of one year
or  three  years,  as  the  case  may  be,  from  the
‘date of allotment’ of such shares.

ix. Enhancement of Upfront Margin Payment
on  Allotment  of  Warrants  Issued  on
Preferential Basis

In  terms  of  the  guidelines  on  preferential
issues,  warrants  could  be  allotted  on
preferential basis, subject to the allottees paying
upfront  amount  equivalent  to  at  least  10  per
cent of the price fixed. It was decided to enhance

7

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

the upfront amount so payable from 10 per cent
to 25 per cent of the price fixed.

xii. Issuance of Non-convertible Debentures

with Warrants through QIP

x. Non-applicability of Certain Provisions of

Preferential Issue Guidelines

The guidelines on preferential issues were
amended  to  provide  that  an  issuer,  which  has
been  granted  relaxation  by  SEBI  in  terms  of
regulation  29A  of  the  SEBI  (Substantial
Acquisitions  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)
Regulations,  1997,  shall  be  exempted  from
certain  provisions  of  preferential  issue
guidelines, i.e., pricing, certificate from statutory
auditors etc, subject to the condition that in the
explanatory  statement  to  the  notice  for  the
general meeting of the shareholders, issuer gives
adequate disclosures about the details of the plan
including the process proposed to be followed by
it for identification of the allottees in addition to
the disclosures required in other applicable laws.

xi. Eligibility 

for  Making  Qualified

Institutions Placement (QIP)

Presently,  the  eligibility  criteria  for  listed
companies  desirous  of  making  QIP  include  a
condition that the equity shares of the same class
of  the  companies  had  been  listed  on  a  stock
exchange  having  nation-wide  terminals,  for  a
period  of  at  least  one  year  as  on  the  date  of
issuance of notice to shareholders for considering
the  QIP.  This  precluded  the  companies,  which
were  listed  during  the  preceding  one  year
pursuant to the High Court approved scheme(s)
or  merger/de-merger/arrangement  entered  into
by such companies with companies which were
listed  for  more  than  one  year  in  such  stock
exchange(s), from using the QIP route for raising
funds.  In  order  to  enable  such  companies  to
raise  funds  through  QIP  route,  it  was  decided
that for the purpose of fulfillment of the above
mentioned eligibility criterion, such companies
may take into account the listing history of the
listed companies with which they have entered
into  the  approved  scheme(s)  of  merger/de-
merger/arrangement.

The  guidelines  for  QIP  were  amended  to
enable  a  listed  company  to  make  a  combined
offering  of  Non-Convertible  Debentures  (NCD)
with  warrants  to  Qualified  Institutional  Buyers
(QIB).  Under  this,  QIB  can  subscribe  to  the
combined  offering  of  NCD  with  warrants  or  to
the  individual  instruments,  i.e.,  either  NCD  or
warrants, where separate books are run for NCD/
warrants. The company is, however, required to
obtain  relaxation  from  the  applicability  of  the
provisions of Rule 19(2)(b), read with Rule 19(4)
of the SC(R)R for listing/ trading of the warrants.

xiii. Reduction in Timelines for Completion

of Bonus Issues

In continuation of its policy for rationalising
the time required for completion of issues, SEBI
reduced  the  timeline  for  completion  of  bonus
issues.  Accordingly,  where  no  shareholders’
approval  is  required  as  per  the  Articles  of
Association of the issuer, the bonus issue shall be
completed  within  15  days  from  the  date  of
approval  by  the  board  of  directors.  Where
shareholders’  approval 
for
capitalisation  of  profits  or  reserves  as  per  the
Articles  of  Association  of  the  issuer,  the  bonus
issue  shall  be  completed  within  60  days  from
the date of meeting of board of directors wherein
bonus was announced subject to shareholders’
approval.

is  required 

xiv. Eligibility  of  Nominee  Directors  for

Employee Stock Option Scheme

The SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme
and  Employee  Share  Purchase  Scheme)
Guidelines, 1999 were amended to provide that
a  director,  nominated  by  an  institution  as  its
representative  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of  a
company,  is  eligible  to  participate  in  the
employee stock option scheme of the company,
if the contract / agreement entered into between
the nominating institution and the director so
appointed specifically provides for acceptance

8

PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

of  the  employee  stock  option  scheme  of  the
company by such director and a copy thereof is
filed with the company.

xv. Accounting  Treatment  for  Options
Granted  under  Graded  Vesting  in
Employee Stock Option Schemes

The SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme
and  Employee  Share  Purchase  Scheme)
Guidelines,  1999  were  amended  to  bring  the
accounting  treatment  prescribed  by  SEBI,  for
options  granted  under  graded  vesting  in  an
employee stock option scheme, in line with the
accounting  treatment  provided  by  Institute  of
Chartered Accountants of India in this regard.

xvi.  Provisions  Pertaining  to  Corporate

Governance

To  enhance  the  standards  of  corporate
governance for listed entities, amendments were
carried out in Clause 49 of the listing agreement
by  introducing  new  provisions  such  as
(i)  requirement  to  have  atleast  one-half  of  the
board  as  independent  directors,  if  the  non-
executive Chairman of the company is a promoter
or is related to promoters or persons occupying
management positions at the board level or at
one  level  below  the  board,  (ii)  specifying  the
minimum age limit of 21 years for independent
directors, (iii) specifying the maximum time gap
(i.e.,  180  days)  between  the  retirement  and
resignation  of  an  independent  director  and
appointment  of  another  independent  director
in  his  place,  and  (iv)  requiring  the  listed
companies to disclose the inter-se relationship
between  the  directors  in  the  filing  made  with
stock exchanges.

Companies  Act,  1956  shall  be  required  to
appoint  an  independent  merchant  banker  for
giving a ‘Fairness Opinion’ on the valuation done
by valuers. Further, the ‘Fairness Opinion’ of the
independent  merchant  banker  shall  be  made
available  to  the  shareholders  at  the  time  of
approving the resolution.

xviii. Amendments to Provisions Pertaining to
Submission  of  Quarterly  Financial
Reports  by  Listed  Companies  to  Stock
Exchanges

In order to bring more transparency in the
disclosures  of  the  financial  results,  SEBI
amended Clause 41 of the listing agreement by:

(cid:127) extending time limit for submission of
consolidated  financial  results,  from
one month to two months from the end
of the quarter;

(cid:127) requiring the company to publish only
consolidated financial results if it opts
to  submit  consolidated  financial
results  in  addition  to  its  standalone
financial results;

(cid:127) relaxing  the  requirement  to  place  the
limited  review  report  on  un-audited
financial  results  before  Board  or
Committee, only if the variation between
un-audited  financial  results  and  its
limited review exceeds 10 per cent; and

(cid:127) requiring  the  company  to  submit  the
limited review report for the last quarter
also,  if  it  opts  to  submit  un-audited
financial results for the last quarter.

xvii. ‘Fairness  Opinion’  of  Independent
Merchant  Banker  in  Schemes  of
Arrangement

In  order  to  safeguard  the  interest  of
shareholders, SEBI amended clause 24 of the
Listing  Agreement  to  provide  that  the  listed
company as well as the unlisted company which

xix. Disclosure  of  Pledged  Shares  by
Promoters/Promoter  Group  in  Listed
Companies

Clause  35  and  clause  41  of  the  Listing
Agreement  were  amended  to  provide  for
disclosure  of  details  of  shares  held  by
promoters and promoter group entities in listed

Box 1.1: Peer Review of Working Papers of Statutory Auditors of Listed Entities

Post  the  development  with  respect  to  Satyam
Computer Services Ltd., a need was felt to boost the
confidence  of  investors  in  the  financial  disclosures
made  by  listed  entities.The  SEBI  Committee  on
Disclosures  and  Accounting  Standards  (SCODA),  in
its meeting held on January 09, 2009, discussed the
matter and recommended a peer review of the working
papers of auditors in relation to financial statements
of  listed  entities.  The  SCODA  recommended  such  a
review in relation to the last quarterly results and the
last audited annual financial results. This may be in

respect of companies constituting the NSE – Nifty 50,
BSE  Sensex  and  some  listed  entities  (on  a  random
basis) outside the list of Nifty 50 and Sensex.

Accordingly, SEBI has short-listed a few audit firms
for the purpose and has initiated the process of peer
review of audit working papers of companies that are
constituents of Sensex/Nifty 50. This exercise, would
reveal the level of adequacy of working of auditors so
as  to  place  reliance  on  the  financial  statements
submitted by listed entities to the stock exchanges.

companies  which  are  pledged  or  otherwise
encumbered.  This  was  done  with  a  view  to
ensure  that  while  deciding  to  invest  in  the
company,  the  investors  may  factor  in  the
information  about  the  pledged  or  otherwise
encumbered shares held by promoter/promoter
group in the company, as the extent of pledge/
encumbrance may  have a significant impact on
the price of the shares .

II. Secondary Securities Market
i.

Short Selling and Securities and Lending
Borrowing Scheme (SLB)

The broad framework for short selling and
securities lending and borrowing scheme for all
market  participants  was  specified  by  SEBI  in
December  2007.  This  framework  was
operationalised with effect from April 21, 2008.

Pursuant  to  feedback  from  the  market
participants, the scheme for Securities Lending
and Borrowing was revised.  Key modifications
made  to  SLB  were:  (i)  increasing  the  tenure
of  SLB,  (ii)  extending  the  duration  of  SLB
session  (iii)  allowing  margins  in  SLB  to  be
taken in the form of cash and cash equivalents
and  (iv)  clarifying  how  to  deal  with  corporate
actions.

ii. Margining of Institutional Trades in the

Cash Market

With a view to bring about a level playing field
in  the  cash  market  among  all  categories  of

investors and to strengthen the risk management
framework, margining for institutional trades was
made mandatory by SEBI w.e.f., April 21, 2008.
Margins  were  collected  from  institutional
investors on a T+1 basis. Institutional investors
were permitted to maintain their entire margin in
the form of approved securities. Further, members
were allowed to make early pay-in of funds and
to  adjust  pay-in  obligations  from  the  cash
component of liquid assets deposited by them.

iii. Exit Option to Regional Stock Exchange

Broad guidelines were specified by SEBI to
provide  an  exit  option  to  Regional  Stock
Exchanges  (RSEs)  whose  recognition  was
withdrawn  and/or  renewal  of  recognition  was
refused by SEBI or for RSEs who would want
to surrender their recognition.

iv.

Introduction of DMA

With a view to increase liquidity, bring about
greater transparency, lower impact cost for large
orders and reduce risk of error associated with
manual  execution  of  client  orders,  the  facility
of  Direct  Market  Access  (DMA)  was  introduced
(Box 1.2).  This  facility  allows  brokers  to  offer
its clients direct access to the exchange trading
system  through  the  broker’s  infrastructure
without manual intervention by the broker.

The  DMA  framework  places  onus  on  the
broker to do proper risk assessment of clients
before  providing  DMA  facility  and  broker  is
responsible  for  risk  management,  setting

Box 1.2: Direct Market Access

Direct  Market  Access  (DMA)  is  a  facility  which
allows  brokers  to  offer  clients  direct  access  to  the
exchange  trading  system  through  the  broker’s
infrastructure  without  manual  intervention  by  the
broker.  Some  of  the  advantages  offered  by  DMA  are
direct control of clients over orders, faster execution
of client orders, reduced risk of errors associated with
manual  order  entry,  greater  transparency,  increased
liquidity,  lower  impact  costs  for  large  orders,  better
audit  trails  and  better  use  of  hedging  and  arbitrage
opportunities  through  the  use  of  decision  support
tools / algorithms for trading.

As per IOSCO definition, Direct Electronic Access
(DEA)  refers  to  the  process  by  which  a  person
transmits orders on his own (i.e. without handling or
re-entry by another person) directly into the market’s
trade  matching  system  for  execution.  DEA  falls  into
two  key  categories:  intermediated  and  non-
intermediated.

Intermediated DEA refers to:

● Customers being given direct access to the market
through  a  registered  intermediary’s  system/
infrastructure, i.e., automated “order routing;” or

● Customers of an intermediary being given direct
access to the market without going through the
intermediary’s  system/infrastructure,  i.e.,
“sponsored”  access.

In  either  case,  however,  the  order  is  sent  to  the
market  as  the  intermediary’s  order,  i.e.,  using  the
intermediary’s trading ID. The intermediary therefore
retains full responsibility for the order.

Non-intermediated  direct  access  generally  refers
to  markets  providing  direct  access  to  non-
intermediaries  (i.e.,  parties  other  than  registered
brokerage  firms),  as  market  members  and  in  that
capacity  connecting  directly  to  the  market,  without
going  through  an  intermediary.  This  type  of  DEA  is
referred  as  direct  access  by  non-registrant/non-
intermediary  market-members.

In  India,  the  High  Powered  Expert  Committee  on
Making  Mumbai  an  International  Finance  Centre

(MIFC)  talked  about  the  potential  of  DMA  and
algorithmic trading to achieve a role in international
finance  here.  Algorithmic  trading  or  programme
trading refers to orders that are automatically placed
in  the  market  by  software  programmes,  built  on
certain  mathematical  models.  Simply  put,  in
algorithmic trading, the software is programmed in a
manner to detect arbitrage opportunities between the
cash  and  the  futures  market  and  place  orders  on
exchanges in real time through DMA. Thus, DMA helps
in reducing “high latency“ or loss of time and enhances
the profit making potential of programme traders and
arbitragers.

SEBI allowed intermediated DMA in India whereby
customers  can  access  the  market  directly  through  a
registered  broker’s  system/infrastructure.  Brokers
interested  to  offer  DMA  facility  shall  apply  to  the
respective stock exchanges ensuring that software and
systems are in place that support direct access. SEBI
asked  stock  exchanges  to  facilitate  direct  market
access to institutional investors.

The  brokers  shall  be  fully  responsible  and  liable
for all orders emanating through their DMA systems.
They shall specifically authorize clients for providing
DMA  facility  after  fulfilling  Know-Your- Client
requirements and carrying out due diligence regarding
clients’  credit  worthiness,  risk  taking  ability,  track
record  of  compliance  and  financial  soundness.
Brokers shall ensure that only those clients who are
deemed  fit  and  proper  for  this  facility  are  allowed
access  to  the  DMA  facility.  Brokers  shall  maintain
proper records of such due diligence. Brokers using
DMA  facility  for  routing  client  orders  shall  not  be
allowed to cross trades of their clients with each other.
All orders must be offered to the market for matching.

The  facility  was  initially  provided  to
institutional  investors.  It  was  clarified  that
Institutional  investors  may  use  DMA  facility
through  investment  managers  after  due
authorisation  and  upon  furnishing  to  the

broker/exchange 
suitable  agreements/
undertakings  between  the  institution  and
investment manager stating, inter alia, that the
institutional  investor  shall  be  responsible  for

v. Mandatory Requirement of PAN

vi. Policy Initiatives for Derivatives

The Central government has exempted the
persons resident in Sikkim from Direct Income
taxes. In view of this, SEBI exempted investors
residing  in  the  state  of  Sikkim  from  the
mandatory  requirement  of  PAN  for  their
investments in mutual funds.

In view of Rule 114 C (1) (c) of Income Tax
Rules, requirement of PAN was also relaxed in
the  case  of  securities  market  transactions
undertaken  on  behalf  of  Central  and  State
Governments and by the officials appointed by
the Courts e.g., official liquidator, court receiver
etc. (under the category of Government).

a) Exchange Traded Currency Derivatives:
Based  on  the  recommendation  of  RBI-
SEBI Standing Technical Committee on
Exchange-Traded  Currency  Futures,
SEBI  laid  down  the  framework  for  the
launch  of  Exchange-traded  Currency
Futures in respect of eligibility norms for
existing  and  new  Exchanges  and  their
Clearing Corporations/Houses, eligibility
criteria for members of such Exchanges/
Clearing Corporations/Houses, product
design,  risk  management  measures,
surveillance  mechanism  and  other
related issues (Box 1.3).

Box 1.3:  Currency Futures

In  1944,  Bretton  Woods  Agreements  (popularly
known as the Bretton Woods system) introduced a gold
standard system that transformed the US dollar into
an  international  reserve  currency,  the  only  one
convertible to gold. The chief features of the Bretton
Woods system were an obligation for each country to
adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange
rate of its currency within, a fixed value plus or minus
one  per  cent,  in  terms  of  gold  and  the  ability  of  the
IMF  to  bridge  temporary  imbalances  of  payments.
Following  this  development,  US  dollar  became  the
international  unit  of  account,  to  the  great  economic
and political advantage of the United States. In 1958
, the European Monetary Agreement (EMA) authorised
the  partial  or  total  convertibility  of  European
currencies.  Under  EMA,  the  central  banks  of  the
signatory  countries  undertook  to  exchange  their
currency  for  dollars  at  rates  set  below  the  limits
imposed by the IMF. Speculation in the dollar exchange
market  began  in  the  spring  of  1971  and  intensified
during the year following the US balance of payments
crisis  during  1958-68.  The  crisis  reached  its  nadir
when  US  President  Richard  Nixon  declared  closure
of the Bretton Woods Agreement on March 16, 1973,
paving  the  return  for  floating  exchange  rate  system
and convertibility of currencies.

In 1972, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, responding
to  the  then  freely  floating  international  currencies,
created  International  Monetary  Market  that  allowed
trading in currency futures for the purpose of hedging
against exchange rate fluctuations. These were the first
futures contracts that were not on physical commodities.

In  the  context  of  liberalisation  of  the  capital
accounts  in  India  and  an  effort  to  continue

development of financial markets, it was felt that wider
hedging opportunities could enhance the flexibility for
the  stakeholders  to  manage  their  currency  risk
dynamically.  International  experiences  established
that  exchange  traded  currency  futures  contracts
facilitate efficient price discovery, enable counterparty
credit risk management, wider participation, trading
of  standardized  products,  reduce  transaction  costs,
etc.  Accordingly,  as  part  of  further  developing  the
derivatives market in India and adding to the existing
options of foreign exchange hedging tools available to
the residents, it was decided to introduce trading in
currency futures in recognized stock exchanges or new
exchanges recognised by the Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) in the country.

A  RBI-SEBI  Standing  Technical  Committee  was
constituted 
to  evolve  norms  and  oversee
implementation  of  Exchange  Traded  Currency  and
Interest Rate Derivatives. To begin with, the Committee
looked at Exchange Traded Currency Derivatives and
submitted a report on May 29, 2008 which laid down
the  framework  for  the  launch  of  Exchange  Traded
Currency  Futures  in  terms  of  eligibility  norms  for
existing  and  new  exchanges  and  their  clearing
corporations/houses,  eligibility  criteria  for  members
of  such  exchanges/clearing  corporations/houses,
product  design,  risk  management  measures,
surveillance mechanism and other related issues.

Only  ‘persons  resident  in  India’  were  allowed  to
purchase or sell currency futures to hedge an exposure
to  foreign  exchange  rate  risk  or  otherwise.  It  was
decided that standardized currency futures shall have
the following features to start with:

SEBI granted approval to National Stock Exchange
of  India  Ltd.  (NSE),  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  Ltd.

(BSE)  and  MCX  Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  (MCX-SX)  for
operationalising  the  exchange  traded  currency
derivatives  segment.  Further,  SEBI  granted  in-
principle approval to United Stock Exchange Ltd. for
operationalising  the  same.  NSE  commenced  trading
on  August  29,  2008,  BSE  commenced  trading  on
October  01,  2008  and  MCX-SX  commenced  trading
on October 06, 2008.

Daily turnover in terms of number of contracts and
value  in  currency  futures  market  at  NSE  and  MCX-
SX  separately,  grew  from  an  average  of  2  lakh
contracts  with  an  average  value  of  Rs.  1,000  crore
since November 2008 to an average of 5 lakh contracts
with  an  average  value  of  Rs.  2,000  crore  till  March
2009.  In  view  of  the  encouraging  response  from
market  participants  towards  trading  in  Exchange-
Traded  Currency  Futures,  the  initial  position  limits
were  reviewed  by  the  RBI-SEBI  Standing  Technical
Committee  and  based  on  its  recommendations,  the
client  level  and  non-banking  trading  member  level
position  limits  for  exchange  traded  currency
derivatives were modified as under:

● Client level: The gross open position of a client
across all contracts would not exceed 6 per cent
of  the  total  open  interest  or  USD  10  million,
whichever is higher, instead of 6 per cent of total
open  interest  or  USD  5  million,  as  prescribed
earlier.

● Non-bank  Trading  Member  Level:  The  gross
open  position  of  a  Trading  Member,  who  was
not  a  bank,  across  all  contracts  would  not
exceed 15 per cent of the total open interest or
USD 50 million, whichever is higher, instead of
15  per  cent  of  the  total  open  interest  or  USD
25 million, as prescribed earlier.

It was further clarified that the position limits would
be  specific  to  an  exchange  and  not  to  the  Exchange-
Traded Currency Futures Derivatives market as a whole.

b) Extending 

Calendar 

Spread
Treatment  till  Expiry  of  the  Near
Month  Contract:  SEBI  extended  the
benefit of calendar spread treatment till
the  expiry  of  the  near  month  contract
to avoid sudden rise in margins without
any corresponding increase in the risk
of the spread position. The margin on
calendar spread remains unchanged at
a flat rate of 0.5 per cent per month of
spread  on  the  far  month  contract
subject to a minimum margin of 1 per
cent  and  a  maximum  margin  of  3  per
cent on the far side of the spread with
legs upto one year apart.

c) Eligibility  Criteria  for  Permitting
Derivatives on Shares: With a view to
rationalise  the  eligibility  criteria  for
permitting derivatives on shares, SEBI
specified  that  the  exchanges  may
introduce derivatives on shares fulfilling
the following criteria irrespective of their
date of listing and/ or size of issue.

(cid:127) The  stock  shall  be  chosen  from
amongst  the  top  500  stocks  in
terms  of  average  daily  market
capitalisation  and  average  daily
traded  value  in  the  previous  six
months on a rolling basis.

(cid:127) The stock’s median quarter-sigma
order size over the last six months
shall be not less than Rs. 1 lakh.

(cid:127) The market wide position limit in the
stock  shall  not  be  less  than  Rs.  50
crore.

d) Revised  Exposure  Margin  for
Exchange-Traded Equity Derivatives:
SEBI modified the exposure margin to
be  the  higher  of  10  per  cent  or  1.5
times the standard deviation (of daily
logarithmic returns of the stock price)
of the notional value of the gross open
position  in  single  stock  futures  and

14

gross  short  open  position  in  stock
options  from  the  earlier  prescribed
limit of the higher of 5 per cent or 1.5
times the standard deviation.

e)

Issuance  of  Electronic  Contract
Notes  (ECNs)  in  Equity  Derivatives
Segment: SEBI extended the facility of
issuance  of  ECNs  as  a  legal  document
using Straight Through Processing (STP)
to the equity derivatives segment.

Equity 

f) Cross  Margining  across  Exchange-
Traded Equity (Cash) and Exchange-
Traded 
Derivatives
(Derivatives)  Segments:  In  order  to
improve  the  use  of  capital  by  market
participants, SEBI extended the facility
of  cross  margining  across  cash  and
derivatives  segments  to  all  categories
of market participants. To begin with,
a spread margin of 25 per cent of the
total applicable margin on the eligible
off-setting  positions  is  levied  in  the
respective cash and derivatives segment.

In  the  first  phase  introduced  in  May
2008, cross margin benefit to the extent
of  VaR  margin  was  provided  for
institutional  investors  on  cash  market
positions  having  off  setting  futures
positions.  In  the  second  phase,
introduced  in  December  2008,  this
facility  was  extended  to  all  market
participants  for  offsetting  positions  in
cash and derivatives market.

g) Exchange -Traded  Interest  Rate
Derivatives:  A  RBI-SEBI  Standing
Technical Committee was constituted to
lay  down  the  operational  and  risk
management norms for three products
i.e., 91-day Treasury Bill Futures, Short
Term Interest Rate Future based on an
Index of actual call rates and Notional
Coupon  Bearing  10  Year  Long  Bond
Futures.

h) Revised  Position  Limits  in  the
Exchange -Traded 
Currency
Derivatives  Segment:  Based  on  the
feedback  received  from  the  market
participants, the client level and non-
bank  trading  member  level  position
limits  for  Exchange  Traded  Currency
Derivatives were modified. Accordingly,
SEBI  specified  that  the  gross  open
position of a client across all contracts
shall not exceed 6 per cent of the total
open  interest  or  USD  10  million,
whichever  is  higher,  instead  of  6  per
cent of the total open interest or USD
5 million, prescribed earlier. Further,
the  gross  open  position  of  a  Trading
Member, who is not a bank, across all
contracts shall not exceed 15 per cent
of  the  total  open  interest  or  USD  50
million whichever is higher, instead of
15 per cent of the total open interest
or USD 25 million, prescribed earlier.
The position limits were made specific
to an exchange and not to the Exchange-
Traded Currency Derivatives market as
a whole, as prescribed earlier.

stock exchange.

b) Any  shareholder,  other  than  the
aforesaid  six  categories  of  investors,
may hold either directly or indirectly,
not more than 5 per cent of the paid-
up equity share capital of a recognised
stock exchange.

c) No person shall, directly or indirectly,
either  individually  or  together  with
persons  acting  in  concert  with  him,
acquire and/or hold more than five per
cent of the paid up equity capital of a
recognised stock exchange, unless he
is  a  fit  and  proper  person  and  has
taken prior approval of the Board for
doing so.

d)

In  respect  of  exchanges  that  are  not
listed, FIIs may purchase shares of such
exchanges through transactions outside
of  the  exchange  provided  it  is  not  an
initial allotment. However, if the exchange
is listed, transactions by FIIs should be
done through the exchange platform.

Box 1.4: Role of Credit Rating Agencies

Credit rating of issues is a mechanism whereby an
independent third party makes an assessment, about
the  likelihood  of  a  default  in  the  debt  issued  by  a
corporate  issuer.  It  focuses  on  the  specific  debt
instrument  and  not  on  the  overall  credit  worthiness
or  financial  standing  of  the  issuer.  It  takes  into
consideration  various  credit  enhancement  tools  like
guarantees, sinking fund, letters of credit or any other
mechanism  devised  to  reduce  the  default  risk  on
specific  issues.  Thus,  a  corporate  issuer  may  have
different  grades  of  rating  for  different  debt  issues.
These  ratings  are  expressed  in  alpha-  numeral
symbols, indicating the degree of certainty regarding
punctual  payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  the
rated debt instrument.  Once a rating is assigned, the
rating agency monitors the rating throughout the life
of the rated instrument. As part of its surveillance, a
rating  agency  may  publish  a  ‘rating  alert’  to  inform
the market of developments which may impact on the
status of the rated instrument e.g a proposed merger
or  a  take-over,  changes  in  government  policies,
economic environment and the like . On analysis of
the  developments,  the  rating  is  either  revised  or
reaffirmed.  The  surveillance  mechanism  is  a  useful
device to indicate the current quality of a rated debt
instrument  and  allows  investors  the  opportunity,  if
they so wish, to realign their investment portfolio.

The  origin  of  credit  rating  can  be  traced  back  to
1900 to USA. Privately owned railroad companies were
the  dominant  issuers  of  corporate  instruments  that
time. These instruments were purchased either on the
basis of advice of friends/brokers or based on ‘name’
recognition. A statistician in a private bank, Mr. John
Moody,  the  founder  of  Moody’s  Investor  Services,
capitalized  on  the  need  for  a  database  which  would
provide potential investor with relevant information on
industrial companies. Therefore, in 1900 he published
‘Moody’s  Manual  of  Industrial  and  Miscellaneous
Securities’.  Its  success  led  to  the  introduction  of
‘Moody’s  Weekly  Review  of  Financial  Conditions  in
1909’  where  among  others,  rating  of  railroad  bonds
was  also  started.  All  these  developments  led  to  the
formation  of  the  world’s  first  credit  rating  agency
‘Moody’s  Investor  Services’  in  1914.  As  per  available
information from various websites, there are 67 CRAs
(credit rating agencies) around the World as on today.

The history of credit rating in India can be traced
to  1987  with  the  setting  up  of  CRISIL.    At  present,
there are five registered credit rating agencies in India
viz.,  CARE,  ICRA,  FITCH,  CRISIL  and  BRICKWORK
Ratings India Pvt. Ltd. SEBI has defined CRAs under
SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 and
prescribed a code of conduct for them.

CRAs  play  an  important  role  in  helping  market
participants  incorporate  into  their  decision-making
voluminous,  diverse  and  highly  complicated
information about a particular investment. Regulators,
market  participants  and  CRAs  themselves  have  an
interest  in  ensuring  that  CRAs  carry  out  this  role.
Broadly, key issues pertaining to CRAs fall under four
categories:

— The quality and integrity of the rating process;

— CRA independence and conflicts of interest;

— The  transparency  and  timeliness  of  ratings

disclosure; and

— CRA use of confidential information.

Although these issues focus on the activities of the
CRAs, creating a market environment in which CRAs
can  most  effectively  offer  informed,  independent
analyses  and  opinions  do  not  depend  exclusively  on
CRAs  themselves.  Other  market  participants  and
particularly  issuers    are  important  partners  in  this
process.

The  role  of  CRAs  is  important  from  investor  as
well as issuer point of view. The IOSCO Report on the
Activities  of  Credit  Rating  Agencies  notes  that  these
assess  the  credit  risk  of  corporate  and  government
borrowers  and  issuers  of  fixed-income  securities  by
analyzing relevant information available regarding the
issuer  or  borrower,  its  market,  and  its  economic
circumstances. A rating is an analysis of the capability
and  willingness  of  the  issuer  to  meet  the  financial
commitments. The issuer can be a company, corporate
or  a  country.  CRAs  assist  investors  in  monitoring
portfolios  by  providing  idea/opinions  about  the
companies. They also act as benchmark for risk. Apart
from  providing  investors  an  idea  about  the  issuers,
credit ratings are also helpful for the issuers:

a) by supporting disclosure and transparency,

b) by facilitating a comparison amongst peers, and

c) by enhancing access to sources of funds.

Rating  agencies  are  paid  by  the  issuers  but  as
discussed  above,  the  ratings  are  designed  to  assist
investors assess the issuer’s creditworthiness. CRAs
continuously  monitor  their  ratings  to  preserve  the
value  of  their  ratings  in  the  market  and  to  maintain
their  reputations.

The  role  of  credit  rating  has  grown  because  of
expansion in issuance volume and increasing faith of

(.... Concld.)
investors as well as regulators in ratings. Because of
the capability of the rating agencies to evaluate a broad
range of securities, world-wide credit ratings are used
as  a  criterion  for  assessing  the  quality  of  issues  for
investors. CRAs undertake an elaborate study of the
issuing  companies/  governments  and  accord  ratings
depending  on  their  assessment  of  the  issuing
company’s  ability  to  honour  the  debt  obligation.
Ratings have far reaching consequences for the issuers
as  well  as  the  investors.  CRAs  contribute  to  the
achievement  of  the  regulatory  objectives  of  investor
protection,  fair  and  transparent  markets  and
reduction of systemic risk.

The poor performance of these agencies, especially in
the context of the East Asian financial crises and the sudden
collapse of Enron, has brought renewed criticism of their
methods, their regulatory status and their role in financial
markets. Following recent sub-prime crisis, there is a world
wide demand for tightening regulations for CRAs. Though
the recent crisis has not impacted India as much as it did
others, there is a need to learn from their experiences.

IV. Mutual Funds

SEBI has taken the following initiatives to

improve the functioning of mutual funds:

i. Overseas Investments by Mutual Fund

In  consultation  with  Government  of  India
and  RBI,  the  aggregate  ceiling  for  overseas
investments  was  raised  from  USD  5  billion  to
USD 7 billion.

ii. Notification on Real Estate Mutual Fund

Schemes

The  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,
1996 were modified to provide a framework for
real  estate  mutual  funds.  The  salient
modifications are:

a) For considering eligibility to set up new
Mutual  Funds  for  launching  only  real
estate  mutual  fund  schemes,  besides
fulfilling  all  other  eligibility  criteria
applicable  for  sponsoring  a  Mutual
Fund,  sponsors  shall  be  carrying  on
business in real estate for a period not
less than five years.

b) An existing mutual fund may launch a
real estate mutual fund scheme if it has
an adequate number of key personnel
and  directors  having  adequate
experience in real estate.

c) Every real estate mutual fund scheme
shall be close-ended and its units shall

be  listed  on  a  recognised  stock
exchange.

d) Every  real  estate  mutual  fund  shall
invest at least thirty five per cent of the
net assets of the scheme directly in real
estate assets.

e) The  AMC,  its  directors,  the  trustees
and the real estate valuer shall ensure
that the valuations of assets held by a
real  estate  mutual  fund  scheme  are
done in good faith in accordance with
the norms specified.

iii. Simplification  of  Offer  Document  and

Key Information Memorandum

The Offer Document and Key Information
Memorandum  of  Mutual  Funds  schemes  were
simplified to make them more reader friendly.
The  Offer  Document  was  split  into  two  parts
i.e., Statement of Additional Information (SAI)
and Scheme Information Document (SID) w.e.f.,
June  1,  2008.  All  statutory  information  on
mutual fund is incorporated with SAI which is
available on website of respective mutual funds.

iv. Net Settlement of Government Securities

Transactions by Mutual Funds

To  place  mutual  funds  at  par  with  other
participants  in  the  government  securities
market, mutual fund schemes were permitted
to sell government securities already contracted
for purchase without waiting for actual delivery

18

PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

of government securities in accordance with the
guidelines issued by RBI.

v.

Parking of Funds in Short Term Deposits
of Scheduled Commercial Banks

It  was  clarified  that  earlier  guidelines  for
parking  of  funds  in  short-term  deposits  of
scheduled  commercial  banks,  pending
deployment,  shall  not  apply  to  term  deposits
placed  as  margins  for  trading  in  cash  and
derivatives  market.  However,  disclosures
regarding all term deposits placed as margins
are required to be made in half-yearly portfolio
statements.

vi. Abridged  Scheme-wise  Annual  Report
Format  and  Periodic  Disclosures  to  the
Unitholders

In  order  to  ensure  uniformity  in  the
contents of abridged scheme-wise Annual Report
prepared  by  mutual  funds,  a  new  format  was
prescribed. It was also decided that the abridged
scheme-wise  Annual  Report  be  mailed  to  the
investors’ e-mail addresses, if so mandated, and
also displayed on the website of the mutual fund.

A  separate  category  of  “Securitized  Debt
Instruments”  was  introduced  in  the  Half-  Yearly
Portfolio  Disclosure  format  under  debt
instruments.

Further, time period for mailing of scheme-
wise  Annual  Report  or  an  abridged  summary
thereof to unitholders and Annual report to the
Board,  was  reduced  to  “four  months”  from  “six
months”.

vii. Valuation  of  Debt  Securities  by  Mutual

Fund

The discretion of -50 basis points (bps) to
+100 bps given to fund managers to value debt
securities was found inadequate in the market
scenario in October, 2008. With a view to ensure
that the value of debt securities reflects the true
fundamentals  the  discretion  was  modified  as
under:

Category

Basis Points (bps)

Rated instruments with
duration upto 2 years

Rated instruments with
duration over 2 years

Unrated instruments with
duration upto 2 years

Unrated instruments with
duration over 2 years

+

500

400

-

 150

100

Discretionary discount of upto
+450  bps  over  and  above
mandatory discount of +50 bps

Discretionary discount of upto
+375  bps  over  and  above
mandatory discount of +25 bps

viii. Applicability  of  Net  Asset  Value  (NAV)
for Income/ Debt oriented Mutual Fund
Scheme(s)/Plan(s)
To harmonize the NAV applicability with the
realisation  of  money  and  to  move  away  from
the NAV based on the application date, it was
prescribed that in respect of purchase of units
in Income/ Debt oriented schemes (other than
liquid  fund  schemes  and  plans)  with  amount
equal to or more than Rs. 1 crore, irrespective
of the time of receipt of application, the closing
NAV of the day on which the funds are available
for utilisation shall be applicable.

ix. Review  of  Provisions  Relating  to  Close-

ended Schemes
With  a  view  to  further  strengthen  the
framework for close-ended schemes, launched
on or after December 12, 2008 (except Equity
Linked Savings Schemes), listing of units along
with  daily  computation  of  NAV  and  its
publication  was  made  mandatory.  It  was  also
mandated that a close-ended debt scheme shall
invest only in such securities which mature on
or before the date of the maturity of the scheme.

x. Portfolio of “Liquid Schemes”

In order to reduce the tenure of the securities
held in the portfolio of liquid schemes from the
requirement of one year, it was stipulated that:

a) With  effect  from  February  01,  2009,
liquid  fund  schemes  and  plans  shall

19

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

make  investment  in  /  purchase  debt
and  money  market  securities  with
maturity of upto 182 days only.

b) With effect from May 01, 2009, liquid
fund  schemes  and  plans  shall  make
investment  in/purchase  debt  and
money market securities with maturity
of upto  91 days only.

xi.

Indicative Portfolios and Yields in Mutual
Fund Schemes
There  was  a  practice  of  mutual  funds
offering  indicative  portfolios  and  indicative
yields in their debt/fixed income products. Since
such practice has potential to mislead investors,
it was decided that no mutual fund should offer
any indicative portfolio and indicative yield. No
communication  regarding  the  same  in  any
manner  whatsoever  be  issued  by  any  mutual
fund or distributors of its products.

xii. Disclosure of Portfolio by Debt Oriented
Close-ended and Interval Schemes/Plans
In order to enhance the transparency of the
portfolios  of  debt  oriented  close-ended  and
interval  schemes/plans,  it  was  decided  that
AMCs  shall  disclose  the  portfolio  of  such
schemes in the format prescribed by SEBI, on
a monthly basis on their respective websites.

V.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)

During 2008-09, SEBI took various initiatives
addressing issues relating to registration of FIIs
and  sub-accounts,  the  issuance  of  P-Notes/ODIs
by FIIs/Sub-accounts and the lending/borrowing
activity undertaken by FIIs abroad. The important
measures are detailed below:

i. Restriction  and  Relaxation  on  Issuance

of Participatory Notes

a)

In October 2007, it was decided to put
quantitative restrictions on the quantum
of PN issuance by the FIIs. The decision
was  taken  against  the  backdrop  of
growing  concern/  perception  of  high
inflows  in  general  and  particularly
through the PN route, as reflected by total
value of outstanding P-Note figures vis-
a-vis assets under custody which showed
a rising trend. Accordingly, Regulation 15
A was suitably amended to provide for
the  quantitative  restrictions  and  more
concise definitions of “regulated entity”
and “overseas derivative instruments”.

b) The impositions of these restrictions and
its  impact,  if  any,  were  reviewed  in
October 2008, and the following factors
were considered.

Box 1.5: Empowering Mutual Fund Investors

Mutual  Fund  schemes  are  presently  subscribed
by  investors  either  directly  without  entry  load  or
through  a  distributor  with  an  entry  load.  This  load
is  deducted  from  investors’  subscription  money  by
AMC and used for paying distributor’s commission.
Investors  making  investments  through  distributors
do  not  have  control  over  the  commissions  so
deducted.

To enable the investor to determine the amount of
commission,  a  few  alternatives  were  presented  in
concept paper titled ‘Proposal on Variable Entry Load’.
The  paper  was  placed  on  SEBI  website  for  public
comments. The paper suggests two options:

i. The  application  forms  indicate  different  options

for  rates  of  commission  and  the  investor  and
distributor sign in one of those rates.

ii. The investor negotiates the rate with the distributor
and issues a separate cheque for the same in favor
of  distributor.

The concept paper brought out the pros and cons
of both the options. The paper also proposed to bring
about transparency in disclosure of commission being
paid  to  distributors  for  the  different  schemes  which
are being recommended to the investor by making the
disclosure of commission mandatory.

Opinions and feedbacks have been received from
distributors, individuals (the investors) and AMCs by
email, letters and post cards.

20

PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

i) The  PN  positions 

reported
represented  an  inflated  figure
because of the following reasons:

accounts abroad shall be disseminated
on a consolidated basis twice a week i.e.,
on Tuesday and Friday of every week.

(cid:127) The FIIs were reporting PNs when
it was merely referenced to Indian
securities,  or  even  when  it  was
referenced  to  a  product  with
Indian weightage, e.g., MSCI Index.

(cid:127) In  the  case  of  ODI,  it  was  not
possible 
to  establish  any
correlation between inflows and
ODIs  as  some  of  the  FIIs  were
reporting  their  ODI  positions
based on notional positions while
others  on  the  premium/  margin
paid towards the ODI contracts.

ii) Further clamping down on the ODI
issuance  capabilities  of  the  PN
issuers on the derivatives had led to
the  unintended  effect  of  exporting
markets abroad.

In  view  of  the  above,  the  quantitative
restrictions  imposed  on  the  ODI
issuance  capabilities  and 
the
restrictions  on  ODI  were  removed
w.e.f., October 07, 2008.

c)

c) The  first  such  information  was
provided on the SEBI website on Friday
October 17, 2008 covering the activity
for  the  period  October  10,  2008  to
October  14,  2008  and  periodically
thereafter.  Further,  the  scrip -wise
position of the FIIs which had the effect
of lending shares abroad, as on October
9,  2008  was  also  disseminated  to  the
public. SEBI continuously reviews data
submitted by the FIIs with regard to their
stock lending activities abroad.
It was observed that the exchange offered
stock  lending  mechanism,  though
operational in the Indian market, was not
being used by the institutions, including
FIIs.  At  the  same  time,  apparently  the
FIIs were engaged in similar activities in
the overseas OTC markets.
It was, therefore, decided to disapprove
the  activity  of  the  FIIs  which  had  the
effect of lending of shares abroad in an
OTC market, an activity which was not
allowed onshore.

for FIIs

a) As per the legal framework for lending
and borrowing of shares, only exchange
offered mechanism was to be availed by
the  market  participants  and  over  the
counter  deals  of  such  nature  were  not
allowed.

b) However, sales in the Indian market by
foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and
their sub-accounts are also possible on
account of the securities being lent by
these  FIIs  /  sub-accounts  abroad.  In
order to lend more transparency to the
market, it was decided that the position

instruments  has 

b) To  enable  better  utilisation  of  the
allocated limits, it was decided to allow
the  entities  five  working  days  to
rollover  their  debt  investments  upon
sale of debt securities held by them.

iv. Changes  made  in  the  Methodology  for

Allocation of Debt Investment Limits

a) SEBI allocated debt investment limits to
the FIIs on first-come-first-served basis.
This  method  of  allocation  was  used  in
June 2008 and October 2008 when the
limits  for  holding  government  and  the
corporate debt by FIIs were enhanced.

b) As  per  this  methodology,  requests  for
investment limits were called from the
entities in a dedicated mail box thrown
open  on  a  particular  day  subject  to  a
maximum  limit  per  entity.  The  limits
were then allocated based on the time
the  e -mails  were  received  in  the
designated  mailbox.  In  the  interest  of
transparency, the list of the entities and
the  time  at  which  the  mails  were
received  in  the  mail  box  were
disseminated  to  the  public  by  way  of
press release.

c) These limits were to be utilised within
a specified time; however, if the same
were  not  utilised  fully  or  partially
within the specified time, the unutilised
limits were withdrawn from the entity
and allocated to other entities further
down in the list of requests received.

d) This  revised  system  was  transparent
and considered a step better than the
earlier system used for allocation. But
there  were  some  inherent  drawbacks
viz.,  non- optimal  matching  of
investment opportunity with allocation
of limits, inefficient utilization of limits.

e) To address these issues, SEBI introduced
an auction based methodology where the
registered  FIIs/sub-accounts  could  bid
through  their  trading  members  for
getting  the  debt  limits.  The  features  of
this methodology are:
(cid:127) The allocation is done on an open
screen  based  bidding  platform
wherein bidders pay a fee for taking
the limits.

(cid:127) The  allocation  is  on  a  price  time
priority,  where  the  highest  bidder
would  take  away  the  given  limit
subject to a minimum of Rs.250 crore
and a maximum of Rs.10, 000 crore.
(cid:127) The  successful  bidders  pay  a
minimum  of  Rs.1,000  or  the  bid
premium, which ever is higher.

(cid:127) The  premium  amount  collected
through this mechanism is paid to
the Consolidated Fund of India.

(cid:127) 45  days  period  is  provided  to  the
entities  for  utilization  of  limits
under this allocation method.

In  the  first  such  auction  conducted,
total limits to the extent of Rs 29,350
crore was allocated to 43 bidders. The
total bidding premium generated from
this  allocation  amounting 
to
Rs.22,33,535  was  remitted  to  the
Consolidated Fund of India.

Further  to  accommodate  the  FIIs/sub-
accounts who require smaller debt limit
(upto Rs.249 crore), the first-come-first-
serve methodology is being continued.

f)

g)

v. Efficient Allocation of Debt-Equity in the

Portfolio of FIIs

In  order  to  accord  better  flexibility  for
efficient  allocation  of  debt  and  equity  in  the
portfolio,  the  restriction  of  70:30  ratio  of
investment  in  equity  and  debt  was  done  away
w.e.f., October 2008.

VI. Investor Assistance and Investor Education

i. Redressal of Investors’ Grievances

SEBI has a comprehensive mechanism to
facilitate  redressal  of  grievances  against
intermediaries  registered  by  it  and  against
companies whose securities are / are being listed
in  Stock  Exchanges.  The  Office  of  Investor
Assistance  and  Education  (OIAE)  acts  as  the
single  window  interface,  interacting  with
investors seeking assistance.

Investors  can  submit  their  grievances  in
any form i.e., plain paper, post card, via e-mail
etc., at the Head Office at Mumbai or at any of
the Regional Offices at Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata
and Ahmedabad. Besides, grievances can also
be filed in standardized forms that are available
at all its offices. Investors also have the option
to  electronically  file  their  grievances  through
the  SEBI  website  (www.sebi.gov.in).  All
complaints received by SEBI (excluding those
which  refers/  pertain  to  investigation)  are
individually acknowledged with unique number,
which facilitates tracking, including through the
SEBI website.

Dedicated  investor  helpline  telephone
numbers  are  available  for  investors  seeking
general  guidance  pertaining  to  securities
markets  and  to  provide  assistance  in  filing
grievances.  Dedicated  personnel  manning  the
helpline also guide the investors in filing up the
grievance  submission  forms  as  well  as  in
determining the appropriate authority for their
first  recourse.  Guidance  is  also  provided  to
approach  the  appropriate  authority  if  their
grievance is outside the purview of SEBI.

Briefly,  the  grievance  handling  procedure

pertaining to listed companies are as under:

a. The grievances lodged by investors are
taken  up  with  the  respective  listed
companies  and  are  continuously
monitored.  The  company  is  required
to  respond  in  prescribed  standard
format  in  the  form  of  Action  Taken

Report (ATR). Upon the receipt of ATR,
the  status  of  grievances  is  updated.
Where the response of the company is
insufficient  /  inadequate,  follow  up
action is initiated.

c.

b. SEBI  website  offers  investors  the
facility  of  tracking  the  status  of  their
grievances 
lodged  with  SEBI,
pertaining to listed companies.
In cases where the rate of redressal of
grievances  is  not  satisfactory  the
officials of the concerned company are
advised to redress the grievances via
several  reminders  and  meetings.
Enforcement  actions  as  provided
under  the  securities  laws  (including
launch  of  adjudication,  prosecution
proceedings,  direction  u/s  11B)  are
initiated  against  companies  and  /  or
its  Directors  whose  progress  in
redressal  of  investor  grievances  is  not
satisfactory.

Grievances  pertaining  to  registered
intermediaries  are  handled  by  the  respective
dealing departments.

During  2008-09,  SEBI  received  57,580
grievances from investors and resolved 75,989
grievances  as  compared  to  54,933  grievances
received  and  31,676  grievances  resolved  in
2007-08.  As  on  March  31,  2009,  there  were
1,71,000  grievances  pending  resolution  as
compared to 1,89,409 unresolved grievances as
on March 31, 2008.

Types  of  investors’  grievances  received
and  redressed,  as  on  March  31,  2009,  are
given in the Table 1.4 and type-wise status of
grievances  awaiting  redressal  is  provided  in
Table 1.5.

ii. Action against Top 100 Companies

Top  100  companies  in  terms  of  number  of
unresolved  grievances  were  identified  and  were

public  issue  of  securities.  Apart  from  the
company, the intermediaries to the issues were
advised to resolve grievances pertaining to the
respective  issues  intermediated  by  them.
Accordingly, merchant bankers to public issues
of companies were identified and were advised
to  arrange  to  redress  grievances  thereof
expeditiously. Initially, letters have been issued
to  top  32  Merchant  Bankers  on  the  basis  of
number  of  their  mandates.    During  2008-09,
29,670 grievances pertaining to public issue of
securities were resolved.

iv. Grievances against Stock Brokers

Meetings with top 20 brokers, based on the
number of pending grievances, were conducted
at  Chennai,  Ahmedabad,  Kolkata,  Delhi  and
Mumbai,  to  address  systemic  issues  and  to
expedite  resolution  of  the  pending  grievances.
The feedback received on grounds of grievances
and the operational constraints in resolving the
same  are  under  consideration  for  possible
policy measures to preempt grievances. During
the  year  2008-09,  1,270  grievances  against
stock brokers were resolved.

v.

Sardar  Sarovar  Narmada  Nigam  Limited
(SSNNL)

SSNNL,  using  the  powers  conferred  on  it
vide  the  SSNNL  (Conferment  of  Power  to
Redeem  Bonds)  Act,  2008,  prematurely
redeemed its deep discount bonds although its
prospectus dated September 29, 1993 did not
provide  for  the  same.  Accordingly,  SSNNL
redeemed bonds @ Rs. 50,000 in January 2009
instead  of  redeeming  them  @  Rs.  111,000  in
January  2014,  leading  to  investor  grievances.
SEBI, therefore, instructed SSNNL to disclose
to the bondholders the approach followed by it
in  arriving  at  the  redemption  price  and  the
justification for the redemption price.

Many petitions were filed by bondholders
before the High Court of Bombay and Gujarat

High  Court,  inter-alia  challenging  the
constitutional  validity  of  SSNNL  (Conferment
of  Power  to  Redeem  Bonds)  Act,  2008,  which
enabled  the  premature  redemption  of  bonds.
SEBI  has  impleaded  itself  as  a  party  to  these
proceedings. Subsequently, the Supreme Court
vide its order dated January 12, 2009, stayed
the  proceedings  before  the  aforesaid  High
Courts and is now hearing the matter.

vi.

Issuance of No-Objection certificate

Companies  raising  capital  through  public
issue of securities are required to deposit one
percent of the issue amount with the designated
stock exchange. This amount is released by the
stock  exchange  only  after  SEBI  issues  a  No
Objection Certificate (NOC). One of the criteria
for  issuance  of  NOC  to  the  companies  is  the
satisfactory redressal of all investor grievances
received by SEBI against the company.

In  2008-09,  107  NOCs  were  issued  to
applicant companies. In 56 cases, NOCs were
not issued as the applications were incomplete
or unsatisfactory record of grievance redressal
on their part

vii.  Investors’ Associations

Empowering investors through education is
recognised as the key to investor protection and
for  long  term  development  of  the  securities
market.  SEBI’s  efforts  in  this  regard  are  also
carried out through Investors’ Associations, which
are  granted  recognition  for  that  purpose.
Feedback, suggestions and opinions of investors
are channeled as inputs for policy formulation at
SEBI,  vide  periodic  interactions  with  these
Associations.

SEBI continued its endeavor to enlarge its
reach to investors by granting recognition to new
Investors’ Associations. Accordingly, during the
year, 2 new Investor Associations were granted
recognition by SEBI. As on March 31, 2009, 22
Investors’ Associations are recognised by SEBI.
These are:

development of securities markets in India. In
this  regard  the  need  for  a  dedicated  fund  to
foster investor empowerment was felt.

Accordingly,  Union  Budget:  2006-07,
proposed setting up of an Investor Protection Fund
(IPF) funded by fines and penalties recovered by
SEBI.  At  present  these  amounts  are  credited  to
the Consolidated Fund of India as required under
securities laws. Hence, the IPF can be established
after the relevant laws are amended permitting
credit of these amounts to the IPF.

Pending the aforesaid amendment, SEBI set
up an ‘Investor Protection and Education Fund’
(IPEF) by an administrative order dated July 23,
2007.  An  initial  corpus  of  Rs.10  crore  was  set
aside for IPEF from the General Fund of SEBI.
The Fund will be utilized for investor education
and  related  activities.  The  fund  shall  be
administered in accordance with the Regulations,
which were approved by the Board on February
2, 2009 and are in the process of being notified.

Salient  features  of  this  Regulations  are  as

under:

a) Amounts  that  can  be  credited  to  the

ix. Financial Literacy for School Students

During  2008-09,  SEBI  and  NISM  jointly
conceived  and  introduced  a  program  for
promoting financial literacy in schools. The main
objective of this program is to sensitize students
at an early age to the concepts of money, savings
and investments. Targeted at class VIII and IX
school  students,  the  program  has  been
positioned as an important life skill to be taught
at  school  level.  The  program  has  been
structured around ‘Training the Trainer’ model
to  generate  multiplier  effect.  Workshops  are
conducted  for  training  the  school  teachers  to
enable them to deliver the program to students.
An innovatively designed tool kit comprises of
three components i.e. course material for kids,
notes  for  instructor  and  a  family  activity
booklet.  Thus the program operates at three
levels: teachers, children and family.

The  program  is  in  its  pilot  stage.  During
the financial year, 158 teachers from 84 schools
were  trained  through  4  workshops.  Three
workshops for training the school teachers were
conducted  at  Delhi  in  collaboration  with
National Progressive Schools Conference, which
is an association of 110 leading schools in and
around Delhi. One workshop was conducted at
Dehradun  in  collaboration  with  The  Doon
School. Two workshops were also conducted in
Chennai  for  Principals  from  about  50  schools
to  create  awareness  about  the  program.  5
schools have already implemented the program
and  more  are  expected  to  launch  it  in  the
forthcoming academic year.

VII. Investigations

During  2008-09,  measures  were  taken  to
prevent  insider  trading  and  to  strengthen
disclosure requirements for the insiders which
were  implemented  by  amending  the  SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,
1992. The amended Regulations were notified
on November 19, 2008. These were as follows:
All  directors/officers/designated
employees of listed companies who buy

(cid:127)

28

or sell any number of shares shall not
take  the  opposite  position  i.e.,  sell  or
buy any number of shares during next
six  months  following  the  prior
transaction.  Also  they  cannot  take
positions  in  derivative  transactions  in
the  shares  of  the  company.  The  main
purpose of this amendment is that the
insiders  of  a  company  should  not
indulge in speculative transactions and
should purchase shares for the purpose
of investment.

Earlier,  the  insiders  and  the  persons
holding five per cent of the equity capital
of a company were required to inform
the  company  within  four  days  about
their transactions and the company in
turn was required to inform the stock
exchange  in  five  days.    With  a  view  to
reducing  the  total  time  period  of  nine
days, in the amended Regulations, two
working  days  have  been  provided  for
such  persons  to  make  the  prescribed
disclosure and a further period of two
working days are given to the company
to communicate the information to the
stock  exchanges.  The  dependents  of
insiders i.e., directors and officers have
also now been brought in the ambit of
regulations for the purpose of making
disclosure of their transactions.  They
are  also  required  to  report  their
transactions simultaneously to the stock
exchanges  where  the  securities  are
listed, while reporting to the company.
Working day is defined as a day when
the regular trading is permitted on the
concerned  stock  exchange  where
securities of the company are listed.

The  amendment  will  enable  the
investors  to  know  the  pattern  of
transactions of the insiders and major
shareholders  in  much  shorter  time
period and would help them in taking
their investment decisions.

E-filing facility for making disclosures
to  stock  exchanges  has  been  provided
in  the  regulations  to  expedite  the
process  of  disclosures  in  accordance
with  the  system  devised  by  the  stock
exchanges.

Definition of “insider” has been slightly
modified for the sake of clarity so as to
clarify the liability of “tippee” i.e., the
person who receives unpublished price
sensitive information from the insider.

VIII. Retrospect and Prospects

i. Retrospect

Indian economy, following a sustained high
growth  rate  during  Tenth  Plan  period,
witnessed a slowdown during 2008-09 as GDP
grew at a moderated pace of 7.1 per cent. The
slowdown in momentum in manufacturing and
industrial  activity  pulled  down  the  overall
growth rate amidst uncertain global business
environment.

The  securities  market  remained  subdued
with the BSE Sensex closing below the 10,000
mark  on  October  17,  2008.  Thereafter,  it
witnessed  its  lowest  close  at  8,160  on  March
09, 2009 before embarking on an upward path.
During 2008-09, BSE Sensex lost 37.9 per cent
and Nifty lost 36.1 per cent over March 2008.
Reflecting  the  price  depreciation,  market
capitalisation  (of  BSE)  to  GDP  ratio  and  the
traded value (of BSE and NSE together) to GDP
ratio declined to 58.0 per cent and 72.4 per cent,
respectively in 2008-09 from 108.8 per cent and
108.6  per  cent  a  year  ago.  The  downslide  in
securities  market  was  broad-based  with  a
majority  of  the  sectors  registering  price  fall.
Besides FIIs, mutual funds and retail investors
also  pared  their  positions  in  the  secondary
market.  Due  to  weak  global  and  domestic
macro-economic fundamentals, overall market
sentiment  was  subdued  throughout  the  major
part of the year, except in last quarter of 2009.

The  primary  market  witnessed  moderate
activity  during  2008-09.  The  number  of
companies  which  accessed  the  primary
market was 47 in 2008-09 compared to 124
in 2007-08. Amount mobilised was Rs. 16,220
crore  during  2008-09,  lower  than  Rs.  87,029
crore  mobilised  during  2007-08.  The  number
of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) declined to 21
in 2008-09 from 85 in 2007-08 and the number
of  rights  issue  declined  to  25  from  32  during
the same period.

There  was  a  net  withdrawal  of  resources
from  mutual  funds  in  2008-09.  With  private
sector mutual funds contributing a major part
of  the  redemption,  there  was  a  net  outflow  of
resources from all mutual funds at Rs. 28,296
crore  during  2008-09  compared  to  a  net
accretion of resources of Rs. 1,53,802 crore in
2007-08. The exposure of mutual funds to debt
securities  increased  due  to  the  correction
witnessed in the domestic equity market.

The  FIIs  continued  to  invest  in  Indian
market.  The  number  of  SEBI  registered  FIIs
went up to 1,635 by end March 2009 from 1,319
a year ago. Their net sales in equities was USD
10,324  million  in  2008-09  as  against  a  net
investment  of  USD  13,243  million  in  the
previous year.

ii. Prospects

Protection  of  investor  interests,  ensuring
that  the  markets  are  fair,  efficient  and
transparent and reduction of systemic risk are
some  of  the  major  objectives  of  SEBI.  In  the
past few years, SEBI has taken several steps to
further  these  objectives  and  proposes  to
continue to take further steps in this direction.

With  maturing  of  markets,  further
specialization  and  innovations  are  likely  to
occur.  These  generate  unknown  risks.  SEBI
would  encourage  all  market  players  to  have
better  risk  management  systems  to  mitigate
risks arising out of these activities.

29

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

Developing  wide  and  deep  markets  will
continue  to  be  an  area  of  prime  importance.
Wider investor participation imparts stability to
markets  and  SEBI  will  continue  to  reinforce
investor protection measures and take further
investor education initiatives towards this end.

Wider  retail  participation  in  the  markets
through investor friendly channels is predicated
upon low transaction costs. SEBI will continue
to take measures which will reduce transaction
costs and encourage retail participation.  SEBI
will take such further steps for empowering the
small investors through necessary disclosures
as necessary. Making available high quality data
to  public  will  continue  to  be  of  prime
importance.

In  the  recent  past  several  new  products
have  been  introduced  in  the  Indian  securities

markets  and  SEBI  will  continue  to  encourage
introduction of relevant innovative products in
the  markets  to  fill  in  the  existing  needs  while
taking care of the systemic stability concerns.

Several important steps have been taken by
SEBI for developing corporate debt market and
further efforts will be made in close coordination
with the industry and other regulators.

Maintaining  market  integrity  is  of  prime
importance to every securities market regulator.
SEBI  would  further  strengthen  its  integrated
market  surveillance  system  to  deter  market
manipulations.

Taking timely and deterrent action against
the  offenders  is  sine-qua-non  of  regulation.
This will continue to be an important part of
SEBI’s work.

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

Indian  securities  markets  displayed
downward trend in 2008-09. The downswing in
the domestic equity markets was in consonance
with  the  downward  spiral  in  global  equity
markets  triggered  by  international  financial
crisis.  Sharp  fall  in  the  benchmark  indices,
across the board fall in share prices, decline in
market  capitalisation,  turnover  and  soaring
volatility  characterised  the  stock  market
behaviour  during  2008-09.  There  was  a
substantial decline in the resource mobilisation
by corporates in the primary market in 2008-09
compared to the previous years.  Redemptions
exceeded  mobilisations  by  the  mutual  funds
resulting  in  substantial  outflows.  Concerns  of
deepening of recession pervading in the developed
economies,  slowdown  in  domestic  industrial
growth and exports, substantial selling by FIIs,
weak corporate results and depreciation of rupee
aggravated the downward momentum. However,
the  Indian  securities  market  continued  to
function in an orderly manner during 2008-09.

1.

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

The  primary  market  segment  witnessed
weak  trend  during  2008-09.  The  volatility  in

stock markets, slowdown in economic growth,
slackening of expansion plans by corporates and
poor investor response led to sharp fall in the
number  of  issues  and  amount  raised  through
the primary market in 2008-09.

I.

Resource Mobilisation

During 2008-09, 47 companies accessed
the primary market and raised Rs.16,220 crore
through public (22) and rights issues (25) as
against 124 companies which raised Rs.87,029
crore  in  2007-08  (Table  2.1).    All  the  public
issues in equity instruments were initial public
offerings  (IPOs).  There  were  only  21  IPOs
during 2008-09 as against 85 during 2007-08.
The  amount  raised  through  IPOs  during
2008-09  was  much  lower  at  Rs.2,082  crore
compared to Rs.42,595 crore during 2007-08.
The share of public issues in the total resource
mobilisation declined to 22.1 per cent during
2008-09  against  62.6  per  cent  in  2007-08
(Chart 2.1). There was a public issue of non-
convertible  debenture  (Rs.1,500  crore)  in
2008-09 after a long hiatus. During 2008-09,
the share of rights issues in the total resource
mobilisation  was  77.9  per  cent.  The  amount

mobilised through rights issues during 2008-09
was  Rs.12,637  crore  compared  to  Rs.32,518
crore during 2007-08.

The  highest  amount  was  mobilised  in
September 2008 (Rs.9,715 crore), followed by
January 2009 (Rs.1,500 crore) and December
2008 (Rs.1,370). The number of issues was the
highest in June 2008 (9) followed by September
2008 (8).

In  order  to  facilitate  quicker  resource
mobilisation  by  companies  from  institutional
investors,  Qualified  Institutions’  Placement
(QIP) was introduced in 2006. However, QIP as
a  mode  of  resource  mopping  also  declined  in
2008-09  reflecting  the  general  subdued  trend
in the primary markets. During 2008-09, only
two  companies  resorted  to  QIP  and  garnered
Rs.189  crore  as  compared  to  36  listed
companies  which  had  raised  Rs.25,525  crore
during 2007-08 (Table 2.2).

II. Sector-wise Resource Mobilisation

Sector-wise classification reveals that only
private  sector  companies  mobilised  resources
during  2008-09.  These  companies  raised
Rs.16,220 crore through 47 issues in 2008-09

increased  from  77.3  per  cent  in  2007-08  to
100.0 per cent during 2008-09 (Chart 2.2). The
analysis  of  last  seven  years  since  2001-02
reveals that 2008-09 was the first financial year
wherein  the  public  sector  companies  did  not
participate in resource mobilisation.

III. Size-wise Resource Mobilisation

About  78.1  per  cent  of  resource
mobilisation was through public issues of issue-
size  above  Rs.500  crore  during  2008-09
compared to 87.8 per cent during the previous

financial year (Table 2.4). However, the number
of issues above Rs.500 crore category declined
from 24 in 2007-08 to 6 in 2008-09.

The average size of the issue almost more
than  halved  in  2008-09  to  Rs.345  crore  from
Rs.702  crore  in  2007-08.  The  smaller  size  of
the  issues  reflected  the  postponement  of
expansion plans by the corporate and industrial
sector due to slackening economic growth.

There  were  9  mega  issues  in  2008-09
(Table 2.5). The number of mega issues had fallen

Industry-wise Resource Mobilisation

Industry-wise  classification  reveals  that
finance  sector  accounted  for  12.1  per  cent  of
total  resource  mobilisation  through  primary
market  (Table  2.6).  Entertainment  sector
garnered 7.1 per cent followed by power sector
(5.9 per cent) and textile sector (4.4 per cent).
Textile sector had the highest number of 5 issues
during 2008-09.

SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

I A. Equity Market in India: An Overview

Equity  markets  witnessed  downward  and
volatile  trend  during  2008-09.  The  domestic
markets  largely  reflected  the  uncertainties  in
international financial market in the financial year.

Markets  were  characterised  by  severe
bouts  of  volatility  during  the  year.  The  BSE
Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty depreciated by 37.9
per  cent  and  36.2  per  cent,  respectively,  over
March  31,2008  (Chart  2.3).  The  BSE  Sensex
declined 5936 points to close at 9709 on March
31, 2009 from 15644 on March 31, 2008.  The
S&P  CNX  Nifty  also  declined  1714  points  to
close  at  3021  at  the  end  of  March  2009  over
4735 at the end of March 2008.

  Indian  markets  had  recorded  severe
volatility  at  the  close  of  2007-08.  However,
towards  the  beginning  of  the  2008-09,  indices
recovered and registered gains during April-May
2008. Better than expected fourth quarter results
of 2007-08 declared by IT majors, net purchases
by FIIs in the Indian equity market till May 20,
2008, and some easing of international crude oil
prices  helped  the  recovery.  However,  in  June
2008, markets reversed due to hike in domestic
and international fuel prices, rise in inflation rate,
net  FII  sales  in  the  equity  segment,  rupee
depreciation  and  a  general  decline 
in
international stock markets.

Notwithstanding 

the  deteriorating
international financial crisis, the Indian equity
markets  performed  in  orderly  manner  in  the
second  quarter  of  2008-09.  Domestic  stock
markets recovered with intermittent corrections
in the second quarter till mid-September 2008.

Since  then,  bankruptcy  of  world’s  largest
financial  institutions  had  its  sway  on  Indian
financial markets. Added to these were the heavy
net  sales  by  FIIs,  domestic  inflation,
depreciation  of  rupee  and  slowdown  in  the
industrial growth as shown by IIP.

35

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

In third quarter of the financial year, weak
trend continued in the markets as there was a
sharp  fall  in  the  share  prices.  Concerns  over
the  world  economy  plunging  into  recession
added  to  the  downswing.  Substantial  net
outflows by FII, poor second quarter corporate
results, depreciation of rupee and concerns of
Indian economy falling into recession on account
of weak industrial growth and decline in exports
accentuated the downtrend.

The subdued and volatile trend continued
in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008-09  mainly
reflecting the international equity markets. The
BSE Sensex touched a low of 8160 on March 9,
2009. Thereafter, a slight recovery was seen in
consonance  with  the  improvements  in  world
equity  markets  towards  the  end  of  2008-09.  In
tandem  with  the  decline  in  stock  prices  in
2008-09, there was a fall in turnover and market
capitalisation across the board (Table 2.7).

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

In the cash segment, the turnover at BSE
and  NSE  declined  by  30.3  per  cent  and  22.5
per cent, respectively during 2008-09 over the
previous year. Derivatives turnover at NSE and
BSE declined by 17.3 per cent in 2008-09 over
the previous year.

I B. Global Equity Markets: An Overview

The global equity market was dominated by
the  financial  turmoil  and  the  signs  of  severe
recession  inflicted  by  the  deteriorating  financial
markets.  Equity  markets  across  the  world  -
developed and emerging - declined over concerns
of economic slowdown in US, Europe and Asia,
which  was  predicted  to  be  the  most  severe
compared  the  recession  of  1930s.  Plummeting
share  prices  and  heightened  volatility  across
markets and sectors characterised the world stock
markets  during  2008-09.  Collapse  of  world’s
leading financial institutions including Lehmann
Brother’s fuelled the downturn in the second-half.
Emerging markets which were till then, shielded
from the direct effect of the financial turmoil, came
under  severe  pressure  during  the  period.
Downward  spiral  of  share  prices,  outflows  of
foreign investment, depreciation of currencies of

emerging markets followed. Weak earnings results
reported by corporates, tightening of lending norms
by  banks  and  overall  reduction  in  consumer
confidence precipitated declining trend of indices,
especially in mid-October and November.

During  2008-09,  all  the  equity  markets
witnessed downturn (Chart 2.4). The downtrend
was the highest for Russian CRTX index (63.5 per
cent) followed by Hermes index of Egypt (59.6 per
cent), BUX index of Hungary (49.0 per cent) and
SET index of Thailand (47.2 per cent). BSE Sensex
and S&P CNX Nifty saw a fall of 37.9 per cent and
36.2 per cent, respectively during 2008-09.

II. Performance of Sectoral Indices

There  was  an  across  the  board  decline  in
broad-based  and  sectoral  indices  in  2008-09.
Among  the  broad-based  indices  of  shares  listed
on BSE, BSE 100, BSE 200 and BSE 500 recorded
a fall of 40.0 per cent, 41.0 per cent and 42.8 per
cent respectively over the previous year (Chart 2.5).

equity prices, there was a decline in the trading
volumes in stock exchanges in 2008-09. During
2008-09, turnover of all stock exchanges in the
cash  segment  declined  by  24.9  per  cent  to
Rs.38,52,579  crore compared to Rs.51,30,816

together  contributed  more  than  99.9  per  cent
of the turnover, of which NSE accounted for 71.4
per cent in the total turnover in cash market.

major exchanges of the world. As per the data
released  by  World  Federation  of  Exchanges
(WFE), NSE  was  ranked  fourth  and  BSE  was

the value of shares traded, NSE was ranked 18th

segments at NSE and BSE indicates the all-India
spread of the stock markets (Table 2.12). As in
the earlier years, Mumbai/Thane accounted for
the largest share in the turnover of BSE (20.6
per  cent)  and  NSE  (39.9  per  cent).  At  NSE,
Delhi/  Ghaziabad  accounted  for  10.7  per  cent
of the turnover followed by Calcutta/ Howrah at
6.6  per  cent  and  Ahmedabad  at  3.8  per  cent.
The top five cities accounted for 62.4 per cent
of turnover at NSE during 2008-09 compared
to 61.3 per cent in 2007-08. At BSE, the share
of top five cities was 24.2 per cent in 2008-09
as against 26.4 per cent in 2007-08.

IV. Market Capitalisation

The market capitalisation of BSE decreased
by    39.9  per  cent  to  Rs.30,86,075  crore  in
2008-09 from Rs.51,38,014 crore at the end of
2007-08  (Table  2.13).  At  NSE  also,  market
capitalisation  declined  by  40.4  per  cent  to
Rs.28,96,194  crore    at  the  end  of  March  2009
from Rs.48,58,122  crore at the end of  March 2008.
As  per  the  data  release  of  WFE,  BSE  and  NSE
were ranked 14th and 15th in the world in terms
of market capitalisation at the end of March 2009.

The  downturn  in  the  stock  markets
resulted in fall in market capitalisation of many
indices in 2008-09. Among the indices of BSE,
decline in market capitalisation was the highest
for BSE Teck index which fell by 39.7 per cent.
The market capitalisation of Bankex index also

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

V.  Stock Market Indicators

The market capitalisation to GDP ratio is
one  of  the  parameters  for  evaluation  of  stock
markets.  Also,  liquidity  of  the  market  can  be
measured by the traded value to GDP ratio, i.e.,
value  of  the  shares  traded  to  GDP  at  current
market  prices.  Since  2002-03,  there  was  a
sustained increase in the market capitalisation
to GDP ratio. The BSE market capitalisation to
GDP ratio had increased from 23.3 per cent in
2002-03 to 108.8 per cent last financial year in
2007-08.  Similarly,  at  NSE  also  the  ratio  had
increased from 21.9 per cent to 102.9 per cent
during the same period (Table 2.15).  However,
downswing in the stock market in 2008-09 led
to  a  substantial  decline  of  the  market
capitalisation to GDP ratios of BSE and NSE to
a round half of its values in the previous year.
The market capitalisation to GDP ratio of BSE
was 58.0 per cent and that of NSE was 54.4 per
cent during 2008-09.

Similarly, the turnover-GDP ratio was the
highest  in  2007-08  for  both  the  cash  and
derivative  segment.  It  slid  considerably  in  the
2008-09  in  tune  with  fall  in  the  share  prices
and the resultant decline in the trading volume.
The  all-India  equity  market  turnover  to  GDP
ratio  declined  to  72.4  per  cent  in  2008-09  as

compared to 108.6 per cent in 2007-08. In the
derivative  segment  also,  the  turnover  ratio
declined  from  282.3  per  cent  in  2007-08  to
207.1 per cent in 2008-09.

The  valuation  of  the  shares  could  be
gauged from the price-earning ratio. The AS 30
index  of  Australia  and  NASDAQ  Composite  of
the U.S. had the highest P/E ratios in 2008-09.
Among  the  indices  of  emerging  markets
analyzed, SHCOMP index of China, TWSE index
of Taiwan and KOSPI index of South Korea had
higher P/E ratios in 2008-09 than that of Indian
benchmark indices (Chart 2.7).

At the end of March 2009, the P/E ratios
of  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  were  13.7
and  14.3,  respectively  (Table  2.16).  The  P/E
ratios witnessed steady fall in 2008-09 from the
initial highs in the first quarter of the financial
year.  Towards  the  last  quarter,  there  was  a
considerable  decline  in  the  valuations  of  all
indices except CNX PSE.

Price to book value ratio (P/B ratio) is a
valuation measure which measures the returns
left  for  the  shareholders  after  providing  for
liabilities of a company. Thus, the P/B ratio of
an index shows the asset quality of companies
pertaining to that sector. During 2008-09, there

VI. Volatility in Stock Markets

Volatility  is  measured  by  the  standard
deviation of logarithmic returns during a certain
period.  During  2008-09,  stock  markets  all  over
the  world  witnessed  extreme  volatility.  The
domestic  stock  market  also  could  not  remain
unaffected  from  the  global  volatile  trend.  The

annualised volatility of BSE Sensex soared to 43.6
per  cent  in  2008-09  from  30.6  per  cent  in
2007-08.  Similar  trend  was  also  observed  for
S&P  CNX  Nifty,  which  recorded  annualised
volatility of 41.5 per cent in 2008-09 compared
to 32.1 per cent in the previous year. Month-wise,
volatility in the benchmark indices was the highest
in October 2008 and November 2008 (Table 2.18).

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

This  was  true  for  the  mid-cap  and  small  cap
indices as the market witnessed negative cues
from  other  countries,  mainly  US  and  Europe.
The lowest volatility in the benchmark indices
was noticed during April 2008 and May 2008.

An  international  comparison  of  volatility
in  stock  returns  indicates  that  volatility  was
quite  high  in  2008-09  in  both  emerging  and
developed markets (Table 2.19 and Chart 2.8).

Volatility was extremely high in majority of the
markets in the month of October 2008. Indian
markets were the seventh most volatile market
in the world. Among the developed markets, the
annualised  volatility  was  high  in  Hong  Kong
(48.4 per cent) followed by Japan (46.0 per cent)
and USA NASDAQ (44.6 per cent). Among the
emerging  markets,  annualised  volatility  was
higher for Russia (81.8 per cent), Brazil (53.0
per cent) and Hungary (45.8 per cent).

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

Majority of the other stock exchanges were
inactive and their operations were confined to
their subsidiaries, which, in turn, have taken
membership of BSE and NSE. The turnover of
many of the subsidiaries declined in 2008-09
over  the  previous  financial  year.  Turnover  of
subsidiaries  during  2008-09  was  Rs.1,71,721
crore compared to Rs.2,53,218 crore in 2007-08,
indicating  a  fall  of  32.2  per  cent.  The
subsidiaries turnover constituted a miniscule
of  1.2  per  cent  of  the  total  turnover  of  cash
and  F&O  segment  of  all  stock  exchanges  in
India (Table 2.22).

IX. Dematerialisation

There  are  two  depositories  in  India  viz.,
National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)

and Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL).
The  depositories  have  set  up  nation-wide
network with proper infrastructure to handle the
securities deposited or settled in dematerialised
mode in the Indian stock markets.

The  number  of  companies  signed  up  for
dematerialisation  in  NSDL  rose  to  7,801  in
2008-09  from  7,354  in  2007-08  (Table  2.23).
In CDSL, the number of companies signed up
increased  from  5,943  in  2007-08  to  6,213  in
2008-09.  Similarly, 
the  number  of
dematerialised shares in NSDL went up by 19.4
per  cent  from  23,68,970  lakh  in  2007-08  to
28,28,700  lakh  in  2008-09.  In  CDSL  too,  the
number  of  shares  dematerialised  rose
significantly by 42.2 per cent to 7,08,200 lakh
in 2008-09 from 4,98,200 lakh in 2007-08.  In

3. TRENDS IN THE BOND MARKET

I. Corporate Bond Market

The trend in corporate bond markets viz.,
OTC trades and trades done on the exchanges is
shown  in  Table  2.36.  The  volume  of  trades  in
corporate  bonds  during  2008-09  increased  by
54.8  per  cent  in  comparison  to  2007-08.  In
comparison  to  increase  in  volume,  increase  in
the  number  of  trades  during  2008-09  is  very
significant.  It  has  increased  from  35,573  in
2007-08 to 4,29,642 in 2008-09. This increase

is mainly attributed to increase in the number of
trades at BSE, that has gone up from 27,697 to
4,17,376. The reason for this significant increase
is  because  of  retail  participation  in  ‘F’  group
category. It has been observed that BSE data on
corporate bond trades and volumes include data
for both ICDM reporting platform and ‘F’ group
trading  platform.  ICDM  reporting  platform  has
only corporate bond dealt between entities who
sought access from BSE from this platform and
the settlement is between the entities.  ‘F’ group
trading platform is where corporate bonds and

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

debentures are dealt in anonymous manner by
investors  through  members  and  settlement  is
through clearing house mechanism.

The  issuers  have  raised  Rs.2,07,165
crore  in  private  placement  during  2008-09
which  is  nearly  61  per  cent  increase  from
2007-08  (Table  2.37).  Although  the  year  has
seen a public issue after a long hiatus, private
placements have still remained as a preferred
mode of raising debt funds. The rise in funds
raised  could  also  be  possibly  attributed  to
issuers  preferring  the  domestic  debt  markets
as a primary source of corporate debt.

II. Wholesale Debt Market (WDM)

During  2008-09,  turnover  in  the  WDM
segment  increased  to  Rs.3,35,950  crore  from
Rs.2,82,317  crore  in  2007-08.  The  net  traded
value  and  average  daily  traded  value  increased
by 19.0 per cent and 25.7 per cent, respectively
during  the  same  period  (Table  2.38).  However,
the number of trades declined by 0.31 per cent
to 16,129 in 2008-09 from 16,179 in 2007-08.
The net traded value started increasing towards

the  end  of  the  third  quarter  and  in  the  fourth
quarter.  The  highest  turnover  was  recorded  in
March  2009  (Rs.49,205  crore)  followed  by
December 2008 (Rs.46,864 crore) and January
2009 (Rs.45,015 crore). Number of trades was
the  highest  for  December  2008  followed  by
January 2009.

Instrument-wise break up of the securities
traded  at  the  WDM  segment  of  NSE  indicates
the dominance of Government securities though
the  share  of  the  G-sec  in  the  traded  value
increased marginally to 69.7 per cent in 2008-09
from 68.8 per cent in 2007-08 (Table 2.39). The
share of Treasury bills declined from 23.4 per
cent in 2007-08 to 16.9 per cent in 2008-09. The
percentage  share  of  ‘others’  which  include
mainly  corporate  debt  securities,  declined
marginally from 4.5 per cent in 2007-08 to 4.4
per  cent  in  2008-09.  The  share  of  PSU/
institutional bonds also rose from 3.3 per cent
in 2007-08 to 8.9 per cent in 2008-09.

Trading  members  dominated  the  WDM
segment with a share of 44.6 per cent in total

previous year.

4. MUTUAL FUNDS

Mutual  funds  play  an  important  role  in
mobilising  the  household  savings 
for
deployment  in  capital  markets.  Mutual  funds
can  be  categorised  into  three  –  private  sector
mutual  funds,  UTI  mutual  Fund  and  other
public  sector  mutual  funds.  The  gross
mobilisation of resources by all mutual funds
during  2008-09  stood  at  Rs.54,26,353  crore
compared  to  Rs.44,64,376  crore  during  the
previous  year  indicating    an  increase  of  21.6
per  cent  over  the  previous  year  (Table  2.41).
Redemption  also  rose  by  26.5  per  cent  to
Rs.54,54,650  crore 
from
Rs.43,10,575  crore  in  2007-08.    All  mutual
funds, put together, recorded a net outflow of
Rs.28,296  crore  in  2008-09  compared  to  an
inflow  of    Rs.1,53,802  crore  in  2007-08.  Net
resource  mobilisation  had  thus  declined  by
118.4  per  cent  in  2008-09  over  the  previous
year.    The  assets  under  management  by  all
mutual  funds  decreased  by  17.4  per  cent  to

in  2008-09

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

Rs.4,17,300  crore  at  the  end  of  March  2009
from Rs.5,05,152 crore over the previous year.

Unlike  the  previous  years,  private  sector
mutual  funds  did  not  dominate  resource
mobilisation efforts during 2008-09. In fact the
net outflow was the highest from private sector
mutual  funds  at  Rs.34,018  crore  as  against  a
net  inflow  of  Rs.1,33,304  crore  in  2007-08
(Table  2.42).  UTI  mutual  fund  recorded  a  net
outflow  of  Rs.3,659  crore  compared  to  net
inflow  of  Rs.10,677  crore  in  2007-08.  Net
inflows were recorded by public sector mutual
funds in 2008-09 amounting to Rs.9,380 crore
compared  to  Rs.9,820  crore  in  the  previous
year.  While  all  the  open-ended  schemes  of
mutual funds recorded positive net inflows, the
close-ended and interval schemes witnessed net
outflows during the financial year.

Gross  mobilisation  of  resources  under
open-ended  schemes  during  2008-09  was
Rs.52,61,429  crore,  of  which,  about  79.1  per
cent  was  raised  by  the  private  sector  mutual
funds.  Similarly,  gross  resources  mobilised
under  close - ended  schemes  stood  at
Rs.1,11,007 crore in 2008-09, of which private
sector accounted for 78.6 per cent.

Scheme -wise  pattern  reveals 

the
domination of income/debt oriented schemes in

total  resource  mobilisation  during  2008-09
(Table  2.43).  During  2008-09,  there  was  net
outflow from income/debt oriented schemes and
ETFs.  Under debt oriented schemes, only gilt
funds  recorded  positive  inflows.  In  fact  gilt
funds recorded the maximum growth of 126.4
per cent in 2008-09 over the previous financial
year.  Even  though  Growth/equity  oriented
schemes  recorded  positive  net  inflows,  it  was
substantially less compared to last year. The net
amount  mobilised  by  Growth/equity  oriented
schemes  was  Rs.4,024  crore  compared  to
Rs.46,933  crore  mobilised  in  the  previous
financial  year.  This  was  in  tune  with  the
downtrend in the domestic equity markets. Net
resources  mobilised  by  ETFs  were  negative
during 2008-09. But GETFs recorded a growth
of 52.4 per cent in the resource mobilisation over
2007-08.  Fund  of  Funds  which  invest  overseas
also collected Rs.778 crore in 2008-09.

There were 1,001 mutual fund schemes as
on March 31, 2009, of which, 599 were income/
debt oriented schemes, 340 were growth/equity
oriented schemes and 35 were balanced schemes
(Table 2.44). In addition, there were 17 Exchange
Traded  Funds,  of  which  5  were  GETFs.  Also
there  were  10  schemes  operating  as  Fund  of
funds  which  invested  in  overseas  securities.
There were 589 open-ended schemes and 344

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

As  on  March  31,  2009,  there  are  a  total
number of 4.76 crore investor accounts holding
mutual units of Rs.4,19,322  crore (Table 2.46).
Investor accounts increased by 9.8 per cent in
2008-09 over the previous year.  However, actual
number of investors  in mutual funds could be
lesser than 4.76 crore as there may be more than
one folio of an investor which might have been
counted more than once. Out of the 4.76 crore
investor  accounts,  4.61  crore    are  individual
investor accounts which account for 96.8 per cent
of  the  total  number  of  investor  accounts  and
contribute Rs.1,55,283 crore which is 37.0 per
cent  of  the  total  net  assets.  Corporates  and
institutions which form only 1.2 per cent of the
total number of investors accounts in the mutual
fund industry, contribute a sizeable amount of
Rs.2,36,233 crore which is 56.3 per cent of the
total net assets of mutual funds. NRIs and FIIs
constitute  a  very  small  percentage  of  investor
accounts (2.04 per cent) and contribute 6.6 per
cent (Rs.27,805 crore) of net assets.

The  unit  holding  pattern  of  public  and
private  sector  mutual  funds  show  the
dominance  of  private  sector  mutual  funds  in
the number of investor accounts as well as share
in net assets. The private sector mutual funds
has 66.3 per cent of the total investor accounts

per cent assets managed by public sector mutual
funds. But while individual investors’ held 41.0
per cent of the net assets in public sector mutual
funds, their share in private sector mutual funds

5. FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT

Since  1992-93,  when  FIIs  were  allowed
entry  into  Indian  financial  markets,  foreign
institutional investment had increased over the
years.  In  tandem  with  the  boom  in  stock
markets and sound global scenario, investments
by  FIIs  into  India  were  quite  high  in  last  few
years,  particularly  since  2003-04.  However,
2008-09  saw  the  highest  FII  outflow  in  any
financial  year  since  inception.  This  could  be
attributed to the global financial meltdown and
the home bias of FIIs in the crisis.

carry out periodic/specific purpose inspections
of their members/participants.

by  SEBI  by  calling  for  periodic  reports  on
inspections conducted, violations observed and
actions taken.

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

As per Regulation 35 of SEBI (Depositories
and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996  every
depository needs to get inspected its controls,
systems,  procedures  and  safeguards  and
forward a copy of the inspection report to SEBI.

Subsequently,  follow  up  of  observations
brought out in the system audit reports of stock
exchanges was done through correspondence as
well as through meetings with senior management
of stock exchanges, whenever required.

During  2008-09,  comprehensive  systems
audit  of  NSDL  and  CDSL  including  review  of
networks,  security,  Business  Continuity
Planning  /  Disaster  Recovery,  IT  processes,
application  security,  maintenance  of  IT
infrastructure,  data  communication  controls,
etc. was performed by independent auditors as
mandated.

IV. Follow-up of Inspection Reports

Pursuant  to  inspection,  the  stock
exchanges and depositories submitted periodic
compliance reports to SEBI duly approved by
their  respective  Governing  Boards.  These
compliance reports were analysed and all non-
implemented observations were followed up for
compliance.  Whenever  required,  the  non-
compliance was also discussed with the senior
management of stock exchanges for expeditious
compliance.

V. Systems Audit of Stock Exchanges

Considering the importance of systems audit
in a technology driven securities market, SEBI
directed all stock exchanges to conduct audit of
their systems on an annual basis. The scope of
systems  audit  encompasses  audit  of  systems
and processes related to examination of trading
systems,  clearing  and  settlement  systems
(clearing  corporation/clearing  house),  risk
management, databases, disaster recovery sites,
business continuity planning, security, capacity
management and information security audit.

Accordingly,  all  stock  exchanges  were
advised to conduct systems audit on an annual
basis and place the systems audit, report and
compliance  status  before  the  governing  board
of the exchange and submit the same to SEBI.

4. SURVEILLANCE

I. Mechanism of Market Surveillance

An  effective  surveillance  mechanism  is
important  to  ensure  investor  protection  and
safeguard  the  integrity  of  the  markets.
Surveillance  is  a  vital  link  in  the  chain  of
activities performed by the regulator to protect
investors  and  develop  the  markets.  The
surveillance  system  adopted  by  SEBI  is  two
pronged  i.e.  Surveillance  Cell  in  the  stock
exchanges  and  Integrated  Surveillance
Department (ISD) in SEBI.

The  stock  exchanges  are  the  primary
regulators and are responsible for detection of
market  manipulation,  price  rigging,  other
regulatory breaches regarding securities market
functioning. The Integrated Surveillance System
of SEBI keeps a constant vigil on the activities
of  stock  exchanges  and  scope  of  its  activities
includes  monitoring  market  movements  and
detecting  potential  breaches  of  regulations,
analysing the trading in scrips and initiation of
appropriate action wherever warranted.

Trading  in  currency  futures  began  from
August 2008 and currently currency futures are
traded  at  NSE,  BSE  and  MCX-SX.  The
surveillance system also monitors the currency
futures markets.

II. Surveillance  Actions

During 2008-09, NSE initiated preliminary
examination and investigation in 165 cases and
BSE has initiated examination and investigation
in 961 cases.

Further, as surveillance measure, during the
year  NSE  shifted  190  scrips  to  trade-for-trade

76

PART THREE: REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKET

segment and BSE shifted 1,078 scrips to trade-
for-trade  segment.  NSE  imposed  a  price  band
(2 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent) on 942
instances whereas BSE imposed price band on
2,047 instances. Further, NSE and BSE verified
118 and 134 rumours respectively. The above
mentioned actions are tabulated in Table 3.16.

c) To  ensure  that  investors  across  the
country are able to trade continuously
and  without  difficulty,  SEBI  advised
exchanges  to  take  necessary  steps  to
ensure 
trading  continues
uninterrupted even during times of sun
outage,  which  causes  disruption  in
telecommunications.

III. Surveillance Measures

a) SEBI  observed  that  there  were  many
instances of wash trades and circular
trades in some illiquid scrips. In order
to  make  the  investors  and  brokers
aware  of  such  stocks,  SEBI  advised
stock  exchanges  to  prepare  and
disseminate  list  of  illiquid  scrips,  on
monthly basis commencing from July
2008.  Stock  exchanges  were  also
advised to intimate brokers to exercise
additional due diligence while trading
in  these  securities  either  on  own
account or on behalf of their clients.

b)

In  order  to  increase  awareness  and
facilitate  better  understanding  of  the
risks involved in investing in derivative
market,  SEBI  advised  exchanges  to
include  illustrative  examples  in  the
FAQs  on  derivatives  so  as  to  clearly
bring out the extent of risk involved in
derivatives’ trading, especially the risk
of loss of entire capital.

In order to protect the interest of those
demat  account  holder  who  operate
their  accounts  through  power  of
attorney, SEBI stipulated that an SMS
alert be sent to the account holder for
debits from his accounts. This would
reduce the scope for misuses of such
demat accounts.

e) SEBI  advised  depositories  to  close
those  nil  balance  demat  accounts
which  were  frozen  due  to  non-
furnishing  of  PAN  in  order  to  reduce
the number of idle demat accounts in
the system.

V.

Integrated Market Surveillance System

During  the  year,  the  integrated  market
surveillance  system  (IMSS)  implemented  in
SEBI  continued to  provide  assistance  to  SEBI
in monitoring the market and in discharging its
regulatory  functions effectively.  The  system  is
being  used 
for  detecting aberrations,
analyzing them  and  identifying the  cases  for
investigation  and  for  taking  further  action,
wherever  warranted.  The  purpose  of  this
exercise is  to  promote  market  integrity  and to
ensure  orderly  conduct  of  the  market.  IMSS
is also being used for monitoring the activities
of market participants as well as issuing suitable
instructions  to  stock  exchanges  and  market
participants.  Wherever  required,  findings
enabled  by  IMSS  are  shared  with  stock
exchanges for appropriate action ensuring that
stock exchanges continue to act as the primary
regulator for detecting and examining abnormal
trading patterns.

To  accommodate  growing  volumes  of
transactions  in  the  securities  market  and
currency markets, IT infrastructure of IMSS was
upgraded  during  the  year  in  order  to  enhance
capacity and ensure further scaling of operations.

VI. Enforcement

On  the  basis  of  surveillance  alerts,  SEBI
initiated  enforcement  actions  and  passed
interim ex-parte orders in the following cases:

i)

Interim  Order  in  the  matter  of
Temptation Foods Ltd.

alleging that Temptation Foods Ltd. (hereinafter
referred  to  as  ‘TFL’)  acting  together  with  a
number of individuals, corporate and brokers
was  acquiring  large  number  of  shares  of  KFL
in violation of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition
of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997.

Based  on  the  preliminary  examination  it
was  observed  that  TFL  along  with  Venture
Business  Advisors  Ltd.,  its  persons  acting  in
concert (PAC) was not holding shares of KFL as
claimed by them in the media.

As the rumours of impending takeover by
TFL of KFL were in circulation in the market, it
was  apprehended  that  lay  investors  could  be
further misled into transacting in the shares of
KFL since the reports in media with its visibility,
pervasive and persuasive content would greatly
influence the public at large to take investment
decisions.  In  view  of  the  above,  by  way  of  ad
interim,  ex-parte  order  dated  February  16,
2009, Temptation Foods Ltd and its Managing
Director, Mr. Vinit Kumar were directed to cease
and  desist  with  immediate  effect  from
publishing  or  causing  to  publish  or  reporting
or  causing  to  report  or  circulate  or  cause  to
circulate in any manner any false or misleading
information relating to dealing in securities in
the manner set out in the order or in any other
manner until further orders.

ii) Consent Orders

a)

IPO Irregularities

SEBI had conducted investigations into the
dealings in various IPOs made during the period
2003-05  and  found  that  certain  entities  (Key
operators), in concert with financiers, cornered
shares  meant  for  retail  investors.  Thereafter,
key operators transferred shares to financiers,
on or before the day of listing, who ultimately
sold them in the market after listing and made
huge ill-gotten gains.

SEBI received a complaint from Kohinoor
Foods  Ltd.  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‘KFL’)

Investigations identified 24 key operators
and  82  financiers.  Some  of  these  entities

78

PART THREE: REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKET

applied  for  consent  and  consent  orders  were
passed in respect of 51 entities for Rs. 13.72
crore together.

b) Nissan Copper Ltd.

SEBI  had  conducted  investigation  into
dealings on the first date of listing of shares of
Nissan  Copper  Limited  (NCL)  upon  noticing
abnormal price rise in the shares of NCL. The
investigations  prima  facie  found  that  certain
entities  had  allegedly  arranged  for  the
subscription from the FII in the QIB portion of
the  IPO  of  NCL.  They  had  agreed  that  upon
listing of the shares of NCL, these entities would
provide  an  assured  exit  for  the  FII  at  a
predetermined price by entering into structured
transactions.  SEBI  passed  an  ad  interim  ex-
parte order dated January 17, 2007, inter alia,
directing NSE and BSE to withhold the profits/
gains of these entities and the FII applicant in a
separate escrow account.

Some of the entities applied for consent in
the above matter. Consent orders were passed
in  respect  of  nine  entities  for  an  amount  of
Rs.13.45 crore.

c) DSQ Software

SEBI  had  initiated  Enquiry  Proceedings
against  some  brokers  into  the  dealings  in  the
shares of DSQ Software Ltd. during the period
from October 1999 to March 2001. The enquiry
officer observed that these brokers had executed
synchronized transactions for their clients with
other  brokers  of  BSE  and  NSE.  The  brokers
preferred consent proceedings and as a part of
consent terms paid Rs 5.55 crore.

iii) Prevention of Money Laundering

Money  laundering  has  been  globally
recognised as one of the biggest threats posed
to the financial system of a country. The fight
against terrorist financing is another challenge
before  civilised  society.  Rapid  developments
and  greater  integration  of  the  financial

markets  together  with  improvements  in
technology  and  communication  channels
continue  to  pose  serious  challenges  to
authorities and institutions dealing with anti-
money laundering and combating financing of
terrorism (AML and CFT).

The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering  Act,
2002  (PMLA)  and  rules  framed  there-under,
brought into force with effect from July 01, 2005
is a significant step towards India’s joining the
global  war  against  money  laundering  and
financing  of  terrorism.  Subsequent  to
enactment of the Act and notification of rules,
SEBI issued a master circular during the year
containing  key  obligations  required  to  be
fulfilled by securities market intermediaries on
areas  relating  to  AML  and  CFT.  The  master
circular  consolidates  requirements  and
obligations  pertaining  to  the  area  of  AML  and
CFT. The master circular also contains specific
provisions  to  give  effect  to  the  relevant  49
recommendations of the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), wherever applicable to securities
market.  Thus,  the  master  circular  is  a  single
reference  point,  containing  legislative  and
regulatory obligations to be fulfilled by market
intermediaries.

iv) Reporting  Obligations

With  the  joint  efforts  of  SEBI,  Financial
Intelligence  Unit-  India  (FIU-IND),  Association
of  Mutual  Funds  in  India  and  mutual  funds,
further improvements were made in the process
flow  for  generation  of  alerts  based  on  certain
pre-defined parameters, analysis of alerts and
reporting of transactions, wherever necessary.
Similar such exercise was also carried out for
depositories’ transactions and a revised process
was put in place by depositories.

v) Other Initiatives

SEBI hosted a high level U.S Government
delegation  led  by  the  Treasury  Assistant
Secretary  Mr.  Patrick  M.  O’Brien  (Terrorism

79

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

Financing and Financial Crimes) on September
11,  2008.  The  delegation  had  a  detailed  and
constructive  discussion  with  senior  SEBI
officers  regarding  efforts  made  by  India  in
general  and  SEBI  in  particular  in  the  area  of
AML and CFT.

The  investigation  process  has  been
expedited.  In  the  current  year  all  the  93
investigations  pending  as  on  March  31,  2008
and  also  those  initiated  during  the  year  upto
August  31,  2008,  were  completed.  Moreover,
seven  investigations  received  after  August  31,
2008, were also completed by March 31, 2009.
This  indicates  that  in  some  of  the  cases,
investigations were completed within a period
of seven months or shorter period.

i. Nature of Investigation Cases Taken Up

About 68 per cent of the cases taken up for
investigation  in  2008-09  pertain  to  market
manipulation  and  price  rigging  as  against  50
per cent of such cases taken up in the previous
year.  Other  cases  pertain  to  insider  trading,
takeover  violations,  irregularities  in  public
issues, and other irregularities. Since, several
investigation cases were taken up on the basis
of  multiple  allegations  of  violations,  strict
classification under specific category becomes
difficult. Such cases were classified on the basis
of main charge/violations.

ii. Nature of Investigation Cases Completed

During 2008-09, about 74 per cent of the
total  116  cases  in  which  investigation  was
completed pertain to market manipulation and
price rigging, misleading advertisements by the
companies and unfair practices. Other cases in
which  investigation  was  completed  pertain  to
insider 
issue  related
irregularities,  takeover  violations,  non-
compliance of disclosure requirements etc. The
details  of  investigation  cases  taken  up  and
completed are provided in Table 3.18, Chart 3.4

Box 3.1: Investigation in case of Satyam Computer Services Ltd.

In  case  of  Satyam  Computer  Services  Ltd.  SEBI
received  an  e-mail  from  its  chairman  on  January  07,
2009 about the irregularities and overstatements in its
financial statements. SEBI ordered investigation on the
same  day  into  the  dealings  in  the  shares  of  Satyam
Computer  Services  Ltd.  Apart  from  the  investigation,
an  inspection  of  the  books  and  records  of  Satyam
Computer Services Ltd. was also ordered. As the subject
matter  of  the  investigation  pertains  to  financial
statements  of  the  company,  SEBI  also  ordered  an
inspection  of  the  documents  available  with  Price
Waterhouse Coopers in their relation as auditors to the
company. The main focus of SEBI’s investigation was to
detect violation of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and
Unfair  Trade  Practices)  Regulations,  2003  and  SEBI
(Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992.

Investigation team of SEBI commenced investigation
on January 08, 2009 at the office of Satyam Computer
Services Ltd. On the same day, Registrar of Companies
based at Hyderabad moved the Court in co-ordination
with SEBI to seize the books and records of the company.
They  mentioned  in  their  petition  that  the  documents
would also be required by SEBI for their investigation.
Court  acceded  to  the  request  and  ordered  seizure  of
the books and records of the company on January 08,
2009.  Registrar  of  Companies  seized  the  books  and
records on the same day. SEBI has been working jointly
with Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

As  Shri  Ramalinga  Raju,  ex-Chairman  and  his
brother  Shri  Rama  Raju,  Managing  Director,  were

arrested by Police Department, Government of Andhra
Pradesh, SEBI filed a petition before the magistrate to
examine  and  record  their  statements.  As  the  petition
was rejected, SEBI filed appeal before the Hon’ble High
Court on January 28, 2009. Since the matter was to be
heard  after  giving  notice  to  Raju  brothers,  SEBI  filed
appeal before Hon’ble Supreme Court because of urgency
of the matter. The Hon’ble Supreme Court allowed SEBI
on February 03, 2009 to examine and record statements
of  both  Raju  brothers.  Subsequently,  SEBI  completed
this exercise on February 04-06, 2009. Thereafter, SEBI
obtained permission from the magistrate for recording
the  statements  of  Shri  Srinivas  Vadlamani,  ex-chief
financial officer of Satyam, Shri S Gopalakrishnan and
Shri  Srinivas  Talluri,  both  ex-partners  of  Price
Waterhouse  (all  of  them  were  in  prison)  and  this  was
carried out on February 19-20, 2009.

While further investigation is in progress, SEBI had
issued show cause notices to Pricewaterhouse Coopers
and its two aforesaid partners on February 14, 2009
and  also  to  Shri  Ramalinga  Raju,  ex-Chairman,  Shri
Rama Raju, ex-Managing Director and Shri Vadlamani
Srinivas,  ex-CFO  of  Satyam  Computer  Services  Ltd.
on  March  09,  2009  on  the  basis  of  findings  of
investigation carried out so far. SEBI has also shared
the  findings  of  investigation  with  other  regulatory
agencies.  Certain  policy  decisions  arising  out  of  this
investigation  like  peer  review  of  the  working  papers
(relating  to  financial  statements  of  listed  entities)  of
auditors  and  disclosure  of  pledged  shares  by  the
promoters have been taken by SEBI.

Box 3.2: Consent and Compounding Scheme of SEBI

With a view to reduce long drawn litigations arising
out  of  various  actions  initiated,  consent  and
compounding  scheme  has  been  introduced  vide
circular dated April 20, 2007. Under the said scheme,
all  litigations  whether  pending  before  SEBI  or
Adjudicating Officer or Securities Appellate Tribunal
or  Court  are  allowed  to  be  settled  upon  imposing
certain  consent  terms  mutually  agreed  between  the
applicant and SEBI. In order to have an impartial and
unbiased decision in arriving consent terms, SEBI has
appointed High Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC)
headed by a Former High Court Judge and two experts
from financial market as members.

Before the consent orders are passed by SEBI, each
of the consent application is required to pass through
multi-tier  discussion  making.  Upon  receipt  of  the
consent  application  by  the  SEBI,  the  application  is
thoroughly  screened  to  ensure  that  all  the  required
information is provided by the applicant. In case the
applicant  fails  to  furnish  the  required  information/
details/documents,  without  assigning  consent
application number, the application will be returned
to the applicant for rectification. If the application is
found to be complete, a consent application number
is  assigned  to  each  application  and  the  application

along  with  the  case  details,  fact-sheet,  etc.,  will  be
placed  before  the  Internal  Committee  of  Division
Chiefs. The Internal Committee of Division Chiefs after
meeting  the  applicant  examines  whether  the  terms
offered by it are appropriate for settlement.

The terms finally offered by the applicant are placed
before the HPAC which after taking into consideration
facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  and  the  factors
specified in the circular, makes its recommendations
accepting, declining or suggesting modifications in the
terms offered by the applicant. A panel of two Whole
Time  Members 
the
recommendations  of  the  HPAC  and  takes  a  decision
whether to settle the enforcement action on the said
terms or decline the settlement.

considers 

of  SEBI 

On  compliance  of  the  terms  of  settlement,  as
approved by the Panel, a consent order is passed by
SEBI,  if  the  matter  is  pending  before  it.  The  agreed
consent  terms  are  placed  before  the  Securities
Appellate Tribunal or the Courts, as the case may be,
if the matter is pending before them, for appropriate
orders.  In  case  of  Compounding,  the  approved
compounding  terms  are  submitted  before  the  Court
for its consideration.

SEBI  and  Madam  Zarinah  Anwar,  Chairman,
Securities  Commission  of  Malaysia  (SC).  The
Conference  had  three  sessions  namely  -  The
Regulatory  and  Capital  Market  Landscape,
Economic & Market Outlook for India & Malaysia
and  Mutual  Funds  &  Fund  Management.  In
addition,  there  were  two  special  focus  sessions
on Malaysia’s Islamic Finance Proposition: MIFC
and  India’s  Financial  Sector  Integration  with
Rest of World and the Way Forward.

Periodic reports are also generated by SEBI
for internal and external uses including weekly
and monthly reports for the Ministry of Finance.

various  publications  by  different  Government
agencies viz. Handbook of Statistics on Indian
Economy,  Economic  Survey:  Government  of
India,  Economic  Survey:  Government  of

PART FOUR: REGULATORY CHANGES

The Board has taken various measures in
the interest of investors in securities market and
for  development  of  the  securities  market  and
various  regulations  have  been  notified  in  this
regard.  The  details  of  such  regulations  are  as
follows:

1. REGULATORY  DEVELOPMENTS

I. New Regulations

i.

The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of
India  (Public  Offer  and  Listing  of
Securitised  Debt 
Instruments)
Regulations, 2008

The  Securities  Laws  (Amendment)  Act,
2004  amended  the  Securities  Contracts
(Regulation) Act, 1956 [SC(R)A] to enable SEBI
to  provide  for  disclosure-based  regulation  for
public  issue    or  listing  of  securitised  debt
instruments on the recognised stock exchanges
with  a view to develop market for securitised
debt instruments. Accordingly, on May 26, 2008
SEBI  notified  the  regulations,  inter-alia,
covering  cost  of  transactions,  competition
policy, the professional expertise of credit rating
agencies,  disclosures  and  obligations  of  the
parties  involved  in  the  transaction  and  the
interest  of  investors  in  such  instruments.
Salient features of the SEBI (Public Offer and
Listing  of  Securitised  Debt  Instruments)
Regulations, 2008 are as follows:

of a trust, the trustees thereof will require
registration from SEBI.  The registration
granted to a trustee shall be permanent
subject to compliance with the provisions
of the Securities Contracts (Regulation)
Rules and the regulations and payment
of appropriate fees.

If a debenture trustee registered with
SEBI  or  a  securitisation  company  or
an  asset  reconstruction  company
registered with Reserve Bank of India

such shall be required.

c) The  securitised  debt  instruments
issued to public or listed on recognised
stock exchange shall acknowledge the
beneficial  interest  of  the  investors  in
underlying  debt  or  receivables
assigned to the issuer. The regulations
provide  flexibility  in  terms  of  pay
through / pass through structures and
do not restrict any particular mode.

d) The assignment of assets to the SPDE
shall  be  a  true  sale.  The  debt  or
receivables  assigned  to  the  issuer
should  be  expected  to  generate
identifiable cash flows for the purpose
of  servicing  the  instrument  and  the
originator 
valid
enforceable interests in the assets and
cash  flow  out  of  assets  prior  to
securitisation.

should  have 

e) The issuer shall be bankruptcy remote
from the originator. Originator shall be
an independent entity from the issuer
and its trustees and the originator and
its  associates  shall  not  exercise  any
control  over  the  issuer.  However,  the
originator  may  be  appointed  as  a
servicer.  The  issuer  may  appoint  any
other person as servicer in respect of
any of its schemes to co-ordinate with
the obligors, manage the said pool and
collection  therefrom,  administer  the
cash  flows  of  asset  pool,  effect
distribution  to  investors  and  make
reinvestments.  The  issuer  shall  not
acquire  any  debt  or  receivables  from
any originator who is part of the same
group  or  which  is  under  the  same
management 
trustee.
Regulations require strict segregation
of assets of each scheme.

facts including financials of the issuer
and the originator, quality of the asset
pool,  various  kinds  of  risks,  credit
ratings  including  unaccepted  ratings,
arrangements  made

the routine disclosures relating to issue,
offer period, application, etc.

g) Rating  from  atleast  two  credit  rating
agencies is mandatory and all ratings
including unaccepted ratings shall be
disclosed in the offer documents. The
rating  rationale  should  include
reference to the quality of the said pool
and strength of cash flows, originator

j)

k)

The draft offer document shall be filed
with  SEBI  atleast  15  days  before
opening of the issue.

In case of public issuances listing will
be mandatory. The instruments issued
on private placement basis may also be
listed  subject  to  the  compliance  of
simplified provisions of the regulations.
The securitised debt instruments issued
to the public or listed on a recognised
stock exchange in accordance with these
regulations shall be freely transferable.

It  has  been  proposed  to  introduce
simplified  and  relaxed 
listing
agreement. Listing of private placement
is  also  permitted  subject  to  the
compliance of simplified provisions of
the 
listing  agreement  and  the
regulations.  The  simplified  listing
agreement is under preparation.

ii. The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of
India  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Debt
Securities) Regulations, 2008

In  order  to  facilitate  development  of  a
vibrant primary market for corporate bonds in
India, SEBI has notified Regulations for Issue
and  Listing  for  Debt  Securities  to  provide  for
simplified  regulatory  framework  for  issuance
and  listing  of  non-convertible  debt  securities
(excluding  bonds  issued  by  Governments)
issued  by  any  company,  public  sector
undertaking  or  statutory  corporations.  The
Regulations  do  not  apply  to  issue  and  listing
of,  securitised  debt  instruments  and  security
receipts  for  which  separate  regulatory  regime
is in place.

The  Regulations  provide  for  rationalised
disclosure requirements for public issues and
flexibility  to  issuers  to  structure  their
instruments and decide on the mode of offering,
without diluting the areas of regulatory concern.
In case of public issues, while the disclosures
specified  under  Schedule  II  of  the  Companies
Act, 1956 shall be made, the Regulations require
additional disclosures about the issuer and the
instrument  such  as  nature  of  instruments,
rating rationale, face value, issue size, etc.

While the requirement of filing of draft offer
documents with SEBI for observations has been
done away with, emphasis has been placed on
due diligence, adequate disclosures, and credit
rating  as  the  cornerstones  of  transparency.
Regulations prescribe certifications to be filed
by  merchant  bankers  in  this  regard.  The
Regulations  emphasize  on  the  role  and
obligations of the debenture trustees, execution
of trust deed, creation of security and creation
of debenture redemption reserve in terms of the
Companies Act.

The  Regulations  enable  electronic
disclosures. The draft offer document needs to
be  filed  with  the  designated  stock  exchange
through a SEBI registered merchant banker who

92

PART FOUR: REGULATORY CHANGES

shall be responsible for due diligence exercise
in  the  issue  process  and  the  draft  offer
document  shall  be    placed  on  the  websites  of
the  stock  exchanges  for  a  period  of  seven
working  days  inviting  comments.  The
documents  shall  be  downloadable  in  PDF  or
HTML 
formats.  The  requirements 
for
advertisements have also been simplified.

While listing of securities issued to the public
is mandatory, the issuers may also list their debt
securities  issued  on  private  placement  basis
subject  to  compliance  of  simplified  regulatory
requirements as provided in the Regulations. The
Regulations provide an enabling framework for
listing  of  debt  securities  issued  on  a  private
placement basis, even in cases where the equity
of the issuer is not listed. NBFCs and PFIs are
exempted from mandatory listing. However, they
may  list  their  privately  placed  debt  securities
subject  to  compliance  with  the  simplified
requirements and Listing Agreement.

iii. The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of
India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008

SEBI  has  undertaken  a  project  to
consolidate  the  common  requirements  which
apply to all intermediaries. Given the fact that
many  requirements  and  obligations  of  most
intermediaries are common, SEBI has notified
the  new  Regulations  on  May  26,  2008.  The
salient features of the Regulations are as under:

a) The  Regulations  put  in  place  a
comprehensive  framework  which  will

h) University 

funds,  endowments,
foundations,  charitable  trusts  and

i)

j)

k)

iv. Amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Depositories

and Participants) Regulations, 1996

The  SEBI  (Depositories  and  Participants)
Regulations, 1996 has been amended on August

the depository shall satisfy the Board that it has
a mechanism in place to ensure that the interest
of the persons buying and selling securities held

shall  register  the  transfer  of  a  security  in  the
name of the transferee only after the depository
is satisfied that payment for such transfer has
been made. Amendment to regulation 32 of the
Depositories and Participants Regulations has
done  away  with  the  requirement  of  the
depositories to ensure payments before effecting
the  transfer  in  the  demat  system  as  the
Depositories Act does not cast an obligation on
the  depositories  to  ensure  that  payment  has
been  made  in  respect  of  transfer  of  security.
However,  depository  is  expected  to  effect  the
transfer of securities diligently.

Managers) Regulations, 1993

been  relaxed  by  providing  that  two
persons  who  should  be 
in  the
employment of Portfolio Manager should
have experience in “related activities” in
portfolio management or stock broking
or investment management.

b) Networth 

for  carrying  portfolio
management service has been increased
from Rs.50 lakh to Rs.2 crore.

c) Capital  adequacy  requirement  for
portfolio  manager  shall  have  to  be
fulfilled separately and independently
of any other intermediary activity.

d)

e)

In  order  to  ensure  that  portfolio
management activities do not partake
the  character  of  a  mutual  fund,
amendment  has  further  clarified  that
portfolio  manager  shall  not  hold  the
securities  of  clients  in  its  own  name
either  by  virtue  of  contracts  or
otherwise. The word ‘scheme’ wherever
occurring  in  the  regulation  has  also
been deleted to ensure the aforesaid.

Since  the  registration  as  portfolio
manager  can  be  sought  by  only  a
company reference to partner or sole
proprietor has also been removed from
the regulation.

vi. Amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of

Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992

Aggrieved  by  the  Fee  Liability  Statements
issued  by  the  SEBI,  the  appellants  had  filed
separate  appeals  before  the  Hon’ble  SAT,
contending  that,  the  benefit  of  fee  continuity
should have been granted by the Board for the
reason  that  the  Membership  Card  was
transmitted  to  them  upon  the  death  of  the
erstwhile  stock  broker.  The  Hon’ble  SAT,  vide
common order dated 12th May, 2006 had held
that, when a stock broker who is a member of
an  exchange  dies,  his  heir  or  successor  who
wants  to  be  admitted  as  a  member  of  the
exchange  has  to  apply  to  the  exchange  afresh
and the exchange has full discretion to decide
whether to admit him or not as a member and
the same cannot be treated as the continuity of

membership.    Against  the  said  orders  of  the
SAT,  appeals  were  filed  before  the  Hon’ble
Supreme  Court.  The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court,
vide order dated 15th May, 2008 had dismissed
the appeals and held that, it is abundantly clear
that no provision of succession to registration
is permissible. It was further held that, in order
to operate in the stock exchange, the broker has
to obtain a fresh registration from the SEBI and
for the first five years, he would be required to
pay the quantum of fee  linked  to  the turnover
and  thereafter  at  the  flat rate of Rs. 5,000/- in
order to keep the registration in force.

Seksaria client of (Brics Securities Ltd.) not to

directly or indirectly, till further directions, for
misutilising  the  IPO  process  of  IDFC,  by
fraudulently  cornering  the  portion  of  shares
reserved for the retail individual investors. Vide
the  said  order,  the  Stock  exchanges  and  the
Depositories  were  directed  to  ensure  that  the
directions  issued  in  the  order  were  strictly
enforced.  The  said  order  was  posted  on  the
website of SEBI on January 12, 2006 itself and
was also communicated to the media through a
press  release  on  the  same  day.  The  financial
dailies reported about the order on the next day.

order dated August 13, 2007. Aggrieved by the
said order of Adjudicating Officer, the appellant
filed an appeal before SAT which by an order
dated  October 29, 2007 dismissed the appeal.

Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  SAT,  M/s  Brics
Securities preferred the present appeal before
Supreme Court which also dismissed the appeal
agreeing  with  the  findings  that      M/s  Brics
Securities Ltd had failed to exercise due skill,
care and diligence in executing transactions for
its  client Mr. Manojdev Seksaria on  January

iii. Rajiv B Gandhi & ors vs. SEBI: C A No.

The appeal was filed against the order dated
9th  May  2008  upholding  the  order  dated  30th
November  2006  passed  by  the  Adjudicating
Officer of SEBI against the appellants viz., Shri
Rajiv B Gandhi, Smt Sandhya Gandhi and Smt.
Amishi Gandhi, thereby imposing a penalty of
Rs 5 lakh each for indulging in insider trading
in the scrip of Wockhardt Ltd. The investigations
by SEBI revealed that the appellants had dealt
in the shares of Wockhardt Ltd on the basis of
unpublished price sensitive information relating
to the quarterly un-audited financial results in
violation  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider
Trading) Regulations, 1992.

The Hon’ble SAT vide order dated 9th May
2008  dismissed  the  appeal  and  upheld  the
impugned  order  of  Adjudicating  officer.  While
dismissing the appeal, the Hon’ble SAT observed
that the appellants being insiders, traded on the
basis of unpublished price sensitive information
in  their  possession  and  thus  had  violated  SEBI
(Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992.

As  against  the  SAT  order,  the  appellants
preferred an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of India which also dismissed the appeal
vide order dated September 11, 2008.

iv. SEBI  vs.  Goldman  Sachs  Investments

(Mauritius) Ltd:  C.A No. 5171/2008

SEBI circulars dated October 31, 2001 and
August 8, 2003 required an undertaking to the
effect that the sub-account has not issued any
off  shore  derivative  instruments  (ODI)  to  any
OCB.  Goldman  Sachs  Investment  (Mauritius)
Ltd.  (GSIML)    is  a  sub-account  and  Goldman
Sachs  International  Ltd.  (GSIL)  which  is  an
affiliate  of  GSIML  issued  off-shore  derivative
instruments  to  an  Overseas  Corporate  Body
(OCB) namely Magnus Capital Corporation Ltd.
(MCCL),  a  Mauritius  based  entity.  However,
GSIML  submitted  a  modified  undertaking  to
SEBI that it has not issued any ODI to any OCB.
The  Adjudication  officer,  SEBI      imposed  a
penalty of one crore on GSIML for violating the
undertaking given by it. On appeal before SAT,
Hon’ble SAT vide its order dated 15th May, 2008,
allowed the appeal and imposed Rs one lakh as
costs on SEBI.

SAT held that since there is no substantive
law banning the issuance of ODIs to OCBs , the
Board  is  not  justified    in  asking  for  such  an
undertaking  prescribed  by the Circular.  SAT
also  held  that  Reg.  15(A)  of  FII  Regulations
restricts FII/Sub accounts to issue the ODIs only
to the regulated entities which comply with the
Know  Your  Client  requirement.      SAT  further
held  that,  it  was  not  fair  and  reasonable  to
charge the appellant, given the fact that the list
of OCBs was never in the public domain so that
GSIML could have known the status of Magnus
Capital  Corporation  Ltd.  While  disposing  the
appeal SAT also made certain adverse remarks
against the Adjudicating officer, SEBI.

On  appeal  filed  by  SEBI  before  Hon’ble
Supreme  court    challenging  the  imposition  of
costs and recording of adverse remarks against
the Adjudicating officer, the Supreme court vide
its order dated February 02, 2009 expunged the
adverse  remarks    against  the  Adjudicating
officer    observing  that  they  are  uncalled  for.
Further  the  Supreme  Court  recorded  the

v.

Shriyam Broking Intermediary vs. SEBI

Shri  Devesh  D  Chaturvedi  was  a
proprietary  member  of  the  Calcutta  Stock
Exchange (CSE) and a certificate of registration
was  granted  by  SEBI  on  November  23,  1994.
This proprietary membership was transferred
to  the  corporate  entity  Shriyam  and  the  said
corporate  entity  got  registered  with  SEBI  on
December 31, 1997. Shriyam is a wholly owned
subsidiary  of  M/s  Shriyam  Securities  and
Finance  Ltd.  where  the  erstwhile  proprietary
member  is  the  whole  time  Chairman  and
Director.

SEBI,  vide  Notification  dated  21.01.1998
amended  the  Schedule  III  of  SEBI  (Stock
Brokers  & Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992 by
introducing a new Para 4 to the said schedule
and  thereby  granted  the  fee  continuity  benefit
to those brokers who converts its partnership
or proprietary membership card to a corporate
entity.  Further,  SEBI  vide  circular  dated
06.02.2004 had clarified that, the fee continuity
benefit  shall  be  available  to  those  who  have
converted  themselves  into  corporate  entity
between April 01, 1997 and January 21, 1998
provided the converted corporate entity satisfies
the conditions in spirit.

In  the  captioned  matter,  the  CSE  vide  its
letter dated November 20, 2003 while providing
the details of conversion of membership, stated
that the erstwhile proprietor was a whole time
director  for  the  relevant  three  years  period
however, he was holding only two shares out of
two  crore  equity  shares.  Accordingly,  the
erstwhile  member  did  not  satisfy  one  of  the
conditions  prescribed  in  the  said  Para  4.
Further, the appellant did not come within the
relaxation  provided  by  the  circular  dated
06.02.2004  i.e.  ‘in  spirit’  since  the  joint
shareholders did not come within the meaning
of  ‘close  relatives’  for  the  purpose  of

The Hon’ble SAT had dismissed the appeal
filed by the company vide order dated 19.02.2008
and held that, “This is not a case where Chaturvedi
corporatised  himself  and  then  transferred  his
broking  business  to  that  new  entity.  He  merely
transferred his card to an already existing stock
broker. Paragraph 4 does not grant the benefit of
exemption  when  a  membership  card  is
transferred  by  one  broker  to  another  which  is
the case here.” The appellant had challenged the
said order of the Hon’ble SAT before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court and the Hon’ble Supreme Court
vide  order  dated  05.05.2008  had  upheld  the
order of the Hon’ble SAT.

II. Securities Appellate Tribunal

i. National  Securities  Depository  Ltd.
(NSDL)/  Central  Depository  Services
(India)  Ltd.  (CDSL)  vs.  Adjudicating
Officer  (AO),  SEBI:  Appeal  Nos.68  and
69 of 2007

Adjudicating  Officer,  SEBI  imposed
penalties  of  Rs.  5  crore  and  Rs.3  crore
respectively on NSDL and CDSL under section
15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 and section 19G of
the  Depositories  Act,  1996  for  the  alleged
irregularities  leading  to  opening  of  multiple
demat  accounts,  non  compliance  with  Know
Your Client (KYC) norms etc. in the matter of Initial
Public Offerings during the period 2003-2005.

Vide  orders  dated  January  14,  2009,  the
Hon’ble  Securities  Appellate  Tribunal  (SAT)
while setting aside the penalty imposed by the
Adjudicating Officer held, inter-alia, as under:

a) Depositories have only a very limited role
in  the  process  of  compliance  of  KYC
norms  which 
the
responsibility of Depository participants.

is  squarely 

b) There is no material in regard to any
irregularity in the maintenance of the
data base by the depositories.

103

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

c) Bye  law  10.2  of  NSDL  provides  for
internal  control  standards.    With
regard to CDSL, it was held that it is
not  open  to  SEBI  to  first  approve
certain  bye  laws  and  then  form  an
opinion  that  these  are  not  adequate
and  penalise  the  framers  of  the  bye
laws for the perceived inadequacy.

d) There is no apparent reason to doubt
the  judgment  of  the  depository  in
deciding the right kind of penalty for
the  lapses  noticed  by  it  during  the
inspection of the DPs.

e) Advance supply of BO IDs by CDSL did
not  facilitate  opening  of  fictitious
accounts.

The SAT further observed that “In fact, the
Board  and  the  two  Depositories  have  to  work
together in tandem to secure the interests of the
investors  and  the  securities  market.  The
Depositories  are  also  very  important  and
responsible market intermediaries and they are
not expected to work at cross purposes with the
Board. In the case of IPO scam too, the immediate
remedy and the further follow up action ought to
be decided by the Board and the two Depositories
together rather than through the Board’s punitive
action against the former (Depositories). Most of
the  data  on  the  basis  of  which  the  Board  has
conducted investigations into the IPO scam and
fixed  responsibilities  on  the  key  operators  and
the financiers has emanated from the data bases
of the two Depositories. Having relied upon and
utilised  such  data  gleaned  from  the  two
Depositories without having any doubts about its
integrity, we do not think it is open for the Board
to allege lack of data integrity in respect of NSDL.”

ii. Arun Kumar & Others vs.  SEBI:  Appeal

No. 62 of 2008

The  above  appeal  was  filed  against  the
order  of  the  Adjudicating  Officer  dated  27th
February  2008  wherein  a  penalty  of
Rs.25,00,000 (Rupees twenty five lakh only) was

imposed  on  the  appellants  for  violation  of
Regulation  10  read  with  Regulation  14(2)  of
SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and
Takeovers)  Regulations,  1997  (for  short
‘Takeover  Regulations’).  The  main  issue  for
consideration  was  whether  appellants  have
triggered Regulation 10 of Takeover Regulations
on the date of allotment of warrants to them or
whether  Regulation  10  got  triggered  on  the
conversion of the warrants into shares carrying
voting rights.

In its order dated 13th October 2008, it was
held  by  SAT  that  Regulation  10  of  Takeover
Regulations  gets  triggered  when  the  acquirer
becomes entitled to exercise 15 per cent or more
of  the  voting  rights  in  a  company.  It  does  not
get  triggered  when  an  acquirer  acquires
warrants. Although warrants which were issued
and allotted to the appellants on 17th June 2002
were ‘shares’ within the meaning of the takeover
code as defined in Regulation 2(1)(k) but these
did not confer any voting rights on them with
the result that their voting rights continued to
remain at 12.84 per cent which they already had
prior to the issue of warrants. Since the voting
rights of the appellants were less than 15 per
cent  even  on  the  acquisition  of  warrants,
Regulation 10 did not get triggered when these
were  issued.  These  warrants  were  converted
into equity shares on 11th December 2003. On
the  acquisition  of  these  shares  which  carried
voting  rights,  the  total  voting  rights  of  the
appellants  increased  to  20.76  per  cent  of  the
paid-up  capital  of  the  company  and  this
triggered  Regulation  10  as  the  acquisition
entitled  the  appellants  to  exercise  more  than
15 per cent of the voting rights in the company.
According to the mandate of Regulation 14(2),
the  acquirers  were  required  to  make  a  public
announcement atleast four working days before
they  acquire  the  voting  rights  upon  the
conversion of warrants. Not having done so, the
appellants violated provisions of Regulation 10
read with Regulation 14(2) of the Takeover Code
and made themselves liable for the imposition

104

PART FOUR: REGULATORY CHANGES

of  penalty  under  section  15H(ii)  SEBI  Act.
Accordingly, vide order dated 13th October 2008,
SAT dismissed the said appeal and upheld the
order of Adjudicating Officer.

iii. M/s MCS Ltd vs. SEBI : Appeal No. 107

of 2008

SEBI received complaints from some of the
issuer  companies  alleging  that  on  the
termination of their agreement with MCS Ltd.,
the  latter  did  not  hand  over  the  records/data
and other relating documents which were in its
possession  in  its  capacity  as  Share  Transfer
Agent. SEBI vide order dated 11th August, 2008
directed MCS Ltd. to transfer all data/records
and  issue  no  objection  certificates  to  the
companies  and  the  depository.  MCS  while
complying  with  the  direction  of  SEBI  filed  an
appeal before the Hon’ble SAT contending that
SEBI  should  have  also  directed  the  issuer
companies to pay the outstanding dues resulting
from  the  services  provided  by  MCS  as  Share
Transfer Agent.

The SAT vide order dated 26th September,
2008 while disposing of the appeal, rejected the
contention  of  MCS  and  held  that  the  code  of
conduct  prescribed  for  STAs  requires  that  as
and  when  the  contract  with  the  issuer
companies  is  terminated,  the  former  should
handover  to  the  latter  the  data/records  and
other  documents  that  may  be  in  their
possession.  SAT  held  that  since  this  was  not
done, the Board rightly directed the appellant
to  return  the  records  and  the  data.  The  SAT
further  held  that  it  would  be  open  to  MCS  to
resort to proceedings in an appropriate forum
in  accordance  with  law  to  receive  those  dues
and the Board cannot take upon it to adjudicate
such contractual disputes between the parties.

iv. Bonanza  Biotech  Ltd.  (BBL)  vs.  SEBI  :

Appeal No.110 of 2007

SEBI  carried  out  investigations  into  the
dealings in the shares of Design Auto Systems

Ltd (DASL) for the period between August 2001
and January 2002. A preferential allotment on
swap basis of 10 crore DASL shares were made
to  BBL.  MPSE  granted  listing  permission  but
trading  permission  for  these  shares  was  not
granted  by  it.  BSE  granted  neither  listing  nor
trading permission for the aforementioned 10
crore shares. Following the allotment the shares
were dematerialised and credited to the demat
account  of  BBL  with  CDSL.  6  crore  unlisted
shares  of  DASL  were  subsequently  offloaded
by BBL using the BSE trading platform. As a
result  of  intervention  of  BSE  9,01,78,926
shares out of the 10 crore shares were frozen,
but the remaining 98,21,074 shares were sold
to lay investors.

In  this  background,  SEBI  vide  its  order
dated  March  6,  2007  directed  BBL  and  its
directors not to access the capital market for a
period of 7 years for violation of regulations 3,
4(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the SEBI (Prohibition of
Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices)
Regulations, 1995. SEBI also directed BBL to
purchase  an  equivalent  amount  of  98,21,074
shares of DASL from the public shareholders.

Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant
filed  an  appeal  before  the  Hon’ble  SAT.  The
Hon’ble SAT while upholding SEBI’s order held
that the appellants acting in concert with DASL
and its directors had played a big fraud on the
lay investors and the securities market and in
the  process  duped  a  large  number  of  public
investors. Public investors have to be protected
and the most reasonable way of it is to give them
an opportunity to exit if they so choose.

v. D-Link  India  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI  :  Appeal

No.120 of 2007

SEBI vide its order dated August 21, 2007
prohibited the appellant company from buying,
selling  or  dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner
directly or indirectly for a period of one month
for the violation of Regulation 5 (1) (a) of SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade

105

ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09

Practices) Regulations, 1995 as D-Link (India)
Ltd  had  no  intention  of  buying  back  its
securities despite having passed a resolution in
the EGM and having enough opportunity to do
the same. Such resolution was for the purpose
of misleading the investors.

Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant
filed  an  appeal  before  the  Hon’ble  SAT.  The
Hon’ble  SAT  while  setting  aside  SEBI’s  order
held that there was no material on the record
to show that the appellant had no intention to
buy-back  its  shares  when  the  shareholders
passed the resolution in September 2002.

vi. Vintel  Securities  Pvt.  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI  :

Appeal No. 91 of 2008

During the course of investigations initiated
by  SEBI  into  the  dealings  in  the  scrip  of
Robinson  Worldwide  Trade  Limited,
summonses were issued to Vintel Securities Pvt.
Ltd.  (hereinafter referred to as the “appellant”)
to  furnish  information  to  the  investigating
officer.  The  first  summons  was  issued  on
December  27,  2004.  The  appellant  did  not
respond  to  this  summons  and  in  the  absence
of any proof of acknowledgement available on
the  record,  the  investigating  officer  issued
another summons on February 25, 2005 which
were admittedly received by the appellant. The
appellant  sent  a  letter  dated  4th  March,  2005
requesting  for  an  adjournment.  Time  was
granted but the appellant failed to furnish the
requisite  information.  Yet  another  summons
was issued on 10th November, 2005 requiring
the  appellant  to  furnish  the  information  by
November  17,  2005.  Again,  there  was  no
response  from  the  appellant.  Yet  another
summonses was issued on 18th January, 2006
and  despite  all  these  summons,  the  appellant
failed to furnish the requisite information.

In  view  of  the  above,  the  Board  initiated
adjudication proceedings against the Appellant
and  the  Adjudicating  Officer  issued  a  show
cause notice on 19th September, 2006 which was

received by the appellant and time was sought
for filing its reply. Admittedly, no reply was filed
in spite of the fact that the Adjudicating Officer
issued  three  notices  for  the  purpose.  The
Adjudicating  Officer  found  that  the  appellant
failed to furnish the information sought and vide
order  dated  February  28,  2008,  imposed  a
monetary penalty of Rs. 5 lakh on the appellant.

An  appeal  was  filed  before  Securities
Appellate Tribunal, against the aforesaid order.
Ld.  SAT  after  hearing  the  arguments  on  both
sides,  dismissed  the  appeal  and  held  that  the
appellant was trying to dodge the regulator and
was avoiding to furnish the information sought
from  it.    Ld.  SAT  also  observed  that  the
Investigating  Officer  had  only  sought
preliminary details from the appellant which it
deliberately  failed  to  furnish  and  that  such  a
failure on the part of a market player has to be
viewed  seriously  as  it  hampers  the  regulator
from  carrying  on  its  statutory  duty  of
investigating into the market irregularities.

vii. Sohel Malik vs. SEBI : Appeal No. 108

of 2008

The appeal was filed by Shri Sohel Malik
(Appellant/Acquirer)  against  the  observation
letter dated September 9, 2008 issued by SEBI
in response to the draft letter of offer filed by
the Appellant with SEBI in terms of Securities
and Exchange   Board   of India   (Substantial
Acquisition      of      Shares        and  Takeovers)
Regulations, 1997 in consequence of acquisition
of  29,55,000  equity  shares  of  Genesys
International  Corporation  Ltd.  (target
company). The said shares were allotted to the
Appellant  pursuant  to  conversion  of  warrants
issued to the Appellant on preferential basis by
the target company. Vide said observation letter,
the Appellant was asked to recalculate the offer
price  by  reckoning  the  date  of  Public
Announcement  as  the  reference  date  in  terms
of  regulation  20.  The  issue  was  whether  the
reference  date  for  computing  the  offer  price
should be the date of allotment of warrants, or

106

PART FOUR: REGULATORY CHANGES

the  date  of  allotment  of  shares  in  exercise  of
the option to convert the warrants into shares,
or the date of the Public Announcement.

The  Hon’ble  SAT  while  dismissing  the
appeal vide order dated 15th October, 2008 held
that the reference date for computing the offer
price should be the date of the meeting of the
Board of Directors of the target company when
the shares were allotted pursuant to exercise of
option to convert the remaining warrants into
shares by the acquirer. It was further held that
the Takeover Regulations are triggered only with
the  acquisition  of  voting  rights  which  did  not
take  place  when  the  warrants  were  issued.  In
this case voting rights were acquired only when
shares  were  actually  allotted.  Therefore,  the
reference  date  for  computing  the  offer  price
should be the date of the Board meeting when
the shares were allotted.

The Hon’ble SAT further directed SEBI to
issue  a  fresh  communication  to  the  Appellant
within a period of two weeks from the date of
the order i.e. 15th October, 2008 incorporating
28th June, 2008 (date of Board Meeting) as the
reference date for calculation of the offer price.
The  Hon’ble  SAT  also  directed  SEBI  to  allow
the  Appellant,  a  reasonable  time,  for  opening
the  offer  before  imposing  the  liability  for
payment  of  interest,  keeping  in  view  the  time
required for the amended public offer to reach
the shareholders and the time required by them
to consider their option afresh, given the change
in the offer price.

viii. Bellary  Steel  &  Alloys  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI  :
Appeal No. 67 of 2008 &  Mr. P. S. Murali
vs. SEBI: Appeal No. 77 of 2008

SEBI  conducted  investigations  into  the
alleged  irregularities  in  the  scrip  of  Bellary
Steels and Alloys Ltd. and found that the there
were two sets of physical shares certificates with
identical  details,  bearing  the  same  distinctive
numbers.  One  set  of  share  certificates  were
pledged  with  Karnataka  State  Financial

Corporation  to  obtain  loan  facilities  while  the
other set was lodged for transfer fraudulently.
On  completion  of  investigations,  SEBI  barred
the Appellants from dealings in securities for a
period  of  5  years  vide  order  dated  March  28,
2008 for the alleged violations of Regulations 3
& 4 (2) (h) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent
and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities
Market)  Regulations  2003.  Challenging  the
order of SEBI the aforesaid appeals were filed.

SAT  vide  common  order  dated  November
18,  2008  upheld  the  order  of  SEBI  and
dismissed both the appeals and imposed costs
of Rs. 50,000 on the Appellants on the grounds
that the company and the Pledgors had connived
in  fraudulently  issuing  duplicate  share
certificates that were subsequently transferred
and dematerialized.  Aggrieved by the said order
of  Hon’ble  SAT,  the  appellants  filed  appeals
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, which were
also dismissed.

ix. Mega Corporation Ltd vs. SEBI : Appeal

No.60 of 2008

Vide order dated February 28, 2008, SEBI
had  restrained  the  appellant  company  from
accessing  the  capital  market  for  one  year  for
the alleged violation of the provisions of SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade
Practices)  Regulations  for  price  rigging  and
manipulation  in  its  shares,  making  false  and
misleading  announcements  to  arouse  the
interest  of  investors  in  the  scrip  and
manipulation in the annual accounts.  Vide its
order dated October 15, 2008, the Hon’ble SAT
set aside the order of SEBI by holding that inter-
se connection amongst the entities who allegedly
traded in the scrip was not established and the
public  announcement    of  the  companies  were
in anyway required to be disclosed to the stock
exchanges in terms of the Listing Agreement.  It
was also held that there is no evidence regarding
the  manipulation  in  the  books  of  accounts  of
the  company  to  lure  the  investors  to  trade  in
the shares.

x. Libord  Finance  Ltd.  vs.  SEBI  :  Appeal
No.  37  of  2008  &  Libord  Securities  vs.
SEBI:  Appeal No.24 of 2008

This  appeal  is  against  the  Order  passed
by  SEBI  dated  February  18,  2008  whereby
Libord  Finance  Ltd.  (Merchant  Banker)
restrained from accessing the securities market
and  also  prohibited  from  buying,  selling  or
otherwise  dealing  or  associating  with  the
securities market, for a period of one month,
for the alleged irregularities in the scrip of M/
s Mazda Fabrics & Processors Ltd. at the time
of IPO.

It is alleged that the Appellants belonged
to  the  same  group  which  had  Merchant
Banking  and  broking  license.  The  Merchant
Banker  was  involved  in  the  irregularities
involved  in  the  IPO  while  the  broking  firm  is
alleged to have committed irregularities in the
trading in the scrip subsequent to listing.  SEBI
issued the impugned directions under section
11B  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  as  the  certificates  of
Registration of the Appellants were not in force
at the relevant time.

SAT  vide  order  dated  March  31,  2008
allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned
orders by observing that SEBI did not take any
action  against  the  Merchant  Banker  for  the
reason  that  its  certificates  of  registration  was
not  in  force.    There  was  a  delay  of  8  years  in
taking action and the impugned directions are
not called for in the circumstances as it would
affect all other activities in the market for which
the appellant may be holding a valid certificate.
SEBI  should  not  resort  to  proceedings  under
section 11B for the violation of Merchant Banker
Regulations unless a regulatory order also needs
to be passed.

SEBI has filed an appeal before the Hon’ble

Supreme Court against the order of SAT.

SEBI vide its order dated January 24,2007
had  restrained  the  appellant  from  dealing  in
securities  for  2  years  for  the  alleged  irregular
transactions  in  the  shares  of  Aftek  Infosys,
Global  Trust  Bank  and  Ranbaxy  Laboratories
Ltd in violation of the (Prohibition of Fraudulent
and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations.  It is
alleged that the appellant who is an NBFC had
lent  shares  in  contravention  of  stock  lending
and  borrowing  scheme  to  entities  related  to
Ketan  Parekh  (KP)  and  had  manipulated  the
market. The Hon’ble SAT vide its order dated
July  29,  2008  has  allowed  the  appeal  by
observing  that  merely  because  the  Appellant
advanced  loans  to  KP  entities  in  the  ordinary
course  of  business,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the
Appellant had aided and abetted those entities
in manipulating the market.  The SAT relied on
its earlier order in Appeal no.135/05, wherein
it  was  held  that  the  appellant  and  KP  entities
cannot be treated as persons acting in concert.
However,  the  Hon’ble  SAT  has  warned  the
Appellant for the contravention of the Securities
Lending Scheme, 1997.

xii. Satyanarayana  Agarwal vs. SEBI : Appeal

No. 94 of 2007

Vide  its  order  dated  February  20,  2007,
SEBI  imposed  penalty  of  Rs.1  crore  on  the
Appellants for trading in the shares of Bhoruka
Financial  Services  Ltd  in  violations  of  the
provisions  of  Section  19  and  23H  of  SCR  Act
1956.  The shares were traded in Magadh Stock
Exchange  which  was  not  a  recognized  stock
exchange at that time.  They were listed under
the  permitted  category  at  Magadh  Stock
Exchange.

The Hon’ble SAT allowed the appeal on the
ground  that  the  Appellant  could  not  have
violated  Section  19  of  the  Securities  Contract
(Regulations)  Act,  1956  since  MSEA  was  a
recognized stock exchange and shown as such

108

PART FOUR: REGULATORY CHANGES

on the website of the SEBI and permission was
granted by the Exchange to trade in the shares
of Bhoruka Financial Services Ltd.  Therefore,
the  appellant  would  not  have  been  faulted  for
the trades.

These  appeals  were  filed  challenging  the
orders  dated  31 st  January  2007  of  SEBI,
restraining the appellants from associating with
the capital market related activities for a period
of five years for violation of regulation 3, 6(a),
(c) and (d) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent
and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 1995.
It was alleged that the appellants have allotted
shares on preferential basis without receipt of
applications/ allotment money and these shares
were  allegedly  sold  in  off  market  transactions
by  the  allottees  to  various  entities  including
Ketan  Parekh  entities  who  later  sold  them  in
the  secondary  market  and  manipulated  the
price of the scrip of Padmini Technologies Ltd.
The shares were listed on the stock exchanges
by presenting false certificates about receipt of
funds.  After  the  original  allottees  received  the
money  against  sale  of  their  shares  by  Ketan
Parekh related entities in the secondary market,
the cheques were issued by the original allottees
for  payment  against  the  application/allotment
and were presented and realized.

The Hon’ble SAT vide its order dated 29th
August 2008 while dismissing the appeals filed
by  the  appellants  held  that  Padmini
Technologies was a party to the whole game plan
which resulted in the manipulation of the price
of its scrip by Ketan Parekh and his associated

entities  and  the  allottees  were  mere  name
lenders and the shares were listed based on the
false certificates issued by the company.

xiv. Sasken  Communication  Technologies

To 
immediately.

the 

buyback

While allowing the appeal, the Hon’ble SAT
in its order dated September 26, 2008 held that
SEBI had no authority to issue direction to the
appellant that the company should exhaust the
entire buy-back limit of Rs. 40 crore as offered
to the public shareholders. SAT also noted that
it is no part of SEBI’s duty to advise a purchaser
regarding the price at which he needs to put in
his  buy-orders.  Further,  it  was  noted  that  the
direction  to  start  the  buy-back  immediately
could  not  be  issued  as  section  77A(4)  of  the
Companies Act, mandates that every buy-back
shall be completed within 12 months from the
date of passing of the resolution by the board
of directors. When the law allows the appellant
to complete the buy-back within 12 months, it
has  the  option  to  start  with  the  same  at  any
time which it thinks is appropriate for the buy-
back  within  the  said  period.  It  cannot  be
compelled to complete the buy-back soon after
the  passing  of  the  resolution  as  has  been
directed by SEBI.

xv. DKG Buildcon Private Limited vs. SEBI:

Appeal No. 106 of 2006

M/s. R.C. Gupta & Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI:
Appeal No. 133 of 2006

On noticing unusual price movement in the
shares of M/s. Shonkh Technologies International
Ltd.,  SEBI  conducted  investigations  into  the
buying, selling and dealings in the shares of this
company.  During the course of the investigation,
summons dated August 27, 2001 was issued to
DKG  Buildcon  Private  Limited  (DKG)  for  the
production  of  Documents  and  submission  of
information. DKG claimed that this summons
was not received by it and, therefore, it could
not respond. Thereafter, a letter dated June 10,
2002 was sent to the appellant along with a copy
of  the  summons  and  it  was  called  upon  to
furnish  the  information  and  produce  the
documents referred to therein. Admittedly, the
appellant did not respond to this letter despite
having  received  the  same.  Again,  summons
dated  June  18,  2002,  was  issued  to  the
company and again there was no response from
the  side  of  the  appellant.  The  investigating
authority  then  issued  summons  dated  March
4, 2003, March 24, 2003 and April 1, 2003 to
the appellant requiring it to appear before the
Investigating Authority to answer all questions
in relation to the investigations and to produce
all the relevant documents.  In spite of al these
summons,  the  appellant  did  not  respond  and
failed  to  appear  before  the  investigating
authority and neither produced the documents
nor furnished the information sought from it.

In the case of R.C. Gupta & Co. Pvt. Ltd.,
the first summons was issued on July 26, 2001.
The appellant furnished the information on July
29,  2001.  Thereafter,  the  appellant  was  again
summoned on 18th June, 2002 to supply some
information  in  addition  to  the  information
already  submitted.  The  appellant  did  not
respond despite having received the summons.
However,  SEBI  issued  another  summons  on
April 9, 2003 requiring the appellant to appear

on April 12, 2003. Vital information was sought
from  the  appellant  pertaining  to  the
investigations  but  the  appellant  failed  to
respond to these summons as well.

On account of the aforesaid failures on part
of the appellants, adjudication proceedings were
initiated against them. The Adjudicating Officer,
vide orders dated 28th November, 2003 and 31st
December,  2003  respectively  imposed  a
monetary penalty of Rs.1 crore on each of the
appellants for not complying with the summons
issued to them for the production of documents
and  furnishing  information  during  the  course
of the investigations carried out by SEBI.

These appeals were filed before SAT against
the aforesaid orders. Before SAT, the primary
contention  of  both  the  appellants  was  that
noncompliance  with  summons  issued  by  the
investigating  officer  does  not  constitute  a
continuing  wrong  and,  therefore,  the  only
offence committed was in the year 2001 in the
case  of  DKG  Buildcon  Private  Limited  and  in
June  2002  in  the  case  of  R.C.  Gupta  &  Co.
Private Limited when they did not comply with
the  summons.  The  argument  was  that  at  the
relevant time the maximum penalty that could
be  levied  could  not  exceed  one  lakh  and  fifty
thousand  rupees  for  such  a  failure  as  this
provision (i.e. Section 15A (a) of the SEBI Act,
1992) was amended with effect from 29.10.2002
to provide for “a penalty of one lakh rupee for
each  day  during  which  such  failure  continues
or one crore rupee, whichever is less.”

Rejecting  the  above  arguments  of  the
appellants  Hon’ble  SAT  upheld  the  orders  of
SEBI  and  observed  that  SEBI,  by  not  having
proceeded  against  the  appellants  for  the  non-
compliances  of  first  summons  and  having
chosen to issue fresh summons in April 2003,
condoned  the  earlier  lapses  and  gave  the
appellants  another  opportunity  to  furnish  the
information  and  appear  in  person  to  make  a
statement.  Non-compliance  of  the  summons

Since this wrong was committed in April 2003
by which time the amended provisions were in
place,  penalty  had  to  be  levied  in  accordance

that no fault can be found with the action of the

appellant for the renewal of its registration as
Depository  Participants  in  the  NSDL  and  the
CDSL as the appellant was not found to be fit
and proper person to carry on business in the
securities market. SEBI had also suspended the

registration of the appellant as stock broker for
one year for violation of PFUTP Regulations in
the matter of Global Trust Bank Ltd.  Aggrieved
by  the  said  rejection  and  suspension,  the
appellant had approached the Hon’ble SAT. The
Hon’ble  SAT,  vide  order  dated  December  10,
2007  had  upheld  the  said  suspension  and
rejection of renewal by SEBI. The Hon’ble SAT
held that, “It is not contrary to the material on
record  and  nothing  relevant  has  been  ignored
nor  any  irrelevant  material  taken  into
consideration.  Thus,  neither  the  decision  nor
the process followed by the Board suffers from
any  legal  infirmity.  In  our  opinion,  the  Board
was justified in keeping the company out of the
market as a risk containment measure in order
to maintain its integrity and in the interests of
investors.”  The  appellant  had  challenged  the
said order of the Hon’ble SAT before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court and the Hon’ble Supreme Court
vide order dated April 7, 2008 had dismissed
the  appeals  filed  by  the  appellant  and  upheld
the order of the Hon’ble SAT.
