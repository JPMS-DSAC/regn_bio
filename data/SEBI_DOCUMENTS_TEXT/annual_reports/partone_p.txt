PART  ONE:  POLICIES  AND  PROGRAMMES

Part One: Policies and Programmes

The Annual Report of the Securities and
Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  for  2007-08
delineates  the  policies  and  programmes  of
SEBI  and  its  working  and  operations  during
the  financial  year  as  per  format  prescribed
by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of
India  (Annual  Report)  Rules,  1994.  During
the  year,  SEBI  continued  its  endeavour  to
remain  committed  to  achieve  the  three
statutory objectives, namely: (a) protection of
the  interests  of  investors  in  securities;  (b)
development of the securities market; and (c)
regulation of the securities market.

In alignment with these objectives, this
Report provides the manner in which SEBI
accomplished its responsibilities and exercised
its powers during the year in terms of: (a) the
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act,
1992; (b) the Securities Contracts (Regulation)
Act, 1956; (c) the Depositories Act, 1996; and

(d) certain provisions of the Companies Act,
1956. The Report also provides a review of the
developments in the Indian securities market
during 2007-08, in the context of changing
dynamics of market regulations.

Against  the  backdrop  of  an  increasing
integration  of  global  financial  markets,  SEBI
channelised its efforts to bring out regulations
to  handle 
the  domestic  and  global
developments. Steps were taken to strengthen
the  regulatory  framework  by  reviewing
existing policies and programmes and issuing
new  guidelines  and  regulations  to  promote
orderly  growth  of  securities  market.  The
underlying  objectives  were  to  ensure
transparency,  efficiency,  fairness,  safety,  and
integrity  of  the  securities  market  in  India.
Major  policy  initiatives  and  developments  in
the  securities  market  during  2007-08  are
presented in Box 1.1.

GENERAL  MACRO-ECONOMIC
ENVIRONMENT

Indian  economy  remained  as  one  of  the
fastest  growing  economies  of  the  world  and
continued  to  expand  during  2007-08,  mainly
driven  by  growth  in  industry  and  services
sectors.  However,  there  was  moderation  in
the  growth  momentum  during  later  part  of
the  financial  year.  According  to  revised
estimates  of  Central  Statistical  Organisation
(CSO), real GDP grew at 9.0 per cent in 2007-

08  in  comparison  to  9.6  per  cent  in  2006-07
(Table  1.1).  Growth  in  the  industrial  sector
was  at  8.1  per  cent,  led  by  manufacturing
activities which recorded a growth of 8.8 per
cent  in  2007-08  as  compared  to  12.0  per  cent
in  2006-07  (Table  1.2).  The  services  sector
continued  to  be  the  main  driver  of  growth
in India with double digit growth of 10.7 per
cent for the fourth year in succession despite
some  moderation  in  pace  during  2007-08.
Growth  in  agricultural  sector  accelerated  to

4.5  per  cent  in  2007-08  from  3.8  per  cent  in
2006-07, though the share of ‘agriculture and
allied activities’ in overall GDP declined from
18.5  cent  in  2006-07  to  17.8  per  cent  in  2007-
08  (Chart  1.1).  In  contrast,  the  share  of
services sector rose from 61.9 per cent to 62.9
per  cent  and  the  share  of  industry  remained
stable  around  19.5  per  cent.  During  the  first
year  (2007-08)  of  the  Eleventh  Plan  period
(2007-12),  India’s  real  GDP  grew  at  9.0  per
cent  compared  to  7.8  per  cent  (average)  in
the Tenth Plan period (2002-07).

Major 

factors  contributing 

to  a
deceleration  in  the  manufacturing  activities
were  subdued  exports,  decrease  in  domestic
demand and weak investment climate due to
higher  interest  rate  etc.  Capital  goods
recorded  a  double  digit  growth  implying
addition  to  industrial  capacity.  Consumer
goods  sector  saw  a  decline  in  growth  rate
mainly  on  account  of  a  slowdown  in
consumer  durables  basket.  ‘Chemicals’,
‘beverages’,  ‘tobacco  and  related  products’,

Part One: Policies and Programmes

‘leather  products’,  ‘jute  textiles’,  ’wood
products’, ‘basic metals and alloys’ witnessed
acceleration  in  growth  in  2007-08.  However,
growth  in  the  intermediate  goods,  basic
goods  and  infrastructure  sector  remained
sluggish.  According  to  business  expectations
surveys,  conducted  by  various  agencies,
India’s  industrial  sector  is  likely  to  continue
its strong performance in near future.

Services  sector  continued  to  remain  the
largest  contributor  to  overall  GDP  growth
and  grew  at  10.7  per  cent  during  2007-08.
Within  the  services  sector,  ‘trade,  hotel,
transport  &  communication’  and  ‘financing,
insurance,  real  estate  &  business  services’
maintained  a  lower  but  double  digit  growth
in  2007-08.  ‘Community,  social  and  personal
services’  grew  marginally  during  2007-08.
Cargo handled by major ports, air cargo and
rural penetration of mobile telephony showed
improved  performance.  Power  generation,
railway  freight  movements  alongwith
production  of  universal  intermediaries  like

9

Annual Report 2007-08

steel, cement and petroleum showed subdued
performance.

As per the latest data on India’s savings
and  investments  available  up  to  2006-07,  by
CSO,  India’s  Gross  Domestic  Savings  (GDS)
as  proportion  of  GDP  at  current  market
prices  increased  from  34.3  per  cent  in  2005-
06  to  34.8  per  cent  in  2006-07  mainly  on
account  of  improvement  in  the  saving
performance  by  the  private  and  public
sectors.  Public  sector  savings  increased  from
2.6 per cent in 2005-06 to 3.2 per cent in 2006-

07.  Private  corporate  sector  savings  also
improved  marginally  from  7.5  per  cent  in
2005-06 to 7.8 per cent in 2006-07, on the back
of  healthy  corporate  profits.  Savings  of
household  sector  decreased  by  0.43
percentage  points  to  23.8  per  cent  in  2006-07
mainly  on  account  of  decline  in  financial
saving  rate  after  witnessing  an  increase  in
2005-06.  The  Gross  Domestic  Capital
Formation  (overall  investment),  exceeded
GDS by 0.4 percentage points to 35.9 per cent
of  GDP  in  2006-07  reflecting  net  inflow  of
foreign  savings.

‘Deposits’  continued  to  dominate  as  a
major  component  of  gross  financial  savings
by  the  households.  The  share  of  deposits  in
total financial savings increased from 47.1 per
cent  in  2005-06  to  55.7  per  cent  in  2006-07
(Chart  1.2).  On  the  contrary,  households’
claims on Government declined from 14.6 per
cent  in  2005-06  to  5.2  per  cent  in  2006-07.
Thus,  there  was  a  visible  shift  in  the  pattern
of  household  financial  savings  from  claims
on  Government  to  deposits  due  to  higher
returns  available  to  them  from  various  types
of fixed and terms deposits offered by banks
and  financial  institutions.

During 2006-07, other major components
of financial savings were contractual savings,
mainly  insurance  (15  per  cent),  followed  by
provident  and  pension  funds  (9.2  per  cent)
and  currency  (8.6  per  cent).  Investment  in
shares  and  debentures  by  the  households  as
a  proportion  of  gross  total  financial  savings
increased  significantly  from  4.9  per  cent  in
2005-06 to 6.3 per cent in 2006-07. Shares and
debentures  as  proportion  to  GDP  (at  current

Part One: Policies and Programmes

market  prices)  improved  from  0.8  per  cent
to 1.2 per cent during the same period.

Lending  activities  by  commercial  banks
decreased  during  2007-08  after  experiencing
an increase in previous fiscal. Non-food credit
growth  witnessed  a  decline  to  22.3  per  cent
during  2007-08  as  compared  to  28.5  per  cent
in  2006-07  reflecting  a  fall  in  GDP  growth  in
general and industrial activities in particular.
Credit  to  services  sector  decelerated  during
2007-08, including retail lending, particularly
to the housing sector. High credit growth was
observed  for  jute  textiles,  leather  and  leather
products,  basic  metals  and  engineering
goods.  During  2007-08,  deposit  growth  and
credit  growth  almost  matched  with  each
other.  The  liquidity  condition  remained  tight
during  the  greater  part  of  the  year  following
monetary  tightening  and  increase  in  cash
reserve ratio (CRR) by Reserve Bank of India
(RBI).

Though there was a rally in stock prices
in the early part of the year under review,

11

Annual Report 2007-08

financial markets remained volatile during the
later part, particularly in the month of January
2008, when global stock price meltdown was
mirrored in the Indian stock market.

Corporates  restructured  their  debt
profile  and  raised  resources  from  securities
markets  and  through  external  commercial
borrowings  apart  from  resorting  to  internal
accruals.  They  mobilised  sizeable  amount  of
resources  accessing  the  domestic  securities
markets  through  a  number  of  public  issues,
rights  issues,  private  placements  and  by
offerings to private equities.

Inflation  on  a  point  to  point  basis,
measured by variation in the Wholesale Price
Index  (WPI),  was  7.4  per  cent  at  the  end  of
March  2008  compared  to  5.9  per  cent  at  the
end  of  March  2007.  On  an  average  basis,  the
inflation  rate  was  4.7  per  cent  in  2007-08
compared to 5.4 per cent in the previous year.
Prices of manufactured products (weight: 63.8
per  cent  in  WPI)  rose  by  7.1  per  cent
compared  to  6.1  per  cent  a  year  ago.
Following  the  hardening  of  international
crude  oil  prices,  fuel  group  recorded  a  rise
of  6.7  per  cent  in  2007-08  as  against  1.0  per
cent  in  the  previous  year.  The  rise  in  prices
can  be  mainly  attributed  to  food,  crude  oil
and metals during the year.

India’s import bill increased significantly
during  2007-08.  The  major  share  was
contributed by crude oil as well as non-oil
imports  on  the  back  of  strong  industrial
demand. As a result, trade deficit too widened
during 2007-08. Bulk of trade deficit was
financed through net receipts under invisibles,
particularly through remittances from the
Indian migrant workers abroad. Impressive
capital flows, which more than offset the
current account deficit, contributed to the
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves of
RBI. India’s foreign exchange reserves rose by
USD 110.5 billion to USD 309.7 billion during
2007-08, on account of rising inflow of foreign
direct 
foreign  portfolio

investment, 

investment, External Commercial Borrowings
and  remittances.  The  Rupee  vis-à-vis  US
dollar appreciated during the major part of
2007-08 following continued foreign capital
inflows but receded in the later part following
a reversal of flows due to the unfolding of
sub-prime mortgage crisis in the U.S.

2. REVIEW OF POLICIES AND

PROGRAMMES

SEBI  initiated  a  number  of  policies  and
programmes  during  2007-08  which  are
presented  in  this  Section  under  six  major
heads  viz,.  primary  securities  market,
secondary  securities  market,  corporate  debt
market,  mutual  funds,  foreign  institutional
investors,  and  investor  assistance  and
investor  education.  The  section  is  concluded
with ‘retrospect and prospects’.

I.

Primary  Securities  Market

A  developed  primary  market  is  crucial
for  resource  mobilisation  by  corporates  to
meet their investment needs for growth. Since
2003-04,  Indian  primary  market  witnessed
high  activity  in  resource  mobilisation  and
number  of  issues  in  the  market,  which
continued  during  2007-08  as  well.  The
ongoing  reforms  in  the  primary  market
improved  the  confidence  of  the  investors  as
well  as  the  issuers.  A  number  of  companies
entered  the  primary  market  for  resource
mobilisation.  Response  of  investors  to  public
issues  was  encouraging.  A  detailed  analysis
on  number  of  issues,  amount  mobilised,  size
and  composition  of  issues  and  industry-wise
resource  mobilised  is  given  in  the  Part  Two
of  this  report.  Following  were  the  major
policy initiatives taken by SEBI relating to the
primary market during 2007-08:

i. Grading  of  Initial  Public  Offerings

(IPOs)

Grading  of  all 

IPOs  was  made
mandatory.  The  grading  would  be  done  by

12

Part One: Policies and Programmes

iv. Tightening  of  Eligibility  Requirement
for  Qualified  Institutions’  Placement
(QIP)

The  eligibility  criterion  for  a  company
desirous  of  making  a  QIP  was  amended.  In
addition  to  the  criteria  specified  in  the
guidelines  governing  QIP,  such  a  company
would  also  be  required  to  have  a  listing
history  of  at  least  one  year  on  the  date  of
issuance  of  notice  to  its  shareholders  for
convening  a  general  meeting  in  terms  of
Section  81(1A)  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956
to consider the QIP.

v.

Relaxation  of  Provision  relating  to
Issuance of Debt Securities

In  order  to  facilitate  development  of  a
vibrant  primary  market  for  corporate  bonds
in  India,  SEBI  amended  SEBI  (DIP)
Guidelines  concerning  Issuance  of  Debt
Securities. The amendments were as under:

a) Requirement  of  Credit  Rating

For  public/  rights  issues  of  debt
instruments,  SEBI  (Disclosure  and  Investor
Protection) Guidelines, 2000, stipulated credit
rating  to  be  obtained  from  not  less  than  two
credit  rating  agencies.  With  a  view  to
reducing  the  cost  of  issuance  of  debt
instruments,  it  was  amended  that  credit
rating  from  one  credit  rating  agency  would
be  sufficient.

b) Below 

Investment  Grade  Debt

Instruments

SEBI 

and 

(Disclosure 

Investor
Protection) Guidelines, 2000, required that the
debt  instruments  issued  through  a  public/
rights  issue  shall  be  of  at  least  investment
grade.  In  a  disclosure  based  regime,  it  is  left
to  the  investor  to  decide  whether  or  not  to
invest  in  a  non-investment  grade  debt
instrument.  Given  this,  and  in  order  to
develop  market  for  debt  instruments,  it  was
decided  to  allow  issuance  of  bonds  below

credit  rating  agencies,  registered  with  SEBI.
It  would  be  mandatory  to  obtain  grading
from  at  least  one  credit  rating  agency.  The
issuer  would  be  required  to  disclose  all  the
grades  obtained  by  it  for  its  IPO  in  the
prospectus, abridged prospectus and all other
places  where  the  issuer  advertised  for  the
IPO.  Expenses  incurred  for  grading  of  IPO
would be borne by the issuer.

ii. Relaxation for Government Companies

in  Infrastructure  Sector

/  corporations/ 

In  order  to  facilitate  government
companies 
statutory
authorities/  any  special  purpose  vehicle  set
up  by  any  of  them,  which  are  engaged  in
infrastructure  sector,  to  raise  funds  in  the
Indian  primary  market  through  IPOs,  SEBI
relaxed  certain  provisions  of  SEBI(DIP)
guidelines  like:

a) minimum  dilution  requirements,

b) minimum period of holding of pre-issue
capital  to  be  issued  in  an  offer  for  sale,
and

c)

eligibility  of  shares  for  the  purpose  of
computation  of  promoters’  contribution
etc.

iii.

Introduction of Fast Track Issuances

To  enable  well  compliant 

listed
companies to access primary securities market
in a time effective manner through follow-on
public  offerings  and  rights  issues,  SEBI
introduced fast track issue mechanism. This
would enable listed companies to proceed
with follow-on public offering / rights issue by
filing a copy of the Red Herring Prospectus (in
case of book-built issue) / Prospectus (in case
of fixed price issue) with the Registrar of
Companies or the letter of offer filed with
designated stock exchange, as the case may be.
Now such companies need not file a draft
offer documents with SEBI and the stock
exchanges.

13

Annual Report 2007-08

investment  grade  to  the  public  to  suit  the
risk/return  appetite  of  investors.

c) Removal  of  Structural  Restrictions

In  order  to  provide  issuers  with
flexibility in structuring of instruments to suit
their  requirements,  the  restrictions  currently
placed  on  debt  instruments  such  as  those  on
maturity,  put/call  option  on  conversion,  etc.,
were  removed.

vi. Rationalisation  of  Certain  Require-
ments  Pertaining  to  Indian  Depository
Receipts  (IDRs)

Prior  to  these  amendments,  only
Qualified  Institutional  Buyers  (QIBs)  were
eligible to apply in an IPO of IDRs. However,
amendments  were  made  to  permit  all
categories  of  the  investors  to  apply  in  IDR
issues,  subject  to  (i)  at  least  50  per  cent  of
the  issue  being  subscribed  by  QIBs,  and  (ii)
the  balance  being  made  available  for
subscription  to  other  categories  of  investors
at  the  discretion  of  the  issuer,  which  should
be  disclosed  in  the  prospectus.  Further,  the
minimum  application  value  was  reduced
from Rs. 2,00,000 to Rs. 20,000.

vii. Amendments 

to  Guidelines 

for

Preferential  Issues

Prior  to  this  amendment,  the  provisions
relating  to  pricing  in  preferential  issue
guidelines,  pre-supposed  listing  history  of  at
least  six  months  for  the  company  proposing
a  preferential  allotment.  The  amended
preferential  allotment  guidelines  enabled
companies  with  listing  history  of  less  than
six  months  also  to  raise  money  through
preferential  allotment,  subject  to  complying
with  the  modified  pricing  and  disclosure
norms.

Further,  the  listed  companies  intending
to  make  preferential  allotment  would  be
required  to  obtain  PAN  from  each  applicant
before making the allotment.

viii. Electronic  Filing  through  Corporate
Filing  and  Dissemination  System
(CFDS )

SEBI  decided  to  phase  out  EDIFAR
gradually in view of a new portal, viz., CFDS
put  in  place  jointly  by  BSE  and  NSE,  which
offers  a  Extensible  Business  Reporting
Language  (XBRL)  enabled  common  platform
for listed companies to file their returns with
stock exchanges and also a common place for
investors to view information related to listed
companies.

A  new  clause  viz.,  clause  52  was
introduced in Equity Listing Agreement. This
clause  requires  listed  companies  to  file
information  with  the  stock  exchanges  only
through  CFDS.  The  companies,  which  were
mandated  to  file  information  through  CFDS
or  were  registered  on  CFDS  on  their  own
volition  though  not  so  mandated,  need  not
file information through the EDIFAR system.
The  companies  which  had  commenced  filing
through  CFDS  would  continue  to  do  so
through CFDS only.

Initially  100  companies,  jointly  selected
by  BSE  and  NSE  based  on  market
capitalisation  were  mandated  to  file  through
CFDS.

ix. Amendments  Pertaining  to  Issue

Process

a) Quoting  of  PAN  Mandatory  in  Issue

Application  Form

Prior  to  the  amendment  in  this  regard,
all applicants in public and rights issues were
required  to  disclose  their  PAN/GIR  in  the
application  form  if  they  were  making  an
application  for  a  value  exceeding  Rs.  50,000.
The  requirement  of  quoting  PAN  in
application  forms  was  extended  to  all
applicants,  irrespective  of  value  of  the
application. Further, it was clarified that there
would  be  no  requirement  of  attaching

14

Part One: Policies and Programmes

e) Deletion of the Chapter on “Guidelines
for  Issue  of  Capital  by  Designated
Financial  Institutions  (DFIs)”

In view of DFIs operationally competing
on  equal  footing  with  private  entities,  the
special  dispensations  given  to  DFIs  were
removed  by  deleting  the  chapter  on
“Guidelines  for  Issue  of  Capital  by  DFIs”
from SEBI (DIP) Guidelines.

f) Monitoring of Issue Proceeds

As  per  erstwhile  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines,
every  issuer  making  an  issue  of  more  than
Rs.  500  crore  was  required  to  appoint  a
monitoring  agency,  which  needed  to  file  a
monitoring  report  with  SEBI.  This  provision
was  amended  to  provide  that  it  would  not
apply  to  (i)  issues  by  banks  and  public
financial  institutions  and  (ii)  offers  for  sale
and  also  that  monitoring  agency  would  be
required  to  file  its  report  with  the  issuer
company  and  not  with  SEBI.  The  issuer
company  would  in  turn  place  the  report
before its Audit Committee.

g)

Eligibility  of  Pledged  Shares  for
Computation  of  Minimum  Promoters’
Contribution

  Securities  which  were  pledged  with
banks  or  financial  institutions  as  collateral
security  for  loans  granted  by  such  banks  or
financial  institutions,  would  not  be  eligible
for  computation  of  minimum  promoters’
contribution  in  case  of  company  going  for
public  issue.

x. Amendments  to  Clause  41  of  the

Listing  Agreement

The revised clause gives an option to the
listed  companies  to  furnish  either  audited  or
unaudited  quarterly  and  year  to  date
financial results to the stock exchange within
one month of end of each quarter (other than
the last quarter), subject to the following :

photocopy  of  PAN  card  with  bid/issue
application  form.

b) Discount  in  Issue  Price  for  Retail

Investors  /  Retail  Shareholders

Prior  to  this  amendment,  SEBI  (DIP)
Guidelines  did  not  provide  for  issuance  of
shares at differential price to investors in the
net  offer  to  public  category.  The  amendment
made,  permitted  issuer  company  to  issue
shares  to  retail  individual  investors  /retail
individual shareholders at a price lower than
that  being  offered  to  other  categories,
provided that such discount does not exceed
10  per  cent  of  the  price  at  which  securities
were issued to other categories of public.

c) Definition  of  “Retail  Individual

Shareholder”  for  Listed  Companies

Prior 

to 

this  amendment, 

listed
companies  making  public  issues  could  make
reservation  on  competitive  basis  for  its
existing  shareholders  who,  as  on  the  record
date,  were  holding  shares  worth  up  to  Rs.
50,000.  However,  no  limit  was  specified  on
the value of the application that can be made
by  such  shareholders.  The  definition  of  the
term  “Retail  Individual  Shareholder”  was
defined  to  mean  a  shareholder  (i)  whose
shareholding  was  of  value  not  exceeding  Rs.
1,00,000 as on the day immediately preceding
the  record  date  to  be  determined  by  the
issuer, and (ii) who made application or bids
in  a  public  issue  for  value  not  exceeding  Rs.
1,00,000.

d) Clarification on the Term CEO / CFO

SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines  required  all
directors,  CEO  and  CFO  of  the  issuer
company  to  certify  that  disclosures  made  in
the  offer  document  are  true  and  correct.  It
was  clarified  that  the  terms  “CEO”  and
“CFO”  in  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines  shall  have
the  same  meaning  as  assigned  to  them  in
clause 49 of the Equity Listing Agreement.

15

Annual Report 2007-08

a)

In  case  the  company  opts  to  submit
unaudited  financial  results,  it  shall  be
subjected  to  limited  review  by  the
statutory auditors of the company (or in
case  of  public  sector  undertakings,  by
any  practicing  Chartered  Accountant)
and  a  copy  of  the  limited  review  report
shall be furnished to the stock exchange
within  two  months  from  end  of  the
quarter.

b)

In  case  the  company  opts  to  submit
audited  financial  results,  it  shall  be
accompanied by the audit report.

The  requirement  as  to  the  furnishing  of
financial results of last quarter was prescribed
in the revised Clause.  

It  also  required  that  explanation  for
variations be furnished only in respect of net
profit  or  loss  after  tax  and  for  exceptional  /
extraordinary  items  and  the  percentage  of
variation  for  the  purpose  was  revised  to  “10
per  cent  or  Rs.  10  lakh,  whichever  was
higher”.

As regards to the publication of financial
results,  the  companies  having  subsidiaries
which file both stand-alone and consolidated
financial  results  to  the  stock  exchange  was
given an option to publish either stand-alone
or  consolidated  financial  results,  subject  to
the  condition  that  a  choice  once  exercised
could not be changed during the year. In case
the  company  changes  its  option  in  any
subsequent  financial  year,  it  should  furnish
comparative figures for the previous financial
year  in  accordance  with  the  option  exercised
for the current year.

The  revised  clause  also  specified  the
manner of approval and authentication of the
financial results and formats.

xi. Amendments  to  Clause  49  of  the

Listing  Agreement

The  amendment  to  Clause  49  made
provided  that  where  a  monitoring  agency

was appointed, the report submitted by such
agency  should  be  placed  before  the  Audit
Committee  of  the  issuer  company,  so  as  to
enable  the  Audit  Committee  to  make
appropriate  recommendations  to  the  Board
of  the  issuer  company.  Further,  every  issuer
company  was  required  to  inform  material
deviations in the utilisation of issue proceeds
to  the  stock  exchange  and  to  simultaneously
make public the material deviations / adverse
comments  of  the  Audit  Committee  /
monitoring agency, through an advertisement
in  newspapers.

II. Secondary  Securities  Market

i. Mandatory  Requirement  of  Permanent
Account  Number  (PAN)  for  All
Transactions in the Securities Market

Pursuant  to  the  Hon’ble  Finance
Minister’s  announcement  in  Union  Budget:
2007-08,  SEBI  stipulated  that  PAN  would  be
the  sole  identification  number  for  all
participants  in  the  securities  market,
irrespective of the amount of transaction with
effect from July 02, 2007.

Market  intermediaries  were  advised  to
ensure  that  their  clients’  transactions  are
linked  to  the  PAN  details  of  the  client  with
which  detailed  analysis  could  be  made  and
to  build  the  necessary  infrastructure  for
enabling  accessibility  and  query  based  on
PAN  thereby  enabling  retrieval  of  all  the
details  of  the  clients  that  was  available
including the transactions done by them. The
objective  of  the  said  requirement  was  to
strengthen  the  ‘Know  Your  Client’  (KYC)
norms through a single identification number
for  all  participants  in  the  securities  market
thereby  facilitating  sound  audit  trail  of  all
transactions.  In  accordance  with  the  above
mentioned policy, SEBI discontinued with the
requirement of Unique Identification Number
(UIN)  under  the  SEBI  (Central  Database  of
Market  Participants)  Regulations,  2003
(MAPIN  Regulations).

iii. Short  Selling  and  Securities  Lending

and  Borrowing  (SLB)

Hon’ble Finance Minister, in the Union
Budget 2007-08, had proposed inter-alia “to
allow  short  selling  settled  by  delivery,  and
securities lending and borrowing to facilitate
delivery, by institutions.” Subsequently, after a
series of discussions with the stock exchanges,
depositories and market participants, SEBI
specified a broad regulatory framework for

short selling and a full-fledged securities
lending  and  borrowing 
scheme  by
institutional investors. Relevant amendments
were made to SEBI (FII) Regulations, 1995 and
SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996,
enabling FIIs and Mutual Funds to participate
in the framework for short selling and SLB.
RBI also made the necessary amendments to
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999
(FEMA) and vide circular dated January 01,
2008,  enabled  FIIs  to  participate  in  short
selling and SLB. Central Board of Direct Taxes
(CBDT) vide circular dated February 22, 2008,
clarified that SLB transactions would not
attract capital gains tax and STT. The aforesaid
framework for short selling and SLB would be
operationalised with effect from April 21,
2008.

Box 1.2: Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing

Short selling is defined as selling a stock which the seller does not own at the time of trade. The
seller  would  have  either  borrowed  the  securities  temporarily  for  delivery  to  the  buyer  or  would  not
have made any provision at all i.e. naked short sale.

Short  selling  is  used  for  many  purposes,  including  to  profit  from  an  expected  downward  price
movement,  to  provide  liquidity  in  response  to  unanticipated  buyer  demand,  or  to  hedge  the  risk  of  a
long  position  in  the  same  security  or  a  related  security.  Short  selling  is  considered  as  a  desirable
feature as it enhances market efficiency through price discovery and improves liquidity in the permitted
securities.  Empirical  analysis  suggests  that  when  short-selling  is  possible,  market  returns  are  less
volatile and there is greater liquidity. However, it is also viewed as potential risk than can accentuate
a downtrend and thus destabilise the market.

Short  selling  is  central  to  the  theoretical  foundations  of  the  Efficient  Markets  Hypothesis  and
Asset Pricing theory. Short selling as a trading tool is important from the broad perspective of global
equity  market  development.  A  recent  research  study  by  Cornell  University,  examines  effectiveness  of
short  selling  across  different  types  of  sellers  including  individuals,  institutions  and  proprietary
accounts.  According  to  the  study,  heavy  short-sellers,  mainly  institutional,  have  in  fact  identified
and  acted  on  important  value-relevant  information  that  has  not  yet  been  impounded  into  prices.  The
price  effects  are  permanent,  which  suggest  that  short  sellers  are  not  manipulating  or  otherwise
temporarily  depressing  the  share  price.  They  found  that  shorting  accounts  for  more  than  12.9  per
cent  of  NYSE  volume,  suggesting  that  shorting  constraints  are  easily  surmounted  for  even  the
smallest-cap  NYSE  stocks.

The  securities  markets  across  the  world  have  permitted  short  sales  subject  to  certain  safeguards
like  disclosures  and  tick  rules.  The  US  SEC  has  introduced  Regulation  SHO  in  2005  which  was  an
updated  version  in  light  of  numerous  market  developments  since  short  sale  regulation  was  first

17

Annual Report 2007-08

Box 1.2: Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing  (Contd.)

adopted  in  1938.  Naked  short  selling  is  not  necessarily  a  violation  of  the  federal  securities  laws  or
the  SEC’s  rules.  SEC  recognises  a  tolerance  level  of  unsettled  trades  for  five  consecutive  settlements,
before taking action under SHO.

On  the  other  hand  in  UK,  the  Financial  Services  Authority  (FSA)  UK,  emphasises  on

transparency and disclosure of short sales rather than putting restrictive rules.

In  Hong  Kong,  short  selling  is  permitted  on  certain  designated  securities  like  those  that  were
part  of  the  benchmark  indices  or  those  in  which  futures  and  options  have  been  made  available.
Further, the tick rule has been specified, i.e., it cannot be effected below the best current ask price. At
the  time  of  putting  the  order,  investors  are  required  to  communicate  to  broker  dealers  that  it  is  a
short  selling  transaction.

Many  emerging  markets  like  Korea,  Japan,  Singapore,  etc.,  have  also  permitted  short  selling
subject  to  disclosure  of  such  transactions  and  tick  rules.  Certain  jurisdictions  prohibit  short  selling
during  specific  corporate  activities  like  acquisitions/takeovers,  new  issuances,  strategic  policy
announcements  etc.

In  India,  short  sale  was  permitted  for  retail  investors  in  1996  subject  to  the  disclosure
requirements.  It  was  banned  twice  in  1998  and  2001  in  response  to  market  volatility.  With  the
introduction  of  rolling  settlement,  with  effect  from  July  2,  2001,  SEBI  permitted  short  sales  by  retail
investors. However, institutional investors were not permitted to do the same.

Pursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  Secondary  Market  Advisory  Committee  (SMAC)  of
SEBI  and  the  decision  of  the  SEBI  Board,  it  has  been  decided  to  permit  all  classes  of  investors  to
short sell. The mechanism for short selling would be supplemented by a full-fledged Securities Lending
and  Borrowing  (SLB)  scheme.  SEBI  has  issued  guidelines  to  implement  and  put  in  place  a  broad
framework to short-sell and for the introduction of SLB.

Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB)

Securities  lending  is  a  temporary  transfer  of  securities  from  the  owner  of  the  securities  to  a
third  party,  for  a  fee.  At  the  end  of  loan  term,  securities  must  generally  be  returned  to  the  owner.
Securities  lending  arrangements  are  governed  by  commercial  agreement  entered  into  between  the
lender  and  borrower.

Securities  lending  and  borrowing  has  become  an  inevitable  mechanism  in  capital  markets.  SLB
complements  short  selling  in  securities  and  also  enables  the  investors  to  earn  returns  on  their  idle
securities.

SLB was first introduced in United States in the 1980s. It now supports trading and settlement
in  all  developed  and  emerging  markets.  A  recent  study  by  World  Federation  of  Exchanges  has
enumerated  how  securities  lending  is  affecting  the  business  of  stock  exchanges  through  corporate
governance norms and market surveillance. SLB confers liquidity and improves efficiency of securities
markets.  Securities  lending  provides  the  lender  of  securities  with  a  low  risk  yield  enhancement  to  his
portfolio, while enabling the borrower to cover failed trades and to hedge/ arbitrage in the market.

In  most  markets,  the  securities  lending  and  borrowing  transactions  are  by  and  large,  over-the-
counter  (OTC)  contractual  obligations  executed  between  lenders  and  borrowers.  Regulators  do  not

18

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Box 1.2: Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing  (Contd.)

directly  regulate  the  lending  and  borrowing  transactions.  In  some  emerging  market  jurisdictions  like
Hong  Kong,  Korea,  Singapore  etc.,  the  depositories  and  custodians  provide  an  electronic  platform  for
execution  of  securities  lending  and  borrowing  transactions.  For  example  the  State  Street,  Bank  of
New  York,  Depositories  Trust  and  Clearing  Corporation,  CrestCo,  Korean  Securities  Depository
Association  run  the  SLB  for  their  clients  who  register  with  them  through  electronic  trading  screen
which matches the demand and supply for the designated securities.

In India, SLB was introduced in 1997 with a view to handling settlement shortages. There was
no  scope  for  investors  to  capitalise  on  the  demand  for  their  securities  in  the  market  and  thus  earn  a
return  by  lending  them.  Later,  there  was  a  need  for  a  full-fledged  SLB  to  include  participation  of  all
classes  of  investors.

SLB  has  been  introduced  by  SEBI  within  the  overall  framework  of  Securities  Lending  Scheme,
1997.  All  market  participants  are  eligible  to  participate  in  the  scheme.  The  SLB  takes  place  on  an
automated,  screen-based,  order-matching  platform  which  will  be  provided  by  the  approved
intermediaries (AIs). The AIs includes Clearing Corporation/Clearing House of stock exchanges having
nation-wide  terminals.  The  securities  traded  in  F&O  segment  are  eligible  for  lending  &  borrowing
under  the  scheme.

Regulations, 2007 were placed on the website
inviting  public  comments  and  suggestions.

In order to provide a level playing field
to  all  the  investors  in  the  cash  market  as  in
the  case  of  derivatives  market,  SEBI
mandated  that  all  institutional  trades  in  the
cash  market  would  be  subject  to  payment  of
margins as applicable to transactions of other
investors. It was specified that w.e.f. April 21,
2008,  trades  would  be  margined  on  a  T+1
basis  with  margin  being  collected  from  the
custodian upon confirmation of the trade.

Depository  Participants

In  terms  of  Regulation  46  of  the  SEBI
(Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations,
1996, every Depository Participant (DP) shall
have adequate mechanism for the purpose of
reviewing,  monitoring  and  evaluating  its
internal  accounting  controls  and  systems.  It
had been clarified that these provisions apply
to  DPs  in  respect  of  all  their  branches  also.
DPs  were,  therefore,  required  in  terms  of
these  provisions  to  put  in  place  appropriate
mechanisms  to  ensure  that  their  branches

19

Annual Report 2007-08

the  operations 

were  carrying  on 
in
compliance  with  the  applicable  regulations,
bye-laws, etc. Further, DPs were also required
to  put  in  place  suitable  internal  control
systems  to  ensure  that  all  branches  were
exercising due diligence in opening accounts,
complying with KYC requirements, ensuring
systems  safety  in  complying  with  client
instructions,  manner  of  uploading  client
instructions,  verifying  signatures  and
maintaining client records, etc.

Depositories shall examine the adequacy
of  the  above  mechanisms  during  their
inspections  of  DPs.  Depositories  shall  also
put  in  place  appropriate  mechanisms  for
monitoring opening of branches by DPs.

vii. Policy  Initiatives  for  Derivatives

of 

and 

a) Derivatives  Market  Review  Committee
(DMRC)was  set  up  on  April  3,  2007
under the Chairmanship of Professor M.
to  carry  out  a
Rammohan  Rao 
comprehensive 
review 
the
developments  in  the  derivatives  market
in India and to suggest the future course
of  action.  SEBI  on  November  14,  2007,
approved,  in  principle,  the  interim
recommendations on ‘New products for
futures 
segment’.
Accordingly,  four  new  derivative
products  have  been  introduced.  It  is
expected  that  these  new  derivative
products  will  provide  investors  with  a
wider  range  of  risk  mitigation  products
and  create  more  activity  in  the  Indian
derivatives  markets.  The  four  products
are as follows:

options 

to 

 Mini  Contracts  in  equity  indices:
Exchanges  (NSE  and  BSE)  were
permitted 
introduce  mini
contracts  in  equity  indices  with
minimum  contract  size  of  Rs.  one
lakh.  It  was  expected  that  the
availability  of  mini  contracts  with
lower  contract  size  i.e.  Rs  one  lakh

20

will facilitate small retail investors to
effectively hedge their portfolios. The
existing  risk  containment  and  other
measures  applicable  for  existing
exchange  traded  equity  Index
derivative  contracts  were  also
extended  to  the  mini  derivative
contract on Index.

 Options  contracts  with  longer  life/

to 

tenure:
Exchanges  (NSE  and  BSE)  were
permitted 
launch  options
contracts  with  longer  tenure  up  to
five  years.  To  begin  with,  at  any
point in time, there would be options
contract  with  at  least  three  year
tenure  available  for  investors.  The
options cycle would be as under:

 The  three  serial  month  contracts

would continue to exist.

 The  following  three  quarterly
months  of  the  cycle  March/June/
September/December  would  be
available.

 After  these,  five  following  semi-
annual  months  of  the  cycle  June/
December  would  be  available,  so
that at any point in time there would
be  options  contract  with  at  least
three  year  tenure  available  for
investors.

The  risk  containment  and  other
measures  applicable  for  existing
exchange traded equity Index option
contracts would be extended suitably
to  long  term  option  contracts  on
Index.

It  was  expected  that  these  contracts
will  provide  liquidity  at  the  longer
end  of  the  market  and  will  enable
investors to hedge their positions for
a longer duration.

 Volatility index and F&O contracts:
Exchanges  (NSE  and  BSE)  were

components.  Clearing  members  were  now
permitted  to  accept  foreign  sovereign
securities  with  ‘AAA’  rating,  (“sovereign
securities”)  as  collateral  from  FII  client  with
the  following  necessary  safeguards:

 Before  accepting  sovereign  securities  as
collateral  from  FII,  the  clearing  member
would  enter  into  a  written  agreement
with  the  FII  and  also  with  the  clearing
corporation.

 The  clearing  member  would  take  due
care  to  ensure  that  the  sovereign
securities  tendered  as  collateral  would
be  available  for  liquidation  in  the  event
of  insolvency  of  the  FII  or  any
intermediary  or  any  other  person
located  overseas  through  whom  the
securities were held.

 The clearing corporation would also take
due  care  to  ensure  that  sovereign
securities  tendered  as  collateral  are
available  for  liquidation  in  the  event  of
insolvency  of  the  clearing  member  or
any  intermediary  or  other  person
located  overseas  through  whom  the
securities were held.

 The  clearing  corporation  would  take
adequate  care  to  ensure  that  the
sovereign  securities  accepted  by  it  as
margin  were 
tendered  under  a
mechanism  which  does  not  unduly
hinder timely liquidation in the event of
default by the clearing member.

The  clearing  corporation  would  value
the  collateral  tendered  by  applying  due
haircuts.  The  haircut  may  either  be  a  fixed
percentage  or  VaR  based.  A  higher  haircut
may be considered to cover the expected time
frame  for  liquidation.  A  market  determined
price  as  obtained  from  an  internationally
recognized  data  vendor  shall  be  considered
for  valuation.  The  prices  shall  be  converted
into  rupee  terms  on  a  daily  basis.  The  rupee

permitted  to  construct  volatility
index and disseminate the same. The
Exchanges  were  free  to  decide
whether  they  want  to  adopt  any  of
the  Volatility  Index  computation
models  available  globally  or  may
like  to  develop  their  own  model  for
computation  of  Volatility  Index.
Based  on  experience  gained  and
awareness  generated,  derivatives  on
Volatility Index would be considered
for  introduction  in  due  course  of
time.

 Bond  Index  and  F&O  contracts:
to
Exchanges  were  permitted 
construct  the  bond  index  (both
corporate and GOI) and disseminate
the  same.  Bond  index  reflects
expectations about the term structure
of  interest  rate  in  the  economy.  It
was  expected  that  futures  and
options  on  bond  index  will  enable
market  participants  to  hedge  their
interest  rate  risk.  The  exchanges
were  free  to  decide  whether  they
want to adopt any of the Bond Index
computation  models  available
globally or may like to develop their
own model for computation of Bond
Index.

b)

SEBI  permitted  clearing  members  to
accept  Foreign  Sovereign  Securities  as
collateral  from  Foreign  Institutional
Investors  (FIIs)  for  Exchange  Traded
Derivative  Transactions.

Presently, in Exchange traded derivative
transactions, FIIs are depositing the collateral
with  the  clearing  members,  in  the  form  of
cash.  Under  the  existing  guidelines  for
clearing  members,  for  collateral  purposes,  at
least  50  per  cent  of  the  liquid  assets  would
be  in  the  form  of  cash  or  cash  equivalents,
and  the  rest  can  be  in  the  form  of  non-cash

21

Annual Report 2007-08

value so used for conversion shall be the “RBI
Reference  rate”.  The  RBI  reference  rate  shall
be  disclosed  by  the  clearing  corporation  to
the  clearing  members,  so  as  to  enable  them
to  report  the  value  of  the  margins  collected
from FIIs.

The  existing  procedure  for  acceptance
and release of collateral tendered by domestic
investors  in  the  case  of  domestic  securities
shall  be  adopted  mutatis  mutandis  for  the
sovereign  securities  tendered  by  FII,  except
to the extent specifically provided otherwise.

The  sovereign  securities  tendered  as
collateral  shall  be  treated  as  part  of  the  cash
component of the liquid assets of the clearing
member, and shall be subject to the condition
that the value of the sovereign securities shall
not  be  more  than  10  per  cent  of  the  total
value  of  the  cash  component  of  the  liquid
assets of the clearing member.

viii. Corporatisation  and  Demutualisation

(C and D) of Stock Exchanges

The  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)
Act,  1956  (SCRA)  was  amended  in  October
2004  to  facilitate  the  Corporatisation  and
Demutualisation  of  stock  exchanges,
mandating  all  recognised  stock  exchanges,  if
not  already  corporatised  and  demutualised,

Box 1.3: New Derivatives Products

India  is  presently  reckoned  as  one  of  the  most  established  markets  in  the  world  for  exchange
traded  derivatives  products.  In  order  to  further  deepen  the  derivatives  market  and  to  cater  to  the
growing  needs  of  investors  for  more  sophisticated  derivatives  products,  SEBI  decided  to  come  up
with  three  new  products  i.e.  mini  contracts,  option  contracts  with  longer  life/tenure  and  volatility
Index. The three products would provide investors more flexibility in terms of executing their trading
strategies.

Mini derivative contracts would enable small investors with a small exposure in the cash market,
to hedge their positions. Initially, mini index futures and options, namely, on Sensex and S&P CNX
Nifty, with a minimum contract size of Rs. one lakh has been introduced. Chicago Mercantile Exchange
provides a wide range of E-mini futures contracts on indices like Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, S&P MidCap
400  and  Russell  2000.  For  example,  E-mini  S&P  500  futures  contract  is  one-fifth  of  the  size  of
standard S&P 500 futures contract.

Presently,  exchange  traded  equity  options  contracts  have  a  maximum  life  of  three  months.  It
was  felt  that  longer  duration/tenure  option  contracts  would  enable  investors  to  take  a  view  on
prolonged  price  changes  without  needing  to  use  a  combination  of  shorter  term  option  contracts  or  to
roll  over  several  short-term  contracts.  Long-term  options  have  been  introduced  with  expiration  dates
upto  three  years,  on  indices  namely,  Sensex  and  Nifty.  Longer  term  equity  option  contracts  were
introduced in 1993 as LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation securities) by Chicago Board of Options
Exchange  (CBOE)  on  S&P  100,  S&P  500  and  Russell  2000  with  an  expiration  time  upto  three
years.  Montreal  Exchange  at  Canada  also  lists  long  term  equity  options  with  an  expiration  time
upto three years.

Volatility  Index  is  a  measure  of  market  expectations  of  near  term  volatility  conveyed  by  the
prices  of  stock  index  options  or  a  basket  of  options  on  stocks.  The  volatility  index  is  considered  to  be
a  kind  of  indicator  of  investor  sentiment,  with  high  values  implying  pessimism  and  low  values
implying  optimism.

22

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Box 1.3: New Derivatives Products  (Contd.)

Volatility Index provides a series of snapshots of expected stock market volatility over a specified
time  period.  The  Volatility  Index  is  calculated  in  real-time  and  gets  continuously  disseminated
throughout each trading day. Investors also use the implied volatility information given by the index,
in identifying mis-priced options. In 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) introduced
the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) which became the benchmark for stock market volatility. CBOE has
a  family  of  derivative  products  based  on  this  index  as  well.  The  CBOE  VIX  is  an  implied  volatility
index  that  measures  the  market’s  expectation  of  30-day  S&P  500  index  volatility  implicit  in  the
prices of near-term S&P 500 index options.

A volatility index would help investors to take a view on the near term volatility changes in the
securities market. It is increasingly felt that an openly available and quoted measure of market volatility
in  the  form  of  an  index  would  help  market  participants  to  hedge  the  risk  arising  out  of  changing
volatility.

The  exchanges  in  India  may  choose  any  of  the  volatility  index  computation  models  available
globally  or  would  like  to  develop  their  own  model  for  computation  of  volatility  index.  The  detailed
methodology  for  computing  the  volatility  index  shall  be  disseminated  by  the  exchange  for  the  benefit
of  the  market  participants  and  investors.  Depending  on  the  experience  gained  and  inputs  generated,
derivatives on volatility index would be considered for introduction in future.

from  the  appointed  date  as  notified  by  SEBI.
It  obligated  on  all  non-corporate  and  mutual
stock  exchanges  to  submit  their  C  and  D
Scheme to SEBI for approval.

SEBI  notified  C  and  D  schemes  of  19
stock  exchanges  in  the  year  2005. As  per  the
C  and  D  schemes,  the  stock  exchanges  were
required  to  complete  their  corporatisation
process  within  three  months  from  the  date
of notification of their respective Schemes.

The  process  of  corporatisation  includes
incorporation  of  for-profit  company  limited

by  shares,  re-registration  /  conversion  from
company  limited  by  guarantee  to  company
limited  by  shares,  allotment  of  shares  to
eligible  members,  etc.  Accordingly,  all  the
stock  exchanges  were  converted  into
corporate entities in the year 2006-07.

In  order  to  fully  complete  their
demutualisation process, the stock exchanges
were  required  to  ensure  that  at  least  51  per
cent  of  their  equity  share  capital  is  held  by
public other than shareholders having trading
rights as per section 4B (8) of the SCRA. The
stock  exchanges  were  required  to  complete
the  same  within  twelve  months  from  the

publication  of  the  Order,  approving  their
respective  schemes  (further  extendable  by
SEBI  by  another  period  of  twelve  months  as
per  the  SCRA).  As  requested  by  the  stock
exchanges,  SEBI  extended  the  above  time
period  by  another  period  of  twelve  months
for all 19 stock exchanges.

To facilitate the divestment process, SEBI
notified  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)
(Manner  of  Increasing  and  Maintaining
Public  Shareholding  in  Recognised  Stock
exchanges)  Regulations,  2006  (MIMPS
Regulations)  on  November  13,  2006.
Subsequently, the Government of India policy
regarding 
in
infrastructure  companies  in  securities
markets,  viz.  stock  exchanges,  depositories
and clearing corporations was issued by SEBI
on December 22, 2006. In conformity with the
provisions of the MIMPS Regulations and the

Reporting  Platforms  for  Corporate
Bonds

Earlier,  during  2006-07,  SEBI  had
permitted  BSE  and  NSE  to  set  up
reporting  platforms  for  corporate  bonds
to  capture  all  information  related  to
trading in corporate bonds as accurately
and  as  close  to  execution  as  possible.
The  platforms  were  put  in  place  since
January  01,  2007  and  March  01,  2007,
respectively.  In  addition  to  the  existing
reporting  platforms  being  operated  by
BSE and NSE, SEBI granted approval to
FIMMDA for starting a similar corporate
bond  trade  reporting  platform.  The
platform 
became
operational  in  September  2007.

subsequently 

b)

In  August  2007,  SEBI  started  placing
information on secondary market trades
(both  exchange  and  OTC  trades)  on  its
website  on  the  basis  of  data  provided
by  the  two  stock  exchanges,  BSE  and
NSE  and  also 
from
FIMMDA.

ii. Trading Platform  for Corporate Bonds

a)

b)

c)

The High Level Committee on corporate
bonds  and  securitisation  chaired  by  Dr.
R. H. Patil had recommended that trade
reporting  be  followed  by  development
of  online  order  matching  platforms  for
corporate  bonds  with  clearing  and
settlement.

SEBI  permitted  BSE  and  NSE  to  put  in
place  corporate  bond  trading  platforms
with  effect  from  July  01,  2007,  to  enable
efficient  price  discovery  and  clearing
and settlement in a gradual manner.

To  begin  with,  the  trade  matching
platform  would  be  order  driven  with
essential  features  of  OTC  market.  BSE
and  NSE  were  advised  to  make  use  of
the existing infrastructure available with
them  for  the  purpose  with  necessary
modifications.

d) On  stabilisation  of  the  trade  matching
system,  exchanges  may  move  towards
anonymous  order  matching  for  trading
of  bonds  within  an  appropriate  period
of time.

a)

Though,  in  the  initial  stages,  entities
may  settle  their  trades  bilaterally,  the
stock exchanges would provide clearing

Annual Report 2007-08

Box 1.4: Corporate Bond Market

The  development  of  debt  market  has  a  significant  bearing  on  a  country’s  economic  development
and  its  ability  to  withstand  shocks  and  crises.  The  debt  market  supplements  the  banking  system  to
meet  the  requirements  of  the  corporate  sector  for  long-term  capital  investment  and  asset  creation.  It
provides  a  stable  source  of  finance  when  the  equity  market  is  volatile  and  works  as  an  alternative
source  of  finance.  It  is  essential  that  the  government  securities  market  and  corporate  debt  market
grow  side  by  side,  preferably  at  a  desired  rate.  Further,  it  is  also  advisable  to  keep  the  level  of  total
debt within a sustainable limit and the cost composition and risk profiles are managed efficiently.

There  are  various  means  of  mobilising  funds  in  capital  market  which  include  debt  issue,  public
issue,  private  placement,  preferential  allotment  etc.  Bonds,  particularly  longer  tenure  ones,  are
attractive for long-term, large-scale borrowing to finance fixed assets and investments.

The  corporate  bonds  can  be  issued  by  way  of  private  placements  and  public  offerings.  The
issuers in these categories are the corporate entities, public financial institutions, banks, public sector
undertakings,  state  owned  enterprises  etc.  Major  instruments  of  mobilising  funds  include  partly/
fully convertible debentures, deep discount bonds, zero coupon bonds, floating rate notes and secured
premium  notes.

In  developed  countries,  corporate  debt  market  is  as  developed  as  the  securities  market.  In  USA,
the corporate debt market has supplemented the market for Treasury securities by increasing issuance
sizes of bonds and periodic regularity to appeal to investor demand. Corporate debt is primarily used
as a benchmark to monitor the performance of the market and to evaluate other outstanding corporate
debt  securities  and  assist  in  pricing  of  new  corporate  debt  issues.  In  Korea,  as  well  the  limited
supply of government bonds has been supplemented by dominance of corporate debt issues.

India has a very well developed government securities market similar to other developed countries
in  the  world.  However,  in  India  the  corporate  bond  market  has  been  lagging  behind  the  government
securities  market  in  terms  of  market  infrastructure,  trading  facilities,  number  of  market  participants,
etc.  Recently,  some  important  measures  have  been  undertaken  to  develop  the  corporate  bond  market
in India.

SEBI granted permission to BSE and NSE to set up trading and reporting platforms to capture
all  information  related  to  trading  in  corporate  bonds.  Non-members  of  the  Exchange  were,  however,
provided  connectivity  through  Virtual  Private  Network  (VPN).  Later,  Fixed  Income  Money  Market
and  Derivatives  Association  of  India  (FIMMDA)  was  permitted  to  start  Corporate  Bond  Trade
Reporting Platform. The trade matching platform is now order driven with essential features of OTC
market.  SEBI  decided  that  a  system  of  anonymous  order  matching  shall  be  established  gradually.
BSE  and  NSE  provide  data  pertaining  to  corporate  bonds  comprising  issuer  name,  maturity  date,
current coupon, last price traded, last amount traded, last yield (annualised) traded, weighted average
yield  price,  total  amount  traded  and  the  rating  of  the  bond  and  any  other  additional  information.  To
reduce information asymmetry, the two exchanges co-ordinate among themselves, check for redundancy
and disseminate information on their websites in a homogenous manner. BSE and NSE provide their
services  for  clearing  and  settlement  of  corporate  bonds  traded.  The  shut  period  in  corporate  bonds
has been reduced to align it with that applicable for Government Securities. Tradable lots in corporate
bonds  have  been  reduced  for  all  the  entities.  It  has  been  made  mandatory  for  all  new  issues  of
corporate bonds to have an actual day count convention.

Box 1.4: Corporate Bond Market  (Contd.)

To  facilitate  clearing  and  settlement,  amendments  were  made  to  the  listing  agreement  for
debentures  to  ensure  that  services  of  ECS  (Electronic  Clearing  Service),  Direct  Credit,  RTGS  (Real
Time  Gross  Settlement)  or  NEFT  (National  Electronic  Funds  Transfer)  are  used  for  payment  of
interest  and  redemption  amounts.

In  context  of  repos  in  corporate  bonds,  SEBI  has  requested  RBI  to  initiate  action  as  required.
BSE and NSE confirmed their preparedness for going in for introduction of repos in corporate bonds.

Honourable  Finance  Minister  in  his  Budget  speech  of  2008-09  has  proposed  to  expand  the

market for corporate bonds. These includes certain measures such as,

•

•

•

•

taking  measures  to  develop  the  bond,  currency  and  derivatives  markets  that  will  include
launching  exchange-traded  currency  and  interest  rate  futures;

developing  a  transparent  credit  derivatives  market  with  appropriate  safeguards;

enhancing  the  tradability  of  domestic  convertible  bonds  by  putting  in  place  a  mechanism
that  will  enable  investors  to  separate  the  embedded  equity  option  from  the  convertible  bond
and trade it separately; and

encouraging  the  development  of  a  market-based  system  for  classifying  financial  instruments
based on their complexity and implicit risks.

Honourable  Finance  Minister  also  announced  that  corporate  debt  instruments  issued  in  demat

form and listed on recognised stock exchanges will be exempted from TDS.

In April 2007, SEBI made amendment to
the  listing  agreement  for  debentures  to
ensure  that  no  material  modification
shall  be  made  to  the  structure  of  the
debentures  issued  in  terms  of  coupon,
conversion,  redemption  or  otherwise
without  prior  approval  of  the  stock
exchanges  where  they  are  listed.  The
stock  exchanges  would  also  ensure  that
such

vi. Policy on Debenture Trustees

a)

The  Patil  Committee  had  made

27

Annual Report 2007-08

recommendations  on  strengthening  the
role  of  debenture  trustees  and  ensure
improved  information  flow  on  ratings,
defaults,  etc.,  and  other  information/
reports,  including  compliance  reports
filed  by  the  companies  and  by  the
debenture  trustees  by  making  them
public.

In  August  2007,  SEBI  made  mandatory
that  the  companies  issuing  debentures
and  the  respective  debenture  trustees/
stock  exchanges  shall  disseminate  all
information regarding the debentures to
the  investors  and  the  general  public  by
issuing  a  press  release  and  also
displaying the details on their respective
websites, in the event of:

 Default  by  issuer  company  to  pay

interest/redemption  amount;

 Failure  to  create  a  charge  on  the

assets; and

 Revision  of  rating  assigned  to  the

information/reports 

SEBI  also  made  it  mandatory  to  make
public, 
on
debentures issued including compliance
reports 
filed  by  companies  and
debenture  trustees  by  placing  them  on
websites  of  the  companies  and  the
debenture  trustees.  The  same  is  also  to
be  submitted  to  stock  exchanges  for
dissemination  through  their  websites.

c)

b) RBI  was  of  the  view  that  appropriate
system  for  Delivery  versus  Payment
(DvP)  III  based  clearing  and  settlement
system, active secondary market trading
for  fair  price  and  Straight  Through
Processing  (STP)  needs  to  be  put  in
place. SEBI had initiated necessary steps
for  early  introduction  of  Repos  in
corporate  bond  market  and  involved
closely with RBI, exchanges and clearing
corporations in this regard.

viii. Quote  Dissemination  Platforms

a)

SEBI had received proposals from I-CAP
India  Pvt.  Ltd.,  a  SEBI  registered  stock
broker  and  also  from  other  entities  like
Bloomberg,  Reuters, 
and
subsequently  Derivium  Capital,  seeking
no-objection  to  establish  electronic
systems to facilitate OTC trades.

etc., 

Since there was no specific provision for
SEBI  to  either  permit  or  reject  such
proposals, letters indicating no objection
were  issued  to  ICAP,  Bloomberg  and
Reuters  in  November  2007  and  to
Derivium capital in February 2008.

The systems would help display of buy-
sell  quotes  of  counter  parties  involved
so  that  the  buyers  and  the  sellers  in  the
corporate  bond  market  could  strike
deals at best prices before they go in for
order  matching  either  at  the  exchange
or  bilaterally.

b)

c)

vii. Road towards Repos

a)

The  Patil  Committee  had  placed
emphasis  on  introduction  of  repos  in
corporate  bonds  by  RBI  in  order  to
improve  secondary  market  trading.  It
was also of the view that this would give
an  opportunity  to  investors  who  have
illiquid  corporate  bonds  to  recycle  the
same  and  borrow  money  against  these
securities.

ix. Simplifying  Issuance  Norms

SEBI amended the provisions pertaining
to  issuances  of  corporate  bonds  under  the
SEBI  (Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection)
Guidelines,  2000.  The  changes  to  the
guidelines were as below:

a)

For  public/  rights  issues  of  bonds,
issuers  now  need  to  obtain  rating  from
only  one  credit  rating  agency  instead  of
from  two,  so  as  to  reduce  the  cost  of
issuances.

28

Part One: Policies and Programmes

a)

“Short-Term”  for  such  parking  of  funds
by  mutual  funds  would  be  treated  as  a
period not exceeding 91 days.

b) No  mutual  fund  scheme  would  park
more  than  15  per  cent  of  the  net  assets
in  short-term  deposit(s)  of  all  the
scheduled  commercial  banks  put
together.  However,  it  may  be  raised  to
20  per  cent  with  prior  approval  of  the
trustees. Also, parking of funds in short-
term  deposits  of  associate  and  sponsor
scheduled  commercial  banks  together
would  not  exceed  20  per  cent  of  total
deployment  by  the  mutual  fund  in
short-term  deposits.

c) No  mutual  fund  scheme  would  park
more  than  10  per  cent  of  the  net  assets
in  short-term  deposit(s),  with  any  one
scheduled commercial bank including its
subsidiaries.

d) Asset  Management  Company  (AMC)
would  not  be  permitted  to  charge  any
investment  management  and  advisory
fees  for  parking  of  funds  in  short-term
deposits of scheduled commercial banks
in  case  of  liquid  and  debt  oriented
schemes.

It  was  clarified  that  the  tenure  of  the
term  deposits  placed  as  margin  for  trading
in derivatives shall not exceed 182 days.

ii. Reduction  in  Filing  Fees  for  Offer
Documents  and  Deployment  of  Funds
in  Short-Term  Deposits  of  Scheduled
Commercial  Banks

c)

In  order  to  facilitate  issuance  of  below
investment grade bonds to suit the risk/
return  appetite  of 
investors,  the
stipulation  that  debt  instruments  issued
through  public/  rights  issues  would  be
of  at  least  investment  grade  was
removed.

Further,  in  order  to  afford  issuers  with
desired  flexibility  in  structuring  of  debt
instruments,  structural  restrictions  such
as those on maturity, put/call option, on
conversion,  etc.,  were  removed.

x. Draft Issue and Listing Regulations

a)

b)

In  January  2008,  draft  Regulations  on
Issue and Listing of Debt Securities were
framed and placed on the website along
with a consultative paper for comments.

Salient  features  of  the  draft  regulations
include:  (i)  rationalisation  of  disclosure
requirements,  and 
(ii)  enhanced
responsibilities  of  merchant  bankers  for
exercising due diligence and mandatory
listing  of  private  placement  of  debt  by
companies which were earlier not listed.

The  paper  also  makes  provisions  for  e-
issuances  of  corporate  debt  and  proposes
introduction  of 
listing
requirements for debt of a listed issuer.

Deployment

In  order  to  ensure  that  the  funds
collected  in  a  scheme  are  invested  as  per  the
investment  objective  stated  in  the  offer
document, SEBI issued guidelines for parking
of  funds  in  short-term  deposits  of  scheduled
commercial  banks  –  pending  deployment.
The  following  were  some  of  the  features  of
the  guidelines:

cent  of  amount  raised  in  New  Fund  Offer
(NFO)  subject  to  minimum  Rs.  one  lakh  and
maximum  Rs.  50  lakh  w.e.f.  April  01,  2008.
Also,  the  registration  fees  payable  by  the
mutual funds was also reduced to Rs. 25 lakh
in place of Rs. 50 lakh earlier.

iii. Extension  of  Time  for  Uploading  of

NAVs of Fund of Fund Schemes

In view of the practical difficulties being
faced  by  the  mutual  funds  in  uploading  the
NAV  of  Fund  of  Fund  schemes  on  AMFI’s
website  and  their  own  website,  it  was
decided  that  the  time  limit  for  uploading  of
NAV  for  fund  of  fund  schemes  would  be
extended  to  10:00  am  the  following  business
day.  In  view  of  this,  the  NAVs  of  these
Schemes  would  appear  in  the  newspapers
with  one  day  time  lag.  The  published  NAV’s
would  be  made  available  with  an  asterix
explaining that the NAVs were with one day/
or  the  actual  time  lag.  All  delays  beyond
10:00  am  would  be  reported  to  AMFI  and
SEBI as already stipulated.

iv. Bi-monthly  Compliance  Test  Reports

(CTRs)

With  an  objective  of  effective  and
relevant  disclosure  to  SEBI,  it  was  decided
that instead of filing complete CTR with SEBI,
the AMCs shall only do exceptional reporting
on  a  bi-monthly  basis  i.e.,  the  AMCs  would
report for only those points in the CTR where
it  had  not  complied  with  the  same.  This
exception report would also be placed before
the board of trustees.

v.

Investment  in  ADRs/  GDRs/  Foreign
Securities  and  Overseas  ETFs  by
Mutual  Funds

The  aggregate  ceiling  for  overseas
investments  by  mutual  funds  was  raised  to
USD  four  billion  and  subsequently  to  USD
five  billion  as  an  industry  vide  ceiling  and
within  this  overall  limit,  mutual  funds  can

make  overseas  investments  subject  to  a
maximum  of  USD  300  million.  The
permissible  investments  in  which  overseas
investments could be made by mutual funds
were  expanded.  Accordingly,  a  mutual  fund
can invest in the following:

a) ADRs/ GDRs issued by Indian or foreign

companies;

b)

c)

d)

Equity  of  overseas  companies  listed  on
recognised  stock  exchanges  overseas;

Initial and follow-on public offerings for
listing  at  recognised  stock  exchanges
overseas;

Foreign  Debt  Securities  in  the  countries
with  fully  convertible  currencies,  short-
term  as  well  as 
long-term  debt
instruments  with  rating  not  below
investment  grade  by  accredited/
registered credit rating agencies;

e) Money  market  instruments  rated  not

below  investment  grade;

f)

Repos  in  the  form  of  investment,  where
the  counterparty  was  rated  not  below
investment  grade;  repos  would  not,
however,  involve  any  borrowing  of
funds by mutual funds;

g) Government  securities  where  the
countries  were  rated  not  below
investment  grade;

ix. Removal of Initial Issue Expenses

Previously  close-ended  schemes  were
permitted to charge initial issue expenses and
not to charge entry load. In order to bring in
more transparency and clarify to the investors
in  terms  of  the  expenses  charged  to  them  in
close-end schemes, SEBI Board decided that:

a) Henceforth,  there  would  not  be  any
provision  of  charging  initial  issue
expenses and amortization of the same.

b) All  mutual  fund  schemes  would  now
meet the sales, marketing and such other
expenses  connected  with  sales  and
distribution  of  schemes  from  the  entry
load.

Standard  Warning  in  Advertisements
by Mutual Funds

The  rapid  fire  manner  in  which  the
standard warning “Mutual Fund investments
are  subject  to  market  risks,  read  the  offer
document  carefully  before  investing”  recited
in the audio visual and audio media rendered
it  unintelligible  to  the  viewer/  listener.  In
order  to  improve  the  manner  in  which  the
said  message  was  conveyed  to  the  investors,
it was decided in consultation with AMFI that
with effect from April 1, 2008:

a)

b)

The  time  for  display  and  voice  over  of
the  standard  warning  be  enhanced  to
five

In  case  of  audio  advertisements,  the
standard  warning  would  be  read  in  an
easily  understandable  manner  over  a
period of five seconds.

xi. Revised Format of New Scheme Report

In 

the 

light  of 

recent  policy
developments  on  account  of  waiver  of  entry
load  for  direct  applicants  and  removal  of
initial  issue  expense,  format  of  the  New
Scheme Report was revised.

exceeding 10 per cent of their net assets).

vi. Reduction  in  Expenses  charged  by

Index Fund Scheme

a)

The  limit  on  investment  and  advisory
fee for index fund schemes was reduced
to  0.75  per  cent  of  weekly  average  net
assets  and  the  total  expenses  of  the
scheme  including  the  investment  and
advisory  fees  to  1.5  per  cent  of  the
weekly average net assets.

b)

The  reduced  expenses  and  investment
and  advisory  fees  was  made  applicable
to exchange traded index funds also.

vii. Short  Selling  and  Securities  Lending

and  Borrowing  (SLB)

Enabling  provisions  were  made  for  a
mutual  fund  to  engage  in  short  selling  of
securities  as  well  as  lending  and  borrowing
of  securities  vide  notification  dated  October
31, 2007. However, these amendments would
come  into  effect  only  after  new  framework
for short selling and SLB is put in place.

viii. Waiver of Load for Direct Applications

Keeping  in  view  the  interest  of  the
investors,  it  was  decided  that  no  entry  load
should  be  charged  for  direct  applications
received  by  the  asset  management  company
(AMC) i.e., applications received through the
internet,  submitted  to  AMC  or  collection
centre/  Investor  Service  Centre  that  were  not
routed through any distributor/ agent/ broker.
This  would  be  applicable  for  investments  in
existing schemes with effect from January 04,
2008  and  in  new  schemes  launched  on  and
after the said date. It would also be applicable
to  additional  purchases  done  directly  by
the investor under the same folio and switch-
in to a scheme from other schemes, if such a
transaction  was  done  directly  by  the
investor.

xii. Load  on  Bonus  Units  and  Units
Allotted on Reinvestment of Dividend

The  practice  of  charging  entry  load  on
bonus units issued to unit holders by mutual
funds was taken up with AMFI. Based on the
recommendations  of  AMFI  Working  Group
on Standardisation of Key Operational Areas,
it  was  decided  that AMCs  would  not  charge
entry as well as exit load on bonus units and
on units allotted on reinvestment of dividend.

xiii. Dedicated  Infrastructure  Funds

Finance  Minister  in  his  Budget  speech
for  2007-08,  announced  that  to  promote  the
flow  of  investment  to  the  infrastructure
sector,  mutual  funds  would  be  permitted  to
launch  and  operate  dedicated  infrastructure
funds.  In  order  to  suggest  a  detailed  action
plan 
the  Budget
announcement,  SEBI  set  up  a  four  member
Committee  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri
U. K. Sinha (CMD, UTI AMC).

to  operationalise 

xiv. Real Estate Mutual Funds

The  first  guidelines  for  Real  estate
Mutual  funds  were  approved  by  the  SEBI  in
June  2006. A  real  estate  mutual  fund  scheme
refers  to  mutual  fund  which  has  investment
objective to invest directly or indirectly in real
estate  asset  and  would  be  governed  by  the
provisions  and  guidelines  under  SEBI
(Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996.  During
2007-08, steps were taken to address residual
issues  in  discussion  with  AMFI,  ICAI  and
Credit  Rating  Agencies.  The  necessary
amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Fund),
Regulations 1996, were thereafter notified on
April 16, 2008.

xv. Simplification  of  Offer  Documents

Presently  Offer  Documents  (OD)  and
Key  Information  Memorandum  (KIM)  of
mutual  fund  schemes  are  prepared  as  per
format  prescribed  by  SEBI.  It  was  felt  that
due  to  regulatory  and  other  changes  over  a

period  of  time,  the  ODs  not  only  became
lengthy  and  complex  but  also  highly
technical  and  legalistic.  Consequently,  ODs
appeared  to  have  become  less-user  friendly.
SEBI  in  consultation  with  AMFI  is  working
on  the  modalities  for  simplification  of  OD.
The simplified version of OD would help the
investor  in  making  investment  decision  by
concentrating on the scheme specific details.

V. Foreign  Institutional  Investors

During  2007-08,  SEBI  took  various
initiatives  addressing  issues  relating  to
registration  of  FIIs  and  sub-accounts,  the
issuance  of  P-Notes/ODIs  by  FIIs/Sub-
accounts.  The  important  measures  are
detailed  below:

i.

a)

b)

c)

ii.

a)

Registration  of  FII/Sub-Accounts

The  “broad-based”  criteria  to  be
modified  to  include  entities  having  at
least  20  investors,  with  no  single
investor  holding  more  than  49  per  cent
(instead of 10 per cent at present).

Track  record  of 
individual  fund
managers  to  be  considered  for  the
purpose of ascertaining the track record
of  a  newly  set  up  fund,  subject  to  such
fund  manager  providing  disciplinary
track record details.

FII  and  sub-account  registrations  to  be
perpetual,  subject  to  payment  of  fees
and  requirement  of  renewal  was
removed.

Issuance  of  Participatory  Notes
(P-Notes)

FIIs/ Sub-accounts were prohibited from
issuing  new  Offshore  Derivative
Instruments  (ODIs)  with  derivatives  as
underlying  and  existing  positions  with
regard  to  such  ODIs  to  be  wound  up
over 18 months.

b)

Sub-accounts  were  barred  from  issuing
new  ODIs  with  existing  sub-accounts

32

required  to  wind  up  outstanding
instruments within 18 months.

c) With  a  view  to  capping  the  volume  of
outstanding  P-Notes/ODIs,  following
measures  were  introduced:

 Those  FIIs  currently  issuing  ODIs
with  notional  value  of  ODIs
outstanding  (excluding  derivatives)
as a percentage of their AUC in India
of  less  than  40  per  cent  would  be
allowed  to  issue  further  ODIs  only
at  the  incremental  rate  of  5  per  cent
of their AUC in India.

 Those  FIIs  with  notional  value  of
(excluding
ODIs  outstanding 
derivatives)  as  a  percentage  of  their
AUC  in  India  of  more  than  40  per
cent  shall  issue  ODIs  only  against
cancellation  /  redemption  /  closing
out  of  the  existing  ODIs  of  at  least
equivalent  amount.

 The  effective  date  for  calculation  of
the  AUC  for  the  purpose  of

Part One: Policies and Programmes

determining  the  notional  value  of
ODIs issued as a percentage of AUC,
for  the  above  proposals  would  be
September 30, 2007.

d)

Issuance  of  PNs/ODIs  would  be  limited
to  only  “regulated”  entities  and  not
“registered”  entities.

iii. Change  in  Investment  Limit  in  Debt

Securities

The  investment  limit  for  FIIs  in
Government  Securities  (including  Treasury
Bills)  was  enhanced  from  USD  2.6  billion  to
USD  3.2  billion.  It  was  decided  that
investments  by  FIIs/Sub-Accounts  in  debt
oriented  mutual  fund  units  (including  units
of  money  market  and  liquid  funds)  would
be  considered  as  corporate  debt  investments
and  reckoned  within  the  stipulated  limit  of
USD  1.5  billion,  earmarked  for  FII/Sub-
Account  investments  in  corporate  debt.  The
following would be applicable in this regard:

a)

There  should  be  no  demarcation
between  100  per  cent  debt  and  normal

Box 1.5: Participatory Notes

Participatory Notes are instruments that derive value from underlying securities such as equity
and  equity  linked  instruments.  It  allows  FIIs  including  financial  institutions,  endowment  funds,
hedge  fund,  private  equity  and  other  entities  for  taking  exposure  in  the  Indian  market  without
registered with SEBI as FII or a su- account.

Participatory  Notes  not  only  give  foreign  investors  access  to  domestic  markets,  but  also  the

identity of the actual investor and source of funds could remain disguised.

After  globalisation  in  1992,  when  FII  were  allowed  to  invest  in  Indian  securities  market,  an
offshore  market  for  PN  developed  as  a  primary  channel  for  the  foreign  investor  to  invest  in  India.
Thus  India’s  stock  market  has  witnessed  a  huge  boom  in  recent  years,  much  of  which  has  been
supplied by FIIs flows. The total investment in Indian markets by FII was almost USD 68 billion as
of  March  31,  2008  compared  to  USD  52  billion  in  March  2007.  There  has  been  a  parallel  rise  in  the
popularity  of  P-Notes.

Keeping  in  mind  the  need  to  move  in  right  direction  towards  international  best  practices  and
more  stable,  transparent  securities  markets  in  India,  SEBI  felt  that  it  is  in  the  long-term  benefit  of
the market, flow of funds through P-Notes need to be transparent.

33

Annual Report 2007-08

70:30 FIIs/Sub-Accounts for the purposes
of  allocation  of  debt  investment  limits.
The individual limits allocated to the 100
per  cent  debt  FIIs/Sub-Accounts  stood
cancelled.

b)

The  allocation  of  unutilised/unallocated
limits  for  investment  in  Government
Securities/T-Bills would be on first-come-
first-serve  basis.

VI. Rationalisation of Fee Structure

A committee under the chairmanship of
former  Whole  Time  Member  Shri  V.  K.
Chopra  was  set  up  to  examine  SEBI’s  fee
structure  for  rationalization.  Based  on  the
recommendations  of  the  committee,  SEBI  fee
was  reduced  ranging  from  50  per  cent  to  90
per  cent  for  filing  of  offer  document  for
public/rights  issue,  offer  document  under
SEBI  takeover  and  buy-back  of  securities,
offer document for mutual fund schemes, ad-
valorum fee charged on assets under custody
of custodians and registration fee for venture
capital  funds.

VII. Investor Assistance and Investor

Education  (OIAE)

i.

Redressal  of  Investors’  Grievances

The  Office  of  Investor  Assistance  and
Education  was  mandated  as  the  single
window  interface  for  receiving  grievances
from  investors.  Investors  could  submit  to
OIAE for redressal of the grievances that they
may  have  against  intermediaries  or  listed
companies  at  any  of  the  four  offices  of  the
SEBI  i.e.  Head  Office  at  Mumbai  and  the
three  Regional  Offices  at  Delhi,  Chennai  and
Kolkata,  irrespective  of  the  location  of  the
intermediary/  listed  company.  SEBI  had  put
in  place  a  comprehensive  mechanism  for
dealing  with  investor  grievances.  OIAE
facilitates  redressal  of  the  grievances  of
investors  by  taking  up  these  grievances  with
the respective listed companies.

While  the  standardised  paper  based
formats  common  for  all  types  of  complaints
was  freely  available  at  all  the  offices  of  SEBI
and  on  the  SEBI  websites,  grievances  from
investors  were  accepted  in  any  form  i.e.  a
plain  paper,  on  a  post  card,  via  e-mail  etc.
SEBI  website  also  offers  investors  the  facility
of  checking  the  status  of  their  complaints
lodged with SEBI.

Dedicated  investor  helpline  numbers
were  made  available  for  investors  to  call  for
guidance  that  they  may  require  in  their
dealings  in  the  securities  market  and
assistance  in  filing  grievances.  Dedicated
personnel,  manning  the  helpline,  guided
investors  in  filling  the  grievance  submission
forms as well as determining the appropriate
authority  for  their  first  recourse  in  case  of  a
grievance.  Guidance  was  also  provided  to
approach  the  appropriate  authority  if  their
grievance is outside the purview of SEBI.

The grievances lodged by investors were
taken up with the respective listed companies
and  registered  intermediaries.  Status  of  the
grievances  taken  up  with  the  companies  and
the 
intermediaries  was  continuously
monitored  and  regular  follow-up  action  was
determined  based  on  the  response  received
from the companies and intermediaries.

During  2007-08,  SEBI  received  54,933
grievances from the investors of which 31,618
grievances  were  resolved  as  compared  to
26,473 grievances received from investors and
17,899 complaints resolved in 2006-07. A total
of  1,89,409  grievances  were  pending
resolution as on March 31, 2008 as compared
to  1,66,152  complaints  pending  as  on  March
31, 2007.

Types  of  investors’  grievances  received
and  redressed,  as  on  March  31,  2008,  are
given  in  the  Table  1.4  whereas  type-wise
status  of  complaints  awaiting  redressal  is
provided in Table 1.5.

An exercise was conducted wherein pre-
paid post cards were sent to 27,319 investors
whose  grievances  had  been  treated  as
resolved based on the action informed by the
respective  companies.  Confirmations  were
sought  from  these  investors  whether  the
grievances  were  actually  resolved.  Cases
where  investors  indicated  the  grievances  as
yet  unresolved  were  reopened  and  matter
was  taken  up  vigorously  with  the  concerned
companies.

with  a  stock  exchange  designated  for  the
purpose.  To  release  this  amount,  an
application  had  to  be  made  to  SEBI  four
months  after  the  date  of  listing  for  issuing  a
NoC  letter  to  the  exchange.  OIAE  processes
this  application  and  ensures  that  investors’
grievances  received  by  SEBI  were  addressed
by  the  concerned  companies  satisfactorily
before issuance of NoC.

In  2007-08,  49  NoCs  were  issued  to
applicant companies. In 12 cases, NoCs were
yet  to  be  issued  due  to  non-submission  of
required  documents  by  the  companies  or  an
unsatisfactory  record  of  redressal  of  investor
grievances on their part.

iv.

Investors’  Associations

OIAE  also  recognises  representatives  of
investors in the form of investors associations.
SEBI  had  collaborated  with  these  investors’
associations,  which  had  interest  of  investors,
to  spread  the  message  of  “Invest  with
knowledge”  to  the  investing  public.  The
inputs,  view  and  opinions  of 
these
associations  were  considered  for  policy
formulation.

SEBI continued its attempts to approach
new  bodies  working  for  the  welfare  of
consumers/investors  to  get  recognition  as
Investors’  Associations  with  itself.  As  on
March  31,  2008,  21  Investors’  Associations
had been granted recognition by SEBI:

SEBI  provided  financial  assistance  and
educational  material  to  these  associations  in
order to empower them to act as conduits of
its investor education and grievance redressal
efforts.  SEBI  also  helped  the  Investors
Associations  by  giving  them  grants  for
procuring  computers,  office  equipments  and
other  infrastructural  items.

a) Decisions  following  deliberations  in
the  meeting  of  Investors’  Associations
with  SEBI  Officials

SEBI conducted periodical meetings with
representatives  of  recognised  Investors’
Associations  which  give  an  opportunity  to

consider  representations/submissions  on
matters  of  policy  made  by  the  Investors’
Associations.

Transmission  to  arrive  at  an  overall  picture
of  the  difficulties  faced  by  all  the  concerned
parties in a case of transmission of shares.

Two recent directions were issued taking
into  consideration  the  views  expressed  by
these Associations at these meetings:

and

Taking  note  of  the  fact  that  the  SEBI
(DIP)  guidelines  only  require  the
quotation  of  the  PAN  number  in  issue
application  forms  and  not  a  photocopy
of the PAN card as being asked for, SEBI
instructed  merchant  bankers  to  ensure
that no application was rejected for want
of a copy of the PAN card.

b) Committee on Transmission of Shares

During  an 

Investors’  association
meeting,  it  was  pointed  out  by  some
representatives  of  the  Investors  Associations
that  despite  the  legislative  intent  to  simplify
the  procedure  of  transmission  of  shares,
companies had over a period of time evolved
varying 
and  diverse  documentary
compliances  on  the  part  of  the  legal
representative of the deceased security holder
which  make  transmission  of  shares,  a  long
and  tedious  process.  To  address  this  issue
and  to  evolve  a  uniform  procedure  and  to
alleviate  and  redress  complaints  received  by
SEBI  in  relation  to  ‘Transmission  of  Shares’,
a Group headed by Shri R. K. Nair, Executive
Director, SEBI was set up.

v.

SEBI Investor Protection and Education
Fund

Para  91  of  the  Union  Budget  speech
2006-07,  reads  “An  investor  protection  fund
to  be  set  up  under  the  aegis  of  SEBI  funded
by fines and penalties recovered by SEBI”.

SEBI had been working in co-ordination
with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  achieve  this
objective.  As  a  part  of  this  proposal  and
based 
committee
recommendations, SEBI had suggested to the
Finance Ministry other sources of income for
the proposed fund as:

the  Kania 

on 

a) Unclaimed  amount  of  dividend  or
interest  lying  with  a  mutual  fund,
collective  investment  company  or
venture capital fund.

b) Amounts  or  securities  of  clients  lying
unclaimed  with  an  intermediary  in  the
securities  market.

c) Monies  lying  un-utilised  in  the  Investor
Protection Fund of the stock exchanges.

While  the  necessary  action  by  way  of
amendment  to  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  was
awaited,  the  SEBI  Investor  Protection  and
Education  Fund  (IPEF)  was  created  by  SEBI
from  its  own  corpus  by  an  executive  order
dated  July  23,  2007  passed  under  Section  11
of the SEBI Act and an amount of Rs.10 crore
had  been  credited  to  it.  The  operational
guidelines  of  the  fund  were  detailed  in  the
draft  SEBI  IPEF  Regulations,  2008,  which
were  posted  on  the  SEBI  website  for  public
comments.

VIII. Retrospect  and  Prospects

i.

Retrospect

So far, Indian economy has continued to
sustain  a  high  rate  of  growth  during  the
Tenth  Plan  period.  During  2007-08,  the  GDP
growth  rate  was  9.0  per  cent.  The  continued
momentum  in  manufacturing  and  service
sector  albeit  at  a  decreasing  rate  resulted  in
higher  capacity  utilisation  and  increased
business  confidence.

The  investors’  confidence  was  also
reflected  in  the  activities  in  the  securities
market.  The  securities  market  continued  to
gather  momentum  with  the  BSE  Sensex
crossing the 14,000 mark for the first time on
April  24,  2007.  Thereafter,  it  crossed  20,000
level on December 11, 2007. It touched an all
time  high  of  20873.33  on  January  08,  2008.
During  2007-08,  BSE  Sensex  gained  19.5  per
cent  and  Nifty  gained  23.9  per  cent  over
March 2007. Reflecting the price appreciation,
market  capitalisation  (of  BSE)  to  GDP  ratio
and  the  traded  value  (of  BSE  and  NSE
together)  to  GDP  ratio  increased  to  109  per
cent and 108.8 per cent, respectively in 2007-
08 from 85.5 per cent and 70.0 per cent a year
ago. The rally in securities market was broad-
based  with  all  the  sectors  registering  gains.
Besides  FIIs,  mutual  funds  and  retail
investors  were  also  active  in  the  secondary
market.  Backed  by  strong  macro-economic
fundamentals,  the  overall  market  sentiment
was buoyant throughout the major part of the
year,  except  in  last  quarter  of  2008.  The
market  witnessed  a  major  correction  in
January  31,  2008,  leading  to  a  fall  of  Sensex
by  13.0  per  cent  and  Nifty  by  16.3  per  cent
over December 31, 2007 on account of global
stock  price  meltdown.

The  primary  market  witnessed
continued  high  activity  during  2007-08.
Though the same number of companies (124)
accessed  the  primary  market  in  2007-08,  the
amount  mobilised  was  Rs.  87,029  crore

during  2007-08,  higher  than  Rs.  33,508  crore
mobilised  during  2006-07.  The  number  of
Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) increased to 85
in  2007-08  from  77  in  2006-07,  however,  the
number  of  rights  issue  in  2007-08  declined
to 32 from 39 in 2006-07.

mobilisation of resources by the mutual funds
in  2007-08.  With  private  sector  mutual  funds
dominating the resource mobilisation efforts,
