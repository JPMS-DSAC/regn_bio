Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices
After SEBI started taking up cases for investigations, one of the priority items on the agenda was to frame suitable regulations. SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Markets ) Regulations, were enacted in 1995 which empowers SEBI to investigate into violations committed by any person including an investor, issuer or an intermediary associated with the securities markets. After the framing of the regulations, various cases have been identified and have been taken up for investigations. The details of the same have been elaborated in Part II of the report.
