PART  TWO:  REVIEW  OF  TRENDS  AND  OPERATIONS

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

1.

PRIMARY  SECURITIES  MARKET

The  momentum  witnessed  in  the
primary  market  since  2005-06  increased
further  in  2006-07.  Strong  macro-economic
fundamentals, favourable investment climate,
encouraging  corporate  results,  and  buoyant
secondary market performance supported by
institutional  investors  encouraged  a  number
of companies to raise capital from the primary
market.  Besides  several  large  companies,
many  small  and  medium-sized  corporates
accessed  the  primary  market  and  mobilised
resources  through  public  and  rights  issues.
Apart from the conventional modes, Qualified
Institutions’  Placement  (QIP)  was  also  used
by  many  listed  companies  to  meet  their
financing  requirements.

I. Resource  Mobilisation

During 2006-07, 124 companies accessed
the  primary  market  and  raised  Rs. 33,508
crore  through  public  and  rights  issues
compared to 139 companies which had raised
Rs. 27,382 crore in 2005-06 (Table 2.1.A). Even
though  the  number  of  companies  accessing
the  primary  market  was  lower,  the  amount

mobilised was higher in 2006-07 as compared
to  the  previous  year.  Of  the  85  public  issues,
77  were  Initial  Public  Offerings  (IPOs)  and
eight  were  Further  Public  Offerings  (FPOs)
(Chart  2.1).  Resources  raised  through  IPOs
and FPOs were Rs. 28,504 crore and Rs. 1,293
crore,  respectively.  The  average  size  of  the
public  issues  increased  from  Rs.  226  crore  in
2005-06  to  Rs.  351  crore  in  2006-07.  The
average  size  of  IPOs  increased  from  Rs.  138
crore to Rs. 370 crore during the same period.
The  share  of  IPOs  in  the  total  resource
mobilisation  was  85.1  per  cent  in  2006-07  as
compared  to  40.0  per  cent  in  2005-06.  The
amount  mobilised  through  rights  issues
declined  from  Rs.  4,088  crore  in  2005-06  to
Rs. 3,711 crore in 2006-07.

Due  to  introduction  of  QIP  in  2006-07,
the  resources  raised  through  FPO  route
declined  from  45.1  per  cent  in  2005-06  to  3.9
per  cent  in  2006-07.  As  per  the  data  made
available  by  NSE  and  BSE,  four  companies
only  at  BSE  and  21  companies  both  at  NSE
and  BSE  raised  Rs.  4,963  crore  at  BSE  and
Rs. 4,530 crore at NSE through the QIP route
(Table  2.1.B).

II. Sector-wise  Resource  Mobilisation

The private sector companies dominated
the  resource  mobilisation  from  the  primary
market  in  2006-07.  There  were  122  issues
from  the  private  sector  companies  and  only
two  issues  from  the  public  sector  (Table  2.2).
The  private  sector  and  the  public  sector
raised  Rs.  31,728  crore  and  Rs.  1,779  crore
respectively.  The  public  sector  issues  were
from  Power  Finance  Corporation  Ltd.

(a  financial  company)  and  Indian  Bank.
During 2006-07, 94.7 per cent of total resource
mobilisation  was  from  private  sector
compared  to  73.8  per  cent  in  previous  year
(Chart  2.2).  The  share  of  public  sector
declined  from  26.2  per  cent  in  2005-06  to  5.3
per cent in 2006-07.

III. Size-wise  Resource  Mobilisation

The  average  issue-size  was  larger  in
2006-07 as compared to 2005-06. The average
size  of  the  issues  rose  from  Rs.  197  crore  in
2005-06 to Rs. 270 crore in this financial year.
In  contrast  to  the  trend  in  the  previous
financial  year,  substantial  amount  of  fund
mobilisation  was  through  large  issues.  There
were  11  issues  in  the  above  Rs.  500  crore
category,  which  mobilised  Rs.  22,400  crore
and 33 issues were in Rs. 100 crore – Rs. 500
crore  category,  which  mobilised  Rs. 7,537
crore (Table 2.3).

SECONDARY  SECURITIES
MARKET

Equity Market in India : An
Overview

The  stock  market  witnessed  a  mixed
trend  during  2006-07.  During  the  year,  there
was  distinctly  upward  trend  interspersed

with  some  corrections.  The  benchmark
indices  continued  to  reach  new  heights
during  2006-07  amidst  major  corrections  in
May  2006  and  February  2007.  Strong  macro-
economic  fundamentals  with  high  GDP
growth  rate,  healthy  corporate  results,
optimistic  investment  scenario,  and  strong
institutional investor support led the upward
trend  in  the  market.  However,  towards  the
end  of  the  year,  a  higher  than  expected
inflation  rate  coupled  with  rise  in  interest
rates somewhat dampened the sentiment.

During  2006-07,  the  benchmark  indices
crossed  many  milestones.  The  BSE  Sensex
and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  recorded  gain  of  15.9

per  cent  and  12.3  per  cent,  respectively  over
March  31,  2006.  The  BSE  Sensex  gained  1792
points  during  the  financial  year  to  close  at
13072  on  March  31,  2007  from  11280  as  on
March  31,  2006.  The  S&P  CNX  Nifty  added
419  points  to  close  at  3822  at  the  end  of
March 2007 over 3403 recorded at the end of
March 2006 (Chart 2.3).

In  the  first  quarter,  stock  markets
remained  buoyant  till  May  10,  2006,  but
witnessed  large  correction  during  the  rest  of
May  2006.  On  May  10,  2006  both  the  BSE
Sensex and the S&P CNX Nifty closed at high
level  of  12612  and  3754,  respectively.
Beginning  from  May  11,  2006  indices
declined,  mainly,  due  to  net  sales  by  FIIs,

36

uncertainty in global interest rates, sharp fall
in  metal  prices,  and  expected  inflationary
pressures.  Concerns  over  an  impending
slowdown in the global growth and declining
trend  in  Asian  market  accentuated  the
downtrend.  The  BSE  Sensex  closed  at  a  low
of  8929  on  June  14,  2006.  During  the  second
half of June 2006, stock markets recovered on
account  of  fresh  buying  by  FIIs,  onset  of  the
monsoon, and recovery in major international
stock  markets.

In  the  second  quarter  of  the  year,  the
stock  markets  gained  buoyancy,  despite  the
rise  in  the  crude  oil  prices,  on  account  of
strong  performance  of  the  economy  in  the
first  quarter,  improved  credit  rating,  and
active  support  from  institutional  investors.

In the third quarter, fall in the crude oil
prices  led  to  an  upward  trend  in,  both  local
and  global  markets.  However,  towards  the
end  of  third  quarter,  in  December  2006,  the
indices  declined  once  again,  on  account  of
hike in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by RBI, low
growth in manufacturing sector and year-end
profit  booking.

In  the  fourth  quarter,  there  was  a
sustained  gain  in  the  markets,  followed  by  a
rise  in  the  benchmark  indices.  The  BSE
Sensex closed at an all-time high of 14652 on
February  8,  2007.  At  this  point  of  time,  the
major  concern  of  the  economy  was  rising
inflation  which  might  impact  the  growth
rates. The high inflation forced RBI to tighten
monetary  measures  with  a  rise  in  CRR,  repo
rates, and bank rate.

In  tandem  with  the  rise  in  the  equity
market,  there  was  a  rise  in  the  market
capitalisation  and  turnover  in  2006-07  (Table
2.7). The turnover in the cash segment of NSE
and  BSE  rose  by  23.9  per  cent  and  17.2  per
cent, respectively in 2006-07 over the previous
year.  The  increase  in  turnover  at  the
derivatives segment of NSE was 52.3 per cent

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

during  the  same  period.  At  BSE  too,  the
volumes  in  the  derivatives  segment  picked
up  during  the  financial  year.  Market
capitalisation of BSE and NSE also witnessed
a  rise  of  17.3  per  cent  and  19.7  per  cent
during 2006-07 over the previous year. By the
end  of  the  financial  year,  the  P/E  ratio  of
Indian  indices  declined  from  the  historical
highs.  P/E  ratio  of  Indian  indices  was  the
highest,  in  the  emerging  markets,  in
November  2006.  As  on  March  31,  2007,  the
P/E  ratio  of  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty
was 20.3 and 18.4 respectively. In comparison
to the previous years, volatility of the indices
was  higher  on  account  of  wide  fluctuations
in  markets.  The  annualised  volatility  of  BSE
Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty was 27.8 per cent
and 28.0 per cent, respectively in 2006-07.

Rising  international  oil  prices  and  a
strong  economic  growth  rate  amplified  the
inflationary  pressure  in  the  global  scenario
during  the  first  half  of  2006.  Earlier  in  May
2006, there was a major correction across the
equity  markets  in  emerging  economies.  But
the  pressure  eased  after  August  2006  on
account  of  monetary  tightening  measures
adopted  by  the  major  central  banks  and
softening  of  oil  prices.  There  was  buoyancy
across  the  financial  markets  during  the
second half of 2006. But since February 2007,
there was a rise in volatility due to correction
in  the  asset  prices.  In  spite  of  correction,  the
international  equity  markets  were  at  their
peak on account of expected robust earnings.

The correction in May-June 2006 was
mostly limited to emerging markets. Contrary
to this, February-March 2007 correction was
broad-based. The uncertainty in US economic
outlook with an impending recession led to a
fall in the equity prices in US, Japan and
European equity markets. Equity prices in
emerging  markets  fell  mostly  due  to  the
unwinding of Yen  carry  trades.  This  was
worsened by the deterioration in the US sub
prime  mortgage  market  and  subsequent

The  geographical  reach  of  the  stock
market  can  be  gauged  from  the  city-wise
distribution  of  turnover  of  NSE  and  BSE.
Mumbai/Thane  was  the  top  city  accounting
for  63.7  per  cent  of  the  total  turnover  (Table
2.12). The share of Delhi in the total turnover
was  10.2  per  cent  followed  by  Kolkata  (7.5
per  cent),  Ahmedabad  (2.9  per  cent)  and
Chennai  (1.6  per  cent).  The  share  of  top  five
cities  in  the  total  value  of  shares  traded  was
85.9 per cent in 2006-07.

IV. Market  Capitalisation

Market  capitalisation  is  a  leading
indicator of the health of the stock market. The
market capitalisation of an exchange is a
summation of market capitalisation of all the
individual stocks listed on the exchange. As
such, market capitalisation of BSE has been
higher than that of NSE due to larger number
of shares being listed at BSE. The market
capitalisation of BSE increased by 17.3 per cent

to  Rs.  35,45,041  crore  in  2006-  07  from
Rs. 30,22,190 crore at the end of 2005-06 (Table
2.13). Whereas, the market capitalisation of
NSE rose by 19.7 per cent to Rs. 33,67,350 crore
at the end of 2006-07 from Rs. 28,13,201 crore
at the end of 2005-06 (Table 2.14).

The  rise  of  market  capitalisation  of
frontline  and  the  sectoral  indices  at  BSE  and
NSE was lower in 2006-07 compared to 2005-
06.  The  market  capitalisation  of  BSE  Sensex
rose  by  20.2  per  cent  in  2006-07  against  96.3
per cent in 2005-06. The market capitalisation
of BSE Teck index and Bankex index rose by
53.1  per  cent  and  16.9  per  cent,  respectively
in  2006-07.  The  decline 
in  market
capitalisation  of  BSE  PSU  index  was  3.5  per
cent  in  2006-07  in  contrast  to  a  rise  of  45.0
per  cent  in  2005-06.  Market  capitalisation  of
S&P CNX Nifty rose by 19.7 per cent during
2006-07 compared to 67.1 per cent in 2005-06
(Table  2.14).

V. Stock Market Indicators

Market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio  is  a
good  indicator  of  the  health  of  stock  market
of  an  economy.  Leading  economies  of  the
world have market capitalisation far in excess
of  their  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  This
indicates not only the investor confidence, but
also  the  strength  of  their  economies.  The
market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio  of  Indian
stock  market  increased  over  the  last  four
years.  It  rose  from  23.2  per  cent  of  GDP  in
2002-03  to  85.9  per  cent  in  2006-07.  At  the
end  of  2005-06,  it  was  84.7  per  cent  (Table
2.15).

Liquidity  of  the  stock  market  indicates
the  ease  with  which  stocks  can  be  traded.
One  way  to  gauge  the  liquidity  is  to  look  at
the ratio of value of shares traded to GDP at
current  market  prices.  This  ratio  increased
from 67.0 per cent in 2005-06 to 70.4 per cent
in  2006-07.  The  traded  value-GDP  ratio  for

the  derivatives  segment  rose  from  135.2  per
cent in 2005-06 to 178.3 per cent in 2006-07.

Other  important  indicators  are:  price/
earnings  (P/E)  ratio  and  price-book  (P/B)
value  ratio.  P/E  ratio  is  a  widely  used
indicator. It is also known as PE multiple. The
P/E  ratios  of  Indian  indices,  even  though
lower  compared  to  previous  year,  were  still
at the sixth (BSE Sensex) and ninth (S&P CNX
Nifty),  highest  position  among  the  emerging
markets (Chart 2.6).

The  highest  P/E  ratio  was  for  SHCOMP
index  of  China  followed  by  Nikkei  index  of
Japan,  NASDAQ  composite  of  USA,  JCI
index  of  Indonesia,  and  IPSA  index  of  Chile.
At  the  end  of  March  2007,  the  P/E  ratios  of
BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  were  20.3
and 18.4 respectively (Table 2.16).

There was a moderation in the P/E ratios
of indices towards the end of the financial
year. Month-wise data shows that P/E ratios of
indices rose considerably in the third quarter,

with a peak in December 2006. The P/E ratios
of all the indices peaked in the third quarter,
after which it declined by the end of 2006-07.
CNX IT had the highest P/E ratio among host
of sectoral and mid-cap indices.

The  price  to  book  value  (P/B)  ratio
measures the returns left for the shareholders

after deducting the total liabilities. In effect,
the P/B ratio of an index shows the asset
quality  of  the  companies  included  in  the
index. The P/B ratio was the highest for CNX
IT index, followed by BSE Sensex and BSE 100
(Table 2.17).

VI. Volatility in Stock Markets

The  average  daily  volatility  was  the
highest  for  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty
in  June  2006,  coinciding  with  the  correction
witnessed  during  the  month  (Table  2.18).  It
was  the  highest  for  BSE  200,  BSE  Small  Cap
and  BSE  500  index  also  in  June  2006.  The
lowest average daily volatility for BSE Sensex
and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  was  recorded  during
November  2006.

The annualised volatility for BSE Sensex
and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  was  higher  in  2006-07
as  compared  to  2005-06  (Table  2.19).  The
annualised  volatility  of  BSE  Sensex  rose  to
27.6 per cent in 2006-07 from 16.3 per cent in
2005-06.  For  S&P  CNX  Nifty,  the  annualised
volatility  was  28.0  per  cent  in  2006-07  as
compared to 16.4 per cent in 2005-06.

The  stock  markets  of  emerging
economies  were  more  volatile  as  compared
to  developed  markets  during  the  financial

year.  Among 
the  emerging  markets,
Colombia  displayed  the  highest  volatility
(37.9  per  cent)  followed  by  Russia  (35.9  per
cent)  and  India  (27.6  per  cent)  (Chart  2.7).
Volatility  of  the  international  markets  was
higher in 2006-07 compared to 2005-06. Japan
was  the  most  volatile  (18.0  per  cent)  among
developed  markets  followed  by  South  Korea
(17.0  per  cent),  Hong  Kong  and  Singapore
(16.5 per cent) (Table 2.19).

Annual return, on a point-to-point basis,
was  the  highest  for  China  in  2006-07.  The
correlation co-efficient between volatility and
annual  returns  in  2006-07  was  0.61,  which
was  positive  and  significant  for  26  indices
studied  across  countries.  In  tandem  with
spiralling  asset  prices,  P/E  ratios  of  most
indices  witnessed  an  upward  trend.  The  P/E
ratio  was  the  highest  for  China  (40.5)
followed by Japan (37.4), Indonesia (21.4) and
Chile (21.3) (Table 2.20).

in 2005-06 (Table 2.21). The trading frequency
improved  considerably  in  the  financial  year
on  both  the  exchanges  as  the  number  of
stocks  that  traded  for  more  than  100  days
was  higher  for  2006-07  as  compared  to

stocks of BSE were traded for under 10 days in
the year compared to 1.2 per cent on NSE.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

2006-07.  Only  four  regional  exchanges  viz.
Calcutta,  Hyderabad,  Madras  and  UPSE
recorded  some  transactions  (Table  2.22).
There  was  virtually  no  trading  in  the
remaining 16 exchanges. The activities in the
regional  exchanges  are  carried  out  mainly
through  subsidiaries  which,  in  turn,  have
taken  up  membership  of  the  BSE  and  NSE.
Among  the  subsidiaries,  the  highest  growth
in  turnover  (84.7  per  cent)  was  recorded  by
DSE  Financial  Services  Ltd.,  the  subsidiary
of  Delhi  Stock  Exchange  Association  Ltd.
(Table  2.23).

During  2006-07,  NSE  had  the  largest
number  of  stock  brokers  followed  by
Calcutta,  BSE  and  ISE  (Table  2.24).  Active
stock  brokers  as  percentage  of  total  stock
brokers  were  negligible  in  many  exchanges.
The  active  stock  brokers  were  nil  in  ten
regional  stock  exchanges.  At  NSE  the
percentage  of  active  stock  brokers  to  total
number  of  stock  brokers  declined  in  2006-07
over  the  previous  financial  year  whereas  at
BSE,  during  the  same  period  the  number  of
active  stock  brokers  as  percentage  to  total
number of stock brokers increased.

IX. Dematerialisation

Introduction  of  dematerialisation  by
SEBI  in  1996  was  a  major  policy  initiative
towards  the 
improvement  of  market
microstructure  of  Indian  stock  market  to
improve 
efficiency.
Dematerialisation  is  a  process  by  which
physical  certificates  of  a  company  are
converted  to  an  equivalent  number  of

operational 

securities  in  electronic  form  and  credited  to
the  investor’s  account  maintained  with  their
depository  participant  (DP).  There  are  two
depositories  in  India,  namely  National
Securities  Depository  Limited  (NSDL)  and
Central  Depository  Services  (India)  Limited
(CDSL).  Currently,  almost  99  per  cent  of  the
trades  in  India  are  settled  in  demat  mode.
These  depositories  have  set  up  nation  wide

X. Derivatives Market in India

The 

launch  of  exchange 

traded
derivative  products  was  one  of  the  major
product innovations in Indian stock markets.
Trading  in  derivatives  began  in  India  with
the introduction of index futures in June 2000,
followed  by  index  options  and  stock  options
in  June  2001  and  July  2001,  respectively.
Single  stock  futures,  though  a  late  entrant,
in  November  2001,  is  the  dominant  product
today  in  Indian  derivatives  market.  The
trading in interest rate futures, started in June
2003,  has  not  picked  up  so  far.  Trading  of
derivative  contracts  takes  place  on  NSE  and
BSE  and  settlement  take  place  through  their
respective  clearing  corporations. Almost  99.0
per  cent  of  derivatives  trading  took  place  at
NSE.  Since  the  second  half  of  2006-07,  BSE
started  recording  some  volumes  in  index
futures and single stock futures category.

The combined turnover of BSE and NSE
in  derivatives  segment  rose  by  53.7  per  cent
to  Rs.  74,15,278  crore  in  2006-07  compared
Rs. 48,24,259 crore in 2005-06 (Table 2.27). The
turnover in derivatives segment was 381.1 per
cent of the cash market turnover at NSE and

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

255.6  per  cent  of  the  combined  cash  market
turnover at BSE and NSE (Chart 2.8). In fact,
the  total  turnover  in  the  derivatives  segment
surpassed  the  combined  cash  market
turnover of both BSE and NSE in 2004 itself.

Month-wise, the decline in turnover was
the  highest  at  25.0  per  cent  in  the  month  of
June  2006  due  to  a  correction  in  the  equity
market  in  May  2006.  The  fall  in  turnover
continued  in  July  and  August.  Fall  was  also
witnessed  in  October,  January,  and  March.
The  highest  turnover  in  this  segment  was
recorded  in  May  2006.  The  percentage  rise
in turnover over the previous month was the
highest  for  November  2006  at  28.5  per  cent.
The  average  daily  turnover  in  2006-07  rose
by  54.9  per  cent  to  Rs.  29,780  crore  from  Rs.
19,220  crore  in  2005-06.  The  open  interest  at
NSE  increased  by  0.6  per  cent  to  Rs.  38,710
crore  at  the  end  of  March  2007,  from
Rs. 38,469  crore  as  on  March  31,  2006.  The
open interest was the highest in January 2007
(Rs. 51,000  crore).

The  total  number  of  contracts  traded  in
the  derivatives  segment  on  NSE  rose  by  37.6
per  cent  to  21,68,83,573  in  2006-07  from
15,76,19,271  in  2005-06.  The  daily  average
number  of  derivatives  contracts  traded  rose
from  6.3  lakh  in  2005-06  to  8.6  lakh  in
2006-07.

stock 

single 

Single stock futures continued to account
for  a  sizeable  proportion  of  total  derivatives
turnover.  About  52.1  per  cent  of  total
derivatives segment turnover was contributed
by 
futures.  However,
considerable  monthly  variation  was  noted  in
the composition. In March 2006, index futures
turnover  (41.9  per  cent)  surpassed  the  stock
futures turnover (40.0 per cent). In June 2006,
index  futures  and  stock  futures  constituted
an  equal  44.0  per  cent  of  total  turnover
(Table  2.28).

On  the  whole,  during  2006-07  index
futures  turnover  was  34.5  per  cent  of  total
derivatives  turnover  compared  to  31.4  per
cent  in  2005-06.  The  share  of  index  options
and  stock  options  was  10.8  per  cent  and  2.6
per  cent,  respectively.  In  fact,  the  share  of
index  options  has  grown  progressively  from
4.8 per cent in 2004-05 to 7.0 per cent in 2005-
06, and to 10.8 per cent in 2006-07 (Chart 2.9).

On  a  monthly  basis,  the  share  of  single
stock  futures  in  the  total  turnover  was  the

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

highest in April 2006 (62.4 per cent), followed
by  November  2006  (59.8  per  cent),  January
2007  (55.9  per  cent),  and  May  2006  (55.1  per
cent).  The  turnover  of  index  futures  was  the
highest in June 2006 (43.7 per cent), followed
by  March  2007  (41.9  per  cent),  and  July  2006
(39.1  per  cent).  The  share  of  index  options
was the highest in March 2007 (16.3 per cent),
followed  by  February  2007  (13.1  per  cent),
and December 2006 (11.9 per cent).

The  open  interest  in  the  derivatives
segment  of  NSE  rose  to  Rs.  38,670  crore  as
on  March  31,  2007  from  Rs.  38,469  crore  as
on March 31, 2006. Product-wise share in the
open  interest  shows  that  the  notional  value
of  outstanding  contracts  was  the  highest  for
stock  futures  (Rs.  18,513  crore)  followed  by
index futures (Rs. 12,453 crore), index options
(Rs.  7,297  crore),  and  stock  options  (Rs. 447
crore)  as  on  March  31,  2007.  The  Table  2.29

market  requires  efficient  intermediation.  The
mutual  funds  have  emerged  as  one  of  the
important  class  of  financial  intermediaries
which  cater  to  the  needs  of  retail  investors.
As  a  traditional  investment  vehicle,  the
mutual funds pool resources from those who
save and allocate them to various investment
opportunities.

The  gross  mobilisation  of  resources  by
all  mutual  funds  during  2006-07  stood  at
Rs. 19,38,493  crore  compared  to  Rs. 10,98,149
crore  during  the  previous  year  –  an  increase
of  76.5  per  cent  over  the  year  (Table  2.35).
Redemption  also  rose  by  76.4  per  cent  to  Rs.

resources  by  all  mutual  funds  stood  at
Rs. 93,985 crore in 2006-07. It was the highest
ever  in  a  single  year.  Reflecting  large
mobilisation  of  resources,  the  assets  under
management  by  all  mutual  funds  increased
to Rs. 3,26,292 crore at the end of March 2007
from Rs. 2,31,862 crore a year ago.

Like the earlier years, the bulk of resource
mobilisation was by the private sector mutual
funds.  Their  share  in  the  net  resource
mobilisation stood at 84.1 per cent in 2006-07
as  against  81.4  per  cent  in  the  previous
financial year (Chart 2.10). Net amount raised
by UTI mutual fund and other public sector
mutual funds constituted 7.8 per cent and 8.1
per cent of the total fund mobilisation. But as
a percentage of gross mobilisation, the share of
private sector mutual funds declined to 82.5
per cent in 2006-07 from 83.3 per cent in 2005-
06. The share of public sector mutual funds
and UTI mutual fund, in gross mobilisation
was 10.1 per cent and 7.3 per cent respectively
(Table 2.36).

The pattern of funds raised on a scheme-
wise  basis  gives  a  different  picture  in  2006-
07.  Unlike  last  financial  year,  when  equity
oriented  mutual  funds  dominated  the
mobilisation  efforts,  it  was  the  debt  oriented
funds  which  dominated  in  2006-07  (Table
2.37).  The  net  inflow  of  funds  by  income  /
debt  oriented  schemes  was  Rs. 64,067  crore
constituting  68.2  per  cent  of  the  net  fund
mobilised.  The  equity  oriented  schemes
mobilised  Rs. 28,206  crore  compared  to
Rs. 35,231  crore  in  2005-06.  The  net  amount
raised by the balanced schemes was Rs. 1,711
crore as against Rs. 927 crore in 2005-06. The
net amount mobilised by close-ended mutual
funds outweighed that of open-ended mutual
funds  in  2006-07  (Chart  2.11).  The  share  of
close-ended  schemes  in  the  private  sector
mutual  fund,  public  sector  mutual  fund  and
UTI  mutual  fund  was  74.6  per  cent,  66.9  per
cent  and  82.0  per  cent  respectively  during
2006-07.

As  on  March  31,  2007  there  were  755

Annual Report 2006-07

As  on  March  31,  2007,  there  were  485
open-ended  schemes  and  270  close-ended
schemes  (Table  2.38).  The  number  of  close-
ended  schemes  rose  substantially  from  47  in
2004-05  to  129  in  2005-06,  and  further  to  270
in  2006-07.  There  were  234  close-ended  debt
oriented  schemes  in  2006-07  as  against  112
in  2005-06.  The  number  of  equity  oriented
schemes  which  were  open-ended  and  close-
ended was 235 and 32 respectively.

The  total  assets  under  management
(AUM)  of  all  mutual  funds  rose  by  40.7  per
cent to Rs. 3,26,292 crore as on March 31, 2007
from  Rs. 2,31,862  crore  a  year  ago.  The  net
assets  of  all  categories  of  mutual  fund
schemes  witnessed  a  rise  in  2006-07  over  the
previous  year.  The  rise  in  AUM  was  the
highest for debt oriented schemes at 55.0 per
cent.  This  was  commensurate  with  spurt  in
resource  mobilisation  by  the  debt  oriented

schemes.  A  rise  of  24.3  per  cent  was  seen  in
the  AUM  of  equity  oriented  schemes.  A
negative  growth  of  28.1  per  cent  was
recorded for AUM of gilt schemes.

The  mutual  funds  have  traditionally
been  the  active  participants  in  the  debt
segment  of  Indian  stock  market.  The
heightened  activity  of  mutual  funds  in  the
equity  segment  in  2005-06  did  not  continue
at  the  same  pace  in  2006-07  save  a  few
months  of  the  financial  year.  In  the  first  two
months  of  the  financial  year,  however,  their
inflow  into  the  equity  segment  was  higher,
after  which  it  declined.  During  2006-07,  the
combined investment in debt and equity was
Rs. 61,606  crore  compared  to  Rs. 51,103  crore
in  2005-06,  indicating  a  rise  of  20.6  per  cent
(Table  2.39).  Bulk  of  this  investment  was  in
the  debt  segment.  Their  total  inflow  into  the
debt segment was Rs. 52,543 crore as against

FOREIGN  INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTMENT

Foreign  institutional  investment  (FII)  is
one  of  the  main  channels  of  foreign
investment  in  India.  Foreign  institutional
investors  (FIIs)  were  permitted  to  invest  in
Indian  securities  market  in  1993.  Since  then,
their  investments  into  Indian  equity  market
have  grown  by  leaps  and  bounds.  In  fact,
FIIs, as a class of institutional investors, have

assumed  a  major  role  in  mature  and
emerging market economies, in recent years.

The FII in the Indian equity markets has
risen  steadily  since  2003-04  (Table  2.40  and
Chart 2.12). The gross purchases of debt and
equity  together  by  FIIs  increased  by  50.0  per
cent  to  Rs. 5,20,508  crore  in  2006-07  from
Rs. 3,46,978  crore  in  2005-06.  The  gross  sales
by  FIIs  also  rose  by  60.3  per  cent  to
Rs. 4,89,667  crore  from  Rs. 3,05,512  crore
during  the  same  period.  However,  the  net
investment by FIIs in 2006-07 declined by 25.6
per  cent  to  Rs.  30,840  crore  in  2006-07  from
Rs. 41,467  crore  in  2005-06  mainly  due  to
large  net  outflows  from  the  equity  segment.
But  the cumulative net investment by FIIs in
Indian stock market (since 1993) crossed USD
50  billion  at  the  end  of  March  2007.  As  on
March  31,  2007,  the  cumulative  net
investment  by  FIIs  was  USD  52  billion.  The

cumulative  net  investment  by  FIIs  at
acquisition  cost,  which  was  USD  15.8  billion
at  the  end  of  March  2003,  had  risen  to  USD
45.3  billion  at  the  end  of  March  2006
(Chart  2.13).

The FII in equity, which was high in the
previous  years,  declined  in  2006-07.  During
2006-07,  FIIs  reduced  their  investment,  in
both  equities  as  well  as  debt  securities
(Table 2.41). The net FII investment in equity
during  2006-07  was  Rs. 25,236  crore,  at  its
lowest  in  past  three  years.  This  was  mainly
due  to  large  net  sales  in  some  months  of
2006-07.

Month-wise,  FII  was  negative  in  the
months  of  May  2006,  December  2006  and
March 2007 (Chart 2.14). However, during the
remaining months of the financial year, there
was  positive  net  equity  investment  by  FIIs,
particularly  in  middle  of  2006-07,  which
drove  the  benchmark  indices  to  historic

highs. The net FII in November 2006 was the
highest  for  2006-07,  followed  by  October
2006,  and  February  2007.  Unlike  last  year
when  FII  in  debt  segment  was  negative  for
all  the  months,  in  2006-07  the  same  was
positive  for  all  months  except  for  January
2007.  Their  total  net  investment  in  the  debt
segment in 2006-07 was Rs. 5,605 crore.

Reflecting  the  congenial  investment
climate,  total  number  of  FIIs  registered  with
SEBI  rose  to  997  as  on  March  31,  2007
compared  to  882  a  year  ago.  A  distinctive
feature  of  the  profile  of  the  newly  registered
FIIs  was  the  rise  in  registration  from  the
unconventional  countries  like  Slovenia,
Brussels,  Guernsey,  Cyprus,  Oman,  Sweden,
and  Japan  etc.  other  than  the  traditional
investors  from  USA,  United  Kingdom,
Singapore,  Malaysia,  Hong  Kong,
Luxembourg  and  others.

cent  in  the  turnover    (Table  2.46).  The  share
of  Indian  banks  and  foreign  banks  in  the
turnover  of  WDM  segment  constituted  26.0
per  cent  and  20.6  per  cent  respectively,  in
2006-07.  In  fact  the  foreign  banks  increased
their  share  from  14.1  per  cent  in  2005-06  to
20.57  per  cent  in  2006-07  while  the  share  of
Indian  banks  declined  from  28.1  per  cent  in
