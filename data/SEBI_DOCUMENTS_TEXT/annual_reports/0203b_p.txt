Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

PART TWO: REVIEW OF THE TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

Part  Two  of  the  Annual  Report  deals  with
operational  aspects  of  Securities  and
Exchange Board of India during the year and
attempts  to  make  a  comparison,  wherever
possible,  with  the  developments  in  the
international  capital  markets.  Operational
areas  such  as  primary  market,  secondary
market,  mutual  funds,  portfolio  investments,
takeovers  and  acquisitions,  regulatory
developments,  investigations  and  enquiries,
are discussed, analysed and compared over
period and across markets

1.

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

The  primary  capital  market  (PCM)  plays  an
important  role  in  the  overall  functioning  of
securities market. Vibrancy of primary market,
among  other  things,  is  a  function  of  macro
economic  factors,  industrial  output  and
demand.  Over  the  years  SEBI  has  taken
several  initiatives  to  improve  the  operational
efficiency  and  transparency  of  the  primary
market, which provides investors with issues
of high quality and for firms a market where
they  can  raise  resources  in  a  cost  effective
manner.  However,  despite  these  measures
the primary market remained lackluster.

Fewer  number  of  issuers  accessed  the
primary  market  during  the  year  and  the
amount  of  funds  mobilized  in  2002-03  was
also  significantly  lower  than  that  of  the
previous  financial  year.  Share  of  equity
issues,  in  terms  of  number  and  amount
mobilized,  however,  was  higher  in  this
financial year compared to the previous one.

In  2002-03,  as  well  as  2001-02,  western
region  dominated  in  mobilizing  resources
through the primary market route. More than
three-fourths  of  the  total  amount  was

3636363636

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

mobilized by western region, southern region
occupied  second  and  no  resources  were
mobilized from northern and eastern regions.

As in the previous years, banks and financial
institutions continued to dominate the primary
market  and  accounted  for  84.5  per  cent  of
the resources mobilised compared to 68.1 per
cent  in  2001-02.  All  other  industries  shared
the  remaining  portion.  Table  2.7  and  Chart
2.2  depict  the  industry  wise  distribution  of
resources mobilized.

Instrument-wise  analysis  shows  that  bonds
have  been  the  primary  instrument  for  the
resource  mobilization  in  the  primary  market
followed  by  equity.  Equity  with  premium
compared  to  the  previous  year,  more  than
doubled  in  2002-03. 
Issues  in  the  public
sector  were  dominant  in  the  current  year,
compared to the issues in the private sector
which  raised  about  87.0  percent  in  the
previous year.

Capital Raised During 2002-03

I.
During  the  financial  year  2002-03,  primary
market witnessed a decrease of 46.0 per cent
in the amount raised and also a decrease of
25.7  per  cent  in  the  number  of  issues
launched  compared  to  the  same  period  in
2001–02.  A  total  of  26  issues  (14  public
issues  and  12  rights  issues)  opened  during
the financial year 2002-03 raising Rs.4070.29
crore (Rs.3638.6 crore through public issues
and  431.6  crore  through  rights  issues).  In
2001-02  a  total  of  35  issues  opened  for
raising  Rs.  7543.0  crore  (20  public  issues-
Rs.  6501.8  crore  and  15  rights  issues-
Rs.1041.2 crore).

The number of companies accessing the
market with initial public offering of equity shares
and the amount mobilized through Initial Public

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

Offering (IPOs) have decreased marginally in
this financial year vis-à-vis previous financial
year. There were 6 IPOs in 2002-03 compared
to 7 in the previous year. Funds mobilized
through IPOs has declined by 13.5 per cent to
Rs. 1038.6 crore in 2002-03 as compared to
Rs. 1201.8 crore (comprising 6 IPOs of equity
issues for Rs. 1031.8 crore and 1 IPO of FCD

amounting Rs. 170 crore resulting in gross total
of funds through IPOs as Rs 1201.8 crore) in
the previous financial year. Rights issues
continued their dominance in both the years.
Prevailing domestic and international industrial
climate, excess capacities and globalisation are
a few of the factors supposedly responsible for
this lackluster performance of primary market.

resources mobilized from the southern region,
increased in 2002-03 compared to the previous
year: as against seven issues raising Rs. 419.1
crore in 2001-02, nine issues raising Rs. 587.6
crore during the year. There was a sharp decline
in the northern region where only one issue
could raise Rs. 7.8 crore compared to Rs 1001.6
crore in previous year from three issues. In
eastern region though the number of issues
went up marginally to three from two, the
resources mobilized declined from Rs. 180.0
crore to Rs. 117.3 crore.

Industry Wise Capital Mobilisation

industries accounted for 84.7 per cent of the
funds raised. With the Banks and FIs increasing
their share from 68.3 per cent to 84.5 per cent
and  companies  in  the  Telecommunication
sector not raising any resources. In 2002-03 the

In 2001-02, Banking/FIs, Telecommunication,
Engineering, Chemical and Textile were among
the top five industries on the basis of capital
raised. However, in the current financial year, top
five industries in terms of capital mobilisation are
Banking/FIs, Information Technology, Paper &
Pulp, Health Care and Cement & Construction.
This clearly indicates the fact that old economy
industries are still the favourites of the primary
market in 2002-03.

In  2002-03,  there  were  13  issues  by  Banks/

Financial Institutions. Out of these 13 issues,
three  issues  were  launched  by  ICICI  Ltd.
These were basically 3 tranches of umbrella
issue of bonds. IDBI also launched 5 tranches
of bond issue in 2002-03. The other 5 issues
were of equity shares to public by Allahabad
Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank of India and
rights  issue  of  equity  shares  by  The
Karnataka  Bank  Ltd.  and  The  Karur  Vysya

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

Ballarpur  Industries  Ltd.  offered  both  ‘Equity
Share’  and  ‘Fully  Convertible  Debenture’.
Therefore,  for  the  limited  purpose  of
instrument-wise  analysis,  number  of  issues
have been assumed as 27 though there is a
total number of 26 primary issues in this year.
In the financial year 2002-03, out of total 27
issues,  17  issues  were  of  equity  shares
accounting for 62.4 per cent of the issue.
However, share of those issues in terms of
capital raised is 35.7 per cent. Out of those 17
issues of equity shares, 6 issues were of equity
shares at par and 11 issues were at premium.
In this year, a total number of 10 issues of
debentures (inclusive of bonds) raised a total
amount of Rs 2613.4 crore. This pattern of fund
mobilisation is different from the one observed
in the previous year, when there were 15 equity

issues launched which mobilised 16.8 per cent
of the total funds mobilised. Therefore, amount
of fund mobilized through equity issues has
gone up significantly this year.

V. Underwriting of Issues
The underwriting of issues is optional in terms
of SEBI (DIP)  Guidelines 2000. In the year
2002-03, 14.3 per cent of the total public issues
of equity shares, in terms of number of issues,
were underwritten. In 2001-02, 42.8 per cent of
the total public issues of equity shares, in terms
of number of issues, were underwritten. From
the point of view of amount of fund mobilized
through public issue of equity shares, 7.0 per
cent of the issue amount through public issue
of equity shares was underwritten in 2002–03.
The same was at the level of 89.9 per cent for
the previous year.

SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET
(SSM)
Introduction

I.
There  are  several  facets  to  the  secondary
market for securities. Trading, clearance and

4444444444

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

settlement  are  one  part  and  others  include
exchange  management,  product  innovation,
risk management etc.;  This section provides
explanation on many developments during the
year in SSM.

II.

Price Behaviour in Secondary
Securities Market: 2002-03

SEBI  has  been  continuously  improving
functioning  of  secondary  securities  market.
Several  reforms  were  introduced  during  the
year.  Trading,  clearing  and  settlement  in
equity  shares  was  contracted  to  T+3  from
April, 2002. It would be further contracted to
T+2  from  April,  2003.  In  order  to  make
markets  more  efficient  and  provide  more
investment  opportunities  to  the  investors,
trading  in  government  securities  on  stock
exchange  was  permitted.  There  have  been
some  differences  in  the  listing  of  securities
requirements  among  the  Indian  Stock
Exchanges. Central Listing Authority has been
conceived  and  formalized  so  that  there  will
be uniform standards for listing of securities.
Conflict  of  interest,  exists  when  ownership,
trading rights and management are clustered
on 
Indian  Stock  Exchange.
Demutualisation  and  Corporatisation  of  the
Indian Stock Exchange would help eliminate
conflict of interests, which now prevail at stock
exchanges;  trading  members  being  on  the
management  of  the  exchange,  conflict  of
interests are embedded in the structure of all
stock exchanges except NSE.

the 

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

During 2002-03, performance of Indian Stock
market  was,  by  and  large,  a  lackluster  one.
S&P  CNX  NIFTY  and  BSE  Sensex  both
registered negative returns of 13.4 percent and
12.1  percent  respectively  over  the  previous
year.  Other  broad  indicators  also  fell  down.
Fall in the market is not specific to India alone

and it appears a global phenomena. Monthly
close of index values are presented in Table
2.19  and  Charts  2.5,  2.6  and  2.7  provide
information  on  volume  of  turnover,  market
capitalization and returns. Turnover has been
increasing and its reached peak in the month
of December 2002.

Indicators of Business

compared  to  the  past.

Table  2.19  to  2.21  and  Charts  2.5  to  2.7
exhibit  information  on  some  of  the  stock
market  indicators  in  India.  Both  the  popular
stock  market  indices,  S&  P  CNX  Nifty  and
Sensex  fell  by  13.4  percent  and  12.1
percent  respectively.  However,  the  fall  is  not
continuous  and  there  were  a  few  months
in  which  the  indices  rose  and  in  other
months  the  indices  fell.  Highest  positive
growth  was  recorded  in  November,  2002.
Price-Earnings  Ratio,  yet  another  indicator
of  market  performance,  also  declined  and
its  fall  makes  Indian  market  more  attractive

Turnover  and  market  capitalization  statistics
are  presented  in  Table  2.21  and  Charts  2.6
and  2.7.  Dominance  of  NSE  is  clearly
increasing.  Roughly,  two-thirds  of  the  total
turnover  was  logged  by  NSE.  Over  period,
BSE turnover has been secularly falling. Year-
on-year  comparison  of  market  capitalization
shows  decrease  in  it  by  Rs.  112418  crore
(NSE).  Out  of  the  total  23  stock  exchanges
on line, as many as 11 stock exchanges did
not  have  any  business.  This  number  has
gone up from the previous year.

Stock Exchange Subsidiaries

V.
Structural changes effected in the functioning
of stock exchanges over a period of time have
had far reaching impact on the functioning of

these exchanges. Leading exchanges have
opened their trading terminals across the
country. Business of regional exchanges
declined  substantially  and  such  stock

BOARD OF INDIA

exchanges had little or no trading. In order to
provide  business  opportunities  to  small
exchanges, SEBI allowed exchanges to float
subsidiaries which can operate on major
exchanges by becoming their members. 17
exchanges floated 21 subsidiaries. Of these, 14
had floated one each, two exchanges two each
and one exchange has three subsidiaries.
Three  exchanges  which  do  not  have
subsidiaries: Gauhati, Mangalore and MPSE.
Business of some of these subsidiaries is not
all that encouraging. Table 2.25 gives details
related to subsidiaries and their operations.

Exchanges

VI. Trading Frequency and Market

Structure

Number of companies traded in 2002-03, both

on BSE and NSE declined substantially. Total
companies traded on BSE declined by 2668
from 5347 to 2679 (Table 2.27) and on NSE the
fall was 120 companies. The companies traded
on 100 days or more in the year went upto 67.7
percent and 88.3 percent on BSE and NSE
respectively. The table reveals the extent of
spread of liquidity in the Indian stock market.

VII. Volatility: A Comparative Analysis
The following tables, charts and boxes depict
the daily volatility of two indices of NSE, viz.,
Nifty and Nifty Junior and two indices of BSE,
viz., Sensex and BSE 100 computed for each
month, yearly and annualised. Indian market
volatility declined over the months and this is
true  for  all  indices.  Structural  changes  such
as introduction of derivative products, rolling
settlement, banning of deferral products, etc.,
appear to have contributed to this fall.

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

The  Box  2.1  provides  a  discussion  on  intra-
day  and  inter-day  volatility  over  long  period
across  about  20  countries.  From  the  tables,

it  is  once  again  evident  that  intra  and  inter
day  volatility  in  India  came  down.  It  also  fell
in other mainly developed markets.

Box 2.1: Volatility in Indian Stock Market

As  a  concept,  volatility  is  simple  and  intuitive.  It  measures  variability  or  dispersion  about  a  central  tendency.
Despite the clear mental image of it, and the quasi-standardised status it holds within the finance industry, there
are  some  subtleties  that  make  volatility  challenging  to  analyse  and  to  implement.  Since  volatility  is  a  standard
measure of financial vulnerability, it plays a key role in assessing risk/return trade-offs.
Stating  the  obvious,  asset-return  variability  can  be  summarized  by  statistical  distributions.  Typically,  the  normal
distribution is used to characterize a series of returns. The distribution is centered at the mean and its width is
determined  by  the  standard  deviation  (volatility).  Many  return  series,  though,  are  not  normally  distributed.  In
contrast,  asset  returns  tend  to  exhibit  excess  kurtosis,  so  that  extreme  values  are  more  likely  than  the  normal
distribution  would  suggest.  Such  fat-tailed  distributions  are  common  in  finance.  Skewness  is  also  common,
especially with equity returns, where big down-moves are typically more likely than comparable, big up-moves.
The  intra-day  volatility  estimators  use  indicators  like  open,  high,  low  and  close  to  characterize  the  distribution
since most of the asset pricing models are based on continuous time. These extreme-value estimators are more
efficient, because they use additional information about movements throughout the period that snapshots at the
end of a period cannot hope to summarize.
The pioneering work in this area is done by Parkinson (1980). Parkinson model to measure intra-day volatility is
as follows:

=
kσ

1

n

∑

(
t LH
t

)

2

log

where k = 0.601 and Ht and Lt denote intra-day high and low respectively. This measure is denoted as high-low
volatility. The other estimator due to Garman and Klass (1980) that uses all four intra-day variation statistics of
open, high, low and close takes the following form;

(2)

(1)

(3)

where  Ht  ,  Lt  ,  Ct,  and  Ot  denote  intra-day  high,  low,  close  and  open  respectively.  This  measure  is  called  as
open-close  volatility.  The  close-close  volatility  and  open-open  volatility  uses  the  standard  volatility  estimation
model. That is,

σ

=

(
1

−

n

)
∑ −
1

(
r
t

)

2

r

where rt denotes open to open returns or close to close returns and r  denotes mean returns of either open to
open returns or close to close returns.

The major findings of the study which are presented in the Tables 2.29 and 2.30 are:













The inter-day close to close Sensex daily volatility during 2002 is half of 2000 and one-third of peak volatility
of the decade achieved during 1992 scam. The 2002 year close to close daily volatility is lowest since 1991.
The inter-day close to close S&P CNX Nifty daily volatility during 2002 is 54% of 2000 daily volatility. Further
close to close volatility recorded during 2002 is lowest since 1995.
The  inter-day  open  to  open  Sensex  daily  volatility  during  2002  is  39.3%  of  2000  and  one-third  of  peak
volatility  of  the  decade  achieved  during  1992  scam.  The  2002  year  open  to  open  daily  volatility  is  lowest
since 1991.
The  inter-day  open  to  open  S&P  CNX  Nifty  daily  volatility  during  2002  is  53.5%  of  2000  daily  volatility.
Further open to open volatility recorded during 2002 is lowest since 1995.
The intra-day Sensex volatility during 2002 is half of 2000 intra day volatility. The lowest intra-day volatility is
registered during 1995 and then onwards it continuously increased till 2000.
The intra-day S&P CNX Nifty daily volatility during 2002 is 49% of 2000 daily volatility. The lowest intra-day volatility
is registered during 1995 and then onwards it continuously increased till 2000 and then started falling.

VIII. Indicators of Liquidity

Liquidity is accepted as one of the conditions
for smooth market functioning. The variations
in the degree of liquidity affects the price
discovery process and efficiency of the market.
For definition purposes, the liquidity of the
market is the situation in which a large trade in

shares can be transacted without having any
material impact on the price of shares.

The past six year liquidity indicators are
presented in Table 2.32. It is evident from the
table that the recent changes effected to market
micro-structure seems to have affected these
indicators. Traded value ratio and turnover ratio

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

5757575757

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

were almost rising till 2000-01 and exhibited fall
in the next year. Turnover ratio picked up in
2002-03 (NSE). Market capitalization to GDP
ratio has been under strain for the past three
years. Liquidity indicators have had their
gyrations affecting investors in the market place.

IX. Progress in Dematerialisation
Dematerialisation  has  provided  systemic
benefit  to  the  Indian  securities  market.  There
are  two  depositories  and  several  depository
participants  that  provide  demat  services  to
the  investor.  Dematerialisation  eliminated
risks  arising  out  of  forgery,  fake  certificates,
stolen  shares,  transit  loss  etc.,  and
increased  pace  of  transfer  of  securities.  Little
over  99  percent  of  the  securities  on  Indian
bourses  are  traded  and  cleared  in  demat
mode.  Further  reform  process  is  also
smoothened  in  the  market  because  of
demat.  Table  2.32  discloses  the  extent  of
spread  of  demat  operations  in  India.

X.

Trading in Derivative Instruments

Trading Volumes
Financial  derivative  contracts  are  traded  on
both,  the  BSE  and  the  NSE.  However,  the
volumes traded on BSE have been very low
and  are  almost  negligible.  In  some  types  of
contracts, on some days, the volumes traded

Table 2.31: Indicators of Liquidity

are zero, therefore, the data pertaining to BSE
are  omitted  here.  In  2002-03,  volumes  in  all
four  types  of  contracts  more  than  doubled
from  Rs.  20490  crore  to  Rs.  49332  crore  at
NSE. For the past two years, volumes traded,
outstanding  contracts  and  notional  value  of
contracts  have  been  rising.  Many  investors,
it  appears,  have  shifted  their  speculative
trading  and  risk  hedging  positions  to
derivatives  segment.  Though,  single  stock
futures  (SSFs)  are  the  youngest  of  the  four,
the volume traded is highest in SSFs followed
by  stock  options.  Trade  in  Index  Futures
contracts  grew  by  more  than  4.5  times  in
2002-03  and  turnover  also  appreciated  by
almost  similar  growth.  Retail  interest  seems
to  be  more  than  that  of  institutions  in
derivatives  trading.  It  could  be  one  of  the
reasons for higher volumes in SSFs and stock
options. In many markets, in other countries,
generally, volumes are higher in index futures.
Call-put  ratio  indicates  investor  expectations
of  the  market.  Call-put  ratio  of  higher  than
one indicates that investors expect the market
to go up and a call-put ratio of less than unity
is indicative of expectations of a likely fall in
the market. In all the months of 2002-03, call-
put  ratio  has  been  consistently  higher  than
one  and  in  a  few  instances  it  has  exceeded
two.  This  behaviour  is  manifested  in  the
notional value as well.

Turnover  ratio  is  value  of  total  shares  traded  divided  by  market  capitalisation.  Traded  value  ratio  is  estimated  by
dividing the total traded value by the GDP. GDP for 1999-00 is Provisional, GDP for 2000-01 is Quick Estimate and
GDP for 2001-02 is Advanced Estimate.

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

XI. Stock Market Performance :

International Comparison

In a globalised market environment , relative
attractiveness  of  countries  is  important  for
investors.  Next  few  paragraphs  analyze
performance  of  select  international  stock
markets  vis-à-vis  India.  All  the  14  indices
presented  in  Chart  2.15  show  negative
returns,  while  some  countries  have  large
losses, some others show small losses. Indian
market has received fourth lowest loss. South
Korea registered higher losses and Thailand
market  exhibited  lower  loss.  P/E  ratios  also
revealed  performance  of  various  markets.
Low  P/E  ratio  means  that  it  is  attractive  to
invest whereas a high P/E ratio indicates its
unattractiveness,  ceterus  paribus.  Thailand
with a P/E of 9.04 had the lowest while United
Kingdom had the highest P/E ratio of 60.32.
P/E  ratio  of  leading  Indian  indices  declined
over  that  of  2001-02  but  that  these  were
relatively small. Tables 2.37 and 2.38 charts
2.15 and 2.16 provide further information.

The US stock exchanges, NYSE and Nasdaq
maintained  their  lead  position  recording
largest number of transactions in all the three
years. Exchanges of South Korea and Taiwan
ranked third and fourth positions. Small stock
exchanges like Sao Paulo, Jakarta recorded
3  to  5  million  transactions  per  year  (Table
2.38).  The  wide  gap  between  small
exchanges such as these and big exchanges
like  NYSE,  NASDAQ  is  not  only  evident  but
the gap widened further year after year.

Number of companies listed, value of shares
and  market  capitalization  are  some  of  the
important  indicators  to  take  a  call  on  the
relative  importance  of  countries  in  the
increasing global economy. For the past two
decades,  the  share  of  emerging  markets
increased  in  the  total  market  capitalization
from 6.8 percent to 8.5 percent from 1980 to
2000  respectively  but  their  relative  share
remained  less  than  one-tenth,  On  the  other

6464646464

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

hand  a  handful  of  developed  markets
continue  to  maintain  their  lions’  share  in
market capitalization

A  close  examination  of  Table  2.41  reveals
several interesting and intriguing facts. Market
capitalization data in the U.S, Japan, the U.K,
France  and  Germany  are  worth  analyzing.
First, the U.S and Japan data disclose almost
a diverse relationship. In 1998, Japan reached
its  peak  market  capitalization,  while  the  U.S
comparatively had its lowest one. Thereafter
every  increase  of  USA,  perhaps  appears  to
have  had  happened  at  the  cost  of  Japan,
though  it  is  not  a  causal  study.  In  the  two
decade period the market capitalization of the
US rose by almost ten times from US $ 1.448
trillion  to  US$15.104  trillion.  Japan  also
experienced  a  rise  of  9  times  but  it  reached
its zenith in 1988 at US$4.39 trillion. The UK
retained its relative share in 7.5 percent to 8
percent almost throughout the 20 year period.
Share  of  France  went  up  by  more  than  100
percent and that of Germany by 50 percent.
These  5  countries  alone  account  for  about
70  percent  of  world  market  capitalization.
Between  2000  and  2002  the  market
capitalization  of  US  fell  sharply  from  US
$15.10  trillion  to  about  US  $  11.03  trillion.
India  has  the  largest  number  of  companies
listed while the US stands second.

Market Volatility in Major Securities
Markets
Table  2.42  and  Chart  2.18  provide  volatility
information  on  some  of  the  indices  for  the
past  one  year,  on  monthly  basis.  It  can  be
seen a mélange in volatility. There is a wide
variation between the lowest at 0.69 per cent
in March 2002 in case of China and 2.61 per
cent  in  case  of  South  Korea  for  the  same
month. Even markets like the US and the UK
also recorded high volatility compared to India
while India’s volatility remained on an average
at about one per cent.

BOARD OF INDIA

Box 2.2 : International Comparison of Stock Market Volatility

Stock  market  volatility  touches  every  participant  directly/indirectly  in  the  capital  market.  General  feeling  among
participants  is  that  the  stock  markets  worldwide  have  become  very  fragile  in  the  recent  past  on  account  of
various developments such as Asian crisis, Brazil Real fall and Russian debacle. Many far-reaching stock market
reforms  have  been  introduced  in  the  Indian  market  for  the  last  few  years.  These  reforms,  in  turn,  changed
market structure. Changing market structure influences nature of stock price behaviour. In our paper, an attempt
has  been  made  to  compare  and  analyse  stock  market  volatility  across  selected  few  developed  and  emerging
markets including India for 15 years.
As  a  concept,  volatility  is  simple  and  intuitive.  It  measures  variability  or  dispersion  about  a  central  tendency.
Despite the clear mental image of it, and the quasi-standardised status it holds within the finance industry, there
are  some  subtleties  that  make  volatility  challenging  to  analyse  and  to  implement.  Since  volatility  is  a  standard
measure of financial vulnerability, it plays a key role in assessing risk/return trade-offs.
Time series daily closing values of each countries’ index are used in this study. Most of the countries chosen for
the  study  have  more  than  one  equity  stock  prices  index.  Bloomberg  database  is  used  as  a  source.  The  data
series  is  taken  from  1985:1  to  2002:12.  Since  the  economic  reforms  in  India  started  in  the  mid  of  1991,  the
period  is  dividend  into  two:  before  and  after  the  economic  reforms  Hence,  study  period  is  sub-divided  into  two
parts: (a) 1985:1 to 1991:12 and (b) 1992:1 to 2002:12.
The results are presented in Tables 2.43 and the summary findings are as follows:



The  second  period  has  seen  a  steep  decline  in  mean  returns,  skewness  and  kurtosis  but  the  volatility  is
more or less same in US markets.

 UK stock markets behaviour is same as that of US market.



In France, decline is noted in skewness and kurtosis only and mean returns and volatility is stable.
In Germany, volatility increased in second period however, mean returns, skewness, and kurtosis reduced.
 Canadian market volatility is up in the second period and remaining parameters declined in the second period.





Australia has seen a steep decline in all the parameters during the second period.

 Hong  Kong  has  seen  a  stable  volatility  but  the  remaining  parameters  showed  a  steep  decline  in  second

period. The skewness shifted from negative to positive.
Singapore  markets  reached  mean  returns  of  zero  and  a  marginal  decline  in  volatility  but  skewness  and
kurtosis fell sharply.
Volatility in Malaysia is up and the rest of the parameters fell in the second period.
In Thailand, volatility fell marginally and the rest fell steeply in the second period.







 China has only one period and volatility is second highest in the sample countries.



Indonesia witnessed a fall in all parameters during the second period.

 Chile  has  seen  a  steep  fall  the  mean  returns  and  volatility  however,  skewness  and  kurtosis  rose  in  the



second period.
Brazil recorded highest mean returns and volatility in the sample countries and daily volatility. The kurtosis is
second to China in the ranking.

 Mexico has data for second period only.
 New Zealand has less volatility but kurtosis ranks third in the list during the second period.









South African markets comparable with other countries in the second period.
Korean  markets  reached  zero  mean  returns  with  increased  volatility  and  kurtosis  but  skewness  declined
marginally.
Taiwan markets showed negative daily mean returns and remaining parameters are more or less low.
Indian Sensex witnessed zero mean returns with a marginally decreased volatility. Further, kurtosis went up
steeply with a decline in skewness.

 Majority of the countries showed negative skewness reflecting occurrence more negative moves than positive.



Brazil register highest mean returns and volatility.

 Chile accounts for second highest mean returns and China comes second in volality.









Second period shows a significant fall in all the parameters for majority of the countries.
Among the developed stock markets, Hongkong registers highest mean returns in both periods.
Among  the  developed  stock  markets,  Hongkong  registers  highest  volatility  and  least  volatility  accounts  for
Canada in the first period and Australia in the second period.
Among  the  developed  stock  markets,  Australia  and  Hongkong  takes  first  and  second  place  respectively  in
highest skewness and kurtosis during the first period. However, the second period shows a significant fall in

XII. Developments in the International

Derivatives Market

Tables  and  graphs  in  this  section  provide
information on volumes traded, open interest,
derivatives  premium  and  notional  principal
value outstanding and other details on various
contracts traded across countries.

One  important  change  that  occurred  is  the
increased  relative  importance  of  OTC
derivatives  compared  to  exchange  traded
products.  In  1988  OTC  products  had  a
percentage share of 56 which grew to 87 per
cent  by  2000.  The  total  notional  principal
value  outstanding  of  exchange  traded
derivatives is only about 13 per cent. In India
we do not have authoritative information about
quantum  of  over  the  counter  derivatives
products therefore, it is very difficult to make
any comparison. Among index options, index
futures,  stock  options,  it  appears  that  index
futures  are  more  popular  in  many  of  the
markets like USA, Hong Kong, Japan and the
UK  in  terms  of  volume  traded.  The  US
exchanges  continue  to  dominate  the  world
derivatives  market  in  terms  of  variety  of

products  traded,  volumes  traded,  open
interest  etc.  A  very  interesting  point  to  note
is that South Korean options recorded about
130 per cent growth in 2002 over the previous
year in terms of contract volume. E-Mini S&P
500 index futures on CME however recorded
about 194 per cent growth in 2002 over 2001.
Futures  on  individual  equities  are  traded  on
many  exchanges.  In  2002  about  15
exchanges  reported  to  have  traded  single
stock futures. In terms of number of contracts
traded,  NSE  stands  second  with  more  than
eight  million  in  2002  while  the  first  position
went to MEFF with over 12 million contracts.
Four  exchanges  added  futures  on  individual
equities  in  2002  to  their  portfolio  namely
Euronext Lisbon, OneChicago, NASDAQ Liffe
markets  and  Italian  derivatives  market.  In
2002 as well as 2001, Eurex retained number
one position in terms of number of contracts
traded.  Others  like  CME,  CBOT  are  ranked
second  and  third  in  2002.  It  is  worth
mentioning that NSE not only ranked 23rd but
in terms of growth it registered second highest
among  all  the  40  biggest  derivative
exchanges in the world.

Government securities market during the past
financial year witnessed significant upturns in
prices until mid-January 2003 when the trend
was  reversed.  The  pattern  of  downturn  in
yields was halted due to the war tensions and
consequent  uncertainty  leading  to  a  heavy
selling pressure.
Major developments in government securities
market in 2002-03 were :
A.

Introduction of the system of publishing a
calendar by RBI that outlines the issue of
dated  government  securities  every  half
year.  The  calendar  for  the  financial  year
of 2002-03 was issued in March 2003.

B. Screen  based  order  driven  trading  in
government  securities  on  the  stock
exchanges introduced on January 16, 2003.
C. CSGL account holders permitted to enter
into  repo  transactions  in  government
securities effective from March 3, 2003.

D. Guidelines for uniform accounting of repo/
reverse repo transactions were issued by
RBI.

E. Under the securities lending scheme, the
Clearing  Corporation  of  India  Limited
(CCIL)  has  been  permitted  to  borrow
required government securities from select
members.

In  accordance  with  RBI  policy  of
consolidation  of  government  debt,  the
practice  of  reissuances  of  existing
government securities continued in 2002-
03 also. Of the 31 securities issued during
2002-03, 19 were reissues. This accounts
for  59  percent.  (Rs.  74,000  crore  of  the
gross amount of Rs. 1,25,000 crore raised
through dated government securties under
the  market  borrowing  programme  of  the
Central Government).

The total private placement of dated securities
with the RBI amounted to Rs. 23,175 crore
(excluding private placement/devolvement to
support pre-payment of Government’s external
debt) during 2002-03 with the RBI effectively
neutralizing the monetary effect by conduct of
outright OMO sales of government securities
amounting to Rs. 53, 780 crore. The weighted
average yield on government borrowings
through dated securities issued during 2002-03
declined by 210 basis points to 7.34 percent
from 9.44 percent during 2001-02. The gilt
yields fell continuously upto mid-January 2003,
facilitated by a bank rate cut, another round of
CRR and the repo rate reductions announced
in October, 2002. (Source: Macro Economic and
Monetary Developments in 2002-03, RBI).
The  total  number  of  trades  in  the  WDM
segment of NSE increased from 1,44,851 in
2001-02 to 1,67,778 in 2002-03. (Table 2.51).

Information in Table 2.53 tells about the profile
of various participants in the debt segment of
NSE. Between 2001-02 and 2002-03, there was
no considerable change in terms of percentage
change in volume traded by each class of
participant. Small changes are noticeable in
case of Indian banks and foreign banks; while
the share in the total volume of the former went
up, that of the latter declined slightly.

3. MUTUAL FUNDS
I.

Resources Mobilised by Mutual
Funds

The  mutual  funds  have  mobilised  a  gross
amount  of  Rs.3,14,706.2  crore  (US  $  66.06
billion)  during  the  financial  year  2002-03  as
against  Rs.  1,64,523.2  crore  (US  $  33.75
billion) during the previous year 2001-02.

II. Net Inflow/Outflow Of Funds:
After  adjustment  of  repurchases  and
redemptions,  there  has  been  net  inflow  of
funds of Rs. 4,196.4 crore (US$ 0.88 billion)
as  against  Rs.  7,175.2  crore  (US  $  1.47
billion) during the previous year 2001-02.

During the first ten months of the current year
(April-January 2003), there was net inflow of
funds  of  Rs.16,612.01  crore  in  the  mutual
funds  industry.  However,  during  the  last  two
months  of  the  year  i.e  during  February  and
March  2003,  the  mutual  funds  industry
witnessed  major  outflow  of  funds  of
approximately  Rs.12,416  crore.  The  major
outflow of funds in these two months was in
debt-oriented  schemes.  A  similar  trend  was
noticed  during  the  last  financial  year  2001-
02,  where  there  was  net  inflow  of  funds  of
Rs.12,724.5  crores  during  April  2001  to
February  2002.  However,  due  to  heavy
repurchases/redemptions  in  the  month  of
March  in  debt-oriented  schemes  and  mainly
in  liquid/money  market  schemes,  it  resulted
in  a  decline  in  the  net  inflow  of  funds  to
Rs.7175.2 crore during the financial year.

Further analysis of data shows that there was
net  inflow  of  funds  of  Rs.12,069.44  crore  in
case of private sector mutual funds compared
to net inflow of Rs.13,049.9 crore during the
previous year 2001-02. Public sector mutual
funds have shown net inflow of funds to the

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

7979797979

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

tune of Rs.1,561.05 crore as against net inflow
of funds of Rs.1,409.31 crore during the last
financial  year  2001-02.  However,  UTI  has
shown outflow of funds of Rs. 9,434.10 crore
as  against  net  outflow  of  funds  of  Rs.7,284

crore during the last financial year 2001-02.
Details  of  funds  mobilised,  repurchase/
redemption amount and the net inflow/outflow
of  funds  for  the  year  2002-03  are  given  in
the following table.

funds. The details are given below (Table 2.56).
III. Trends in Purchases/Sales by Mutual

Funds

On  analysing  the  data  of  purchase  and
sales  transactions  of  mutual  funds  on  stock

exchanges,  it  has  been  observed  that  the
trend  of  net  purchase  of  debt  securities  and
net  sale  of  equity  has  continued  in  the
current  year  also.  During  the  year  2002-03,
the  mutual  funds  were  net  sellers  in  equity
to  the  tune  of  Rs  2066.70  crore  and  net
buyers  in  debt  to  the  tune  of  Rs.  12604.42
crore.  The  month-wise  details  of  the  trend
in  purchases  and  sales  in  the  market  during
the  year  2002-03  are  given  in  the  following

VI. Schemes launched
Fifty-four schemes were launched during the
year  2002-03,  which  included  50  new
schemes  and  4  schemes  which  were
converted  from  close-ended  to  open-ended
schemes. During the last financial year 2001-
02, almost a similar number, that is, 49 new
schemes  were  launched  and  five  schemes
were  converted  from  close  ended  to  open
ended schemes.

Assured Return Schemes of Mutual
Funds

Some of the schemes which assured returns
in  the  offer  documents  faced  difficulties  in
meeting  the  assurances.  SEBI,  in  pursuing
its  objective  to  protect  the  interest  of
investors,  has  been  directing  the  AMCs/
sponsors  to  honour  their  commitments  of
paying assured returns.

During the year 2002-03, the sponsors/AMCs
have  contributed  Rs.0.56  crore  in  case  of
Dhanvarsha (13) Scheme of LIC Mutual Fund,
and  Rs.0.03  crore  in  case  of  Libra  Leap
Scheme of Taurus Mutual Fund.

In case of UTI, there was shortfall of Rs. 617
crore in case of MIP 97 (I) Scheme, Rs.855
crore in case of MIP 97 (II) Scheme, Rs. 379
crore in case of MIP 97 (III) Scheme and Rs.
277  crore  in  case  of  IISFUS  97  Scheme.
Following  the  directive  from  SEBI,  UTI  met
the  shortfall  by  taking  loans  from  the  banks
by  offering  the  Development  Reserve  Fund
as  collateral  and  on  the  basis  of  the
guarantee by Government of India.

Subsequently  the  Government  announced
segregation  of  the  assured  return  schemes
from  the  NAV  based  schemes  under  2
separate  entities  with  the  enactment  of  the
Unit  Trust  of  India  (Repeal  and  Transfer  of
Undertaking)  Act,  2002  and  committed  to
meet  the  deficits  for  the  assured  return
schemes.

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

Till, date the sponsors and asset management
companies of nine mutual funds including UTI,
contributed  a  total  amount  of  Rs.4558.96
crore  to  meet  the  shortfall  in  case  of  32
schemes  as  on  March  31,  2003.  It  may  be
mentioned here that many of these schemes
were launched even before the enactment of
SEBI Act 1992.

Box 2.3 : Historical Background -ETFs

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a new variety of mutual fund that first became available in 1993. ETFs have
grown rapidly and now hold nearly $80 billion in assets. ETFs are sometimes described as more “tax efficient”
than traditional equity mutual funds, since in recent years, some large ETFs have made smaller distributions of
realized and taxable capital gains than most mutual funds.

In  the  November/December  1976  issue  of  Financial  Analysts  Journal,  Professor  Nils  Hakansson  published  a
paper  titled  “The  Purchasing  Power  Fund:  A  New  Kind  of  Financial  Intermediary.”  The  theoretical  “Purchasing
Power  Fund”  envisioned  a  new  financial  instrument  made  up  of  “Supershares”  that  provided  payoffs  only  for  a
pre-specified level of market return. The underlying assets of the Purchasing Power Fund were index funds.

In the late 1980s, Leland, O’Brien, Rubenstein Associates (LOR), a firm known for developing portfolio insurance
products,  believed  there  was  a  demand  for  a  simplified  version  of  the  Purchasing  Power  Fund  as  a  hedge
product. With the backing of large institutional investors, such as the IBM  Pension  Fund, LOR wanted to create
a so-called “SuperTrust” based on Hakansson’s “Supershares” ideas.

In order for the SuperTrust to work, the product needed an underlying index investment that could be listed on a
stock  exchange  and  could  continuously  offer  and  redeem  shares  -  an  ETF.  The  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission (SEC) had previously authorized securities that could be either open-ended or exchange-listed, but
they had not authorized securities that could have both characteristics.

In 1990, LOR undertook the arduous and expensive task of petitioning the SEC to allow the creation of an ETF
as  the  underlying  security  for  the  SuperTrust.  LOR  chose  the  S&P  500  Index  as  the  structure  and  named  the
investment the “Index Trust SuperUnit”.

In 1990, the SEC issued the Investment Company Act Release No. 17809, the “SuperTrust Order”, that granted
LOR  specified  exemptions  from  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940  (the  Act).  Specifically,  the  order  granted
exemptions  from  the  rules  regulating  unit  investment  trusts  and  the  SEC’s  rules  and  regulations  governing
investment companies. The SEC also made exemptions to the rules governing the way securities are sold and
exchanged. This order allowed the first ETF.

After  additional  regulatory  delays,  LOR  introduced  the  SuperTrust  and  the  Index  Trust  SuperUnit  in  1993.  The
SuperTrust and the SuperUnits offered advantages over other hedge products. However, even LOR’s simplified
version of Professor Hakansson’s Purchasing Power Fund turned out to be too complex for the marketplace and
the SuperTrust did not get the financial backing that LOR had hoped for. Making matters worse, demand for all
hedge products had fallen off dramatically. The SuperTrust was terminated in 1996.

Although  LOR  developed  the  Index  Trust  SuperUnit  as  an  investment  underlying  a  hedge  product,  there  was
some  discussion  of  the  product  being  valuable  as  a  stand-alone  S&P  500  Index  investment.  The  Index  Trust
SuperUnit  enabled  investors  to  trade  directly  in  the  S&P  500  Index  as  if  it  were  a  listed  corporation.  Yet,  the
Index Trust SuperUnit was marketed and priced as a hedge product and thus was not viable on its own.

The  American  Stock  Exchange  LLC,  through  its  subsidiary  PDR  Services  LLC  and  the  Standard  &  Poors
Depository  Receipt  (SPDR)  Trust,  took  advantage  of  the  SuperTrust  Order  to  petition  for  and  receive  a  SEC
Order  that  in  1992  authorized  a  stand-alone  S&P  500  Index-based  ETF  as  a  unit  investment  trust.  The  SPDR
Order specified some additional exemptions allowing for easier exchange of shares, a concept pioneered in the
SuperTrust and explained below.

Unlike  the  Index  Trust  SuperUnit,  the  SPDR  gained  acceptance  in  the  marketplace  and  became  the  first
commercially successful ETF.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a rapidly growing class of financial products. ETFs are typically organized as
unit trusts. They were introduced in 1993, and by the end of 2001, they held $79 billion in assets — 2.4 percent
of the total assets in equity mutual funds. The share of equity mutual fund assets held through ETFs doubled in
2000  and  rose  by  nearly  fifty  percent  in  2001.  With  several  years  of  continued  growth  at  this  pace,  the  assets
held through ETFs will rival the amount held in equity index funds.

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

Box 2.3 : Historical Background -ETFs (Contd.)

ETFs -  In short, they are similar to index mutual funds but are traded more like a stock.  As their name implies,
Exchange Traded Funds represent a basket of securities that are traded on an exchange.  As with all investment
products, exchange traded funds have their share of advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages of Exchange Traded Funds 
Being similar to stocks, exchange traded funds offer more flexibility than your typical mutual fund.









ETFs  can  be  bought  and  sold  throughout  the  trading  day,  allowing  for  intraday  trading  -  which  is  rare  with
mutual funds.

Traders have the ability to short or buy ETFs on margin.

Low annual expenses rival the cheapest mutual funds.

Tax efficiency - due to SEC regulations, ETF tend to beat out mutual funds when it comes to tax efficiency
(if it is a non-taxable account then they are equal).

Disadvantages of ETFs
Unfortunately, exchange traded funds do have some negatives: 
 Commissions - like stocks, trading exchange traded funds will cost you.

 Only institutions and the extremely wealthy can deal directly with the ETF. Companies must buy through a broker.

 Unlike  mutual  funds,  ETFs  don’t  necessarily  trade  at  the  net  asset  values  of  their  underlying  holdings,

meaning an ETF could potentially trade above or below the value of the underlying portfolios.



Slippage - as with stocks, there is a bid-ask spread, meaning you might buy the ETF for 15 1/8 but can only
sell it for 15 (which is basically a hidden charge).

One  unique  feature  of  SPICE  is  that  it  can
be  bought  and  sold  like  any  other  equity
share  on  the  BSE  trading  terminal  (BOLT)
through a stockbroker. The minimum lot size

will be one unit of SPICE. Effectively, a retail
investor  can  buy  one  SPICE  unit  for  Rs.  33
and hold it in his Demat account just like any
other security.

Box 2.4 : A Global Overview of ETFs :

During  2002,  AUM  increased  by  35%,  from  US$104.8  billion  to  US$141.62  billion.  AUM  gowth  came  from  the
Japanese listed ETFs, which increased 218% (US$14.40 billion) to US$21.00 billion, followed by Europe, which
increased by 91% (US$5.09 billion) to US$10.69 billion, and the US, which increased by 21% (US$17.68 billion)
toUS$102.28billion.

The number of products increased by 39% to 280 ETFs, cross-listings increased by 57% to 361. Europe has the
largest number of products at 118 and cross-listings at 192, and had the largest number of new product launches,
47, an increase of 66% during 2002.

There are 280 ETFs with 361 listings on twenty six exchanges around the world. Europe has the largest number
of  products  at  118  and  cross-listings  at  192  and  has  the  largest  number  of  new  product  launches  at  47,  an
increase  of  66%,  and  accounted  for  all  53  cross-listings  during  the  year  followed  by  US  with  15  new  product
launches  and  Japan  with  10.  The  average  daily  trading  volume  for  the  month  of  December  was  153  million
shares or US$6.6 billion at the end of November 2002. January 29, 2003 will mark the 10th anniversary of the
listing of the SPDR, the first ETF in the US. -Excerpts from Morgan Stanley Equity Research Jan 29, 2003

FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTMENT
Investments by Foreign Institutional
Investors (FIIs)

The cumulative net investment by the Foreign
Institutional  Investors  (FIIs)  in  the  Indian
capital  market  touched  US  $15.80  billion  on
March 31, 2003, thus registering an increase
of US $562.4 million over the cumulative net

investment over the previous year.

It  can  be  observed  that  during  the  past  10
years  there  has  been  a  gradual  increase  in
the  FII  investment.  This  reflects  an  increase
in  the  confidence  of  the  FIIs  and  also  a
vindication of the reforms process carried out
by  SEBI  to  make  the  Indian  capital  markets
more  efficient,  transparent  and  investor
friendly.

The  Indian  markets  were  not  left  untouched
by the global recession and weak sentiments.
The  war  in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  added  to
the  negative  sentiments.  Due  to  these
negative undercurrents the net investment by
FIIs  in  2002-03  was  Rs.  2688.7  crore  as
compared to the net investment of Rs. 8755.2

crore in 2001-2002.
As  can  be  seen  from  the  above  table,  FIIs
were  net  sellers  only  during  the  months  of
April,  June  and  October  .  FIIs  were  net
purchasers  during  other  months  and  the
overall trend was positive during the financial
year.

SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF
SHARES AND TAKE-OVERS

During  the  year  2001-02,  88  letters  of  offer
for making open offers were filed with SEBI.
Under  the  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of
Shares  and  Takeovers),  Regulations,  1997,
a  category  of  non  applicability  of  open  offer
obligations  was  introduced  to  automatically
exempt  certain  transactions  from  open  offer
which  may  become  necessary  in  the  overall
commercial  and  business  interest  of  the
company. During the year, 238 reports were
filed  under  this  category.  The  transactions,
which  are  not  covered  under  the  said
category, are required to be submitted to the
Takeover Panel for exemption from open offer.
During  the  year,  35  such  applications  were
submitted  out  of  which  exemption  from
making open offer was granted in respect of
17 cases. (Table 2.70).

INVESTIGATION, ENFORCEMENT
AND SURVEILLANCE

I. Market Surveillance
Market  Surveillance  plays  a  key  role  in
ensuring stability and integrity of the markets.
The Market Surveillance Division of SEBI, part
of Investigation, Enforcement and Surveillance
Department,  keeps  a  proactive  oversight  on
the  surveillance  activities  of  the  stock
exchanges.
A. SEBI’s market surveillance functions have
been essentially focused on:
a) policy  formulation  for  introduction  of
surveillance  systems  at  the  stock
exchanges  to  bring  integrity  and  stability
in the Indian securities markets;

b) overseeing  the  surveillance  activities  of
the  stock  exchanges  including  the
monitoring of market movements by them;

c)

inspection of such surveillance functioning
of the stock exchanges; and

d) preparation  of  reports  and  studies  on
market  movements,  which  SEBI
circulates, periodically to the Government
of  India  and  to  securities  markets
regulators from other countries.

The  primary  responsibility  of  market
surveillance has been entrusted to the stock
exchanges.  SEBI  keeps  an  oversight  on
market  monitoring  by  exchanges  and  in
exceptional  circumstances  it  analyses  the
same.  When  appropriate,  on  the  basis  of
reports  received  from  the  stock  exchanges
or  specific  complaints,  preliminary  enquiries
are  conducted  to  determine  whether  the
trading 
raises  suspicion  of  market
manipulation  and  /  or  insider  dealing.  At
times,  on  exception  basis  only,  cases  are
taken up suo-moto also. In case an analysis
of the trading information leads to a suspicion
of  market  abuse,  like  occurrence  of  market
manipulation  or  insider  dealing  or  other
misconduct, investigations are initiated.

B.  The  Market  Surveillance  systems  are
developed and consolidated on a continuous
basis.  Some  of  the  improvements  in  the
surveillance systems that have been brought
about are given below:

a) Revision  of  periodic  and  event  driven

reports by stock exchanges;

b)

c)

Inspection  of  surveillance  functioning  of
stock exchanges;

Imposition of trading restrictions including
suspension  of  trading  in  scrips  by
exchanges

manipulation;

to 

d) Meetings  of  Inter  Exchange  Market
Surveillance  Group  for  interactive  and
effective decision making on surveillance
issues  and  co-ordination  between  stock
exchanges;  Two  meetings  were  held
during the year.

AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

e) Development  of  database  on  violations,
contraventions  and  cases  of  non-
compliance  by  members  and  companies
for  internal  use  in  surveillance  and
monitoring.

f) Designation of senior official at exchange
level  for  co-ordination  and  information
sharing  with  other  exchanges  over
surveillance related issues.

g) Development  of  an  enforcement  manual
and  improvement  in  the  process  and
documentation  of  surveillance  and
investigation activity.

II. Mechanisms for a fair and

in 

transparent securities market
improvements 

Bringing  about 
the
surveillance, investigations, co-ordination and
information sharing functions is a continuous
and  constantly  evolving  process  involving
technological  upgradation,  manpower
enhancement, training requirements, etc. As
part  of  this  continuous  process  and  in
response  to  new  market  developments  and
happenings  in  the  last  couple  of  years,
various  new  measures  were  initiated  and
steps taken. These include the following:

III. Surveillance in derivatives market
Derivatives 
trading  now  comprise  a
substantial part of market turnover. This is a
new  segment  in  Indian  markets.  Regulatory
experience with regard to surveillance in this
area is limited. In Indian derivatives markets,
single  stock  futures  have  a  dominant
presence,  which  is  unlike  the  experience  in
many  derivative  markets  abroad.  For
surveillance  and  monitoring  in  this  segment,
discussions  were  held  internally  within  SEBI
and  with  exchanges  to  identify  areas  for
monitoring. Pursuant to these discussions, an
advisory circular was issued to exchanges on
aspects  of  surveillance  in  this  segment.  To
examine the functioning of exchanges in this

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

9595959595

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

area,  spot  inspections  of  the  exchange
surveillance  systems  were  undertaken.
Periodic reports required to be submitted by
exchanges  were  modified  to  incorporate
oversight  of  surveillance  in  derivatives
markets. Emphasis has been made on taking
an integrated approach for surveillance in the
cash and derivatives markets.

Co-ordination between Exchanges
Information  sharing  and  co-ordination  is  a
necessary requirement for surveillance across
markets.  SEBI  has  formalized  a  mechanism
for  co-ordination  between  the  two  major
exchanges  viz.  BSE  and  NSE,  in  different
areas  such  as  surveillance  actions,
investigations  taken  up,  scrip  suspension,
circuit filter reduction, rumor verifications etc.
The exchanges share relevant information and
also  meet  periodically  to  discuss  relevant
issues.

Reporting by stock exchanges
For  overseeing  and  supervision  of  the
surveillance activity at stock exchanges, SEBI
receives both periodic as well as event driven
reports from exchanges.

The  periodic  reports  comprise  of  weekly
reports  which  include  details  about  overall
trading statistics, member deactivations, scrip
suspension,  instances  of  rumor  verification,
working of stock watch system and reporting
on exception basis, any happenings, trends,
events, specific actions/ decisions which have
bearing on safety and integrity of market. The
monthly  report  gives  details  about  analysis/
investigations  taken  up  by  the  exchanges
following  investor  complaints  forwarded  by
SEBI or otherwise, outcome of the same and
actions  taken  by  the  exchange  against
members/ issuers, and reporting on exception
basis,  any  happenings,  trends,  events,
specific actions/ decisions which have bearing
on safety and integrity of market.

The periodic reports were revised to include

9696969696

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

reporting on derivatives markets and the scope
of periodic reporting requirement by exchanges
was enhanced by making it necessary for
exchanges to report on the actions taken by
them in respect of scrips showing high price
volatility or large volume variations. The
reporting formats now require the exchanges to
compulsorily record the decisions relating to
scrips where no action is taken by exchanges
despite price/volume variations.

Use of Client IDs
For surveillance to be effective, it is essential
that ultimate beneficiaries of transactions are
immediately known. However in the absence
of  unique  client  IDs,  identity  of  the  ultimate
client in a transaction is not easily known at
present  and  requires  investigation,  which  is
a  time  consuming  process.  SEBI  has,
therefore,  made  it  mandatory  for  brokers  to
use unique client IDs. SEBI has also stressed
upon  building  up  of  databases  incorporating
unique  client  information,  which  is  expected
to help in identifying ultimate beneficiaries for
surveillance and investigations.

IV. Greater responsibility and

accountability of the surveillance
cells of the stock exchanges

To  bring  about  greater  responsibility  and
accountability in discharging the surveillance
functions  by  stock  exchanges,  following
measure were initiated during 2002-03.

Stock Watch System – an on-line automated
surveillance system
SEBI  had  asked  the  exchanges  to  develop
and  implement  an  online  market  monitoring
and surveillance system on the basis of basic
parameters  specified  by  SEBI.  The  system
has been implemented in different exchanges
in varying formats, and has been customized
by  exchanges  to  suit  their  trading  practices/
surveillance  procedures,  though  basic  alerts
have remained similar in different exchanges.
As turnover in smaller exchange is negligible,

the  relevance  of  online  monitoring  in  these
exchanges has reduced.

The major exchanges are using the system in
conjunction with offline surveillance methods
i.e. in addition to online monitoring, exchanges
also monitor trades offline at the end of day.
Exchanges  were  advised 
to  update
benchmarks to generate fewer and more
meaningful alerts and the efficacy of the system
is regularly examined in exchange inspections.
Exchanges were also asked to better utilise
existing databases for filtering of alerts.

Co-ordination within the various departments of
the Exchange for surveillance functions
Exchanges have been advised to initiate
surveillance and examinations based on
feedback  from  other  departments  of  the
exchange such as listing, broker inspections,
clearing and settlement etc. This issue was
followed  up  on  a  continuous  basis  with
exchanges. As suggested by SEBI, surveillance
and  investigation  functions  which  were
scattered across different departments in NSE
have been restructured for better co-ordination
and information flow within the exchange.

Surveillance staff strength at exchanges
SEBI has been continuously following up with
exchanges  to  enhance  manpower  for  the
surveillance function, in view of the necessity
for  employing  greater  resources  in  terms  of
manpower  for  surveillance  and  follow-up
investigation.  Manpower  deployed  at  major
exchanges  was  increased  in  this  area  by
around 50 per cent.

Investigations by Exchanges
Based on their online and off-line surveillance
activity, exchanges conduct investigations into
trading  activity 
in  scrips.  SEBI  has
endeavoured  to  improve  the  quality  of
investigations  conducted  by  exchanges
through  the  inspections  of  exchange
surveillance functioning and through informal
feedback to exchanges. Exchanges are also

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

advised  to  take  action  based  on  their  own
bye-laws, rules and regulations in the cases
investigated by them. SEBI had also advised
exchanges  to  take  up  more  investigations
related  to  merger/takeover  announcements
and place more emphasis on identifying insider
trading  cases  by  examining  trading  activity
around the time of major announcements by
corporates.

During 2002-03, exchanges were seen to be
taking up more cases for investigations. BSE
and  NSE  were  doing  more  comprehensive
investigations than earlier. However, there is
still scope for substantial improvement in the
methodology  for  conducting  effective
investigations. Exchanges were also advised
to  complete  investigations  in  a  time  bound
manner. In case an investigation takes more
than  six  weeks  to  complete,  exchanges  are
required  to  indicate  reasons  for  delay  in
completion  while  reporting  on  pending
investigations.

V.

Inspection of surveillance cells of
stock exchanges

During 2002-03, SEBI inspected functioning of
surveillance cells of 4 stock exchanges. The
areas examined during these inspections include
-
Functioning  of  surveillance  cell  of  the
exchange  with  respect  to  detection  of
price  volume  aberrations  and  abnormal
market movements
Functioning  of  stockwatch  system  for
detection of price volume aberrations

-

- Market  monitoring  for  identifying  market
abuse  such  as  price  rigging,  insider
trading etc.

- Procedure for taking up investigations by

Important Pronouncements relating
to Securities Laws

A. High Court Case/s

Harinarayan G Bajaj Vs. SEBI - High Court
of Bombay –
The appellants were investors in shares and
securities and they traded through brokers at
Stock  Exchanges.  The  appellants  were
served with two show-cause notices alleging
that the appellants had indulged in buying and
selling of abnormal volumes of ARBL stripes
with a view to creating artificial market in the
scrip  and  for  above  malpractices  as  to  why
they  should  not  be  subjected  to  criminal
prosecution  under  the  provisions  of  the  Act.
The appellants responded to the show-cause
notices requesting the respondent to provide
details  of  show  cause,  etc.  The  respondent
did  not  respond  to  the  said  request  of  the
appellants.  The  appellants,  therefore,  filed  a
writ  petition  but  the  Board,  after  hearing,

rejected  the  applications  and  directed  to  file
the reply to show-cause notices. On appeal,
the Tribunal dismissed the appeal holding that
the appellants were not in any way debarred
from  raising  any  objection  before  the
respondents in the proceedings if they felt that
the material relevant to the charges had been
held  back  from  them  and  in  case  they  were
aggrieved by the outcome of the proceedings
initiated  by  the  respondents,  they  were
entitled  to  appeal  against  such  decision
before the concerned Forum.

The Hon’ble Court held that in the context of
the  scheme  of  the  Act,  it  was  difficult  to
accept the submission of the appellants that
each  and  every  order  made  by  the  Tribunal
is  intended  to  be  subjected  to  appeal  under
section 15Z. Mere procedural orders are not
the  orders  which  can  be  taken  up  and
challenged  under  section  15Z.  Unless  the
orders formally adjudicate and effect rights of
the  parties,  it  is  difficult  to  conceive  that

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

107107107107107

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

remedy of an appeal under section 15Z would
be  available.  In  term,  section  15Z  provides
for an appeal from the decision of the Tribunal
‘on any question of fact or law’ arising out of
the  order.  This  clearly  implies  that  the  order
in appeal should have decided the fact or law
or  decided  the  mixed  question  of  fact  and
law  which  affect  the  appellants’  rights
adversely. The section does not contemplate
an appeal against any decision or order which
does not decide the fact or law affecting any
right of the parties.

The  rights  and  liabilities  of  the  parties
normally would be decided by the final order.
Very  rarely  the  interlocutory  order  on
procedural matters would affect the rights of
the parties. The course of a litigation should
normally  proceed  unhampered.  If  at  every
stage the Appellate Court has to entertain an
appeal, there cannot be a speedy culmination
of  the  litigation  at  all.  It  is  with  a  view  to
expedite the trial and conclusion of a litigation
before the original authority or the Court that
the  Supreme  Court  has  limited  the  scope  of
the appellate jurisdiction in the manner stated
in Central Bank of India Ltd. v. Gokal Chand
AIR 1967 SC 799. Therefore, the Court held
that  purely  procedural  orders  which  do  not
affect the substantive right of the parties are
not  appealable  under  section  15Z.  This
interpretation  would  also  apply  with  equal
force to section 15T which provides an appeal
to  the  Tribunal  against  the  order  passed  by
the  Board  or  the  Adjudicating  Officer.
Therefore,  the  interlocutory  orders  not
affecting  the  rights  of  the  parties  would  not
be appeal able under section 15T.

B. Securities Appellate Tribunal

Kinglet Finlease & Securities Ltd. Vs. SEBI.
The  appeal  was  filed  challenging  the  order
dated  22.08.2002  suspending  the  certificate
of  the  appellant  broker,  a  member  of  NSE
for  a  period  of  one  year.  The  broker  was
found involved in manipulation and fraudulent

108108108108108

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

dealings  in  shares  of  M/s.  Kamal  Overseas
Ltd.  The  certificate  of  the  broker  was
suspended for violation of the code of conduct
read  with  schedule  II  of  Stock  Brokers
Regulations,  1992  and  regulation  4  of  SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade
Practices  relating  to  securities  market)
Regulations, 1995.

The  order  was  challenged  on  grounds  that
the  broker  was  subjected  to  double
punishment  on  the  same  set  of  facts  and
violations,  once  by  NSE  by  deactivating  its
terminal  and  debiting  Rs.  20  lacs  towards
fines and penalties and again by SEBI by the
impugned order and that the impugned order
was  passed  beyond  the  one  month  period
specified  in  regulation  29  (3)  of  the  Stock
Brokers Regulations.

The  Securities  Appellate  Tribunal  vide  its
order  dated  29.01.2003  has  dismissed  the
appeal  being  devoid  of  any  merits  and  held
as under –

a.

It  is  beyond  any  doubt  that  SEBI  is
empowered to suspend the certificate of
registration  granted  to  a  stock  broker
independent  of  any  action  by  the  stock
exchange  for  not  acting  in  accordance
with  the  Rules,  Regulations  and  Bye–
laws  of  the  exchange.  It  is  not  that  a
broker  who  has  been  punished  by  an
exchange  under  its  bye  –  laws  /
regulations is untouchable by SEBI. It is
not  material  as  to  whether  the  facts
relied on by SEBI and NSE are one and
the same. It is the distinct nature of the
offence that matters. Offence is relatable
to  the  omission  or  commission  made
punishable by any law. The action taken
by NSE and SEBI is not with reference
to  the  same  offence.  It  is  well  settled
that imposition of monetary penalty as a
result  of  a  domestic  enquiry  cannot  be
considered  as  punishment  for  the
purpose  of  considering  protection  from
‘dual jeopardy’.

b.

The reply referred to in regulation 29 (3)
of the Stock Brokers Regulations is not
confined  to  written  reply  alone.  If  a
noticee seeks personal hearing, the oral
submissions  so  made  in  the  hearing
should also be considered as reply.

Dalmia Securities Pvt. Limited Vs. SEBI
The  captioned  appeal  was  filed  by  the
appellant  Dalmia  Securities  Pvt  Limited
(hereinafter referred to as “Dalmia Securities”)
against  the  imposition  of  the  condition  that
no  new  accounts  shall  be  opened  by  the
appellant.  Dalmia  Securities  was  registered
with SEBI as a DP through NSDL since 17th
March, 1997. Since the registration was due
to  expire  in  March  2002,  they  made  an
application  for  renewal  on  31st  December,
2001.  While  granting  renewal  of  registration
as  a  Depository  Participant  on  NSDL  to  the
appellant  the  said  condition  was  imposed  in
view of the pendency of investigations against
them  and  in  the  interest  of  the  securities
market.

The  SAT  in  its  order  dated  29.1.03  upheld
SEBI’s  powers  to  impose  conditions  while
granting renewal of registration. SAT observed
that :

is  empowered 

“From  the  legal  position  emerging  from  the
regulations  cited  above  it  is  clear  that  the
Respondent 
to  grant
registration  and  renewal  of  the  registration
subject  to  certain  conditions.  The  certificate
of  registration  can  be  granted  subject  to
conditions  is  evidenced  from  provisions  in
section 12(1A) of the Act also as the section
stipulates  that  “No  depository,  participant,
custodian  of  securities,  foreign  institutional
investors,  credit  rating  agency  or  any  other
intermediary  associated  with  the  securities
market  as  the  Board  may  by  notification  in
this behalf specify, shall buy or sell or deal in
securities except and in accordance with the
conditions  of  a  certificate  of  registration
obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

to 

the  regulations  made  under  this  Act.”  The
section  recognises  SEBI  as  the  authority
empowered 
issue  certificates  of
registration,  and  therefore,  obviously  the
power to impose conditions is also vested in
SEBI.  The  Respondent’s  submission  that  it
is  empowered  to  issue  certificate  subject  to
conditions, thus in my view, is tenable…

Since  the  renewal  is  to  be  considered  “as  if
it is a fresh registration”, for good reason the
Respondent  is  empowered  to  put  conditions
while granting renewal as it is empowered to
put  conditions  on  “first  registration”.  The
Appellant’s submission that as per regulation
23, the renewal can be subject only to those
conditions  of  certificate  of  registration
specified  in  regulation  22,  has  no  legal
support.  As  noted  earlier  as  per  sub
regulation (2) of regulation 22 the Respondent
is  empowered  to  deal  with  the  renewal
application in the same manner as if it were
a  fresh  application  for  grant  of  certificate  of
registration.”

However, the Tribunal set aside the condition
that  no  new  accounts  shall  be  opened  by
Dalmia  Securities  on  the  ground  that  the
impugned condition is unreasonable and that
the decision was taken in an unjust and unfair
manner.  In  its  order  the  Tribunal  has  also
observed that if Dalmia securities was found
unfit  to  be  allowed  to  operate  or  deal  in
securities,  in  the  interest  of  investors,  they
should  not  have  been  granted  renewal  till
such time the investigations are completed.

Swedish Match AB and others v/s SEBI
The  appellant  as  a  result  of  acquisition  of
shares  triggered  regulations  11(1)  and
regulation  12.  The  appellant  contended  that
it  was  not  required  to  make  public
announcement  in  terms  of  the  regulations
since  the  acquisition  by  the  appellant  was
covered by proviso given in regulation 12. The
issue  before  SAT  was  whether 
the
acquisitions  covered  by  regulation  12  will

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 - 2003

109109109109109

Part-II Review of the Trends and Operations

subsume  the  acquisitions  governed  by
regulation  11  also  in  light  of  the  fact  that
wherever  change  in  control  of  the  target
company was accompanied by acquisition of
shares  beyond  the  threshold  limits  provided
in regulations 10 and 11.

While  dismissing  the  appeal,  SAT  held  that
Regulations,  11(1)  and  12  are  independent
regulations and do not come in conflict in any
manner  and  the  same  are  put  in  position  to
meet  different  situations.  Regulation  11
specifically deals with cases of acquisition of
shares  for  the  purpose  of  consolidation  of
holdings by the existing shareholders whereas
regulation 12 is exclusively on control and the
control  is  not  connected  to  any  particular
factor.  Therefore,  in  case  any  acquisition
triggers two regulations the acquirer will have
to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  both  the
regulations and the exemption available under
one of the regulations cannot be extended to
the other regulations under which public offer
is  to  be  made.  SAT  also  held  that  Takeover
Regulations  1997  is  a  beneficial  regulation
and a bare mechanical interpretation of words
and application of legislative intent devoid of
concept and purpose will reduce the remedial
and  beneficial  measures  provided  for  in  the
legislation to futility. Accordingly, the appellant
was  directed  to  make  public  announcement
for violation of regulation 11(1).

T.J. Stock Broking Services (P) Ltd. vs. SEBI
In  the  instant  case,  the  respondent  ordered
investigation to ascertain as to the role played
by  various  persons  /  intermediaries  and
violations, if any, of the regulatory provisions
by them in dealing of shares of Amara Raja
Batteries Ltd. (ARBL). The investigation stated
to have revealed that Shri Harinarayan Bajaj
and  his  son  Shri  Rahul  Bajaj  were  the
dominant traders in the ARBL’s shares. Some
of the members of BSE and NSE had aided
and  abetted  Shri  H.Bajaj  in  creating  a  false
market  in  ARBL’s  scrips.  The  respondent
decided to conduct a detailed enquiry into the
role  and  conduct  of  the  appellant  in  trading
in the scrip. The enquiry officer on concluding
the  enquiry  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the
appellant had failed to exercise due care and
skill  in  his  dealing  with  Bajaj  thereby
violated Code  of  Conduce  of  Brokers’
Regulations,1992 and SEBI Circular dated 7th
March,2001  whereby  short  sales  were
banned.  The  Enquiry  Officer  recommended
one  month  suspension  of  the  Certificate  of
Registration. SAT observed that the appellant
had  failed  to  exercise  due  care  was
established  and  further  observed  that  the
suspension  of  CORn  for  one  month,  for  the
violation  of  the  Code,  awarded  by  the
respondent  cannot  be  considered  unduly
harsh as argued by the appellant. The appeal
was dismissed.
