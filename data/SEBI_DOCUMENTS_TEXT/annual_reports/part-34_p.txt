Securities and Exchange Board of India
PART III
FUNCTIONS OF SEBI IN RESPECT OF MATTERS SPECIFIED
IN SECTION 11 OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA ACT, 1992

Annual Report 2000-2001

A] REGULATION OF BUSINESS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGES
The SEBI has been inspecting all the stock exchanges once every year since 1995-96 under the
SEBI  Act,  1992.  However,  in  view  of  the  low/insignificant  turnover  recorded  at  the  OTCEI,
Saurashtra-Kutch, Madhya Pradesh, Jaipur, Mangalore, Magadh, Bhubaneswar and Gauhati Stock
Exchanges, these exchanges were not inspected during 1999-2000. In the year 2000-2001 four
more exchanges viz. Madras, Vadodara, Coimbatore and Inter-connected Stock Exchange ware
added to this list of exchange not to be inspected.

During  these  inspections,  a  review  of  the  market  operations,  organisational  structure  and
administrative control of the exchange is made to ascertain whether :









the exchange provides a fair, equitable and growing market to investors
the  exchange’s  organisation,  systems  and  practices  are  in  accordance  with  the  Securities
Contracts (Regulation) Act (SC(R) Act), 1956 and rules framed thereunder
the exchange has implemented the directions, guidelines and instructions issued by the SEBI
from time to time
the exchange has complied with the conditions, if any, imposed on it at the time of renewal/
grant of its recognition under section 4 of the SC(R) Act, 1956.

Based on the observations/suggestions made in the inspection reports, the exchanges are advised
to  send  a  compliance  report  to  the  SEBI  within  one  month  of  the  receipt  of  the  inspection
report by the exchange and thereafter quarterly reports indicating the progress made by them in
implementing  the  suggestions  contained  in  the  inspection  report.  The  SEBI  nominee  directors
and public representatives on the governing board/council of management of the stock exchanges
also pursue the matters in the meetings of the governing board/council of management. If the
performance  of  the  exchanges  whose  renewal  of  recognition  is  due,  is  not  found  satisfactory,
SEBI grants further recognition for a short period only, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions.
Further,  the  functioning  of  the  exchanges  are  also  being  monitored  through  a  Monthly
Development Report which the exchanges are required to submit to the SEBI every month.

The  table  3.4  presents  the  stock  exchange-wise  broker  details  according  to  their  ownership
structure. A number of brokers, proprietor firms and partnership firms have converted themselves
into  corporates.  A  number  of  FIs  have  also  been  registered  as  brokers.  This  diversification
reflects increase in decentralised ownership patterns. This is a sign of healthy development of
stock market in the country. It would be observed that of the 9,782 brokers, 3,763 brokers were
corporate  brokers  as  on  March  31,  2001.  In  terms  of  percentage  corporate  brokers  accounted
for  about  36  per  cent  in  total  brokers  as  on  end  March  2000.  This  percentage  increased  to

143

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

nearly 39 per cent as on March 31, 2001. FIs numbered 20 as on March 31, 2001 compared to
19  brokers  as  on  March  31,  2000.  It  would  be  also  observed  that  of  the  new  590  brokers
registered during 2000-01, 447 were corporate brokers and 140 were proprietors. The number
of partnership firms in brokerage business, however, decreased from 335 to 325. Thus brokerage
service are increasingly better organised than before. This stratification of broker services can
be  expected  to  increase  healthier  functioning  of  broker  houses.  The  corporatisation  and
institutionalisation of the brokers should result in more organized and efficient services leading
to healthier trading and accounting standards.

Annual Report 2000-2001

It may be stated that brokers in many cases get registered at more than one stock exchanges. It
would be seen from table 3.5 below that 621 brokers had membership at two stock exchanges
as on March 31, 2001 as compared to 493 brokers with double memberships as on March 31,
2000.  Whereas  82  brokers  had  membership  on  3  stock  exchanges  as  on  March  31,  2001  as
compared  61  members  as  on  March  31,  2000.  Thus  multiple  membership  is  increasing  on
Indian stock exchanges which a number of times results in cross trading over the stock exchanges
for arbitrage etc.

Sub-brokers
The  services  of  sub-brokers  provide  link  between  the  investors  and  the  brokers.  Since  sub-
brokers are located at far flung areas from the stock exchanges, they provide network of stocks
market  in  the  hinterland  of  the  country.  There  were  9957  sub-brokers  registered  as  on  March
31, 2001, as compared with 5675 sub-brokers in the previous year. As such the growth of sub-
brokers has been high and this is the indication that their services are in demand in the market.
It would be seen from table 3.6 below that 92 per cent of the total sub-brokers registered with
the  SEBI  during  the  current  year  were  from  the  Stock  Exchange,  Mumbai  and  NSEIL.  This
ratio was 90 per cent as on March 31, 2000. The high concentration of sub-brokers at Mumbai
and  NSEIL  indicates  skewed  availability  of  brokers’  services  at  smaller  stock  exchanges  like
Madhya Pradesh, Guwahati, Managalore, Magadh, Coimbatore, Ludhiana etc. probably due to
non-availability of adequate business. In these areas lack of sufficient business discourages the
brokers/sub-brokers  to  take  up  thinly  available  broking  services.  Sub-broker  services  are  very
crucial in educating the potential investors in the primary as well as secondary market.

The high growth in number of brokers and sub-brokers warrants strengthening and expanding
of surveillance and regulatory framework.

D] FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES
After  enacting  the  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  relating  to  the
securities  market)  Regulations,  which  enabled  SEBI  to  investigate  into  market  manipulations
and  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices,  vigorous  efforts  were  undertaken  to  unearth  these
manipulations  and  practices  and  take  action  against  the  manipulators/violators.  During  2000-
2001, 47 cases were taken up for alleged market manipulation and price rigging; 5 cases were
taken  up  for  alleged  “issue”  related  manipulation,  etc.  The  details  of  the  same  have  been
elaborated in Part II of the report.

E] PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING
During 2000-2001, 6 new cases were taken up. Inquiries/Investigations were completed in four
cases of insider trading in this year. Show cause notices have been issued to the insiders pursuant
to successful investigations in one case. On full working of the Stock Watch System, which has
been put in place, surveillance over insider trading would be further strengthened.

F] SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF SHARES AND TAKE-OVERS
SEBI has taken up one case of alleged violation of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares
and Take-overs) Regulations, 1997. Inquiries/Investigations were completed in three other cases
and  pursuant  to  investigations,  adjudication  proceedings  have  been  initiated  in  one  cases  and
further proceedings under the regulations are in progress (Annexure 2).

Annual Report 2000-2001

Inspection and enquries – stock brokers and sub brokers
Section  11(2)  of  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992  provides  that  SEBI  shall
register and regulate the working of stock brokers and sub-brokers. In fulfillment of the above,
SEBI carries out inspections of the books and records of stock brokers to verify whether:

(a) Books  of  accounts,  records  and  other  documents  are  being  maintained  in  the  manner
specified  by  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957  and  SEBI  (Stock  Brokers
and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992.

(b) The provisions of the SEBI Act, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act and the provisions

made thereunder are being complied with by the broker.

(c) Adequate steps for redressal of grievances of the investors are being taken and the conditions

of registration as a stock broker are complied with.

As 9,782 brokers and 9,957 sub-brokers are registered with SEBI, it is not possible for SEBI to
inspect all the brokers with its limited resources. Brokers are therefore selected for inspection,
on sample basis, by SEBI. Apart from SEBI, Stock Exchanges as self-regulatory organizations
are  also  expected  to  carry  out  inspection  of  10  per  cent  of  their  respective  active  member-
brokers.

During  2000-2001,  98  brokers  from  the  12  Exchanges  across  the  country  were  inspected  by
SEBI. For the first time, Sub-Brokers were inspected during the year.

During the inspection the following features were observed:
1. Brokers of regional stock exchanges were hit hard by sharp slump in their business. Many
of them were either out of business or working for the brokers of bigger Stock Exchanges
or have taken the terminals of BSE and NSE members.

2. Due to slow down in the Stock Market, clientele business in general had diminished.
3. Brokers and investors were trading mainly to avail of the benefit of arbitrage.
4. Most of the brokers have already computerised their books of accounts and other relevant

records

5. Subsequent to dematerialisation of most actively traded scrips, the problem of bad delivery

faced by the brokers has gone down substantially.

6. Most of the large stock broking houses are providing the services as DP.
7.

In some of the Stock Exchanges, some brokers are trading in other Stock Exchanges through
Subsidiary route.

Common irregularities noticed during inspection were the following:

Irregularities in issuance of Contract notes.
1.
2. Non segregation of clients and own funds.
3. Client database and agreement with clients not maintained/entered.

Annual Report 2000-2001

4. Dealing with unregistered Sub-Brokers.
5. Dealing as unregistered Sub-Brokers.
6. Delay in transfer of securities from Broker’s Pool Account to Client’s Beneficiary Account.

Inspections  of  brokers  conducted  by  the  SEBI  from  time  to  time  have  resulted  in  better
compliance to SEBI Rules/Regulations/Circulars by them.

A comparative statement of inspection of brokers carried out during the year, enquiries ordered
and its outcome for the year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 are given in the table 3.9.

It is noticed that number of enquiries ordered has shown significant increase over the previous
year’s  figure.  This  is  because  of  enquiry  initiated  against  188  brokers  for  the  failure  to  fulfill
underwriting devolvement in various issues.

Inspection of mutual funds
Inspections of 33 active mutual funds (including those schemes of UTI which come under the
purview of SEBI) have been ordered during the year to be carried out by independent chartered
accountancy  firms  covering  the  period  April  1999  to  September  2000.  Necessary  action  has
been taken on the findings of inspections carried out in the last year.

Disciplinary action taken
Monitoring  of  mutual  funds  was  further  strengthened  to  ensure  that  interests  of  investors  are
protected. SEBI took disciplinary action against a number of mutual funds in the year 2000-01,
the details of which are given in the following Table 3.10.

During the year 2000-01, adjudication proceedings were ordered against the asset management
companies of 4 mutual funds. The details/reasons for the adjudication proceedings are as follows:

(a) Alliance Capital Mutual Fund - The mutual fund exceeded the investment limit of 10 per
cent,  in  five  schemes,  in  violation  of  clause  10  of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to  the  SEBI
(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.

(b) SBI  Mutual  Fund  -  The  mutual  fund  delayed  the  despatch  of  unit  certificates/  account

statements in 2 schemes. The period of delay ranged from 2 days to 396 days.

(c) PNB Mutual Fund - The mutual fund exceeded the investment limit of 10 per cent, in two
schemes,  in  violation  of  clause  10  of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)
Regulations, 1996.

(d) Escorts Mutual Fund - The mutual fund failed in finalising the scheme-wise annual report
and  despatching  them  to  the  unitholders  in  violation  of  clause  56  of  the  SEBI  (Mutual
Funds)  Regulations,  1996.  Further,  the  fund  also  delayed  in  forwarding  the  copy  of  the
annual report to SEBI within the six months period from the date of closure of the financial
year thus violating clause 57 of the Regulations.

Penalties Imposed
The details of penalties imposed on mutual funds on the basis of adjudication proceedings are
as follows:

(a) Shriram Mutual Fund – The mutual fund had violated the investment restrictions and had

delayed in despatching redemption/repurchase proceeds.

151

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

The  Adjudication  officer  vide  order  dated  9/10/2000  imposed  a  penalty  of  Rs.5  lakh  on
the AMC. However, the AMC filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal and
the Appellate Authority reduced the penalty to Rs.2,50,000/- vide order dated 28/2/2001.

(b) Canbank Mutual Fund – The memorandum i.e. abridged offer document-cum -application
form of the Canpep 93 scheme, a close-ended scheme which was converted into an open-
ended scheme, did not contain the prescribed disclosures, which was in violation of clauses
29(2)  and  29(4)  of  the  Regulations.  The  Adjudicating  officer  imposed  a  penalty  of  Rs.3
lakh  on  the  AMC.  The  AMC  filed  an  appeal,  however,  the  order  of  adjudicating  officer
was upheld.

(c) PNB Mutual Fund – The mutual fund exceeded the investment limit of 10 per cent, in two
schemes,  in  violation  of  clause  10  of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)
Regulations, 1996. The adjudicating officer imposed a fine of Rs.2 lakh on the AMC.

Warning / Deficiency Letters

Considering  the  magnitude  and  seriousness,  33  warning/deficiency  letters  were  issued  to  22
mutual  funds  on  the  basis  of  monitoring  through  various  periodical  reports  and  deficiencies
pointed out in the inspection reports.

The main reasons for which warning letters were issued to mutual funds were:

(i) violation of advertisement code/guidelines,

(ii) delay in submission of periodical reports,

(iii) non-exercise of due diligence in draft offer document and smaller font size,

(iv) delays in publication of NAVs and wrong publishing of NAVs

(v) discrepancies in recording of investment decisions

(vi)

Inadvertent short-selling,

(vii)

failure to install systems and compliance mechanism in place,

(viii) unsatisfactory standard of investor services,

(ix) delay in filing details of trustees transactions,

(x) discrepancies in calculation of investment management fees,

152

Securities and Exchange Board of India

Annual Report 2000-2001

(xi) systemic deficiencies for delays in remitting the repurchase/ redemption proceeds,

(xii) delay in transfer of consideration in case of inter-scheme transfers,

Payment of Interest

SEBI  has  made  it  mandatory  that  the  mutual  funds  must  pay  interest  @  15  per  cent  for  the
delays in despatch of repurchase/redemption proceeds to the unitholders. The mutual funds are
required to report these cases of delays to SEBI on quarterly basis.

During the year 2000-01, 22 mutual funds including UTI, paid interest to the unitholders at the
rate of 15 per cent for the delay in despatch of redemption/repurchase proceeds. A total interest
of about Rs.8.37 lakh was paid to 6,722 investors. During the last financial year 1999-2000, on
the intervention of SEBI, a total amount of Rs 17.24 lakh was paid to 14, 686 investors by 4
mutual funds. Because of strict action by SEBI and making it mandatory to pay interest for the
delays in despatch of redemption/repurchase proceeds, the number of such cases has declined.

Compensation to Unitholders

In the case of Templeton Mutual Fund, in one of its offer document, the disclosures relating to
variable  load  structure  applicable  during  the  IPO  were  confusing  and  the  mutual  fund  issued
lesser number of units to the investors. On SEBI’s intervention, the AMC compensated the load
amount  of  Rs.37.7  lakh  to  the  scheme  and  the  unitholders  were  allotted  additional  units.  The
unitholders who redeemed their holdings before the directive of SEBI, were paid the difference
in amount to compensate them.

In case of BOI Mutual Fund, the unitholders were compensated for the loss incurred by them
due  to  incorrect  repurchase  price  alongwith  interest  @15  per  cent  for  the  period  commencing
from the date of despatch of redemption proceeds till date.

Compensation to Schemes

In  the  inspection  report  of  SBI  Mutual  Fund,  it  was  observed  that  in  3  cases  of  inter-scheme
transfers,  funds  had  not  been  transferred  on  spot-basis.  SEBI,  therefore,  directed  the  AMC  to
pay the schemes an amount of Rs.60,195/- on account of interest for delay in transfer of funds.

Exit Option to Investors

In case of some of the schemes of Tata Mutual Fund and a scheme of Prudential ICICI Mutual
Fund, advertisements were issued by them in which the figures of returns was not compounded
in  accordance  with  the  Advertisement  Code  and  the  guidelines.  Apart  from  issuing  warning
letters, SEBI directed them to disclose the factual position to their unitholders and give them an
option to exit at prevailing NAVs without exit loads.

Investors’ grievances redressal – securities market
SEBI  has  established  a  comprehensive  investor  grievances  redressal  mechanism.  The  Investor
Grievances  Redressal  and  Guidance  Division  of  SEBI  assists  investors  who  prefer  to  make
complaints  to  SEBI  against  listed  companies.  A  standardised  complaint  format  is  available  at
all  SEBI  offices  and  on  the  SEBI  Website  for  the  convenience  of  investors.  Each  complaint
received  by  SEBI  from  the  investors  is  acknowledged  and  a  reference  number  is  sent  to  the
complainant. Each complaint is taken up with the company and if the complaint is not resolved
within a reasonable time, a periodical follow up is also made with the company. SEBI officers
also hold meetings with the company officials to impress upon them their obligation to redress
the  grievances  of  investors.  Errant  companies  are  warned  of  stern  action  for  their  failure  to
redress  grievances.  Recalcitrant  companies  are  referred  for  prosecution.  SEBI  also  issues
fortnightly press release for public information, on the status of redressal of investor grievances
highlighting  companies  against  whom  more  than  1000  complaints  are  outstanding  and  the
redressal rate is below 40 per cent . SEBI has also put, on its website, information with regard
to companies against which maximum number of complaints are pending.

During the period 1991-92 to 2000-01, SEBI has received 26,29,882 grievances from investors
against companies and the same were taken up by the SEBI with the concerned companies for
redressal. Of this a total of 25,01,801 grievances were redressed by companies, which indicates
a  redressal  rate  of  95.13  per  cent.  The  cumulative  status  of  investor  grievances  received  by
