Annual Report 2007-08
PART  TWO:  REVIEW  OF  TRENDS  AND  OPERATIONS

The Indian securities markets witnessed
significant  uptrend  and  volatility  in  2007-08.
The  equity  markets  registered  gains  and  the
benchmark indices breached historic highs on
several  occasions.  However,  since  mid-
January  2008,  stock  markets  witnessed  sharp
corrections  in  tandem  with  the  global  equity
markets.  Resources  raised  by  the  corporates
from  the  primary  market  were  substantially
higher  indicating  the  continuation  of
investment  boom  in  India.  Mutual  funds  too
mobilised  large  amount  of  resources  during
2007-08.  Sound  domestic  macro-economic
fundamentals,  private  corporate  profitability
and  active  buying  support  from  institutional
investors  were  the  major  factors  that
dominated  stock  market  movement  during
2007-08.

1.

PRIMARY  SECURITIES  MARKET

The  upward  trend  in  primary  market
activities continued in 2007-08. The buoyancy
in the secondary market coupled with strong
macro-economic 
fundamentals,  active

institutional  support  led  by  FIIs  and  mutual
funds encouraged large number of companies
to  raise  resource  from  the  primary  market.
Several  large  companies  mobilised  resources
through  public  issues,  rights  issues  and
Qualified  Institutions’  Placement.  The
companies  in  private  sector  led  in  raising
resources  from  primary  market  during
2007-08.

I. Resource  Mobilisation

During 2007-08, 124 companies accessed
the  primary  market  and  raised  Rs.87,029
crore  through  public  (92)  and  rights  issues
(32)  as  against  124  companies  which  raised
Rs.33,508 crore in 2006-07 (Table 2.1A). While
the  number  of  issues  remained  the  same  in
both  the  years,  the  amount  mobilised  was
more  than  twice  in  2007-08  as  compared  to
2006-07. Of the total 92 public issues in 2007-
08,  85  were  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs)
(Rs.42,595 crore) and 7 were follow-on public
offerings  (FPOs)  (Rs.11,916  crore).  Even
though  the  number  of  rights  issues  were

more  than  eight  times  from  Rs.3,711  crore  in
2006-07  to  Rs.32,518  crore  in  2007-08.  The
share  of  rights  issues  in  the  total  resource
mobilisation went up to 37.4 per cent in 2007-
08  as  compared  to  11.1  per  cent  in  2006-07.

III. Size-wise  Resource  Mobilisation

About  87.8  per  cent  of  resource
mobilisation  was  through  issues  of  above
Rs.500 crore (Table 2.4). The number of issues
above Rs.500 crore category doubled from 11
in 2006-07 to 24 in 2007-08.

The average size of the issue was Rs.702
crore  in  2007-08  as  against  Rs.270  crore  in
2006-07.  The  mean  issue-size  of  the  public
issues  increased  from  Rs.351  crore  in  2006-
07  to  Rs.593  crore  in  2007-08.  The  larger  size
of 
issues  reflected  high  capital
expenditure  plans  of  companies  in  view  of
strong  economic  and  industrial  expansion.

the

SECONDARY  SECURITIES
MARKET

Industry-wise  classification  reveals  that
banks  and  financial  institutions  topped
resource mobilisation (Table  2.6).  Their  share
was  35.6  per  cent  followed  by  cement  and
construction  including  real  estate  (21.7  per
cent) and the power (15.8 per cent). However,
cement  and  construction  had  the  highest
number  of  27  issues  during  2007-08.  The
accelerated growth of the economy has paved
the  way  for  large  number  of  infrastructure
companies viz., cement and construction and
power,  to  tap  the  capital  market  for  their
fund requirements for various projects.

year, there was steep correction in the indices
on  account  of  concerns  over  domestic

Annual Report 2007-08

The benchmark indices surpassed many
landmarks  during  2007-08.  The  BSE  Sensex
and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  appreciated  by  19.7  per
cent and 23.9 per cent, respectively, on March
31,  2008,  over  March  31,2007  (Chart  2.3).
During  the  year,  BSE  Sensex  gained  2572
points  to  close  at  15644  on  March  31,  2008
from  13072  as  on  March  31,  2007.  The  S&P
CNX Nifty added 913 points to close at 4735
at the end of March 2008 over 3822 recorded
as on March 31, 2007.

The  financial  year  2007-08  commenced
with  an  uptrend  in  the  equity  markets.  The
BSE Sensex crossed the level of 14000 in April
2007.  Thereafter,  markets  displayed  strength
in  the  first  quarter  on  account  of  liquidity
support  from  FIIs  and  mutual  funds  and
strong  corporate  profitability.

During  the  second  quarter,  the  buoyant
trend continued with corrections in between.
Apart  from  the  growth  factors,  benign
inflation rate and upward trend in the global
equity  markets  supported  the  trend.

However,  concerns  over  US  sub-prime
mortgage  crisis,  surge  in  international  crude
oil  prices,  political  uncertainty  and  policy  to
cap  on  ECBs  were  some  of  the  worry-some
factors.  By  the  end  of  second  quarter,  BSE
Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  breached  17000
level and 5000 level, respectively.

In  the  third  quarter,  upward  trend
continued in emerging markets and with the
boom in commodity prices, the Indian equity
markets  also  surged  forward.  However,  in
mid-December 2007, the decline in developed
equity markets due to sub-prime losses, fears
of  credit  squeeze  and  global  recession  led  to
a  decline  in  Indian  equity  markets.  The
depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  major
currencies  and  increase  in  global  crude  oil
prices  to  high  levels  also  contributed  to
decline in major equity markets.

In  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  quarter,
on January 8, 2008, BSE Sensex and S&P CNX
Nifty closed at record high of 20873 and 6288,
respectively. Since mid-January 2008, markets

recorded  highest 

turned  volatile.  On  January  21,  2008,  the
markets 
intra-day
corrections  in  the  Indian  equity  markets  so
far.  During  the  month  of  October  2007  and
January  2008,  emerging  markets  witnessed
higher  volatility  as  compared  to  other
markets.  Indian  indices  were  one  of  the
highly  volatile  indices  in  the  world  during

January 2008. The annualised volatility of BSE
Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  were  30.6  per
cent  and  32.1  per  cent,  respectively  during
2007-08.

There  was  a  significant  rise  in  market
capitalisation  and  turnover  in  2007-08  on
account  of  buoyancy  in  the  equity  market
during major part of the year (Table 2.7).

Annual Report 2007-08

In the cash segment, the turnover at BSE
and  NSE  rose  by  65.1  per  cent  and  82.6  per
cent, respectively in 2007-08 over the previous
year.  Significant  upward  trend  was  recorded
in the derivatives segment and the combined
derivative  turnover  at  BSE  and  NSE  rose  by
79.8  per  cent  in  2007-08.  The  market
capitalisation  at  BSE  and  NSE  witnessed  a
rise  of  44.9  and  44.3  per  cent,  respectively
over  the  previous  year.  Indian  markets  with
strong  economic  growth  and  good  corporate
profitability  continued  to  attract  FIIs.
Substantial  resource  mobilisation  by  mutual
funds  from  income/debt  oriented  schemes
and  equity  related  schemes  was  another
significant feature of Indian securities market
in 2007-08. Liquidity support by institutional
investors  was  the  major  reason  for  the
buoyancy in the Indian stock markets.

I B. Global  Equity  Markets:  An

Overview

The  global  equity  markets  were
dominated  by  the  US  sub-prime  mortgage
and credit squeeze crisis in 2007-08. The other
key downside risks were inflation, oil prices,
and  slowdown  in  the  world  economy  led  by
recession  in  USA.  The  main  source  of
inflationary pressure was on account of rising
commodity  prices,  particularly  food  and
crude oil. During the first half of 2007-08, the
upward  revision  in  growth  expectations,
robust  corporate  earnings,  increased  merger
and  acquisition  activity  and  increased  risk
appetite  led  to  buoyancy  in  equity  markets
in  major  economies.  However,  in  the  second
half  of  2007-08,  the  re-pricing  of  risks
resulting  from  the  deterioration  in  the  sub-
prime  mortgage  sector  in  US  led  to  decline
in the equity markets in advanced economies.
In  the  third  quarter  of  2007-08,  the
depreciation  of  US  dollar  vis-à-vis  major
currencies  and  rise  in  international  crude  oil
prices  dampened  the  market  sentiment.
However,  emerging  markets,  India  in

particular,  recorded  gains  during  the  third
quarter  due  to  strong  portfolio  flows  and
robust  economic  and  corporate  earnings
growth.

The  annual  return  on  a  point-to-point
basis  was  the  highest  for  HERMES  index  of
Egypt  (56.3  per  cent)  followed  by  JCI  of
Indonesia  (33.7  per  cent)  and  IBOV  of  Brazil
(33.1 per cent) (Chart 2.4). India’s index return
was  the  fourth  highest  in  the  world.  All  the
advanced  equity  markets  recorded  decline
during  2007-08,  except  Hong  Kong.  The
decline  was  the  highest  for  NIKKEI  index  of
Japan  (27.6  per  cent)  followed  by  CAC  40
index  of  France  (16.5  per  cent)  and  IGBC
index of Colombia (16.0 per cent).

II. Performance of Sectoral Indices

indices 

recorded 

For  the  major  part  of  2007-08,  the
sectoral 
buoyant
performance. Among the broad-based indices
of BSE, BSE 100 recorded rise of 25.0 per cent,
BSE 200 (24.1 per cent) and BSE 500 (24.3 per
cent)  over  the  previous  year  (Chart  2.5).
Among the indices of NSE, the S&P CNX 500
and  CNX  Mid-cap  gained  by  21.6  per  cent
and  28.7  per  cent,  respectively  in  2007-08
(Table  2.8).

The  BSE  Small-cap  index  recorded  a
gain  of  21.2  per  cent  in  2007-08.  Among  the
sectoral  indices,  the  highest  gain  was
recorded  by  BSE  Metal  index  (65.2  per  cent),
BSE  Oil  and  Gas  index  (56.1  per  cent)  and
BSE  Capital  Goods  index  (54.4  per  cent)
(Table  2.8  and  2.9  ).  The  rise  in  BSE  Metal
index  reflected  sharp  rise  in  metal  prices  on
account of commodity boom worldwide. BSE
Oil index rose sharply on account of spiraling
oil  prices.  The  only  indices  which  witnessed
a decline were BSE Teck index (14.3 per cent)
and  BSE  Auto  index  (7.1  per  cent).  The
decline  in  technology  indices  was  mainly  on
account  of  appreciation  in  rupee  vis-a  vis-
dollar which affected the revenue of IT sector
in rupee terms.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

The movement of sectoral indices at NSE
is  depicted  in  Chart  2.6.  During  2007-08  ,the
highest  rise  was  witnessed  in  S&P  CNX
Finance (60.1 per cent), followed by S&P CNX
Petrochemicals (45.3 per cent),CNX PSE (31.8
per cent) and CNX Bank (25.4 per cent). CNX
IT  index  saw  a  decline  of  28.5  per  cent  in
2007-08.

III. Turnover in Indian Stock Market

There has been a spurt in the growth of
trading  volumes  in  stock  exchanges  since
2005-06. During 2007-08, turnover of all stock
exchanges  in  the  cash  segment  rose  by  76.7
per  cent  to  Rs.  51,30,816  crore  compared  to
Rs.  29,03,057   crore  in  2006-07  (Table  2.10).
BSE and NSE together contributed more than
99 per cent of the turnover, and of which NSE
accounted  for  69.2  per  cent  in  the  total
turnover in cash market. Apart from NSE and
BSE,  the  only  two  stock  exchanges  which
recorded  turnover  during  2007-08  were
Kolkata  Stock  Exchange  and  UPSE.  There

was  hardly  any  transaction  on  other  stock
exchanges.  Growth  in  turnover  at  BSE  and
NSE  was  phenomenal  in  2007-08  as  it  rose
by  65.1  per  cent  and  82.5  per  cent,
respectively  over  the  previous  year.  Month-
wise,  BSE  and  NSE  recorded  the  highest
turnover in October 2007 followed by January
2008 and November 2007 (Table 2.11).

The rise in the volumes in NSE and BSE
has  augmented  their  positions  in  the  global
scenario.  As  per  the  data  released  by  World
Federation  of  Exchanges  (WFE),  NSE  was
ranked  third  and  BSE  was  ranked  sixth  in
the  world  in  terms  of  the  number  of  trades
in  equity  shares.  In  terms  of  the  value  of
shares  traded,  NSE  was  ranked  17th  in  the
world for the calendar year 2007.

City-wise distribution of the turnover of
NSE  and  BSE  indicates  the  geographical
spread  of  the  securities  market  in  India.  Of
the  top  ten  cities,  Mumbai/Thane  accounted
for 23.4 per cent and 39.9 per cent of the total

capitalisation was 35.3 per cent for CNX Mid-
cap  and  53.0  per  cent  for  CNX  Bank.  The
CNX IT index and S&P CNX Pharmaceuticals
index  however,  witnessed  decline  in  market
capitalisation  by  23.3  per  cent  and  3.5  per
cent,  respectively.

V. Stock Market Indicators

The  market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio
is  an  important  indicator  of  stock  market
development.  Also,  liquidity  of  the  market
can  be  measured  by  the  traded  value  ratio,
i.e.,  value  of  the  shares  traded  to  GDP  at
current  market  prices.  The  market
capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio  has  increased
substantially during the last five years at BSE

and  NSE.  The  BSE  market  capitalisation  to
GDP  ratio  increased  from  23.3  per  cent  in
2002-03  to  85.5  per  cent  in  2006-07  and
further  to  109.0  per  cent  in  2007-08  (Table
2.15).  Similarly,  the  market  capitalisation  to
GDP  ratio  at  NSE  also  increased  from  21.9
per  cent  in  2002-03  to  103.1  per  cent  in
2007-08.

The  phenomenal  increase  in  turnover
has also pushed up the traded value to GDP
ratio significantly in 2007-08. It rose from 70.0
per cent in 2006-07 to 108.9 per cent in 2007-
08.  The  rise  in  the  traded  value  ratio  of  the
derivatives  segment  was  more  impressive
which increased from 178.9 per cent in 2006-
07 to 282.9 per cent in 2007-08.

The  valuation  of  the  shares  could  be
gauged  from  the  price-earning  ratio.  In
contrast to the trend in the previous year, the
P/E ratios of the majority of indices witnessed

a  moderate  rise  in  2007-08.  India’s  P/E  ratio
was  one  of  the  highest  in  the  emerging
markets  in  2007-08  (Chart  2.7). At  the  end  of

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

S&P  CNX  Nifty  were  20.1  and  20.6,
respectively. Month-wise data indicate rise in
the  P/E  ratios  of  benchmark  indices  in  every
month in 2007-08, except in July 2007, August
2007,  January  2008  and  March  2008.  The  P/E
ratios of the indices viz., S&P CNX Nifty and
BSE  Sensex  were  the  fifth  and  sixth  highest
in the world, respectively.

In the developed markets, the NASDAQ
Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average
of the U.S. had the highest P/E ratios in 2007-
08.  In  emerging  markets,  SHCOMP  index  of
China and IGBC index of Colombia also had
higher  P/E  ratios  in  2007-08,  other  than  that
of Indian benchmark indices.

The  price  to  book  value  (P/B)  ratio  is
another  important  indicator  which  measures
the  returns  left  for  the  shareholders  after
providing  for  liabilities  of  a  company.  Thus,
the  P/B  ratio  shows  the  asset  quality  of
companies  pertaining  to  that  sector.  The  P/B

ratio  was  the  highest  for  the  CNX  IT  index
at  6.17,  followed  by  the  benchmark  indices,
BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  at  5.18  and
5.09, respectively (Table 2.17).

VI. Volatility in Stock Markets

Based  on  the  upward  and  downward
movement in the stock prices, the annualised
volatility  of  BSE  Sensex,  measured  by
standard  deviation  of  log  returns,  increased
to 30.6 per cent in 2007-08 from 27.6 per cent
in  the  previous  year.  Similar  trend  was  also
observed for S&P CNX Nifty, which recorded
annualised volatility of 32.1 per cent in 2007-
08 compared to 28.0 per cent in the previous
year. Month-wise, volatility in the benchmark
indices  was  the  highest  in  January  2008  and
March  2008,  coinciding  with  significant
correction  of  indices  during  those  months
(Table  2.18).  The  lowest  volatility  in  the
benchmark  indices  was  noticed  during  May
2007  and  June  2007.  In  case  of  the  BSE  Mid-

volatility was observed in January 2008.

An international comparison of volatility
in  stock  returns  indicates  that  emerging
markets  were  more  volatile  than  developed
markets during 2007-08 (Table 2.19 and Chart
2.8).  Indian  markets  were  the  third  most
volatile  in  the  world.  China  and  Hong  Kong
were  the  only  markets  which  were  more
volatile  than  India.  Among  the  developed
markets,  the  annualised  volatility  was  high
in  Hong  Kong  (34.7  per  cent)  followed  by
Japan  (24.5  per  cent)  and  Australia  (22.3  per
cent).  Apart  from  India  and  China,  among
the  emerging  markets,  annualised  volatility
was  higher  for  Brazil  (29.3  per  cent),
Indonesia  (28.2  per  cent)  and  Russia  (27.9
per cent).

number of shares traded in BSE was 3,166 as
compared to 3,097 in 2006-07 (Table 2.20). On
the other hand, the average number of shares
traded  in  NSE  were  1,266  in  2007-08
compared  to  1,121  in  2006-07.  The  number
of  shares  traded  above  100  days  also
improved  in  both  the  stock  exchanges  which
reflected  a  rise  in  frequently  traded  stocks.
In  percentage  terms,  about  90.6  per  cent  of
the  shares  were  traded  for  more  than  100
days  at  BSE  compared  to  86.3  per  cent  in
2006-07. Similarly, in NSE too, the percentage
of shares traded increased from 87.5 per cent
in  2006-07  to  93.0  per  cent  in  2007-08.  The
percentage  share  of  stocks  traded  for  less
than 10 days was 3.3 per cent at BSE and 0.6
per cent at NSE in 2007-08.

However, 
turnover  by  all
subsidiaries  (cash  and  derivatives  taken
together) constituted 1.4 per cent of the gross
turnover  of  all  exchanges  in  2007-08
compared to 1.9 per cent in the previous year.
In  absolute  terms,  the  highest  turnover  was
recorded  by  LSE  Securities  Ltd.,  the
subsidiary  of  Ludhiana  stock  exchange  and
VSE  Stock  Services  Ltd.,  a  subsidiary  of
Vadodara Stock Exchange. On a year-on-year
basis, growth in turnover was the highest for
Cochin  Stock  Brokers  Ltd.,  which  recorded
rise of 71.5 per cent.

Among all the exchanges, NSE has the
largest number of brokers followed by BSE,
Calcutta and ISE in 2007-08 (Table 2.23). The
number of brokers witnessed a rise in BSE,
NSE, Ahmedabad, Calcutta and Cochin. On
the other hand, there was a decline in the total
number of brokers at six stock exchanges viz.,
UPSE, OTCEI, Madras stock exchange, Jaipur
stock exchange, ISE and Bhubaneswar stock
exchange. Active brokers as percentage to the
total brokers were very less in most of the
regional stock exchanges. The active brokers
were  nil  in  case  of  nine  regional  stock
exchanges. There had been concentration and
consolidation of the broking industry around
BSE and NSE. In fact, at NSE and BSE, the
active  brokers  as  percentage  to  the  total
brokers were 88.6 per cent and 78.8 per cent,
respectively in 2007-08.

IX. Dematerialisation

To improve operational efficiency of the
Indian  stock  markets,  dematerialisation  was
introduced  in  the  securities  markets  in  1996.
Dematerialisation  signifies  conversion  of
share  certificates  from  its  physical  form  to
equivalent  number  of  securities  in  electronic
form.  Two  depositories  in  India,  viz.,
National  Securities  Depository  Limited
(NSDL)  and  Central  Depository  Services
Limited  (CDSL)  have  set  up  nation-wide
network  with  proper  infrastructure  that

64

handles  the  securities  held  and  settled  in
dematerialised  mode  in  the  Indian  stock
markets.  The  two  depositories  have  put  in
place, state of the art technology and advance
computing,  security  and  storage  systems
which  manage  enormous  database  of
transactions  in  securities.  Concerns  relating
to loss, misplacement, theft and damage etc.,
of  share  certificates  have  disappeared.
Elimination of risk of bad delivery and faster
transfer  of  shares  have  improved  the  overall
efficiency of stock market transactions.

The number of companies signed up for
dematerialisation  in  NSDL  rose  to  7,354  in
2007-08  from  6,483  in  2006-07  (Table  2.24A).
In  CDSL,  the  number  of  companies  signed
up  increased  from  5,589  in  2006-07  to  5,943
in  2007-08.  Similarly,  the  number  of
dematerialised  shares  in  NSDL  went  up  by
16.9 per cent to 23,68,970 lakh in 2007-08 from
20,27,013  lakh  in  2006-07.  In  CDSL  too,  the
number  of  shares  dematerialised  rose
significantly by 59.4 per cent to 4,98,200 lakh
in  2007-08  from  3,12,500  lakh  in  2006-07.  In
both the depositories, there was a substantial
increase  in  the  value  of  shares  settled  in
dematerialised  mode.  While  in  NSDL,  the
total  value  of  demat  settled  shares  rose
substantially by 71.1 per cent to Rs. 14,20,717
crore  in  2007-08  from  Rs.  8,30,513  crore  in
2006-07  ,  the  same  in  CDSL  rose  by  94.5  per
cent  from  Rs.  1,97,050  crore  in  2006-07  to
Rs. 3,83,179 crore in 2007-08.

Apart from the shares, dematerialisation
trend  continued  in  other  instruments  like
commercial  papers  and  bonds.  The  total
dematerialised  value  of  the  commercial
papers at CDSL declined in 2007-08 to Rs.980
crore  from  Rs.1,020  crore  in  2006-07  (Table
2.25).  However,  demat  value  of  commercial
papers  increased  at  NSDL  from  Rs.20,293
crore  in  2006-07  to  Rs.37,507  crore  in  2007-
08.  There  was  a  considerable  increase  in  the
value  of  bonds  dematerialised  at  NSDL  and
CDSL in 2007-08 over 2006-07.

X. Derivatives Market in India

A. Trends in Derivative Market

Introduction  of  exchange 

traded
derivatives 
is  one  of  the  significant
developments  in  the  history  of  India’s
securities market. In India, derivatives trading
began  with  the  launch  of  index  futures  in
June  2000  followed  by  index  options,  single
stock options and single stock futures in 2001.
Interest  rate  futures  were  also  launched  in
June 2003. The two premier stock exchanges,
namely  NSE  and  BSE  provide  trading
platforms  for  derivative.

Over  the  years,  turnover  on  the
derivative market has grown exponentially in
terms  of  the  number  of  contracts  and  value.
This  trend  continued  in  2007-08  too.
Presently,  the  derivatives  market  in  India  is
dominated  by  NSE  with  its  share  of  over  98
per  cent  in  the  total  turnover  as  well  as
number  of  contracts.  There  had  been  revival
of  derivatives  trading  at  BSE  since  2006-07,
which continued in 2007-08 also.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

The  total  turnover  in  the  derivative
segments  surpassed  the  combined  turnover
in  the  cash  segment  of  both  BSE  and  NSE
since early 2004. During 2007-08, the turnover
of derivatives market was higher by 259.9 per
cent  of  the  combined  cash  market  turnover
of BSE and NSE (Chart 2.9).

increase 

There  was  a  steady 

in
derivatives  turnover  during  2007-08,  except
marginal fall in few months (Table 2.27). The
highest  turnover  was  recorded  in  October
2007,  when  the  percentage  rise  in  the
turnover  over  the  previous  month  was  69.7
per  cent.  This  was  followed  by  November
2007  and  January  2008  when  the  monthly
turnover  growth  rate  was  25.6  per  cent  and
17.2  per  cent,  respectively.  The  average  daily
turnover  in  the  derivative  segment  has  also
risen  significantly  during  the  recent  years.
The  average  daily  turnover  in  2007-08  rose
by 78.4 per cent to Rs. 53,119 crore compared
to  Rs.29,780  crore  in  2006-07.  Open  interest
increased by 26.5 per cent to Rs. 48,974 crore

67

Annual Report 2007-08

at the end of 2007-08 compared to Rs. 38,723
crore a year ago.

The  total  number  of  contracts  traded  in
the  derivative  segment  of  NSE  rose  by  96.0
per  cent  to  42,50,13,200  in  2007-08  from
21,68,83,573  in  2006-07  whereas  at  BSE,  the
number of contracts traded rose by 318.4 per
cent to 74,53,371 in 2007-08 from 17,81,220 in
2006-07.  The  value  of  the  contracts  traded  in
the  derivative  segment  of  NSE  increased  by
77.9 per cent to Rs. 1,30,90,478 crore in 2007-
08  from  Rs.  73,56,271  crore  in  2006-07,
whereas  the  turnover  at  the  derivatives

segment  of  BSE  rose  by  310.6  per  cent  to
Rs.2,42,309  crore  in  2007-08  from  Rs.59,007
crore in 2006-07.

Product-wise  share  in  the  turnover  of
the derivatives segment of NSE indicates that
futures  are  more  popular  than  options  in
India  (Table  2.28). About  57.7  per  cent  of  the
total derivatives turnover was contributed by
the  single  stock  futures,  followed  by  index
futures (29.2 per cent) in 2007-08 (Chart 2.10).
The  share  of  index  options  stood  at  10.4  per
cent  and  stock  options  2.7  per  cent.  Month-
wise trend shows that there has been a steady

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

increase  in  the  share  of  index  futures  in  the
last quarter of the year. In March 2008, share
of  index  futures  in  the  total  turnover
surpassed  that  of  single  stock  futures  for  the
first time.

Though in the developed markets, stock
options  are  the  single  largest  trading
instrument,  in  India,  single  stock  futures
continued  to  remain  the  most  popular
derivative product. In fact, NSE continued to
remain  the  largest  market  for  single  stock
futures in the world.

As indicated earlier, the open interest in
the  derivative  segment  rose  significantly  by
26.5 per cent to Rs. 48,974 crore at the end of
2007-08  from  Rs.  38,723  crore  at  the  end  of
March  2007.  Product-wise  share  in  the  open
interest  shows  that  the  notional  value  of
outstanding  contracts  was  the  highest  for
single  stock  futures  (Rs.21,143  crore),
followed  by  index  futures  (Rs.15,557  crore),
index  options  (Rs.11,636  crore)  and  stock

options (Rs.636 crore). The tables 2.29 to 2.32
show  the  product-wise  trends  in  the
derivative  market  in  India  during  the  recent
years.

B. Membership  of  Derivatives  Segment

There  was  a  significant  rise 

in
registration  of  various  types  of  membership
for  derivative  segment  at  NSE.  The  number
of members increased to 964 as on March 31,
2008  from  882  in  the  previous  year  (Table
2.33). Out of the total, there were 510 trading
members  at  the  end  of  2007-08  compared  to
491 a year ago. There were 198 trading-cum-
clearing  members  and  237  trading-cum-self
clearing  members  at  NSE  as  on  March  31,
2008.  At  BSE,  there  were  298  trading
members  and  99  trading-cum-clearing
members at the end of March 2008.

The transactions undertaken by trading-
cum-clearing  members  constituted  57.6  per
cent of the total turnover of the F&O segment

capture  all  information  related  to  trading  in
corporate  bonds  as  accurately  and  as  close
to  execution  as  possible.  The  platforms  were
put in place since January 01, 2007 and March
01,  2007,  by  BSE  and  NSE,  respectively.  In
addition  to  the  existing  reporting  platforms
being  operated  by  BSE  and  NSE,  SEBI
granted  approval  to  FIMMDA  for  starting  a
similar  corporate  bond  trade  reporting
platform.  The  platform  subsequently  became
operational  in  September  2007.

During 2007-08, secondary market trades
(both OTC and exchanges) stood at Rs.96,119
crore  (Table  2.35).  The  amount  of  trade
reported to BSE were the highest at Rs.41,187
crore.  The  number  of  trades  reported  was
also  the  highest  at  BSE,  which  constituted

77.9  per  cent  of  the  total  number  of  trades.
Of  the  three  platforms,  the  number  of
corporate  bond  trades  and  value  of  trade
reported were the lowest at NSE.

Although there were no public issues of
bonds  in  2007-08,  corporate  sector  mobilised
large  amount  of  resources  by  way  of  private
placements  of  corporate  bonds.

During  2007-08,  issuances  of  corporate
bonds  through  private  placement  stood  at
Rs.1,28,602  crore  as  reported  at  BSE  &  NSE
(Table 2.36). On a year on year basis, the total
amount  reported  increased  by  22.5  per  cent.
Of  the  two  exchanges,  amount  of  private
placement  reported  to  NSE  constituted  76.7
per cent.

Indian Wholesale Debt Market
(WDM)

The  number  of  trades  in  the  WDM
segment  of  NSE  has  been  witnessing  a
decline since 2004-05. In 2007-08, the number
of  trades  declined  by  17.3  per  cent  over  the
previous year. However, the net traded value
and  average  daily  traded  value  increased  by
28.9  per  cent  and  25.6  per  cent,  respectively
during the same period (Table 2.37).

The  highest  turnover  was  recorded
during  January  2008  at  Rs.  42,724  crore.  The
trend  in  the  number  of  trades  in  the  WDM
segment was similar to that of the net traded
value.  The  average  traded  value  increased
from Rs. 899 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.1,129 crore
in  2007-08.

Instrument-wise  break  up  of  the
securities  traded  at  the  WDM  segment  of
NSE indicates the dominance of Government
securities  (G-sec)  though  the  share  of  the
G-sec in the traded value declined marginally
to 68.8 per cent in 2007-08 from 70.0 per cent

Trading  members  dominated  the  WDM
segment with a share of 38.2 per cent in total
turnover  in  2007-08  as  compared  to  30.9  per
cent  in  2006-07  (Table  2.39).  While  the  share
of  foreign  banks  improved  to  27.1  per  cent
in  2007-08,  that  of  Indian  banks,  financial

4. MUTUAL  FUNDS

important  class  of 

The  mutual  funds  have  emerged  as  one
of 
the 
financial
intermediaries  which  generally  cater  to  the
investment  needs  of  retail  investors.  Mutual
funds  pool  savings  of  households  and  other
investors  and  invest  in  different  instruments
such  as  shares,  bonds,  debentures  and  other
securities.

Over the years, resource mobilisation by
mutual  funds  has  grown  significantly  higher
which reflect investor confidence in them and
they  provide  opportunities  of  investment  in
a  diversified  portfolio  managed  by
professional  fund  managers.  The  gross
mobilisation of resources by all mutual funds
during  2007-08  stood  at  Rs.  44,64,376  crore

compared  to  Rs.  19,38,493  crore  during  the
previous  year  indicating  an  increase  of  130.3
per  cent  over  the  previous  year  (Table  2.40).
Redemption  also  rose  by  133.7  per  cent  to
Rs.  43,10,575  crore 
in  2007-08  from
Rs. 18,44,508  crore  in  2006-07.  The  net
mobilisation of resources by all mutual funds
was  Rs.  1,53,802  crore  in  2007-08  compared
to  Rs.93,985  crore  in  2006-07,  a  rise  of  63.6
per  cent.  The  assets  under  management  by
all  mutual  funds  increased  by  54.8  per  cent
to Rs. 5,05,152 crore at the end of March 2008
from  Rs.  3,26,292  crore  over  the  previous
year.

The  private  sector  mutual  funds,  as  in
the  previous  years,  continued  to  dominate
resource  mobilisation  efforts  during  2007-08.

Scheme-wise  pattern  reveals 

the
domination of income/debt oriented schemes
in  total  resource  mobilisation  during  2007-08
(Table  2.42).  The  net  amount  mobilised  by
income  /  debt  oriented  schemes  was
Rs.1,03,867  crore  which  constituted  67.5  per
cent  of  the  total  net  mobilisation.  Within  the
income/debt  oriented  schemes,  the  highest
share  was  contributed  by  debt  oriented
schemes followed by money market schemes.
However,  the  gross  mobilisation  and  gross

redemption  were  substantially  higher  for
liquid/money  market  schemes  than  other
schemes. In consistence with buoyancy in the
stock  market,  the  net  inflow  of  funds  was
higher  for  growth/  equity  oriented  schemes
at  Rs.46,933  crore  in  2007-08  compared  to
Rs.28,206  core  in  2006-07,  a  rise  of  66.4  per
cent.

There were 956 mutual fund schemes as
on  March  31,  2008,  of  which,  593  were
income/debt  oriented  schemes,  313  were

78

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

growth/equity oriented schemes and 37 were
balanced  schemes  (Table  2.43).  In  addition,
there  were  13  Exchange  Traded  Funds,  of
which five were GETFs. Among the different
mutual  fund  schemes,  open-ended  schemes
appeared  to  be  the  most  preferred  choice  of
investors  in  India.  There  were  592  open-
ended schemes and 364 close-ended schemes
as on March 31, 2008. Of the 364 close ended
schemes, 296 were debt oriented schemes, 62
were  growth/equity  oriented  schemes  and  6
balanced  schemes.

  The  total  assets  under  management
(AUM)  of  all  the  mutual  funds  rose
substantially  by  54.8  per  cent  to  Rs.  5,05,152
crore  at  the  end  of  March  31,  2008  from
Rs.3,26,292  crore  a  year  ago.  There  was  a
significant  rise  in  the  assets  managed  by  all
categories  of  schemes  in  2007-08.  The  AUM

was  the  highest  for  income/debt  oriented
schemes at Rs. 3,12,997 crore while the AUM
under  growth  /  equity  oriented  scheme  was
Rs.  1,72,742  crore.  In  terms  of  growth  in
AUM,  balanced  schemes  (78.7  per  cent)
achieved  the  highest  increase  followed  by
income/debt oriented schemes (61.7 per cent)
and  growth/equity  oriented  (39.8  per  cent)
schemes during the year.

The  mutual  funds  have  been  the  major
investors  in  the  debt  segment  of  the  Indian
securities  market.  However  since  2005-06,
there  has  been  an  increasing  trend  in  their
participation  in  the  equity  segment.  During
2007-08, the combined net investments by the
mutual  funds  in  debt  and  equity  was  Rs.
90,095  core  compared  to  Rs.61,606  crore  in
2006-07,  an  increase  of  46.2  per  cent  (Table
2.44).  The  net  investments  in  the  equity

FOREIGN  INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTMENT

Emerging  markets  in  general  and  India
in  particular,  have  attracted  huge  portfolio
flows  in  recent  years.  India  has  become  an
attractive  destination  for  FIIs  among  the
emerging  markets  since  1992-93.  During  last
three  years  in  particular,  there  has  been  a

continuous  increase  in  the  investments  by
FIIs  in  the  Indian  securities  market.
Notwithstanding the signs of global recession
and  sub-prime  crisis,  India  attracted  a
sizeable  investment  from  FIIs  in  2007-08  as
well.

The  gross  purchases  of  debt  and  equity
by  FIIs  increased  by  82.1  per  cent  to  Rs.
9,48,020  crore  in  2007-08  from  Rs.  5,20,508
crore  in  2006-07  (Table  2.45).  The  combined
gross  sales  by  FIIs  also  rose  by  80.1  per  cent
to  Rs.  8,81,842  crore  from  Rs.  4,89,667  crore
during  the  same  period.  The  net  investment
by FIIs was Rs. 66,179 crore in 2007-08 which
was  more  than  double  from  Rs.  30,840  crore
in 2006-07. The cumulative investment by FIIs

billion at the end of March 2007, rose to USD
68.0  billion  at  the  end  of  March  2008  (Chart
2.11).

There  has  been  a  significant  increase  in
investment  by  FIIs  in  equity  since  2003-04.
The  total  net  foreign  institutional  investment
in  2007-08  has  been  the  highest  in  a  single
year  so  far.  Investment  by  FIIs  in  the  equity
segment  rose  by  111.6  per  cent  to  Rs.53,404
crore in 2007-08 from Rs.25,236 crore in 2006-
07. Their net investment in the debt segment
at Rs.12,775 crore was also higher by 128 per
cent  over  Rs.5,605  crore  in  the  previous  year
(Table  2.46).

Month-wise,  the  net  FII  investment  in
equity segment in July 2007 (Rs.23,872 crore)

which  is  also  the  highest  ever  in  a  single
month  so  far.  FII  inflows  were  particularly
strong in the second and third quarter of the
year,  pushing  the  benchmark  indices  to
breach  new  levels  (Chart  2.12).  In  January
2008,  the  outflow  from  the  equity  segment
was the highest at Rs.13,036 crore.

The  FIIs  were  permitted  to  trade  in  the
derivatives  market  since  February  2002.  The
cumulative FII trading in derivatives was Rs.
2,91,456  crore  as  on  March  31,  2008.
Reversing  the  existing  trend,  open  interest
position  of  FIIs  in  index  futures  was  the
highest  at  44.0  per  cent  by  end-March  2008,
followed by stock futures (43.2 per cent). The
share  in  index  options  was  13.1  per  cent
while the lowest trading was in stock options
(0.2 per cent) (Table 2.47).
