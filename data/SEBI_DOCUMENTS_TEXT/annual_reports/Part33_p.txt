PART THREE: REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKET

Annual Report 2004-05

This part of the Report delineates the functions of SEBI as specified in

Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992.

1. PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET

Intermediaries  play  an  important  role  in
the capital market in channelising the financial
resources from savers to investors. The role
of  professionally  managed  market
intermediaries  is  exceedingly  important  for
business  development  and  growth  of  capital
market.  The  market  requires  services  of  a
variety  of  intermediaries  like  merchant
bankers,  bankers  to  issues,  brokers,
debenture trustees, etc., to bring the suppliers
and  users  of  funds  together  for  mutual
benefits.

During 2004-05, there was a significant
increase  in  the  number  of  various  classes
of  intermediaries  registered  with  SEBI
such  as  registrar  to  an  issue  and  share
transfer  agents,  bankers  to  an  issue,
debenture trustees, portfolio managers, under-
writers  and  merchant  bankers  (Table  3.1).
Dematerialisation activities witnessed a surge
with the number of DPs increasing at CDSL.
However,  number  of  depository  participants
marginally  declined  to  210  in  2004-05  from

216  in  2003-04  at  NSDL.  The  number  of
credit rating agencies remained same at 4 in
2004-05. There was 40 per cent increase in
the  category  of  portfolio  managers  as  their
number  increased  from  60  in  2003-04  to  84
in  2004-05.  The  rise  in  all  categories  of
intermediaries, except credit rating agencies,
was  attributed  to  good  performance  of  the
securities market and the overall demand by
the investors for different types of services in
2004-05.

2. SECONDARY SECURITIES

MARKET

I.

Registration of Brokers
The  Indian  broking  industry  has
undergone  structural  changes  during  the
recent  years.  Greater  emphasis  has  been
given on consolidation and restructuring in the
broking  segment.  During  2004-05,  239  new
brokers were registered with SEBI (Table 3.2).
The number of reconciliations/ cancellations/
surrender  of  memberships  during  2004-05
was  479,  higher  than  that  of  292  in  the

Annual Report 2004-05

National  Stock  Exchange  (NSE)  has  the
highest  number  of  brokers  at  976  in  2004-
05, followed by the Calcutta Stock Exchange
(962)  and  OTCEI  (801).  Out  of  the  total
brokers  in  NSE,  89.86  per  cent  were
corporate  brokers.  The  shares  of  corporate
brokers  at  OTCEI  and  BSE  were  76.90  per
cent and 73.55 per cent, respectively in 2004-
05.  On  an  all-India  basis,  the  corporate
brokers constituted 41.33 per cent of the total
brokers  in  2004-05  as  compared  with  40.43
per cent in 2003-04.

Brokers  are  divided  into  five  categories
viz.,  proprietary,  partnership,  corporate,
institutions  and  composite  corporate.
However,  as  the  registrations  of  broking
entities  under  categories  of  institutions  and
composite corporate are negligible during the
recent  years,  these  categories  have  been
clubbed together as corporate. The details of
the exchange-wise stock brokers on the basis
of ownership are provided in Table 3.4. In the
old  exchanges,  most  of  the  brokers  were
proprietary  in  nature,  whereas  in  the  new
exchanges,  they  were  corporate  members
(Charts  3.1  and  3.2).  The  proprietary
membership was the highest in Calcutta Stock
Exchange at 14.0 per cent of the total brokers
relating  to  the  same  category.  It  was  the
lowest  for  NSE  wherein  0.9  per  cent  of  the
brokers  belonged  to  the  proprietorship

category.  The  percentage  of  brokers  in  the
partnership category was the highest in NSE
(18.5  per  cent)  in  2004-05.  There  were  no
brokers  in  the  partnership  category  in
Bhubaneshwar  Stock  Exchange  and
Coimbatore  Stock  Exchange.  Of  the  total
brokers  in  corporate  category,  23.2  per  cent
belonged  to  NSE,  followed  by  OTCEI  (16.3
per cent) and BSE (14.1 per cent) (Chart 3.3).

Prior  to  screen  based  trading  and  the
spread of trading network across the country,
brokers  in  some  of  the  exchanges  acquired
membership  in  more  than  one  exchange
(multiple  membership)  to  expand  their
business and serve clients spread across the
country. With the introduction of screen-based
trading and expansion of networking to most
cities  and  towns  of  the  country,  the  concept
of  multiple  membership  has  become  less
prevalent although it persists today.

Table  3.5  presents  details  of  multiple
memberships  which  range  from  two  to  six.
The density of multiple members falls rapidly
with  rise  in  the  number  of  multiple
membership.  The  multiple  membership  with
two broking cards declined from 798 in 2003-
04 to 597 in 2004-05. However, the multiple
membership with three broking cards rose by
51.7  per  cent  to  91  in  2004-05  from  60  in
2003-04.

II. Registration of Sub-brokers

The role of sub-brokers is important from
the  point  of  view  of  spread  of  broking
business.  They  help  the  geographical  reach
of  broking  entities  to  the  investors  in  the
country.  In  hectic  market  conditions,
sometimes  brokers  may  not  be  able  to

entertain  all  small  investors  and  in  such  a
situation,  the  sub-brokers  help  the  investors
to  buy  and  sell  shares.  The  total  number  of
sub-brokers in all the exchanges in India was
13,684  during  2004-05  as  against  12,815  in
2003-04,  an  increase  of  6.8  per  cent  (Table
3.6). The two major exchanges, namely BSE
and NSE together accounted for 89.5 per cent
of the total sub-brokers.

III. Recognition of Stock Exchanges

The  stock  exchanges  are  granted
recognition  by  SEBI  under  Section  4  of
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956.
There  are  twenty  two1   stock  exchanges
recognised  under  Securities  Contracts
(Regulation) Act, 1956. Eight stock exchanges
have  been  granted  permanent  recognition,
three  were  granted  a  tenure  period  renewal
and remaining exchanges have been granted
yearly  renewal.  During  2004-05,  SEBI  has

1 The application for renewal of recognition of Mangalore Stock Exchange was refused vide Order dated August
31, 2004 under Section 4(4) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. The matter is sub-judice as on

IV. Corporate Restructuring:

Substantial Acquisition of Shares
and Takeovers
In recent years, mergers and acquisitions
have  emerged  as  a  natural  process  of
business  restructuring  all  over  the  world.
Since  the  introduction  of  economic  reforms
in  1991,  Indian  industries  were  exposed  to
both  domestic  and  international  competition.
They had started restructuring their operations
around their core business activities through
acquisition and takeovers. Some may attempt
to  concentrate  their  holdings  in  target
companies in a bid for takeover in future. In
these circumstances, the investors should get
a  justified  exit  route  and  fair  price  amid
takeover campaigns by corporates. This has
been  ensured  by  SEBI  (Substantial
Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)
Regulations.  In  response  to  regulations  and
corporate  developments,  60  public  offers
opened during the year. During 2004-05, 212
reports  were  filed  under  the  category  of
transactions  that  qualify  for  exemption  from
open offer obligations. The transactions, which
are not covered under the said category, are
required  to  be  submitted  to  the  Takeover
Panel  for  exemption  from  open  offer.
Accordingly,  38  such  applications  were
forwarded by SEBI to the Takeover Panel for
their  consideration,  out  of  which  exemptions
from  making  open  offers  were  granted  in
respect of 17 cases (Table 3.9).

V. Registration of Foreign

Institutional Investors
The  foreign  institutional  investors  (FIIs)
played  a  crucial  role  in  sustaining  buoyancy
in  the  securities  market  through  portfolio
investments.  The  processing  of  FII
registrations  has  been  streamlined  and
expedited. Commensurate with record portfolio
investment by the FIIs, the new registration of
FIIs  and  sub-accounts  went  up  significantly
during  the  year.  Notable  among  them  were
the UN Pension Fund, CalPERS, Tennessee
Valley  Authority  (TVA),  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment
Trust etc. As on March 31, 2005, the number
of  FII  entities  registered  with  SEBI  stood  at
685  and  the  sub-accounts  at  1,889.  As  on
March 31, 2004, there were 540 FIIs and 1,542
sub-accounts  registered  with  SEBI.  Thus,
there  was  a  27  per  cent  increase  in  FII
registrations  and  22  per  cent  rise  in  the
number of sub-accounts in 2004-05.

VI. Registration of Custodians of

Securities
The 

total  number  of  custodians
registered  with  SEBI  as  on  March  31,  2005
stood  at  11,  same  as  during  last  two  years.
This indicates that there is sufficient coverage
of market by the existing custodians.

VII. Registration of Collective

Investment Schemes
Subsequent  to  the  notification  of  the
SEBI  (Collective  Investment  Schemes)
Regulations,  1999,  so  far,  no  CIS  entity  is
registered with SEBI. Action taken against CIS
entities are indicated under enforcement.

VIII. Registration of Mutual Funds

Mutual funds have acquired the position
of  major  institutional  investors  in  the  capital
market. They mobilise funds through various
schemes  such  as  income  schemes,  growth
schemes,  income  and  growth  schemes,  tax

saving schemes etc. There has been intense
competition  among  mutual  funds.  Many
innovative schemes were introduced by new
as well as old mutual funds in the country.

The mutual funds are the common man’s
vehicle to stock market. Denominated in small
units,  it  is  a  viable  alternative  for  small  and
retail investors who route their corpus through
various schemes offered by the mutual funds.
Prudential allocation of funds into equity and
debt oriented schemes determines returns to
the unit holders. As on March 31, 2005, there
were  39  mutual  funds  registered  with  SEBI
of  which  31  belonged  to  the  private  sector
and  8  (including  the  UTI)  were  in  the  public
sector.  The  number  of  private  sector  mutual
funds  increased  by  2  to  31  in  2004-05  from
29 in 2003-04 (Table 3.10).

IX. Registration of Venture Capital

Funds

The development of venture capital is of
paramount  importance  to  any  economy  in
terms  of  its  contribution  to  job  creation,
economic growth and technological progress.
Venture  capital  normally  takes  care  of  the
funding  needs  of  companies  which  do  not
have the requisite size, assets and necessary

Table 3.11: Venture Capital Funds

background  to  obtain  capital  from  more
traditional sources such as market and banks.
It is employed by entrepreneurial companies
that  use  unproven  technology  but  with  a
promising  future.  Equity  holdings  by  venture
funds  may  command  a  premium  when
divested  in  equity  markets.  Equity  markets
enable to provide an exit route for the venture
funds  that  extend  seed  capital  to  those
companies.  Although  the  venture  capital
industry is not developed in India, it has made
a humble beginning during the recent years.
The  number  of  indigenous  venture  capital
funds increased to 50 in 2004-05 from 45 in
2003-04.  There  was  also  an  addition  of  5
foreign  venture  capital  funds  in  2004-05
(Table 3.11).

X. Fees and Other Charges

As  per  the  regulatory  provisions,  SEBI
receives fees and certain charges on different
heads  from  the  market  intermediaries  for  its
services. Table 3.12 provides details regarding
fees and other charges collected during 2004-
05.  The  fees  received  by  SEBI  (unaudited)
increased by 93.3 per cent to Rs.169.9 crore
in 2004-05 over the previous year. Among all
intermediaries,  the  highest  fee  of  Rs.143.90
crore  was  collected  from  stock  brokers  and

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

 With 

the  objective 

to  ensure
independence of the governing board of
SRO,  the  regulations  stipulate  that
majority of directors shall be independent
directors;
The  regulations  entrust  SEBI  with  the
right to undertake inspection of the books
of  accounts,  other  records  and
documents  of  the  Self  Regulatory
Organisation;
The  Self  Regulatory  Organisation  shall
furnish  periodical  returns  relating  to  its
affairs to SEBI; and
In case of default, it is the obligation of
the Board of Directors to take disciplinary
action against a member.







sub-brokers.  Other  major  sources  of  fees
collected  were  from  the  FIIs  including  sub-
accounts  (Rs.6.99  crore)  and  derivatives
segment  (Rs.  5.24  crore).  In  terms  of
percentage, the highest increase in the fees
was  from  the  venture  capital  funds,  (about
345  per  cent).  The  recurring  revenues  rose
by 112.9 per cent to Rs. 154.74 crore in 2004-
05  as  compared  to  Rs.  72.67  crore  in  the
previous year.

3. SUPERVISION

Implementation of the regulations entails
a  multi-stage  process  of  supervision,
enforcement through initiation of adjudication
and  enquiry  against  violation  of  rules  and
regulations  and  prosecution.  Market
intermediaries at varied levels have distinctive
features  and  responsibilities.  Therefore,
supervision of different intermediaries requires
individual  approach  that  can  serve  a  useful
purpose.

I.

Promotion and Regulation of Self
Regulatory Organisations

the  objective 

SEBI  (Self  Regulatory  Organisations)
Regulations  were  notified  on  February  19,
2004  with 
to  promote
organisation of intermediaries representing a
particular segment of the securities market as
a  self  regulated  entity/  organisation.  Salient
features of the regulations are:







For  any  applicant  to  be  recognised  as
SRO, it should be a company registered
under Section 25 of Companies Act and
have  a  minimum  net  worth  of  Rs.  1
crore;
The company shall make an application
to  SEBI  in  the  prescribed  format  and
provide  a  copy  of  the  governing  norms
of  the  SRO  along  with  a  copy  of  the
memorandum and articles of association;
The  certificate  of  recognition  as  SRO
shall be valid for a period of five years;

For  recognition  of  organisation  of
intermediaries  as  SROs,  SEBI  has  held
discussions  with  various  bodies  like
Association of NSE Members of India (ANMI),
Registrars  Association  of  India  (RAIN)  and
further response from these bodies is awaited.

II. Development of Stock Exchanges
as Self Regulatory Organisations
Stock  exchanges  are  recognised  under
Section  4  of  the  Securities  Contracts
(Regulations)  Act,  1956.  These  exchanges
were recognised/set up over a period of time
to stimulate the growth of the capital market
by  channelising  the  savings  of  households
and  others.  These  exchanges  are  suitably
empowered by Section 9 of SC(R) Act, 1956
to make bye-laws for the conduct of business,
regulation and enforcement of contracts.

ii. The  provisions  of  the  SEBI  Act,  the
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act and
the  provisions  made  thereunder  are
being  complied  with  by  the  subsidiary;
and

iii. Provisions  of  the  bye-laws,  business

VI.

Illegal Trading Outside Stock
Exchanges
SEBI,  from  time  to  time,  receives
information  about  alleged  illegal  trading  in
securities by unregistered entities outside the
stock  exchanges.  Illegal  trading  is  a
cognisable  offence  under  section  19  of
Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956
within  the  meaning  of  Code  of  Criminal
Procedures  which  does  not  fall  within  the
regulatory  jurisdiction  of  SEBI.  Therefore,
SEBI  forwards  such  references  received  by
SEBI as well as press articles in this regard
to  Chief  Ministers  of  respective  States
requesting  them  to  look  into  the  matter  and
to  take  action  against  those  found  to  be
involved  in  the  illegal  trading  of  securities.
SEBI has also written letters to Chief Ministers
of  States  requesting  them  to  put  the  police
on  a  continuous  alert  and  to  take  suitable
action against any person/entity violating the
provisions of SC(R)A.

There  were  some  complaints  regarding
illegal  trading  outside  stock  exchanges  by
registered  entities  also.  On  receipt  of  such
complaints, concerned stock exchanges have
been asked to verify the complaints in order
to  ascertain  the  veracity  of  the  allegations,
and to take appropriate action.

During  the  year,  SEBI,  in  co-ordination
with  the  respective  stock  exchanges  carried
out  eight  surprise  inspections  of  the
intermediaries  and  appropriate  enforcement
action is being taken against the violators.

VII. Inspection of Depositories

A  special  inspection  of  National
Securities  Depositories  Limited  was  carried
out during 2004-05.

VIII. Systems Audit

Trading, settlement and risk management
systems  of  stock  exchanges  are  almost
completely automated. For this reason, it
becomes very important that the systems do
not have deficiencies which can impair their
efficacy. It also becomes important to ensure
that  the  stock  exchanges  have  suitable
Disaster  Recovery  Sites  and  Business
Continuity Plans and that the systems are
adequately secure. Active stock exchanges
have been asked to carry out systems audit
through external agencies competent to carry
out systems audit exercise. SEBI does follow-
up for rectification of deficiencies pointed out in
the systems audit reports. In 2004-05 too, such
follow-up was done through off-site analysis of
compliance reports from stock exchanges and
meetings with the senior management of stock
exchanges.

4. SURVEILLANCE

I. Market Surveillance Mechanism

In order to ensure investor protection and
to safeguard the integrity of the markets, it is
imperative  to  have  in  place  an  effective
market  surveillance  mechanism.  The
surveillance function is an extremely vital link
in  the  chain  of  activities  performed  by  the
regulatory  agency  for  fulfilling  its  avowed
mission of protection of investor interest and
development  and  regulation  of  capital
markets. The surveillance system adopted by
SEBI  is  two  pronged  viz.,  Surveillance  Cell
in  the  stock  exchange  and  the  Integrated
Surveillance Department in SEBI.

The  stock  exchanges  are  the  primary
regulators 
for  detection  of  market
manipulation,  price  rigging  and  other
regulatory breaches regarding capital market
functioning.  This  is  accomplished  through
Surveillance  Cell  in  the  stock  exchanges.
SEBI keeps constant vigil on the activities of
the stock exchanges to ensure effectiveness

of surveillance systems. The stock exchanges
are charged with the primary responsibility of
taking  timely  and  effective  surveillance
measures  in  the  interest  of  investors  and
market  integrity.  Proactive  steps  are  to  be
taken  by  the  exchanges  themselves  in  the
interest  of  investors  and  market  integrity  as
they are in a position to obtain real time alerts
and  thus  know  about  any  abnormalities
present in the market. Unusual deviations are
informed  to  SEBI.  Based  on  the  feedback
from the exchanges, the matter is thereafter
taken  up  for  a  preliminary  enquiry  and
subsequently,  depending  on  the  findings
gathered  from  the  exchanges,  depositories
and  concerned  entities,  the  matter  is  taken
up for full-fledged investigation, if necessary.

SEBI on its own also initiates surveillance
cases  based  on  references  received  from
other regulatory agencies, other stakeholders
(investors,  corporates,  shareholders)  and
media reports. Being proactive is one of the
necessary  features  for  success  in  taking
surveillance measures. Keeping the same in
mind, the Integrated Surveillance Department
of SEBI keeps tab on the news appearing in
print and electronic media. News and rumours
appearing in the media are discussed in the
weekly  surveillance  meetings  with  the  stock
exchanges and necessary actions are initiated.
Apart  from  the  above,  the  department
generates reports at the end of each day on
the  details  of  major  market  players,  scrips,
clients and brokers during the day in the Cash
and  F&O  segment  of  the  stock  exchanges.
This ensures timely identification of the market
players responsible for unusual developments
on a daily basis. The department monitors the
market  movements,  analyses  the  trading
pattern  in  scrips  and  indices  and  initiates
appropriate action, if necessary, in conjunction
with  stock  exchanges  and  the  depositories.
Thus, SEBI supplements the primary regulator
i.e.,  the  stock  exchanges  in  ensuring  safe
markets for the investors.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

A major initiative taken by SEBI that has
gone a long way in taking pre-emptive actions
is  the  Weekly  Surveillance  Meetings.  These
meetings  have  helped  in  better  coordination
between  the  stock  exchanges  and  ensured
uniformity in the surveillance measures taken
by the stock exchanges.

SEBI  has  established  standards  for
effective  surveillance  in  Indian  securities
markets in line with global standards thereby
setting  global  benchmark  for  effective
surveillance  in  securities  market.  SEBI  also
ensures  a  rigorous  application  of  the
standards and effective enforcement against
offences to ensure the safety and integrity of
the  market.  SEBI  also  established  co-
operation  among  overseas  regulators  of
securities  and  futures  markets  to  strengthen
surveillance on cross border transactions. As
a  result,  the  securities  market  in  India  is
considered  as  one  of  the  most  efficient  and
sound markets in the world.

II.

Integrated Market Surveillance
System

In  order  to  enhance  the  efficacy  of  the
surveillance function, SEBI has decided to put
in  place  a  world-class  comprehensive
Integrated Market Surveillance System (IMSS)
across  stock  exchanges  and  across  market
segments (cash and derivative markets).

The  proposed  IMSS  solution  seeks  to

achieve the following objectives:





An  online  data  repository  with  the
capacity  to  capture  market  transaction
data  and  reference  data  from  a  variety
of sources like stock exchanges, clearing
corporations/houses, depositories etc., in
different  formats  for  the  securities  and
derivatives markets;

A  research  and  regulatory  analysis
platform  to  check  instances  of  potential
market abuse; and



Sophisticated  alert  engines,  that  can
work  with  various  data 
formats
(database,  numeric  and  text  data)  to
automatically  detect  patterns  of  abuse
and  then  issue  an  alert.  These  include
insider trading engine, fraud alert engine
and market surveillance engine.

SEBI 

initiated 

the  process 

for
implementing the proposed IMSS system by
appointing  a  high  level  technical  committee
comprising eminent technical experts to study
the  technical  matrix  of  SEBI’s  requirements
and frame a set of parameters which formed
the basis for structuring of tenders, evaluation
of bids, recommending terms of contract etc.,
for  the  IMSS.  After  following  the  process  of
global competitive bidding, a vendor has been
identified  to  implement  the  IMSS  solution  in
a time bound manner (Box 3.1).

III.

Interim Surveillance Arrangement
While the Integrated Market Surveillance
System (IMSS) is in the process of being fully
operationalised,  an  interim  surveillance
mechanism has been put in place since June
2003. A regular system of weekly surveillance
meetings  with  major  stock  exchanges  viz.,
BSE,  NSE;  and  depositories  viz.,  NSDL,
CDSL is now in place to provide a confidential
platform  for  exchange  of  views  on  areas  of
emerging concern-specific abnormalities and
to  consider  pre-emptive  actions  and  discuss
general  surveillance  issues.  In  the  weekly
meetings,  inputs  from  SEBI,  exchanges  and
depositories  are  pooled  for  better  co-
ordination,  sharing  of  information  and  pro-
active, co-ordinated actions. The meeting also
provides a highly specialised and interactive
forum to discuss prevailing surveillance issues
and  emerging  concerns,  if  any,  so  as  to
expeditiously initiate appropriate surveillance
action. During 2004-05, 57 such surveillance
meetings  were  held.  In  addition,  such
meetings  are  also  held  as  and  when  felt
necessary depending on market exigencies.

Annual Report 2004-05

Box 3.1: Integrated Market Surveillance System

Effective surveillance is the  sine qua non for a
well functioning capital market. As an integral part in
the  regulatory  process,  effective  surveillance  can
achieve investor protection, market integrity and capital
market  development.  According  to  IOSCO,  “the  goal
of  surveillance  is  to  spot  adverse  situations  in  the
markets and to pursue appropriate preventive actions
to avoid disruption to the markets.”

In India, the stock exchanges hitherto have been
entrusted with the primary responsibility of undertaking
market surveillance. Given the size, complexities and
level  of  technical  sophistication  of  the  markets,  the
tasks of information gathering, collation and analysis
of data/information are divided among the exchanges,
depositories  and  SEBI.  Information  relating  to  price
and  volume  movements  in  the  market,  broker
positions,  risk  management,  settlement  process  and
compliance  pertaining  to  listing  agreement  are
monitored by the exchanges on a real time basis as
part  of  their  self  regulatory  function.  However,
regulatory oversight, exercised by SEBI, extends over
the  stock  exchanges  through  reporting  and
inspections.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  SEBI
initiates special investigations on the basis of reports
received  from  the  stock  exchanges  or  specific
complaints  received  from  stakeholders  as  regards
market manipulation and insider trading.

In  order  to  prevent  market  irregularities,  it  was
felt that the existing surveillance system needs to be
revamped  to  protect  the  interest  of  investors  more
effectively.  In  this  connection,  SEBI  commissioned  a
study  under  USAID  assistance  as  part  of  FIRE  II
project  to  provide  a  suitable  design  structure  for  an
integrated surveillance model.

Subsequently,  a  Technical  Committee  was  set
up to study the technical matrix of SEBI’s requirements
and frame a set of parameters which would form the
basis for subsequent structuring of tenders, evaluation
of  bids,  recommending  terms  of  contract  etc.,  to  put
in  place  an  integrated  surveillance  system.  On  May
17,  2005,  SEBI  signed  an  agreement  with  a
consortium  of  HCL  Technologies  Limited  and
Securities Markets Automated Research Training and
Surveillance  (SMARTS)  PTY.  Ltd.,  Australia  for  the
implementation  of  a  comprehensive  integrated
surveillance system.

SEBI  is  now  on  the  verge  of  providing  final
touches  to  Integrated  Market  Surveillance  System
(IMSS)  that  would  help  identify  unusual  market
behaviour on a real-time basis. The system envisages
integration  of  data  available  from  stock  exchanges
(cash and derivatives segments), clearing corporations
and  depositories  into  a  single  integrated  market
surveillance  system.  The  IMSS  is  expected  to
generate alerts that will help SEBI identify and detect
serious  market  violations  such  as  market
manipulations, insider trading and other types of frauds
that  undermine  market  integrity.  The  proposed  IMSS
solution  is  expected  to  be  operational  by  March
2006.The  system  would  be  implemented  across
exchanges  and  segments  and  would  integrate  the
surveillance systems of BSE, NSE, CDSL, NSDL and
other  stock  exchanges  with  that  of  market  regulator
in phases. The new surveillance system would focus
on  real  time  reports  from  exchanges  pertaining  to
abnormalities and suspicious transactions in terms of
price,  volume,  big  brokers,  scrips  and  intermediaries
who  constitute  about  80-85  per  cent  of  the  trading
volumes.

IV.

Inter-Regulatory Alert System

In view of the growing linkages between
the securities market and the banking system,
it  was  felt  desirable  to  set  up  an  inter-
regulatory  alert  system  between  SEBI  and
RBI. Towards this end, a SEBI-RBI Group on
Integrated System of Alerts has been set up

to  share  information  and  to  recommend
suitable measures for co-ordinated action. In
accordance with the recommendations made
by  the  Group,  appropriate  alerts  and  data
have  been  identified.  A  system  making  use
of  the  same  has  been  put  in  place  since
February  2004  and  the  system  is  fully
functional.

V. Significant Market Developments

during 2004-05

a) Sharp Fall in Stock Indices on

May 14 and May 17, 2005
The  BSE  Sensex  fell  by  330  points  to
5069.87  on  May  14,  2004  from  5399.47  as
on  May  13,  2004.  It  recorded  its  highest
intraday variation of 842 points and closed at
4505.16 on May 17, 2004, a decline of 564.71
points over the previous close. Thus, the total
fall  in  the  two  day  period  May  14,  2004  to
May 17, 2004 was around 16.5 per cent. The
previous  highest  fall  was  570.42  points  on
April 28, 1992.

The  settlement  and  payment  went
through without any hitch and there were no
defaults.  In  view  of  the  efficiency  of  the  risk
management system, real time monitoring of
the  broker  positions,  provision  for  automatic
disablement of broker terminals and market-
wide  circuit  breaker,  the  market  withstood  a
fall  of  this  magnitude  without  any  disruption
or  settlement  failure.  The  broker  terminals,
which were shut off, got reactivated after the
brokers brought in their funds to meet margin
shortfalls. As a result, the exchanges did not
have to draw upon the settlement guarantee
fund at all.

Special surveillance meetings were held
in the evening of May 14, 2004, the evening
of May 17, 2004 and the morning of May 18,
2004. A thorough review of the adequacy of
the  risk  management  was  made  and  no
settlement / payment crises were anticipated.
A  re-assuring  statement  was  also  released
by  SEBI  about  the  robust  risk  management
measures in place and assuring the investing
public of SEBI’s constant watch on the market
for  taking  such  measures  as  may  be
warranted by the emerging situation.

In  view  of  the  sharp  fall  in  the  indices,
as  part  of  its  continual  market  surveillance

action, SEBI took up an inquiry into the matter
to  examine  the  role  and  involvement  of  the
major  market  players  such  as  FIIs,  brokers,
clients  etc.,  from  the  point  of  view  of  their
trading in the cash and the futures segments.
Pursuant  to  findings  of  investigations,
appropriate  proceedings  have  been  initiated
in  terms  of  the  SEBI  Act  and  SEBI
Regulations. Show cause notices have been
issued  so  far  to  12  entities.  One  entity  has
been penalised.

b) Surveillance Action in Respect of

Shares of Global Trust Bank
(GTB)
Pursuant  to  the  announcement  of
moratorium  on  GTB,  as  a  part  of  the
surveillance measure, it was decided on July
26, 2004 that exchanges should put the scrip
of  GTB  in  trade-for-trade  segment  and
remove  the  circuit  filter  from  the  scrip  so  as
to minimise the scope for price manipulation.
Press release was issued by the exchanges
regarding the terms of the proposed merger.
Exchanges also issued warnings to members
and  investors  to  exercise  due  diligence  and
caution  while  trading  in  the  scrip  of  GTB.
Trading on GTB was suspended from August
27,  2004  on  account  of  the  scheme  of
amalgamation with OBC.

c) Market Movement on January 5,

2005
On January 5, 2005, the Sensex fell by
196.84  points  representing  a  fall  of  2.9  per
cent  with  an  intra-day  variation  of  295.24
points.  Similarly,  Nifty  fell  by  71.55  points
representing  a  fall  of  3.4  per  cent  with  an
intra-day fluctuation of 114.95 points. In view
of the major fall in the indices, accompanied
by  huge  intra-day  volatility  and  a  steep
increase in trading turnover, SEBI took up the
trading  on  January  5,  2005  for  examination.
The  examination  did  not  reveal  any  prima
facie market manipulation.

VI. Surveillance Action

Several  preventive  and  proactive
measures were taken by SEBI during the year
for enhancing market safety and integrity. The
surveillance measures taken during the year
include  shifting  of  scrips  to  trade-for-trade
segment, reduction of circuit filter, imposition
of additional margins etc. Further, the criteria
for initiating such surveillance measures were
also reviewed from time to time based on the
prevailing  market  conditions.  The  year  had
witnessed spurt in mid-cap & low cap stocks
and it was further observed that some of the
defunct  companies  have  become  active.  To
arrest manipulative / speculative price rise in
these  scrips,  various  surveillance  measures
were  taken  as  and  when  considered
necessary.  The  significant  measures  taken
during the year were as under:

a) SEBI has mandated the stock exchanges
to  carry  out  daily  analysis  (end  of  day)
of market activities. Client-wise analysis
is  being  undertaken  at  the  end  of  the
day  itself  of  market  participants  who
have  traded  in  the  cash  and  F&O
segments. This will facilitate identification
of major market players on a daily basis.

b)

c)

The  stock  exchanges  have  also  been
advised to undertake a patch (time slot)
analysis  when  volatility  of  more  than  1
per  cent  in  the  Sensex/  Nifty  is  noticed
by  them  in  any  time  patch  during  the
trading hours and incorporate findings of
the  same  in  the  daily  report.  This  will
facilitate  identification  of  major  market
players, scrips, clients & brokers in time
slots of increased volatility.

Spurt  in  mid-cap  and  low  priced  stocks
during  the  year  was  discussed  in  the
weekly surveillance meetings. As a part
of  the  surveillance  action  and  pursuant
to  the  decision  taken  in  the  weekly
surveillance meetings, criteria for shifting
the  scrips  to  trade-for-trade  segment

d)

were revised in 2004-05 and accordingly
certain scrips falling under the prescribed
criteria  were  thereafter  shifted  to  trade
for trade segment.

The issue of spurt in speculative activity in
small cap stocks reported by various
news articles was examined. Exchanges
have been advised to put in place a
system to look into the matter. News items
are now being analysed in respect of
scrips recommended and exchanges are
asked to provide comments on the same
in the weekly surveillance meetings.

e) SEBI  has  now  advised  the  stock
exchanges  to  prepare  a  suspect  list  of
entities / brokers/ clients. It was felt that
the  earlier  surveillance  measures  used
to  focus  on  individual  scrips  based  on
feedback from exchanges. This led to a
situation  where  there  was  a  flood  of
information  given  by  the  exchanges  to
SEBI which, however, did not capture or
provide  any  meaningful  information
regarding  entities  who  had  undertaken
manipulations.  The  exchanges  have,
therefore,  been  advised  to  prepare  a
suspect list of entities / brokers / clients
according  to  past  trading  pattern  and
other feedback mechanism available with
them.  This  would  enable  prompt
identification of such entities and facilitate
quicker  understanding  of  their  activities
across the market.

f)

To  address  concerns  over  the  stock
specific advice / recommendations made
on TV channels / newspapers, a system
has  been  put  in  place  to  deal  with  the
issue  from  surveillance  point  of  view.
Television media has been advised that
the persons who are desirous of offering
investment advices should make specific
disclosures  regarding  their  interest  /
shareholding  in  the  scrips.  These
disclosures should be aired immediately

' 

 +;

 +;
 ;

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

prior  to  the  investment  advices  offered
by such persons. Disclaimer clauses are
also  required  to  be  aired  immediately
prior  to  the  investment  advices  offered
by  such  persons  to  the  effect  that  the
investment  advices  reflect  the  personal
views  of 
the  person  and  no
compensation has been received directly
or  indirectly,  from  interested  parties  in
connection  with  recommendations  or
views expressed by them.

It  was  observed  during  the  year  that
various  companies  come  up  with
announcements  like  issue  of  bonus
shares, buyback of shares etc. which is
not fulfilled by the company later. It was
decided that BSE and NSE shall identify
such companies which have made such
announcements  without  fulfilling  it  and
shall  take  appropriate  action  against
these  companies  and  also  refer  the
same to SEBI for further investigation.

It  was  observed  during  the  year  that
some  of  the  delisted  companies  had
become  active.  In  this  regard  BSE
informed  that  many  of  the  delisted
companies have started complying with
the  listing  agreement.  However,  these
companies  have  been  kept  suspended.
Trading  has  been  allowed  in  few
companies  but  has  been  kept  in  trade-
for-trade  segment.  It  was  decided  that
exchanges  would  monitor 
these
companies closely.

To  address  concerns  with  regard  to
rumours circulating in the market which
results  in  unusual  price  movement,
exchanges were advised to put in place
a  suitable  mechanism  to  deal  with  the
issue.  Accordingly,  the  exchanges  now
verify factual position from the company
and disseminate the same to the market
at the earliest.

Unusual  price  movement  observed  in
several  loss  making  companies  and
penny  stocks  were  scrutinised  by  SEBI
and appropriate action was initiated. This
was  also  complemented  at  times  by
special  surveillance  measures  by  the
stock  exchanges  to  arrest  manipulative
/ speculative price rise.

investor 

It was also observed during the year that
some  companies  were 
issuing
unsolicitated 
inducing
advertisements.  Such  advertisements
were  generally  made  in  respect  of
companies whose shares were illiquid and
these  advertisements  portrayed  rosy
pictures  of  the  present  and  the  future
activities of the companies and appeared
to have been issued with a view to attract
investor  interest.  In  such  cases,  the
company / its promoters were immediately
called  for  discussions  to  ascertain  the
factual position and suitable actions were
initiated wherever felt necessary.

During  2004-05,  consequent 
to
inspection  of  surveillance  cells  of  the
stock  exchanges,  SEBI  recommended
further improvements in their functioning.
These  included  criteria  for  selection  of
members for investigations, examination
of  the  history  of  unusual  trades  and
inclusion of history of alerts of the short-
listed  scrips  while  scrutinising  for
surveillance action. Exchanges were also
advised 
the  manual
intervention  at  the  time  of  scrutiny  of
online non real time alert reports and to
take  deterrent  action  to  prevent
regulatory breaches.

a. Constitution  of  Special  Sur-
veillance  Investigation  Team
at the Head Office and Regional
Offices for Special Inspection
After  the  securities  scam  of  2001,  the
JPC  recommended  that  an  integrated
approach to surveillance be undertaken so as
to  minimise  the  incidents  of  securities  fraud
and  present  effective  deterrents  to  potential
violations.

As part of surveillance measures, SEBI
advised the exchanges to prepare a suspect
list  of  entities/brokers/clients  that  appear  to
be having a noticeable trading pattern across
scrips.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the
exchanges,  brokers  were  short-listed  for
further scrutiny. These brokers were observed
to have traded in more than 50 scrips mostly
belonging  to  B1/B2/Z  group.  In  such  cases,
entity  based  investigation  would  be  more
effective than scrip based investigation.

Therefore,  Special  Surveillance
Inspection  Teams  (SSIT)  consisting  of  both

surveillance and inspection officials have been
constituted for this purpose. The teams have
commenced conducting surprise and special
inspections at the premises of suspect entities.

b. Meeting  of  Asia  Pacific
Group  (APG)  on  Money
Laundering

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
on Money Laundering was established by the
G-7 Summit in Paris in 1989. It has made 40
recommendations  to  its  Member  National
Governments  to  implement  effective  anti-
money-laundering  programmes.  The
recommendations broadly cover 3 aspects –
role  of  the  national  legal  system,  role  of  the
financial system and international co-operation.
India is a member of the Asia Pacific Group
on money laundering. The APG is responsible
for  implementation  and  assessment  of  the
international  standards  against  money
laundering and terrorist financing. In the month
of March 2005, a Mutual Evaluation Team from
the  Secretariat  of  the  APG  on  Money
Laundering  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the
supervisory  and  oversight  systems  and  the
capital markets in India from the point of view
of measures taken on implementation of the
anti-money  laundering  /  combating  the
financing of terrorism recommendations made
by the Financial Action Task Force.

issues 

In accordance with ongoing interactions
with  other  agencies  -  domestic  and
international  -  the  surveillance  department
organised  the  meeting  of  the  APG  in  March
2005.  To  facilitate  effective  surveillance,
several 
to  effective
documentation  of  client  information  and
prevailing practices relating to record keeping,
increased  due  diligence  by  FIs,  and
identification  and  reporting  of  suspicious
transactions  were  discussed  in  the  meeting.
This  would  also  enable  expeditious
enforcement of regulatory action.

c. Revamping the Functioning of the

Surveillance Department
The  functioning  of  the  department  has
been revamped. Emphasis has been laid on
the quality of investigation with demonstrative
effect  on  the  market  which  will  act  as  a
deterrent  to  potential  offenders.  It  has  been
decided that a limited number of cases should
be taken up for investigation and such cases
should be focused and deterrent punishment
should be handed over to the offenders.

d.

Increased Co-ordination with
other Regulatory Agencies
It  has  also  been  decided  that  there
should  be  ongoing  co-ordination  with  other
investigative  and  regulatory  agencies  with  a
view  to  developing  a  multi-disciplinary
approach  and  the  use  of  multi-domain
knowledge for investigation.

e. Commencement of Special

Studies
In order to assist in effective surveillance
policy  making  and  to  gauge  the  prevailing
market  situation,  the  department  has
commenced  special  studies  in  the  areas  of
FII  flows,  impact  analysis  of  international
factors on market indicators/stocks and trends
in  the  derivative  segments  of  the  capital
market.

5.

INVESTIGATION

I. Objectives

Investigations are undertaken with a view
to examine alleged or suspected violations as
well  as  to  gather  evidence  and  identify
persons/entities  behind  irregularities  and
violations such as:
 price manipulation;
 creation of artificial market;
 insider trading; and
 public issue related irregularities, takeover

violations and other misconducts, etc.

Investigations involve the identification of
persons  involved  in  the  violations,  collection
of  elaborate  data  regarding  primary  issues,
transactions in the secondary markets, trading
details,  followed  by  verification  and  analysis
of  the  same.  Pursuant  to  completion  of
investigation, 
like
administrative  directions  and  penal  actions
under the SEBI Act and various SEBI Rules
and  Regulations  are  initiated.  These  actions
include  monetary  penalties,  warning,
suspension  of  activities,  cancellation  of
registration, prohibition of dealing in securities
and ban on access to the capital market etc.

various 

actions 

SEBI  has  undertaken  over  900
investigation  cases  since  1992-93.  The
experience  gained  during  investigations  has
contributed  to  evolution  of  policies  and
procedures in the regulatory and enforcement
environment, some of which are as follows:

 Amendments to the SEBI Act to strengthen
various  provisions  of  the  Act  which  have
been carried out in the SEBI Amendment
Act, 2002;

 Insider Trading Regulations were amended

in February 2002;

 Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices
Regulations  were  thoroughly  revised  in
2003-04 and new set of regulations were
notified;

 OCBs,  whose  role  came  to  light  in  the
investigations in 2001, have been banned
by RBI from the markets;

 The disclosure of PNs by FIIs was made

mandatory;

 Unique  client  codes  have  been  made

mandatory;

 Suggestions are given to other operational
departments of SEBI from time to time for
amending regulations/guidelines; and

 Inputs  to  other  regulatory  agencies  like
RBI,  MCA,  CBI,  ED  and  Income  Tax
Department etc.

II. Stages of Investigation

The action may include:

a. Preliminary investigation

Based  on  the  facts  contained  in  a
reference  and  feedback  obtained  from
exchanges/  other  sources  of  relevant
information, preliminary investigation is made
to check whether the matter warrants a formal
investigation. At the preliminary investigation
stage,  information  is  sought  and  collected
from  all  available  sources 
including
exchanges,  depositories,  secondary
databases, company and brokers, if required.
As  this  is  only  a  preliminary  investigation,
production  of  documents  and  calling  of
information  cannot  be  enforced.  Based  on
available information, an assessment is made
as to whether a formal investigation is needed
to establish charges of violations.

b. Formal Investigations

Based on the findings of the preliminary
investigation,  a  case  is  taken  up  for  formal
investigation.  Once  a  case  is  taken  up  for
formal  investigation,  the  SEBI  Act  provides
for:





calling for information;
compelling production of documents; and

 examination of witnesses etc.

c. Post Investigative Proceedings

After  completion  of  investigation,  action
is  taken  by  Enforcement  Division  as  per  the
recommendations of the approving authority.

issuing warning letters;

initiating  enquiry  proceedings  against
registered intermediaries;

initiating adjudication proceedings for levy
of penalties;

issuing directions under SEBI Act; and

launching prosecution.

III. Trends in Investigation Cases

Over  the  years,  SEBI  has  undertaken
908  investigation  cases  of  which  755  cases
have  been  completed.  During  2004-05,  130
new  cases  were  taken  up  for  investigation
and 179 cases were completed. (Table 3.15).

a.

Investigation Cases Taken Up
During  2004-05,  130  new  cases  were
taken  up  for  investigation  as  against  121  in
the previous year (Table 3.16, Chart 3.5). Of
total cases taken up, 84.6 per cent pertained
to  market  manipulation  and  price  rigging  as
against  79.3  per  cent  of  such  cases  in  the
previous year. Other cases pertain to insider
trading,  takeover  violations,  irregularities  in
public issues, and miscellaneous cases. Many
investigation  cases  were  taken  up  on  the
basis of multiple allegations of violations and
hence,  strict  classification  under  specific
category becomes difficult. Such cases have
been classified on the basis of main charge/
violations.

IV. Regulatory Actions Against

i. Violation  of  advertisement  code/

Mutual Funds

guidelines;

a. Warning and Deficiency Letters

Considering 

the  magnitude  and
seriousness,  53  warning/deficiency  letters
were issued to 21 mutual funds (Table 3.23)
on  the  basis  of  monitoring  through  various
periodical reports and deficiencies pointed out
in  the  inspection  reports.  Some  of  the  main
reasons  for  which  warning  and  deficiency
letters were issued to mutual funds were:

ii. Delay in submission of reports;
iii. Inadvertent short-selling;
iv. Bouncing of SGL deals;
v. Systemic  deficiencies  for  delays  in
remitting  the  repurchase/redemption
proceeds (apart from their paying interest
to unit holders);

vi. Marginally  exceeding  the  investment

limits; and

vii. Non-compliance  regarding  uploading



NAVs on AMFI website.

b. Adjudication Completed and

Monetary Penalty Imposed
In 

the  current  year, 

there  was
adjudication  against  one  mutual  fund  and
monetary  penalty  was  imposed  for  violation
of SEBI Regulations:

Templeton  Mutual  Fund:  An  error  in
computation of NAV of an ex-Pioneer ITI
scheme  was  reported  in  the  inspection
for  the  period  2000-02.  Accordingly,  as
directed by SEBI, the fund compensated
the  scheme  to  the  extent  of  Rs.8.16
lakh  being  the  error  in  computation  of
NAV.

 Alliance  Capital  Mutual  Fund:  A
penalty  of  Rs.5.75  lakh  each  was  imposed
on Alliance Capital Mutual Fund and Alliance
Capital  Asset  Management  (India)  Pvt.  Ltd.
for  violation  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Fund)
Regulations,  1996,  in  the  matter  relating  to
allotment  of  units  to  two  investors  at  lower
NAV than applicable.

c. Payment of Interest

SEBI  has  made  it  mandatory  that  the
mutual funds must pay interest @ 15 per cent
for  the  delays  in  despatch  of  repurchase/
redemption proceeds to the unitholders. The
mutual  funds  are  required  to  report  these
cases of delays to SEBI on a quarterly basis.
During  the  year  2004-05,  19  mutual  funds
paid  Rs.  22.04  lakh  to  12,058  investors  for
delay  in  dispatch  of  redemption/repurchase
proceeds  as  against  a  total  amount  of  Rs.
95.22  lakh  paid  to  1,18,054  investors  in  the
year  2003-04  (Table  3.24).  Due  to  action  by
SEBI making it mandatory to pay interest for
the  delays,  such  cases  have  declined
considerably from the previous year.

d. Compensation to Scheme in



2004-05
Templeton  Mutual  Fund:  In  the  year
2002-03, the AMC charged management
fees  on  AMC  investment  in  one  of  the
schemes. This matter got reported in the
inspection  and  on  discussing  the  issue
with the AMC, an amount of Rs.4.16 lakh
being  management  fees  on  AMC
investment  was  compensated  to  the
scheme.

e. Compensation to the Unitholders



in 2004-05
Templeton  Mutual  Fund:  An  error  in
computation of NAV of an ex-Pioneer ITI
scheme  was  reported  in  the  inspection
for  the  period  2000-02.  Accordingly,  as
directed by SEBI, the fund compensated
21,382 unitholders of the scheme, to the
extent of Rs.3.24 crore (including interest
for the delay).

V. Regulatory Actions under SEBI

(Substantial Acquisition of Shares
and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997
During the year, 30 cases were referred
for adjudication under Section 15 of SEBI Act,
1992 for alleged violation of the provisions of
SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and
Takeovers)  Regulations,  1997  and  a  sum  of
Rs. 69,17,000 was received towards monetary
penalty.

VI. Regulatory Actions Against CIS

Entities
SEBI has information regarding 664 CIS
entities. Out of this, 75 entities wound up their
schemes  and  repaid  money  to  the  investors
as  certified  by  their  statutory  auditors.  In
addition, court cases are pending in case of
19  entities.  SEBI  has  taken  the  following
actions against the remaining 570 CIS entities
for their failure to wind up their schemes and
make repayments to investors:



Prosecution  under  Section  24  of  SEBI
Act, 1992 has been filed by SEBI against

the  entities  under  Section  433  of  the
Companies Act.

In  addition  to  this,  SEBI  has  requested
the  police  authorities  to  file  First  Information
Reports (FIRs) under the Indian Penal Code
against  70  CIS  entities  which  had  mobilised
Rs.5  crore  or  more  under  their  collective
investment  schemes  and  had  failed  to  wind
up their schemes to repay investors.

Golden Forest (I) Ltd. (GFIL):
Appointment of Central Committee

Golden  Forest  (I)  Ltd.  (GFIL)  had
mobilised  about  Rs.  1000  crore  from  the
investors  under  its  various  collective
investment schemes and as per information,
this  was  the  single  largest  mobilisation  of
funds by any CIS entity. SEBI had filed a writ
petition against GFIL in the Hon’ble Mumbai
High Court before the notification of the CIS
Regulations to facilitate repayment of money
to the investors. Later on, a number of cases
were filed against GFIL by investors in various
High courts of the country. Due to this, there
was  a  possiblity  of  different  High  Courts
passing  different  orders  in  the  matter.
Therefore,  SEBI  filed  a  Transfer  Petition  in
the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court,  so  that  all  the
different  cases  pending  before  various  High
Courts against GFIL can be clubbed together
and transferred to the Supreme Court. In the
said  Transfer  Petition,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme

Court  has  recently  appointed  a  Central
Committee consisting of 3 members under the
Chairmanship of Hon’ble Chief Justice (Retd.)
R.N.  Aggarwal  and  one  member  each  from
SEBI and RBI. The task of the Committee is
to realise the assets of GFIL, to invite claims
from the investors and to scrutinise the same
and thereafter submit a report to the Hon’ble
Supreme Court.

INVESTORS’ EDUCATION AND
TRAINING OF INTERMEDIARIES
A detail account of initiatives by SEBI in
the area of investor education is provided in
Part I. SEBI realises that a cadre of securities
market professionals is a basic infrastructure
for  development  of  the  securities  market.  It
is  essential  not  only  to  sustain  the  reforms
undertaken  so  far  but  also  to  initiate  further
reforms  and  to  maintain  and  enhance  the
confidence of investors/issuers in the market.
The  quality  of  personnel  providing
intermediation services determines the shape
and  health  of  the  securities  market,  as  the
suppliers  of  funds/securities  rely  on
knowledge and expertise of the intermediaries
and look up to them for guidance and support.

In  order 

to  groom  a  cadre  of
professionals who understand the market and
the regulations and can service the investors
and  the  issuers  improving  thereby  the
competence  of  the  intermediaries,  a  set  of
two complementary initiatives namely training
and  certification  is  generally  used.  Keeping
this  in  mind,  SEBI  has  set  up  the  ‘National
Institute of Securities Markets’ (NISM) which
will undertake both initiatives with creditability
and efficiency. It would design and implement
the  entire  gamut  of  educational  initiatives,
including  education,  training,  certification,
research  and  consultancy  in  the  area  of
securities  market  and  allied  subjects  for

securities  market  professionals  in  India  and
neighbouring  countries.  This  would
complement SEBI’s statutory responsibility to:

(i) promote investors’ education;

(ii) train  intermediaries  in  the  securities

market; and

(iii) conduct  research  necessary  for  the

discharge of its responsibilities.

The general superintendence, direction,
control  and  management  of  the  affairs  and
funds of the NISM is vested with its Board of
Governors.

9. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

Knowledge management is the tool that
helps acquire the cutting edge in a globalised
financial market. The guidelines for research
initiatives  are  incorporated  in  SEBI  (Annual
Report)  Rules,  1994.  Core  activities  of
department of research includes preparation of
reports, compilation of data for publication in
monthly bulletin and generation of information
and analysis on market trends as required by
senior executives of SEBI from time to time.
Concept  papers  in  greenfield  areas  of
securities market are also part of the research
profile. Guest Lectures on topical issues like
impact  of  the  Union  Budget  on  securities
market were organised during the year.

The  Research  Department  published
Handbook  of  Statistics  on  Indian  Securities

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

Market,  which  contains  a  vast  collection  of
data  on  Indian  securities  market.  The  data
published in the Handbook are consistent with
the requirement of IMF under the special data
dissemination  standard.  Several  initiatives
were  taken  during  2004-05  to  strengthen
in-house  research  activities  in  SEBI.  Some
of the research outputs are published. Notable
among  them  were  ‘Securities  Market  and
Poverty  Alleviation’,  ‘IPO  Pricing  by  Dutch
Auction  System’,  ‘Regulatory  Framework  of
Debt Market’ and ‘Capital Structure Theories’.
‘Market  for  Corporate  Control  and  Takeover
Regulations:  Trends  and  Analysis’  was
published as a working paper.

Under  the  SEBI  Act,  1992,  SEBI  is
responsible for conducting research necessary
for  regulating  and  developing  the  securities
market and protecting interests of investors in
securities. Keeping this in view, and in order
to  promote  quality  research  in  the  area  of
securities market in a cost effective manner,
SEBI instituted the “SEBI Award for Excellence
in Research in the Area of Securities Market
Initiative”.  Under  the  Initiative,  SEBI  shall
confer up to 3 (three) awards on the 3 (three)
best  researchers  (individuals/  institutions)  in
securities  market  every  year.  The  award
includes a cash prize of Rs. 1,00, 000 (Rupees
One Lakh Only) and a citation.
