PART ONE: POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES

Part One: Policies and Programmes

The Annual Report of the Securities and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  for  2009-10 
articulates  the  policies  and  programmes  of 
SEBI and its working and operations during 
the financial year as per the format prescribed 
by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of 
India  (Annual  Report)  Rules,  1994.  During 
the  year,  SEBI  continued  to  pursue  its  three 
statutory  objectives,  namely:  (a)  protection 
of  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities, 
(b)  promotion  of  the  development  of  the 
securities  market  and  (c)  regulation  of  the 
securities market.

SEBI  pursues  these  objectives  in  a 
transparent  manner  in  consultation  with 
the  regulated  entities. Advisory  Committees 
have  been  constituted  in  all  major  areas  of 
work. Consultation on major policy issues is 
carried  out  by  putting  discussion  papers  in 
public  domain  and  seeking  comments  from 
public. All  its  decision/orders  are  placed  on 
its website.  The agenda papers of the  Board 
are put on the website.

In  line  with  the  stated  objectives,  this 
Report  provides  the  manner  in  which  SEBI 
discharged  its  responsibilities  and  exercised 
its powers during the year in furtherance of 
the  objectives  enshrined  in  (a)  the  Securities 
and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  (b) 
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act, 
1956  (c)  the  Depositories  Act,  1996  and  (d) 
the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Companies 
Act, 1956. The Report also provides a review 
of  the  developments  in  the  Indian  securities 
market  during  2009-10,  in  the  context  of 
changing  dynamics  of  securities  market 
regulations.

Against  the  backdrop  of  increasing 
integration  of  global  financial  markets, 
SEBI  channelised  its  efforts  to  bring  out 
regulations  to  withstand  the  domestic  and 
global  developments.  SEBI,  in  its  attempt  to 

strengthen the existing regulatory framework, 
policies  and  programmes,  introduced  new 
guidelines and regulations to promote orderly 
growth  of  securities  market  while  ensuring 
transparency,  efficiency,  fairness,  safety  and 
integrity.

1. GENERAL MACRO-ECONOMIC 

ENVIRONMENT
Indian  economy  remained  one  of  the 
fastest  growing  economies  in  the  world,  as 
it  managed  to  come  out  of  the  slowdown, 
post  global  financial  crisis,  during  2009-10. 
According  to  revised  estimates  of  Central 
Statistical Organisation (CSO), real GDP grew 
at 7.4 percent in 2009-10 in comparison to 6.7 
percent  in  2008-09  (Table  1.1).  The  services 
sector  continued  to  be  the  main  driver  of 
growth  in  India,  albeit  at  a  moderate  rate, 
with  a  growth  of  8.3  percent  in  2009-10 
compared  to  9.3  percent  in  2008-09.  Growth 
in  the  industrial  sector  was  at  10.4  percent, 
where  manufacturing  activities  recorded  a 
growth  of  10.8  percent  in  2009-10  compared 
to  3.2  percent  in  2008-09  (Table  1.2).  The 
agricultural  sector  registered  a  subdued 
growth of 0.2 percent in 2009-10 compared to 
a growth of 1.6 percent in 2008-09. The share 
of ‘agriculture and allied activities’ in overall 
GDP  declined  from  15.7  percent  in  2008-09 
to  14.6  percent  in  2009-10  (Chart  1.1).  The 
share of services sector rose from 64.4 percent 
to  64.9  percent  while  the  share  of  industry 
remained stable around 20.0 percent. During 
the  first  three  years  of  the  Eleventh  Plan 
period (2007-12), India’s real GDP grew at 7.8 
percent per annum (average) equaling that of 
the Tenth Plan period (2002-07).

Factors  that  contributed  towards  the 
acceleration  in  manufacturing  activities 
were  strong  domestic  demand,  improved 
investment climate and turnaround in exports

due to gradual global recovery following the 
financial  meltdown.  A  rise  in  growth  rate 
for  capital  goods  indicated  momentum  in 
industrial  activity.  Automobiles,  machinery 
and  equipment  other  than  transport 
equipment,  rubber  and  plastic  products, 
wool  and  silk  textiles  and  chemicals  and 
chemical  products  registered  acceleration 
in  2009-10.  Consumer  goods  sector  saw  an 
uptick in growth rate due to strong demand 
observed  in  the  durables  segment.  Also, 
growth  in  intermediate  goods,  basic  goods 
and infrastructure sector gathered strength.

During  2009-10,  services  sector 
continued  to  remain  the  largest  contributor 
to  GDP.  In  terms  of  growth  during  2009-
10,  construction,  trade,  hotel,  transport  and 
communication  recorded  improved  growth 

rate.  However,  community,  social  and 
personal  services  and  financing,  insurance, 
real  estate  and  business  services  witnessed 
deceleration in growth rate during 2009-10.

As per the CSO data on India’s savings 
and  investments,  India’s  Gross  Domestic 
Savings  (GDS)  as  proportion  of  GDP  at 
market  prices  decreased  from  36.4  percent 
in  2007-08  to  32.5  percent  in  2008-09  on 
account  of  weakness  in  saving  performance 
by  the  public  sector  and  to  a  marginal 
extent  by  private  corporate  sector.  Public 
sector  savings  decreased  from  5.1  percent 
in  2007-08  to  1.4  percent  in  2008-09  and 
private  corporate  sector  savings  declined 
marginally from 8.7 percent in 2007-08 to 8.4
percent  in  2008-09.  Savings  of  household 
sector  remained  stable  at  22.6  percent  in

Annual Report 2009-10

2008-09.  The  Gross  Domestic  Capital 
Formation  (overall  investment)  at  34.9 
percent of GDP in 2008-09, exceeded GDS by 
2.4 percentage points reflecting net inflow of 
foreign savings.

‘Deposits’  continued  to  remain  a 
major  component  of  financial  assets  of  the 
households.  The  share  of  deposits  in  total 
financial savings increased to 58.5 percent in 
2008-09  from  52.2  percent  in  2007-08  (Chart 
1.2).  On  the  contrary,  households’  claims  on 

Government  declined  from  3.0  percent  in 
2006-07 to minus 3.1 percent in 2008-09. There 
is  a  visible  shift  in  the  pattern  of  household 
financial  savings  moving  from  claims  on 
Government  to  deposits  because  of  better 
returns  from  various  types  of  term  deposits 
offered by banks and financial institutions.

During 2008-09, other major components 
of financial savings were contractual savings 
at  29.6  percent  (insurance  at  20.1  percent 
and  provident  and  pension  funds  at  9.5

percent), followed by currency at 12.5 percent. 
Investment  in  shares  and  debentures  by 
the  households  as  a  proportion  of  financial 
savings  decreased  significantly  from  12.4 
percent  in  2007-08  to  2.6  percent  in  2008-09. 
Further investment in shares and debentures 
by the households as proportion of GDP (at 
market  prices)  declined  from  1.9  percent  to 
0.4 percent during the same period.

Bank  credit  during  2009-10  witnessed 
moderate  flow  as  the  economy  experienced 
a  challenging  environment  following  global 
financial crisis. Credit was struggling to pick 
up  in  the  first  half  of  2009-10  as  corporates 
in  order  to  fund  their  expansion  plans 
resorted to non-bank sources for alternatives, 
notably  primary  capital  market,  to  take 
advantage  of  the  pent  up  investor  appetite 
and  internal  accruals.  There  was  also  a 
moderation  in  demand  for  credit  from  oil 
marketing  companies  as  global  crude  oil 
prices witnessed a fall following a contraction 
in  global  demand  post  financial  crisis.  As 
the  economic  recovery  became  increasingly 
more  broad-based,  with  industrial  output 
exhibiting  particularly  strong  acceleration  in 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

recent months, there was a significant revival 
in credit demand since November 2009. Non-
food credit started picking up from the later 
half of 2009-10 reaching a year-on-year peak 
of  16.9  percent  in  March  2010  as  corporates 
faced increasing demand following a recovery 
in  manufacturing  and  consumer  durables. 
According to disaggregated provisional data 
released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 
the  year-on-year  growth  in  bank  credit  to 
industry declined alongwith real estate, while 
credit  to  agriculture  and  housing  witnessed 
an uptick.

Liquidity  condition  remained  easy 
for  the  larger  part  of  2009-10  as  banks 
faced  lower  credit  demand  as  the  working 
capital  needs  of  corporates  went  down.  The 
surplus  liquidity  in  the  domestic  markets, 
partly  induced  by  unwinding  of  the  Market 
Stabilisation  Scheme  (MSS)  balances, 
prevailed  during  almost  the  entire  financial 
year  2009-10.  The  key  drivers  of  liquidity 
during  the  first  half  of  2009-10  were  open 
market  operations  (OMO)  to  manage  the 
Government borrowing programme coupled 
with  MSS  unwinding.  The  situation  was 

5

Annual Report 2009-10

further  accentuated  following  a  lower  forex 
demand  from  oil  marketing  companies  as 
global crude oil prices declined. Flushed with 
funds, banks increasingly parked money with 
RBI  through  reverse  repo  window  and  also 
increased their exposure to mutual funds for 
better returns. As easy liquidity was fuelling 
inflationary expectations during second half, 
RBI increased cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 75 
basis  points  in  February  2010  and  increased 
repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points 
in March 2010 to anchor the same.

Stock  prices  in  India  recovered  during 
2009-10 in keeping with the recovery in global 
financial  markets.  Stock  prices  witnessed  an 
upsurge, particularly in the month of October 
2009,  when  global  stock  markets  were  at  a 
peak.  Stock  market  recovery  was  witnessed 
with the BSE Sensex closing above the 14,000 
mark on May 18, 2009 post announcement of 
election results. Thereafter, it witnessed a brief 
correction to close at 13,400 on July 13, 2009 
before embarking on an upward trajectory. It 
recorded its highest close at 17,701 on January 
06, 2010. BSE Sensex recorded an increase of 
80.5  percent  and  Nifty  73.8  percent  in  end-
March 2010 over end-March 2009.

Rates  in  the  money  market  hovered 
around  the  lower  bound  of  Liquidity 
Adjustment  Facility  (LAF)  corridor  for  a 
better  part  of  2009-10  due  to  the  surplus 
liquidity  sloshing  around  the  system.  In 
contrast to the low interest rates that prevailed 
in money markets, the yield on government 
bonds  hardened  in  the  first  half  of  2009-
10  reflecting  the  concerns  of  stimulus  led 
large fiscal deficit and the rising inflationary 
expectations. Following the aggressive stance 
by RBI to anchor inflationary expectations in 
the later half, interest rates crept up across the 
term  structure  in  the  government  securities 
markets. The secondary market yield on 10-

6

year  government  securities  hardened  and 
reached a peak of over eight percent during 
March 2010.

Inflation  on  an  year-on-year  basis, 
measured by variation in the Wholesale Price 
Index  (WPI),  was  9.9  percent  at  the  end  of 
March  2010  compared  to  1.2  percent  at  the 
end  of  March  2009.  On  an  average  basis, 
the  inflation  rate  was  3.7  percent  in  2009-10 
compared to 8.4 percent in the previous year. 
Prices of manufactured products (weight: 63.8 
percent in WPI) rose by 7.1 percent compared 
to  2.3  percent  a  year  ago.  Following  the 
hardening of international crude oil prices in 
the last six months of the financial year 2009-
10, fuel group recorded a rise of 12.7 percent 
in  2009-10  as  against  a  fall  of  six  percent 
in  the  previous  year.  The  rise  in  overall 
prices was mainly attributed to food articles 
registering  a  rise  of  16.7  percent  in  2009-10 
following a poor monsoon.

India’s  import  bill  decreased  during 
2009-10 both on account of crude oil as well as 
non-oil imports. As a result, trade deficit too 
narrowed during 2009-10. Bulk of trade deficit 
was  financed  through  net  receipts  under 
invisibles,  particularly  through  remittances 
from  the  Indian  migrant  workers  abroad. 
India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by 
USD 25 billion to USD 277 billion during 2009-
10.  The  inflow  of  funds  from  foreign  direct 
investment recorded an increase and external 
commercial  borrowings  recorded  a  fall.  The 
Rupee appreciated vis-à-vis US dollar during 
the better part of 2009-10.

2. REVIEW OF POLICIES AND 

PROGRAMMES
SEBI  initiated  a  number  of  policies 
and  programmes  during  2009-10  which 
are  presented  in  this  Section  under  nine 
major  heads  viz.,  primary  securities  market, 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

secondary  securities  market,  corporate 
debt  market,  mutual  funds,  portfolio 
managers,  foreign  institutional  investors, 
takeovers,  delisting  and  investor  assistance 
and  education.  The  section  concludes  with 
‘retrospect and prospects’.

I.   Primary Securities Market

An efficient primary market is critical for 
resource  mobilisation  by  corporates  to  meet 
their  growth  and  expansion  plans.  Indian 
primary market witnessed renewed activity in 
terms of resource mobilisation and number of 
issues during 2009-10, building it further from 
its relatively subdued pace in 2008-09. In view 
of  the  recovery  witnessed  in  equity  markets 
post global financial crisis, companies entered 
the  primary  market  and  investors’  response 
to  public  issues  was  encouraging  in  2009-10 

when  compared  to  2008-09.  Equity  capital 
was  raised  to  the  tune  of  Rs.55,055  crore 
through 73 issues during 2009-10, higher than 
Rs.14,720  crore  mobilised  through  46  issues 
during  2008-09.  The  ongoing  reforms  in  the 
primary market further helped in maintaining 
the  investors’  confidence.  An  analysis  on 
number  of  issues  made,  amount  mobilised, 
size and composition of issues and industry-
wise resource mobilised is presented in Part 
Two of this report. Following were the major 
policy initiatives taken by SEBI relating to the 
primary market during 2009-10:

i.  

Introduction of Pure Auction Method in 
Public Offerings
In order to enable better price discovery 
and to maximise the amount which could be 
raised by an issuer, SEBI introduced the pure 

Box 1.1: Salient Features of Pure Auction Method in Public Offerings

a.  The  issuer  mentions  the  floor  price  in  the  red 
herring  prospectus  or  in  the  alternative,  it 
announces  the  floor  price  at  least  one  working 
day  before  opening  of  the  bid  in  all  the 
newspapers in which the pre-issue advertisement 
was released.

b.  Qualified  institutional  buyers  bid  at  any  price 

above the floor price.

c.  The  bidder  who  bids  at  the  highest  price  is 
allotted the number of securities that he has bid 
for and then the bidder who has bid at the second 
highest  price  and  so  on,  until  all  the  specified 
securities on offer are exhausted.

d.  Allotment  is  made  on  price  priority  basis  for 

qualified institutional buyers.

e.  Allotment  to  retail  individual  investors,  non-
institutional investors and employees of the issuer 
are made proportionately at the floor price.

f.  The  issuer  may  place  a  cap  either  in  terms  of 
number  of  specified  securities  or  percentage  of 
issued capital of the issuer that may be allotted to 
a single bidder.

g.  The  issuer  may  decide  whether  a  bidder  be 
allowed to revise the bid upwards or downwards 
in terms of price and/or quantity.

h.  The  issuer  may  decide  whether  a  bidder  be 

allowed single or multiple bids.

Benefits of the method:
a.  Higher  price  realisation  for  the  issuer  and 

b. 

c. 

consequently higher issue proceeds.
Investors,  who  are  able  to  analyse  an  issue  in 
more  detail,  and  understand  the  management, 
the business model and the business parameters 
in  a  better  fashion,  bid  more  accurately  and  at 
a  higher  price  for  the  issue.  This  means  that 
potential investors are more likely to do a detailed 
research before deciding to invest in the issue and 
therefore,  the  issue  potentially  gets  subscription 
from more informed investors.
Issue  may  be  able  to  attract  higher  quality  of 
investors  vis-à-vis’  the  traditional  proportionate 
allotment since the investors know that they may 
be  able  to  get  a  higher  allotment  based  on  their 
bid  price  rather  than  everyone  getting  allotment 
based on the number of securities applied for.

auction method in further public offerings by 
listed entities. In this method the QIB bidders 
are  free  to  bid  at  any  price  above  the  floor 
price.  The  bidder  who  bids  at  the  highest 
price  is  allotted  the  number  of  securities 
that he has bid for and then the bidder who 
has  bid  at  the  second  highest  price  and  so 
on,  until  all  the  specified  securities  on  offer 
are  exhausted.  Allotment  is  made  on  price 
priority  basis  and  at  differential  prices. 
Allotment to retail individual investors, non-
institutional  investors  and  employees  of  the 

issuer  is  made  proportionately  at  the  floor 
price.

ii.   Introduction  of  Concept  of  ‘Anchor 

Investors’ in Public Offerings
In  order  to  ensure  certain  minimum 
levels  of  subscription  from  qualified 
institutional buyers (QIBs) even in a relatively 
bearish market, SEBI introduced the concept 
of ‘Anchor Investors’ in public offering. Such 
investors  are  expected  to  offer  stability  to 
the  issue  by  subscribing  to  the  issue  before 

Box 1.2: Introduction of Concept of ‘Anchor Investors’ in Public Offerings

SEBI has introduced the concept of ‘Anchor Investors’ 
in public offering. Salient features of this concept are 
as under:

a.  An  Anchor  Investor  makes  an  application  of  a 

value of at least Rs.10 crore in the public issue.

b.  Allocation  to  Anchor  Investors  is  subject  to  a 
minimum  number  of  two  such  investors  for 
allocation  of  upto  Rs.250  crore  and  five  such 
investors for allocation of more than Rs.250 crore.

c.  Upto  thirty  percent  of  the  portion  available  for 
allocation  to  qualified  institutional  buyers  is 
available  to  anchor  investor(s)  for  allocation/
allotment (‘anchor investor portion’).

d.  One-third  of  the  anchor  investor  portion  is 

reserved for domestic mutual funds.

e.  The bidding for Anchor Investors opens one day 

before the issue opening date.

f.  Anchor  Investors  pays  a  margin  of  at  least  25 
percent on application with the balance to be paid 
within two days of the date of closure of the issue.

g.  Allocation  to  Anchor  Investors  is  completed  on 

the day of bidding by Anchor Investors.

h. 

If  the  price  fixed  as  a  result  of  book  building  is 
higher  than  the  price  at  which  the  allocation  is 
made  to  Anchor  Investor,  the  Anchor  Investor 

brings in the additional amount. However, if the 
price  fixed  as  a  result  of  book  building  is  lower 
than the price at which the allocation is made to 
Anchor Investor, the excess amount shall not be 
refunded to the Anchor Investor and the Anchor 
Investor shall take allotment at the price at which 
allocation was made to it.

i.  The  number  of  shares  allocated  to  Anchor 
Investors and the price at which the allocation is 
made, is made available in public domain by the 
merchant banker before opening of the issue.

j. 

There is a lock-in of 30 days on the shares allotted 
to the Anchor Investor from the date of allotment 
in the public issue.

k.  Neither  the  merchant  bankers  nor  any  person 
related to the promoter/promoter group/merchant 
bankers in the concerned public issue can apply 
under Anchor Investor category. The parameters 
for  selection  of  Anchor  Investor  shall  be  clearly 
identified  by  the  merchant  banker  and  shall 
be  available  as  part  of  records  of  the  merchant 
banker for inspection by the Board.

l.  The  applications  made  by  qualified  institutional 
buyers  under  the  Anchor  Investor  category  and 
under the Non Anchor Investor category may not 
be considered as multiple applications.

Part One: Policies and Programmes

a)  Rationalisation  of  Disclosure  Require-
ments:  The  disclosure  requirements 
for  further  public  issues  and  rights 
issues  by  listed  companies  were  almost 
as  rigorous  as  those  for  initial  public 
offerings.  Considering  that  much  of 
the information about listed entities are 
already in public domain and investors 
trade  day  to  day  on  the  basis  of  such 
available information, it was considered 
necessary to rationalise disclosure norms 
for  further  public  issues  and  rights 
issues by listed entities so that the time 
taken for putting together the disclosure 
documents as well the number of pages 
is  reduced  which  can  result  in  overall 
time and cost saving for companies. It is 
expected that the quantity of disclosures 
in  the  letter  of  offer  for  a  rights  issue 
will come down by about 25 percent on 
account of the rationalisation.

b)  Smoothening  the  Payment/Refund 
Process  in  Issues:  In  its  continuing 
endeavour  to  make  the  existing  public 
issue  process  more  efficient,  SEBI  had 
introduced  application  supported  by 
blocked amount (ASBA) (ASBA Phase I) 
as  a  supplementary  facility  to  retail 
individual  investors  for  applying  in 
public  issues.  In  order  to  enable  more 
investors  to  make  use  of  the  ASBA 
process in public issues, ASBA facility has 
now been extended to all investors other 
than qualified institutional buyers. This is 
expected to further improve the efficiency 
of  the  issue  process.  Additionally,  to 
encourage  ASBA,  there  was  a  need 
to  have  a  uniform  incentive  structure 
and  level  playing  field  between  the 
respective  intermediaries,  i.e.  syndicate 
members for non-ASBA and self certified 
syndicate  banks  (SCSBs)  for  ASBA. 
Therefore,  SEBI  directed  merchant 

the  bid  is  open  to  other  categories  of  the 
investors.

iii.   Rationalisation  of  Regulatory  Frame-
work for Issuance of Indian Depository 
Receipts (IDRs)
In  order  to  facilitate  issuance  of  IDRs 
and to bring in necessary liquidity in trading 
of  IDRs,  the  regulatory  framework  has  been 
suitably  modified  to  enable  participation  of 
FIIs  and  Mutual  Funds  in  IDRs.  SEBI  has 
also  notified  a  simplified  “Model  Listing 
Agreement  for  IDRs”  of  issuer  companies 
from  the  countries  whose  securities  market 
regulators  are  signatories  to  the  Multilateral 
Memorandum  of  Understanding  of  IOSCO. 
The  provisions  of  this  model  Listing 
Agreement  are  aligned  with  the  listing 
requirements  of  the  issuers’  home  countries 
so  as  to  avoid  additional  regulatory  burden 
or  cost  for  the  issuer  company.  Further,  in 
order  to  align  the  disclosure  requirements 
pertaining  to  issuance  of  IDRs  with  the 
Companies  (Issue  of  Indian  Depository 
Receipts)  Rules,  2004,  amendments  relating 
to  disclosure  of  financial  information  in  the 
offer  document  in  respect  of  the  accounting 
standard  to  be  adhered  to  and  the  format 
of  disclosures  and  extent  of  applicability 
of  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations 2009 to issuances 
of IDRs have been carried out.

iv.   Making Issue Process More Efficient

For issuers, capital market access should 
be easy, cost effective and time efficient. This 
is  all  the  more  necessary  when  issuers  are 
competing in the markets across the globe. In 
order to make our markets competitive, SEBI 
has  been  constantly  reviewing  various  rules 
and procedures to make issue process simpler, 
at the same time safer and cost effective. Some 
of the major initiatives in this area include:

9

Annual Report 2009-10

bankers  to  ensure  that  both  ASBA  and 
non-ASBA applications should be treated 
at  par  while  paying  commission  to  the 
concerned  intermediaries  for  the  work 
undertaken by them.

v. 

Strengthening  the  Regulatory 
Framework Governing Public Offerings
In order to have a greater enforceability 
of the regulatory framework relating to issue 
of capital by companies and to streamline the 
disclosures  while  also  taking  into  account 
changes in market design, the erstwhile SEBI 
Disclosure and Investor Protection Guidelines 
(DIP  Guidelines)  governing  public  offerings 
were  replaced  by  the  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital 
and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations, 
2009 (ICDR Regulations). There were certain 
changes  made  in  the  ICDR  Regulations 
vis-à-vis  the  provisions  contained  in  DIP 
Guidelines,  on  account  of:  (a)  removal  of 
redundant  provisions  of  DIP  Guidelines,  (b) 
modifications on account of change in market 
design  and  (c)  bringing  more  clarity  to  the 
existing provisions of DIP Guidelines.
vi.  Uniform  Procedure  for  Dealing  with 

Unclaimed Shares
It was brought to the notice of SEBI that 
there  is  a  large  quantum  of  shares  issued 
pursuant to the public issues, which remains 
unclaimed  i.e.  which  could  not  be  allotted 
to  the  rightful  shareholder  despite  the  best 
efforts  of  the  registrar  to  an  issue  or  the 
issuing company and that there is no uniform 
practice for dealing with such shares. In view 
of  this,  SEBI  decided  to  provide  a  uniform 
procedure for dealing with unclaimed shares. 
Accordingly,  a  new  Clause  5A  has  been 
inserted  in  the  equity  listing  agreement,  as 
per  which,  in  respect  of  shares  issued  but 
remain unclaimed in the escrow account, the 
issuer follows the following procedure:
a)  The  registrar  to  an  issue  sends  at  least 
three reminders at the address given in 

the application form as well as captured 
in  depository’s  database  asking  for  the 
correct  particulars  and  if  no  response 
is  received,  the  unclaimed  shares  are 
credited  to  a  demat  suspense  account 
with one of the depository participants, 
opened by the issuer for this purpose.

b)  The  issuer  maintains  details  of 
shareholding of each individual allottee 
whose  shares  are  credited  to  such 
suspense account.

c)  As and when the allottee approaches the 
issuer, the issuer credits the shares lying 
in  the  suspense  account  to  the  demat 
account  of  the  allottee  to  the  extent  of 
the  allottee’s  entitlement  after  proper 
verification of the identity of the allottee.
d)  The voting rights on such shares remain 
frosen till the rightful owner claims the 
shares.  Further,  any  corporate  benefits 
in  terms  of  securities  accruing  on  such 
shares  viz.  bonus  shares,  split  etc.,  are 
also  credited  to  such  demat  suspense 
account.

e)  The  issuer  discloses  the  details  of  such 

unclaimed shares in its Annual Report.

vii.  Listing  of  Securities  Issued  through 
IPO  on  at  least  One  Stock  Exchange 
with Nationwide Trading Terminals
In  order  to  provide  greater  liquidity 
in  securities  of  companies  after  the  IPO,  it 
was  mandated  that  an  unlisted  company 
making an IPO shall list the securities being 
issued  through  the  IPO  on  at  least  one 
stock  exchange  having  nationwide  trading 
terminals.

viii. Prohibition on Issuance of Shares with 

Superior Rights
In  order  to  curb  misuse  especially  by 
promoter/promoter  group  to  increase  their

b.  SMEs

The  roadmap  for  convergence  with 
IFRS  in  respect  of  insurance  companies, 
banking companies and non-banking finance 
companies is as follows:

by  way  of  issuing  shares  with  superior 
voting  rights  to  themselves  which  could 
have  adversely  affected  the  rights  of  other 
shareholders, clause 28A was inserted in the 
equity  Listing  Agreement  to  prohibit  listed 
companies from issuing shares with superior 
rights  as  to  voting  or  dividend  vis-à-vis  the 
rights on equity shares that are already listed.

ix.   Disclosure of Details of the Allottees in 
the  Qualified  Institutional  Placements 
(QIP)  and  Shareholding  Pattern  of 
Issuer Companies
In order to make information regarding 
details  of  those  allottees  in  QIP  who  have 
been  allotted  more  than  five  percent  of  the 
securities offered in the QIP as well as on the 
shareholding  pattern  of  issuers  before  and 
after the QIP available to the general public, 
SEBI  directed  stock  exchanges  to  make  this 
information available on their websites along 
with the final placement document.

x.  Adoption  of  International  Financial 

Reporting Standards (IFRS)
After  detailed  deliberations  on  the 
various implementation challenges, especially 
those  related  to  legal  and  accounting 
framework,  transitional  issues,  and  sector 
specific concerns, the following roadmap for 
convergence with IFRS has been finalised by 
the Core Group:

Introduction  of  Uniform  Margin 
Payment for all Categories of Investors 
in Public Issues
Retail  individual  investors  and  non-
institutional  investors  were  required  to  pay 
entire  application  money  upfront  while 
applying  in  public  issues  while  qualified 
institutional  buyers  (QIBs)  could  apply  by 
paying  only  10  percent  of  the  application 
money  as  margin  on  their  application.  This 
resulted in a non-level playing field for retail 
individual  investors  and  non-institutional 
investors  vis-à-vis  the  QIBs.  It  also  resulted 
in an inflated demand in public issues since 
the lower margin enjoyed by QIBs led them 
to  put  in  larger  bids  than  they  intended  to 

acquire.  In  order  to  address  these  concerns, 
SEBI  decided  that  with  effect  from  May  1, 
2010,  the  margin  collected  shall  be  uniform 
across all categories of investors.

II.   Secondary Securities Market

Secondary  market  witnessed  revival 
following  sharp  fall  in  the  previous  year  in 
the  wake  of  global  financial  crisis  that  had 
plunged  global  equity  markets.  Investors 
regained  confidence  and  the  Indian  market 
rallied post announcement of general election 
results during May 2009. Following were the 
major policy initiatives taken by SEBI relating 
to the secondary market during 2009-10:
i. 

Trading  Hours  on  Stock  Exchanges:
With  a  view  to  align  Indian  markets 
with  those  of  the  international  markets 
to facilitate assimilation of any economic 
information that may flow in from other 
global markets, SEBI, vide circular dated 
October  23,  2009,  decided  to  permit 
the  stock  exchanges  to  set  their  trading 
hours  (in  the  cash  and  derivatives 
segments) subject to the condition that
The trading hours are between 9 am and 
5 pm, and

Box 1.3: Convergence of Indian Accounting Standards with IFRS

The  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards 
(“IFRS”)  issued  by  the  International  Accounting 
Standards  Board  (“IASB”)  are  increasingly  being 
recognised as the global financial reporting standards. 
Convergence  with  IFRS  has  gained  worldwide 
momentum in recent years. India being an important 
emerging global economy, the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs  (“MCA”)  has  committed  to  convergence  of 
Indian  Accounting  Standards  with  IFRS  from  April 
1, 2011.

The  MCA,  which  is  spearheading  the  plan  of 
convergence in India, has set up a High Powered Core 
Group  comprising  various  stakeholders,  including 
SEBI,  for  convergence  with  IFRS  by  2011.  The  Core 

Group  is  supported  by  two  sub-groups.  The  first 
sub-group headed by Shri Y.H. Malegam, Chairman, 
National  Advisory  Committee  on  Accounting 
Standards  is  identifying  changes  required  in  various 
laws,  regulations  and  Indian  Accounting  Standards 
for  convergence  with  IFRS  and  has  prepared  a 
clear  roadmap  for  achieving  the  same.  The  second 
sub-group  of  CFOs  under  the  chairmanship  of  Shri 
Mohandas  Pai,  Director,  Infosys  and  Member,  SEBI 
Board,  is  interacting  with  various  stakeholders  in 
order  to  understand  their  concerns  on  the  issue  of 
convergence  with  IFRSs,  identifying  problem  areas 
and ascertaining the preparedness of the stakeholders 
for such convergence.

which  are  traded  in  the  compulsory 
dematerialised  mode  was  done  away  with 
and accordingly, short deliveries, if any, of the 
shares  traded  on  cum-basis  shall  be  directly 
closed out. In case of such direct close-out, the 
mark-up price would be 10 percent.

iv.  Comprehensive  Risk  Management 

Framework for the Cash Market

It was observed that in some instances 
such as buy transactions, the margins levied 
exceeded  the  amount  needed  to  cover  the 
maximum  possible  risk,  thereby  leading 
to  a  scenario  where  the  buyer  ended  up 
paying  more  margins  than  his  actual  pay-in 
obligation.  Therefore,  it  was  clarified  that  in 
case of a buy transaction in cash market, VaR 
margins,  Extreme  loss  margins  and  mark 
to  market  losses  together  shall  not  exceed 
the  purchase  value  of  the  transaction.  In 
sale  transactions,  the  existing  practice  will 
continue.

v.  Disclosure of Investor Complaints and 
Arbitration Details on Stock Exchange 
Website
Based  on  the  feedback  received  from 
investors  and  their  associations  to  bring  in 
more transparency in the grievance redressal 
available  in  the  stock  exchanges,  it  was 
decided that stock exchanges shall henceforth 
disclose  the  details  of  complaints  lodged  by 
clients/investors against trading members and 
companies  listed  in  the  exchange,  on  their 
website.  The  aforesaid  disclosure  shall  also 
include  details  pertaining  to  arbitration  and 
penal action against the trading members.

vi.  Disclosure of Investor Complaints and 

Arbitration Details on Depositories
Based  on  the  feedback  received  from 
investors  and  investor  associations  to 
improve  transparency  in  the  ‘grievance 

• 

The  exchange  has  in  place  risk 
management  system  and  infrastructure 
commensurate to the trading hours.
NSE  and  BSE  have  fixed  their  trading 
hours  in  the  equity  and  equity  derivatives 
segment from 9:00 am-3:30 pm as compared 
to the earlier 9:55 am-3:30 pm.

ii.   PAN Requirement for Transfer of 

Shares in Physical Form
For  securities  market  transactions  and 
off-market/private  transactions  involving 
transfer  of  shares  in  physical  form  of  listed 
companies,  it  was  made  mandatory  for  the 
transferee(s) to furnish copy of PAN card to 
the  company/registrar  to  an  issue  and  share 
transfer  agent  (RTA)  for  registration  of  such 
transfer of shares.

• 

In  case  of  transmission/transposition  of 
physical  shares  it  was  made  mandatory  for 
the  transferees(s)  to  furnish  a  copy  of  PAN 
card in the following cases:
•  Deletion  of  name  of  the  deceased 
shareholder(s),  where  the  shares  are 
held  in  the  name  of  two  or  more 
shareholders.
Transmission  of  shares  to  the  legal 
heir(s), where deceased shareholder was 
the sole holder of shares.
Transposition  of  shares  –  when  there  is 
a change in the order of names in which 
physical  shares  are  held  jointly  in  the 
names of two or more shareholders.
Transferees  shall  include  all  surviving 
holders,  legal  heir(s)  and  all  existing 
shareholders  respectively  in  the  above 
instances.

• 

iii.  Abolition of No-delivery Period for all 

Types of Corporate Actions
‘No-delivery  period’  for  all  types  of 
corporate  actions  in  respect  of  the  securities

redressal  mechanism’,  it  was  decided  that 
the depositories shall henceforth disclose the 
details  of  complaints  lodged  by  beneficiary 
owners  (BO’s)/investors  against  depository 
participants  (DPs)  on  their  website.  The 
aforesaid disclosure shall also include details 
pertaining  to  arbitration  and  penal  action 
against the DPs.

vii.   Securities  Lending  and  Borrowing 

(SLB) Framework
Based on the feedback received from the 
market  participants,  the  tenure  of  contracts 
in  Securities  Lending  and  Borrowing  was 
increased  upto  a  maximum  period  of  12 
months  from  a  contract  period  of  30  days. 
Further, the Approved Intermediary (Clearing 
Corporation/Clearing  House)  has  been 
provided  with  the  flexibility  to  decide  the 
tenure.  Also  the  provision  of  early  recall/
repayment of shares for the lender/borrower 
has been introduced.

viii. Market  Access  through  Authorised 

Persons
With  a  view  to  enable  the  investors  to 
access  the  stock  markets,  SEBI,  vide  circular 
dated  November  6,  2009,  introduced  the 
concept  of  Authorised  Persons  (AP).  AP 
appointed  by  a  stock  broker  can  access  the 
trading  platform  of  a  stock  exchange  as  an 
agent  of  a  stock  broker. A  stock  broker  may 
appoint one or more APs after obtaining prior 
approval of the stock exchange concerned for 
each such person. The approval as well as the 
appointment shall be for specific segment of 
the exchange.

The  presence  of  AP  in  small  towns/
remote areas will provide greater accessibility 
to  the  investors  to  trade  in  stock  markets. 
The  investors  from  these  areas  will  be  able 

14

to approach the broker through the APs. As 
an agent of the stock broker, AP may provide 
administrative  assistance  in  procurement 
of  documents  and  settlement.  No  funds  or 
securities of clients shall go to the account of 
the  AP.  The  clients  shall  be  registered  with 
stock broker and the funds and securities of 
the  clients  shall  be  settled  directly  between 
the  stock  broker  and  clients.  All  documents 
like  contract  notes,  statement  of  funds  and 
securities  would  be  issued  to  the  clients 
by  stock  broker  directly.  Thus,  while  the 
investors would be able to invest or trade in 
the stock markets through the APs, the stock 
brokers  themselves  would  continue  to  be 
responsible for the funds and securities of the 
investors and thus protecting their interests.

ix.  Transparency  in  Dealing  between 
a  Client  and  Stock  Broker  and 
Strengthening  of  Know  Your  Client 
(KYC) Norms
SEBI  received  representation  from 
several Investors’ Associations regarding the 
problems  faced  by  the  investors  because  of 
the complex registration documents that are 
signed  by  the  investors  for  trading  in  the 
securities market. There were also sometimes 
complaints  from  investors  against  the  stock 
brokers  alleging  misuse  of  their  funds  and 
securities,  non  receipt  of  electronic  contract 
notes  (ECNs),  unauthorised  trading  in  their 
accounts, etc. It was observed that a majority 
of  the  complaints  were  arising  mainly  due 
to  certain  authorisations  taken  by  the  stock 
brokers from the clients, e.g., running account 
authorisation  and  authorisation  to  the  stock 
brokers  to  create  email  ID  on  behalf  of  the 
clients.

Therefore, with a view to instill greater 
transparency  and  discipline  in  the  dealings 
between  the  clients  and  the  stock  brokers, 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

e)  The client shall indicate in the KYC form, 
the stock exchange as well as the market 
segment  where  it  intends  to  trade  so 
as  to  avoid  complaints  of  unauthorised 
trading by the brokers in its account.

x. 

In-person Verification of Clients
SEBI in the year 2008 had mandated the 
“in-person verification” of the clients. It was 
advised that “in person verification” shall be 
carried  out  by  the  staff  of  the  stock  brokers 
in  case  of  trading  account  and  by  the  staff 
of the depository participant (DP) in case of 
beneficial owner (BO) account.

SEBI  received  suggestions  from  the 
market  participants  regarding  repeated 
verification  of  the  same  clients  by  both  DP 
and  stock  broker  which  in  most  cases  are 
either  the  same  entity  or  holding/subsidiary 
company of the other.

Accordingly,  SEBI,  vide  circular  dated 
January 18, 2010, clarified that the “in person 
verification”  done  for  opening  BO  account 
by a DP will hold good for opening trading 
account  by  a  stock  broker  and  vice  versa,  if 
the  stock  broker  and  DP  is  the  same  entity 
or if one of them is the holding or subsidiary 
company of the other. The guidelines would 
enable the intermediaries to avoid duplication 
of efforts without compromising the exercise 
of due diligence on their part.

xi.  Enhanced Supervision of Members

As  part  of  its  continuous  pursuit  for 
improving  the  functioning  of  the  stock 
brokers and maintaining the integrity of the 
market,  SEBI  issued  a  master  circular  dated 
March 17, 2010 updating the earlier circulars 
concerning  the  oversight  of  members.  This 
circular  mandates  the  stock  exchanges/
clearing  corporations  to  inspect  all  active 
members  in  various  segments  every  year. 

SEBI, vide circular dated 3rd December, 2009, 
issued the following guidelines:
a)  Unless specifically agreed to by a client, 
the  settlement  of  funds/securities  shall 
be  done  within  24  hours  of  the  pay 
out.  However,  a  client  may  specifically 
authorise  the  stock  broker  to  maintain 
a  running  account.  In  such  cases  the 
authorisation  shall  be  renewed  at  least 
once  a  year  and  shall  be  dated.  The 
client  may  revoke  such  authorisation 
at  any  time.  The  stock  broker  shall 
compulsorily settle the running account 
on monthly/quarterly basis as desired by 
the clients and send them a statement of 
account to that effect.

b)  The  stock  broker  shall  not  create  email 
IDs for the clients desirous of receiving 
ECNs.  The  client  desirous  of  receiving 
ECNs shall create/provide his own email 
ID to the stock broker.

c)  The stock broker shall disclose its policy 
and procedure with regard to applicable 
brokerage  rate,  refusal  of  order  for 
penny stocks, setting up client’s exposure 
limits, deregistering a client, imposition 
of penalty/delayed payment charges, to 
avoid complaints from the investors, etc.
d)  The stock broker shall clearly distinguish 
between mandatory and non-mandatory 
clauses  in  the  registration  documents. 
Any  authorisation  sought  in  non-
mandatory  part  by  the  stock  broker 
shall  be  a  separate  document  and  shall 
have  specific  consent  of  the  client.  The 
clauses  in  non-mandatory  part  shall 
not  be  in  contravention  of  any  of  the 
clauses  in  the  mandatory  documents. 
All  the  documents  in  both  mandatory 
and non-mandatory part shall be printed 
in  a  minimum  font  size  of  11  for  easy 
readability for the investors.

15

Annual Report 2009-10

The  circular  also  updates  and  brings  out 
the  common  irregularities  observed  by  SEBI 
during  its  inspection  of  stock  brokers  and 
accordingly,  the  stock  exchanges/clearing 
corporations  have  been  advised  to  ensure 
that  their  members  avoid  these  violations/
deficiencies.

Further,  the  stock  brokers  are  required 
to  carry  out  internal  audit  by  practicing 
chartered  accountants/cost  accountants/
company  secretaries  on  a  half  yearly  basis. 
According to the circular mandating the half-
yearly internal audit, the internal auditor shall 
submit the audit report to the member, who 
shall  place  it  before  its  Board  of  Directors/
Proprietor/Partners  and  shall  forward  the 
same  along  with  para-wise  comments 
to  the  respective  stock  exchange/clearing 
corporation within three months from the end 
of the half year period. The stock exchanges 
are  required  to  intimate  SEBI  the  details  of 
action taken by them, within six months from 
the end of the half year period

With  a  view  to  update  with  the  latest 
developments  and  improve  the  quality  of 
audit further, National Institute of Securities 
Markets (NISM), with the support from SEBI, 
stock  exchanges  and  depositories,  organised 
workshops for training the internal auditors. 
These  workshops  received  a  good  response 
from  the  broking  as  well  as  the  auditors’ 
community.

xii.  Enhancing the Competency Level of the 

Employees of the Intermediaries

a)  Certification  of  Person  Engaged  or 

Employed by RTA:
SEBI  vide  notification  dated  September 
4,  2009  mandated  the  requirement  of 
obtaining  the  certification  specified  by 
NISM  by  the  employees  engaged  or  to  be 

16

engaged  with  the  various  activities  of  RTA. 
This  will  ensure  that  only  certified  persons 
are employed by the registrar to an issue or 
share  transfer  agent  and  thus,  they  will  be 
better  equipped  to  carry  out  the  operations 
effectively.

b)  Certification  of  Approved  Users 
and  Sales  Personnel  of  the  Trading 
Members  of  the  Currency  Derivatives 
Segment:
SEBI  vide  notification  dated  May  13, 
2009  mandated  the  requirement  of  Series-I: 
CD  Certification  for  all  the  approved  users 
and  sales  personnel  of  the  trading  members 
of  the  currency  derivatives  segment.  This 
will  ensure  that  only  certified  persons  are 
employed by the trading members and thus, 
they will be better equipped to carry out the 
dealing  and  sales  operations  skillfully  and 
effectively.

c)  Certification  of  Approved  Users 
and  Sales  Personnel  of  the  Trading 
Members in Interest Rate Futures:
SEBI  has  been  taking  steps  to  enhance 
the competency level of the employees of the 
stock  brokers,  which  would  enable  them  to 
discharge  their  responsibilities  effectively  in 
the interest of investors. In this regard, SEBI 
assigned  the  job  of  creating  a  certification 
module  for  the  approved  users  and  sales 
personnel of the trading members in interest 
rate futures to NISM.

xiii.  Credit Rating Agencies

SEBI  has  taken  various  measures  to 
strengthen  the  functioning  of  credit  rating 
agencies (CRAs).
a)  Vide  circular  dated  6th  January,  2010, 
SEBI has mandated a half yearly internal 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

lot  sizes  with  many  of  the  lot  sizes 
expressed  as  odd  numbers.  This 
created  confusion  among  the  market 
participants.
Accordingly, vide circular dated January 
8,  2010,  the  lot  size  of  the  derivative 
contracts  on  individual  securities  has 
been  standardised  so  that  only  eight 
fixed  lot  sizes  continue  to  exist  in  the 
market.

c)  Expiry  Date  for  Equity  Derivative 
Contracts:  With  a  view  to  permit 
market  participants  to  have  varying 
hedging  tenures,  SEBI  vide  circular 
dated  November  13,  2009  allowed 
stock  exchanges  the  flexibility  to  set 
any  day  of  the  month  as  expiry  date 
for  equity  derivative  contracts.  The 
equity  derivative  contracts  trading  on 
NSE  would  continue  to  expire  on  last 
Thursday  of  the  month,  while  BSE 
has  chosen  to  let  its  equity  derivative 
contracts expire on the Thursday falling 
two weeks prior to the last Thursday of 
the expiry month.

d)  Revised  Eligibility  Criteria  for 
Inclusion  of  Stocks  in  the  Equity 
Derivatives  Segment:  SEBI  on  April 
20,  2009  revised  the  eligibility  criteria 
for  inclusion  and  exclusion  of  stocks 
in  the  equity  derivatives  segment.  As 
per the new criteria, the stock’s median 
quarter-sigma  order  size,  over  the  last 
six  months,  shall  not  be  less  than  Rs. 
five  lakh  instead  of  Rs.  one  lakh  and 
the  market  wide  position  limit  in  the 
stock shall not be less than Rs.100 crore 
instead of Rs.50 crore. Further, in terms 
of  the  revised  criteria  for  exclusion  of 
stocks in the equity derivatives segment, 
the  stock’s  median  quarter-sigma  order 
size,  over  the  last  six  months,  shall  be 

audit  for  credit  rating  agencies  to  be 
conducted  by  Chartered  Accountants, 
Company  Secretaries  or  Cost  and 
Management  Accountants  who  are 
in  practice  and  who  do  not  have  any 
conflict  of  interest  with  the  CRA.  The 
audit  shall  cover  all  aspects  of  CRA 
operations  and  procedures,  including 
investor grievance redressal mechanism, 
compliance  with  the  requirements 
stipulated  in  the  SEBI  Act  and 
Regulations  made  thereunder  and 
guidelines  issued  by  SEBI  from  time  to 
time.

b)  SEBI  (Credit  Rating  Agencies), 
Regulations, 1999 have been amended so 
that any change in status or constitution 
in  CRAs  resulting  in  their  change  of 
control,  change  in  managing  director/
whole  time  director  etc.  would  require 
prior approval of SEBI.

xiv.  Policy Initiatives for Derivatives
a)  Exchange Traded Currency Derivatives:
Exchange-Traded  Currency  Futures  on 
USD-INR  pair  started  trading  on  NSE, 
BSE  and  MCX-SX  on  August  29,  2008, 
October  1,  2008  and  October  7,  2008 
respectively.
In  consultation  with  RBI,  vide  circular 
dated  January  19,  2010,  eligible  stock 
exchanges  have  been  permitted  to 
introduce  currency  futures  on  three 
established  currency  pairs:  Euro-INR, 
Pound  Sterling-INR  and  Japanese  Yen-
INR.  Trading  of  futures  on  these  new 
currency pairs started at NSE and MCX-
SX on February 01, 2010.

b)  Standardised  lot  Size  for  Derivative 
Contracts: It was observed that periodic 
alignment  of  contract  size  of  equity 
derivatives  resulted  in  numerous 

17

Annual Report 2009-10

less than Rs. two lakh instead of Rs. one 
lakh and the market wide position limit 
shall  be  less  than  Rs.60  crore  instead 
of  Rs.45  crore.  Based  on  the  revised 
eligibility  criteria,  upto  March  31,  2010, 
53  stocks  were  excluded  and  11  stocks 
were  included  in  the  equity  derivatives 
segment  of  NSE,  while  17  stocks  were 
excluded and 15 stocks were included in 
the equity derivatives segment of BSE.

e)  Derivatives  on  Volatility  Index:  SEBI 
decided, in principle, to allow the stock 
exchanges  to  introduce  derivatives  on 
Volatility Indexes which have a suitable 
track record.

f)  Options  Contracts  with  Longer  Life/
Tenure:  SEBI  decided,  in  principle,  to 

allow  the  stock  exchanges  to  introduce 
options with tenure of upto five years.

g)  Physical  Settlement  on  Derivatives:
SEBI  decided,  in  principle,  to  allow  the 
stock  exchanges  to  introduce  physical 
settlement of equity derivatives.

h)  Exchange Traded Interest Rate Futures:
Pursuant  to  the  issue  of  SEBI  circular 
dated  August  28,  2009  regarding 
introduction of exchange traded 10-Year 
Notional  coupon  bearing  GoI  security 
futures with physical settlement, trading 
in  the  10-Year  Notional  coupon  bearing 
GoI  security  futures  started  on  NSE  on 
August 31, 2009.
Further,  based  on  feedback  received 
from  exchanges,  SEBI  permitted  exchanges 
to set any period of time during the delivery 

Box 1.4: 10-Year Notional Coupon-bearing Government of India (GoI) 

Security Futures

The  RBI-SEBI  Standing  Technical  Committee 
submitted  its  Report  on  Interest  Rate  Futures  on 
June  17,  2009  detailing  the  product  design,  margins, 
position limits and risk management measures for 10-
Year  Notional  Coupon-bearing  Government  of  India 
(GoI) Security Futures. Trading in the 10-Year Notional 
coupon  bearing  GoI  security  futures  started  on  NSE 
on August 31, 2009. The salient features of the product 
are as below:

GoI  security  with  notional  coupon  of  seven 
percent.

2.  The trading hours are from 9 am to 5 pm on all 
working  days  from  Monday  to  Friday  and  the 
contract size is Rs. two lakh.

3.  The  quotation  is  similar  to  the  quoted  price  of 
the  GoI  security.  The  day  count  convention  for

year, consisting of 12 months of 30 days each and 
half yearly coupon payment.

4.  The maximum maturity of the contract is for 12 
months. The ‘Contract Cycle’ consists of four fixed 

quarterly  contracts  for  entire  year,  expiring  in

5.  The  ‘delivery  month’  is  the  last  month  of  the 
expiring  contract,  i.e.,  March,  June,  September 
and  December  and  last  delivery  day  is  the 
last  business  day  of  the  delivery  month.  The 
Exchanges  have  also  been  allowed  to  set  any 
period  of  time  during  the  delivery  month  as 
the  delivery  period  for  the  deliverable  grade 
securities.

6.  Exchanges to select their own basket of securities 
from the eligible ‘deliverable grade securities’. The 
deliverable grade securities are the GoI securities

years  from  the  first  day  of  the  delivery  month, 
with  a  minimum  total  outstanding  stock  of 
Rs.10,000 crore.

7.  The  ‘conversion  factor’  for  deliverable  grade 
security  is  equal  to  the  price  of  the  deliverable 
security (per rupee of the principal), on the first 
day (calendar day) of the delivery month, to yield 
seven percent with semiannual compounding.

xv.  Committee  for  Review  of  Ownership 
a n d   G o v e r n a n c e   o f   M a r k e t 
Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs)
A  Committee,  under  the  Chairmanship 
of  Dr.  Bimal  Jalan  (former  Governor  of 
Reserve Bank of India), has been constituted 
to  look  into  the  ownership  and  governance 
norms  for  stock  exchanges,  clearing 
corporations  and  depositories  (collectively 
termed  as  MIIs).  The  other  members  of  the 
Committee are:
1.  Dr.  K  P  Krishnan,  Joint  Secretary, 

Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India

3.  Mr.  Uday  Kotak,  Managing  Director, 

Kotak Mahindra Bank

4.  Prof.  G.  Sethu,  National  Institute  of 

Securities Market

6. 

Member, SEBI
Shri J.N. Gupta, Executive Director, SEBI 
(Member Secretary).
The terms of reference of the committee 
are to review and make recommendations on 
the following issues:
a)  Ownership structure of stock exchanges 

and clearing corporations,

19

Annual Report 2009-10

b)  Board  composition  of  stock  exchanges 

and clearing corporations,

c)  Listing  and  governance  of  stock 

exchanges and clearing corporations,

d)  Balance between regulatory and business 
functions  of  stock  exchanges  and 
clearing  corporations,  in  the  context  of 
their ‘for profit’ status

e)  Relationship  between  stock  exchanges 

and clearing corporations,

f)  Relationship  between  stock  exchanges 

and technology providers, and

g)  Competition  policy  for  stock  exchanges 

and clearing corporations.
The  Committee  may  also  make 
recommendations  on  other  relevant  issues 
inter-alia as it finds necessary.

The  Committee  held  its  first  meeting 
on  March  15,  2010.  During  the  meeting, 
the  Committee  inter  alia  decided  to  form 
a  sub-committee  to  have  a  consultative 
process  (through  questionnaire)  with  MIIs, 
market  participants  and  users  on  the  issue 
of  ownership  and  governance  of  MIIs  and 
include  depositories  under  the  scope  of 
the  committee  since  they  form  part  of  the 
Financial Market Infrastructure institutions.

xvi.  Prior  Approval  for  Re-commencement 

of Trading on the Stock Exchanges
With  the  completion  of  corporatisation 
and demutualisation of stock exchanges, some 
of  the  stock  exchanges  on  which  there  was 
no  trading  over  the  past  several  years,  have 
generated  renewed  trading  interest  and  are 
in  the  process  of  resuming  trading  for  their 
revival. It was felt that the regulatory changes 
introduced  by  SEBI  in  the  interim  may  not 
have been complied by the exchanges.

stock  exchanges  that  have  no  trading  for  a 
period  of  six  months  or  more  shall  resume 
trading  only  after  ensuring  that  adequate 
and  effective  trading  systems,  clearing 
and  settlement  systems,  monitoring  and 
surveillance  mechanisms,  risk  management 
systems are in place and have also complied 
with  all  other  regulatory  requirements 
stipulated by SEBI from time to time. Further, 
the stock exchanges shall resume trading only 
after obtaining prior approval from SEBI.

xvii. Limitation  Period  for  Filing  of 

a) 

Arbitration Reference
In  terms  of  the  bye-laws  of  the  Stock 
Exchange  the  limitation  period  for 
referring  complaint/claim//difference/
dispute is six months.

b)  Based  on  the  feedback  received 
from  the  market  participants  and 
recommendation  of  Secondary  Market 
Advisory  Committee  (SMAC),  SEBI 
vide  its  circular  dated  December  2, 
2009  mandated  that  the  limitation 
period of six months shall be computed 
from  the  end  of  the  quarter  during 
which  the  disputed  transaction(s)  were 
executed. In addition to the above, while 
computing  the  said  limitation  period 
the  time  taken  in  settlement  of  claims, 
complaints, differences, disputes through 
the  Investors  Grievances  Redressal 
Committee mechanism of the Exchange 
will  be  excluded.  Further  a  period  of 
one  month  from  the  date  of  receipt  of 
complaint  by  the  broker  or  the  actual 
time  taken  by  the  broker  to  resolve  the 
complaint  whichever  ends  earlier,  will 
also be excluded.

In light of the above, SEBI vide circular 
dated October 7, 2009 has stipulated that the

Regulations, 2008.

iii.   Clearing  and  Settlement  of  Corporate 

Bonds
Settlement  of  bond  trades  was  earlier 
being  done  only  on  bilateral  basis  between 
the  counterparties.  With  a  view  to  remove 
counterparty  risks  from  the  settlement 
process,  SEBI  has  evolved  a  clearing  and 
settlement  mechanism  for  corporate  bond 
trades  through  the  clearing  corporations 
which  are  subsidiaries  of  NSE  and  BSE.  To 
facilitate clearing and settlement through the 
two  clearing  corporations,  real  time  gross 
settlement  system  (RTGS)  connectivity  was 
given  to  the  two  clearing  corporations,  viz. 
National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. 
(NSCCL)  and  Indian  Clearing  Corporation 
Ltd. (ICCL) by RBI in June and October 2009 
respectively.

In  October  2009,  SEBI  made  it 
mandatory  for  all  trades  in  corporate  bonds 
between  mutual  funds,  FIIs/sub-accounts, 
venture  capital  funds,  foreign  venture 
capital investors, portfolio mangers, and RBI 
regulated  entities  as  specified  by  RBI  to  be 
cleared and settled through NSCCL or ICCL, 
effective  from  December  1,  2009.  RBI  issued 
a similar circular to all its regulated entities. 
Insurance  Regulatory  and  Development 
Authority (IRDA) also issued similar circular 
to IRDA regulated entities. Now, clearing and 
settlement takes place on DvP-1 basis usually 
on T+1 day and in case of failure by one party 
to pay, the funds/securities are returned to the 
counterparty.

IV.  Mutual Funds

Mutual  funds  after  witnessing 
redemption  pressures  during  later  half  of 
2008-09  post  global  credit  crisis  witnessed 

• 

rejected on the ground of exceeding the 
limitation period without going into the 
reasons  thereof,  which  were  not  in  the 
interest  of  the  investors.  In  view  of  the 
above, it was decided that:
The  stock  exchange  can  extend  the 
limitation period by a further period of 
three  months.  However,  this  is  subject 
to  stock  exchange  obtaining  sufficient 
documentary  proof  in  this  regard  and 
recording  the  reasons  for  the  same  in 
writing.

III.  Corporate Debt Market

i.   Simplified Listing Agreement for Debt 

Securities
In  May  2009,  SEBI  issued  a  simplified 
listing  agreement  for  debt  securities.  The 
Agreement has two parts – Part A for issuers 
with listed equity and Part B for issuers who 
have no listed equity. For issuers with listed 
equity,  minimal  incremental  disclosures 
specific to the debt issue prescribed in Part-A 
of  the  agreement  need  to  be  complied  with. 
For  issuers  whose  equity  is  not  listed  and 
who  seek  listing  of  their  debt  securities, 
detailed  disclosure  norms  are  prescribed  in 
Part-B of the Agreement.

ii.   Applicability  of  Debt  Securities 

Regulations
In June 2009, SEBI clarified that the issue 
of debt securities, convertible, either partially 
or  fully  or  optionally  into  listed  or  unlisted 
equity,  are  guided  by  the  disclosure  norms 
in  terms  of  the  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and 
Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations  2009. 
It was also clarified that the issue and listing 
of  non-convertible  debt  securities,  whether 
issued to the public or privately placed shall 
be  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the 

21

Annual Report 2009-10

renewal  of  investors’  interest  in  terms  of 
mobilisation  of  resources  through  new  fund 
offerings as well as existing schemes. SEBI has 
taken the following initiatives to improve the 
functioning of mutual funds:

i.  Guidelines  for  Investment  by  Mutual 

Funds in IDRs
It  was  clarified  that  mutual  funds  can 
invest  in  IDRs  [Indian  Depository  Receipts 
as  defined  in  the  Companies  (Issue  of 
Indian  Depository  Receipts)  Rules,  2004] 
subject to compliance with the SEBI (Mutual 
Funds)  Regulations,  1996  and  guidelines 
issued  thereunder,  specifically  investment 
restrictions  as  specified  in  the  Seventh 
Schedule of the Regulations.

ii.  Money  Market  Instruments  Brought 

under the Investment Limits
The Mutual Funds (Second Amendment) 
Regulations,  2009  prescribed  that  no  mutual 
fund schemes can invest more than 30 percent 
of their assets in money market instruments 
of an issuer. However, such limit shall not be 
applicable  for  investments  in  Government 
securities,  treasury  bills  and  collateralised 
borrowing and lending obligations.

iii.  Valuation

a)  Valuation of Debt Securities by Mutual 

Funds
Debt  securities  are  valued  by  Mutual 
Funds  in  terms  of  spread  indicated  by 
specified rating agencies. Mutual Funds have 
been  given  discretionary  mark  up  or  down 
detailed in guidelines issued in the years 2000 
and 2002. These varied from -25 bps to +100 
bps  (basis  points).  These  discretionary  mark 
ups  were  increased  considerably  in  2008  to 
accommodate  for  the  great  variation  in  the 
values  of  securities  on  account  of  volatile 

22

market  conditions.  During  2009-10,  the 
discretionary mark ups/downs were returned 
to their levels specified in 2000/2002. Further, 
it  was  decided  that,  the  Chief  Executive 
Officer (whatever his designation may be) of 
the  Asset  Management  Company  shall  give 
prior  approval  to  the  use  of  discretionary 
mark up or down limit.

b)  Valuation  of  Debt  and  Money  Market 

Instruments
To  ensure  that  the  value  of  money 
market  and  debt  securities  in  the  portfolio 
of  mutual  fund  schemes  reflects  the  current 
market  scenario,  the  provisions  regarding 
valuation of certain securities were modified, 
as under:
•  Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt 
securities with residual maturity of upto 
91 days:
All  money  market  and  debt  securities, 
including  floating  rate  securities,  with 
residual  maturity  of  upto  91  days  shall 
be  valued  at  the  weighted  average 
price  at  which  they  are  traded  on  the 
particular  valuation  day.  When  such 
securities are not traded on a particular 
valuation  day,  they  shall  be  valued  on 
amortisation  basis.  The  floating  rate 
securities with floor and caps on coupon 
rate  and  residual  maturity  of  upto  91 
days  shall  be  valued  on  amortisation 
basis taking the coupon rate as floor.

•  Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt 
securities with residual maturity of over 
91 days:
All  money  market  and  debt  securities, 
including  floating  rate  securities,  with 
residual  maturity  of  over  91  days 
shall  be  valued  at  weighted  average 
price  at  which  they  are  traded  on  the 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

particular  valuation  day.  When  such 
securities are not traded on a particular 
valuation  day,  they  shall  be  valued  at 
benchmark  yield/matrix  of  spread  over 
risk  free  benchmark  yield  obtained 
from  agency(ies)  entrusted  for  the  said 
purpose by Association of Mutual Funds 
in India.

iv.  Mutual Funds - Empowering Investors 
through  Transparency  in  Payment  of 
Commission and Load Structure

In order to empower the investors in 
deciding the commission paid to distributors 
in  accordance  with  the  level  of  service 
received,  to  bring  about  more  transparency 
in payment of commissions and to incentivise 
long term investment, it was decided that:
a)  There  shall  be  no  entry  load  for  all 

mutual fund schemes.

b)  The scheme application forms shall carry 
a  suitable  disclosure  to  the  effect  that 

the  upfront  commission  to  distributors 
will  be  paid  by  the  investor  directly  to 
the distributor, based on his assessment 
of  various  factors  including  the  service 
rendered by the distributor.

c)  Of  the  exit  load  or  contingent  deferred 
sales  charge  (CDSC)  charged  to  the 
investor,  a  maximum  of  one  percent 
of  the  redemption  proceeds  shall  be 
maintained  in  a  separate  account 
which  can  be  used  by  the AMC  to  pay 
commissions  to  the  distributor  and  to 
take care of other marketing and selling 
expenses. Any balance shall be credited 
to the scheme immediately.

d)  The  distributors  shall  disclose  all 
the  commissions  (in  the  form  of  trail 
commission or any other mode) payable 
to  them  for  the  different  competing 
schemes  of  various  mutual  funds  from 
amongst  which  the  scheme  is  being 
recommended to the investor.

Box 1.5: No Entry Load for Mutual Fund Investments

Mutual funds are an avenue for investors who would 
like to diversify their risks and avail of the services of 
professional  fund  managers.  Retail  investments  are 
pooled  into  a  MF  scheme  with  defined  investment 
objective and deployed into securities investments. For 
investment  services  provided  by  asset  management 
companies  (AMC),  two  types  of  expenses  were 
charged  to  investors,  upfront  expenses  popularly 
called ‘sales load’ (or entry load) and annual scheme 
expenses. Besides, a few schemes also charge an exit 
load.

Many  mutual  fund  investors  avail  the  services  of  a 
distributor  who  also  acts  as  financial  adviser.  The 
adviser  is  expected  to  assist  investors  in  choosing 
schemes that suit their respective risk return appetite 
besides  assisting  him  in  making  an  application. 
Till  2009,  the  schemes  charged  an  entry  load  as  a 
percentage  of  amount  invested.  This  entry  load  was 
deducted  from  the  total  amount  invested  and  was 

generally passed on to distributors by AMC. Investor, 
in effect, did not have any say in the commission that 
was paid to the distributor from entry load.

This  gave  rise  to  a  situation  of  potential  conflict 
of  interest.  The  distributor  being  likely  to  choose 
schemes which would give him better sales incentives 
rather  than  schemes  which  would  be  best  suited  to 
the  customer.  As  repeated  investments  by  investor 
would  entitle  distributor  to  more  commissions,  he 
was  likely  to  encourage  investors  to  sell  existing 
mutual fund investments and buy new mutual fund 
units. This churning was neither to the advantage of 
investor nor to the mutual fund industry. The Report 
on  ‘Reform  of  Mutual  Funds  in  India’  (2004)  by 
Cadogan  Financial,  UK  has  highlighted  that  power 
of  distributors  transforms  the  basis  of  competition 
as  majority  of  consumers(investors)  rely  heavily  on 
their advisers and as a consequence, the real customer 
for  the  product  provider  –  the  asset  management 

23

Annual Report 2009-10

Box 1.5: No Entry Load for Mutual Fund Investments (contd.)

company  -  tends  to  be  the  adviser,  rather  than  the 
consumer(investor).

As  distribution  agents  play  twin  roles,  that  of  an 
advisor  to  investor  and  point  of  sale  for  the  AMC 
products,  the  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  a 
distributor providing financial advice to the investors 
and  his  role  as  an  agent  of  the  AMCs  has  seized 
the  attention  of  various  jurisdictions  besides  India. 
In  UK,  according  to  ‘Retail  Distribution  Review’ 
(2008), a report by Financial Services Authority (FSA) 
asserts  that  there  needs  to  be  a  distinction  between 
‘advice’ and ‘sales’. Accordingly, advisers need to be 
independent in their remuneration that is determined 
without product provider influence. FSA has set out 
reduction of commissions paid by product provider in 
stages with year 2013 as final time line for complete 
detachment  of  advisor  remuneration  from  product 
providers’  remuneration.  In  Australia,  Future  of 
Financial  Advice  reforms  have  been  undertaken  to 
tackle conflicts of interest that had threatened advice 

quality  and  caused  mis-selling  of  products.  This 
reform measure in Australia envisages advisers having 
their own "product neutral" charges.

In India, no entry load on investments made directly 
by the investors (not routed through any distributor), 
was  mandated  on  December  31,  2008.  Subsequently, 
in  cases  of  all  mutual  fund  investments,  it  was  felt 
that to empower the investor in deciding commissions 
paid to the distributors and also ensure transparency 
in  commissions  being  paid,  the  amount  of  payment 
should be decided by investor depending on level of 
service received, not by AMC (as was in form of entry 
load). Hence, it has been decided that from August 1, 
2009 there shall be no entry load for all MF schemes. 
Upfront  commission  to  distributors  is  to  be  paid  by 
the investor to the distributor directly depending on 
quality  of  service  rendered.  It  is  expected  that  this 
would segregate the streams of payment for the two 
roles of distributor, a point of sale for the AMC and an 
adviser to the investor.

v. 

Exit Load - Parity among All Classes of 
Unit Holders
It  was  observed  that  the  mutual  funds 
were  making  distinction  among  the  unit 
holders  by  charging  differential  exit  loads 
based  on  the  amount  of  subscription.  In 
order to have parity among all classes of unit 
holders,  it  was  decided  that  no  distinction 
among  unit  holders  shall  be  made  based  on 
the  amount  of  subscription  while  charging 
exit  loads.  Further,  it  was  decided  that  the 
parity  among  all  classes  of  unit  holders  in 
terms  of  charging  exit  load  shall  be  made 
applicable at the portfolio level.

vi.  Systems Audit of Mutual Funds

Considering  the  importance  of  systems 
audit  in  the  technology  driven  asset 
management  activity,  it  was  decided  that 
mutual  funds  shall  have  a  systems  audit 
conducted  by  an  independent  Certified 

Information System Auditor (CISA)/Certified 
Information  Security  Manager  (CISM) 
qualified  or  equivalent  auditor.  The  systems 
audit  shall  be  comprehensive  encompassing 
audit of systems and processes.

Accordingly,  the  AMCs  were  advised 
to  conduct  systems  audit  of  mutual  funds 
once  in  two  years  and  to  place  the  systems 
audit  report  and  compliance  status  before 
the Trustees of the mutual fund. The systems 
audit  report/findings  alongwith  trustee 
comments shall be communicated to SEBI.

vii.  Facilitating  Transactions  in  Mutual 
Fund  Schemes  through  the  Stock 
Exchange Infrastructure
The  need  for  enhancing  the  reach  of 
mutual fund schemes to more towns and cities 
was widely felt. To address this issue, units of 
mutual  fund  schemes  were  permitted  to  be 
transacted through registered stock brokers of 

24

Part One: Policies and Programmes

recognised stock exchanges. The convenience 
of stock exchange mechanism would also be 
available now to mutual fund investors.

his  distributor  and/or  go  direct,  without 
compelling  that  investor  to  obtain  an  NoC 
from the existing distributor.

viii. Transactions  through  Some  Mutual 
Fund  Distributors  and  Compliance 
with the SEBI Circular on Anti Money 
Laundering (AML)
As  all  documentation  related  to  the 
investor, including Know Your Client, Power 
of Attorney (PoA) in respect of transactions/
requests  made  through  some  mutual  fund 
distributors was not available with the AMC/
RTA  of  the  AMC,  it  was  reiterated  that  the 
requirements  as  mentioned  in  the  master 
circular ISD/AML/CIR-1/2008 dated December 
19,  2008  issued  by  SEBI  is  applicable  to  the 
mutual  funds/AMCs  and  hence  maintaining 
all  the  documentation  pertaining  to  the 
unitholders/investor is the responsibility of the 
AMC. Pending completion of documentation, 
Mutual  Funds  are  required  to  exercise  great 
care  and  be  satisfied  of  investor  bonafides 
before authorising any transaction, including 
redemption,  on  such  accounts/folios.  The 
trustees were instructed to confirm to SEBI of 
the steps taken to address the above.

ix.  Association  of  Mutual  Funds  in  India 
(AMFI)  Guidelines  for  Change  of 
Mutual Fund Distributor
Unwarranted  hardship  was  caused 
to  investors  in  mutual  fund  schemes  who 
wished  to  switch  from  an  existing  mutual 
fund  distributor  to  either  another  mutual 
fund  distributor  or  opt  to  deal  direct, 
since  some  AMCs  insisted  on  the  investor 
procuring a ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) 
from  the  existing  distributor  for  this  switch 
over.  Therefore,  the  AMCs  were  advised  to 
ensure  compliance  with  the  instruction  of 
the  investor  informing  his  desire  to  change 

x.  Standard  Warning  in  Advertisements 

by Mutual Funds
In order to improve the manner in which 
the standard warning message is conveyed to 
the investors, it was decided that:
a)  The  standard  warning  in  audio-visual 
advertisement  shall  be  displayed  as 
“Mutual  Fund  investments  are  subject 
to market risks, read all scheme related 
documents carefully”.

b)  No addition or deletion of words shall be 

made in the standard warning.

It  was  emphasised  that  both  the  visual 
and  the  voice  over  of  the  standard  warning 
will be run for at least five seconds.

a) 

xi.  Additional  Mode  of  Payment  through 
Applications  Supported  by  Blocked 
Amount (ASBA) in Mutual Funds and 
Reduction  in  New  Fund  offer  (NFO) 
Period
In  its  continuous  endeavor  to  make 
the  public  issue  process  efficient,  SEBI 
has  introduced  ASBA  facility  to  NFOs 
of  mutual  funds  which  investors  have 
been enjoying for subscription to public 
issue  of  equity  capital  of  companies.  It 
shall  co-exist  with  the  current  process, 
wherein  cheques/demand  drafts  are 
used as a mode of payment. The banks 
which are in SEBI’s list shall extend the 
same facility in case of NFOs of mutual 
fund schemes to all eligible investors in 
mutual  fund  units.  Mutual  funds  shall 
ensure  that  adequate  arrangements  are 
made by RTA for the implementation of 
ASBA.

25

Annual Report 2009-10

b) 

It  was  decided  that  the  present  limit 
of  maximum  NFO  period  of  30  days 
in  case  of  open  ended  schemes  and  45 
days of close ended scheme be reduced 
to  15  days  (except  ELSS  schemes). 
Mutual funds/AMCs shall use the NFO 
proceeds  only  on  or  after  the  closure 
of  the  NFO  period.  The  mutual  fund 
shall  allot  units/refund  of  money  and 
dispatch  statements  of  accounts  within 
five  business  days  from  the  closure  of 
the  NFO  and  all  the  schemes  (except 
ELSS)  shall  be  available  for  ongoing 
repurchase/sale/trading  within  five 
business days of allotment.

xii.  Non-availability  of  Unit  Premium 

Reserve for Dividend Distribution
Since, it was observed that some mutual 
funds  were  using  unit  premium  reserve  for 
distribution of dividend, SEBI clarified that:
a)  When units of an open-ended scheme are 
sold,  and  sale  price  is  higher  than  face 
value  of  the  unit,  part  of  sale  proceeds 
that  represents  unrealised  gains  shall 
be  credited  to  a  separate  account  (unit 
premium reserve) and shall be treated at 
par with unit capital and the same shall 
not  be  utilised  for  the  determination  of 
distributable surplus.

b)  When  units  of  an  open-ended  scheme 
are  sold,  and  sale  price  is  less  than 
face  value  of  the  unit,  the  difference 
between  the  sale  price  and  face  value 
shall be debited to distributable reserves 
and  the  dividend  can  be  declared  only 
when  distributable  reserves  become 
positive  after  adjusting  the  amount 
debited to reserves as per para 2(a) (ix) 
of  Eleventh  Schedule  of  SEBI  (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations.

xiii.    Role  of  Mutual  Funds  in  Corporate 
G o v e r n a n c e   o f   P u b l i c   L i s t e d 
Companies
With  a  view  to  improving  corporate 
governance, it was decided that AMCs shall 
disclose their general policies and procedures 
for  exercising  the  voting  rights  in  respect  of 
shares  held  by  them  on  the  website  of  the 
respective  AMC  as  well  as  in  the  annual 
report distributed to the unit holders.

Further,  henceforth  the  AMCs  are  also 
required  to  disclose  on  the  website  of  the 
respective  AMC  as  well  as  in  the  annual 
report  distributed  to  the  unit  holders,  the 
actual  exercise  of  their  proxy  votes  in  the 
AGMs/EGMs of the investee companies.

xiv.  Fund of Funds Scheme

AMCs  were  entering  into  revenue 
sharing  arrangements  with  offshore  funds 
in  respect  of  investments  made  on  behalf  of 
Fund of Funds schemes which created conflict 
of interest.

It  was  decided  that  henceforth  AMCs 
shall  not  enter  into  any  revenue  sharing 
arrangement  with  the  underlying  funds  in 
any manner and shall not receive any revenue 
by whatever means/head from the underlying 
fund. Any commission or brokerage received 
from  the  underlying  fund  shall  be  credited 
into concerned scheme’s account.

V.  Portfolio Managers

i.   Non-Pooling  of  Securities  in  Clients’ 

Accounts
In  August  2008,  the  SEBI  (Portfolio 
Managers)  Regulations,  1993  were  amended 
to  ensure  that  each  client’s  listed  securities 
and  funds  are  kept  separately.  To  ensure 
compliance  with  this  requirement,  portfolio 

managers were advised that clients’ securities 
held  in  a  pool  account  as  on  May  11,  2009 
shall  be  frozen  with  respect  to  any  further 
transactions. While fresh purchases on behalf 
of such clients were not permitted, selling and 
transfer of securities from such accounts was 
allowed.

Subsequently,  the  portfolio  managers 
were  advised  that  they  may  discontinue  the 
services to clients who were not co-operating 
for  opening  separate  client  accounts,  after 
serving at least three notices, and return the 
securities/funds  to  the  client  and  maintain 
records of the same.

ii.  Handling  of  Funds  of  Portfolio 

Management Clients
The  SEBI  (Portfolio  Managers) 
Regulations,  1993  mandate  the  segregation 
of  clients’  funds  and  portfolio  of  securities. 
In  June  2009,  it  was  clarified  that  portfolio 
managers  may  keep  the  funds  of  all  clients 
in  a  separate  bank  account  maintained  by 
the  portfolio  manager  subject  to  conditions 
such as: (a) clear segregation of each client’s 
fund through back office records, (b) non use 
of  funds  of  one  client  for  another  client,  (c) 
maintaining  accounts  with  separate  client-
wise  data  for  their  funds  and  providing 
statement to clients for such accounts at least 
on  monthly  basis;  and  (d)  reconciliation  of 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

client-wise  accounts  with  the  bank  accounts 
on daily basis.

VI.  Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)

i.   Allocation of Debt Investment Limits

SEBI  has  been  following  various 
allocation  methodologies  over  a  period  of 
time  for  allotment  of  debt  investment  limits 
to  FIIs  and  Sub-accounts.  For  some  time, 
allocation  was  done  on  a  quota  basis.  At 
present,  debt  limit  allocation  is  done  on  a 
periodical basis as and when sufficient limits 
are available for allotment.

Based  on  the  allocations  and  the 
utilisation of the allocated debt limits by the 
entities,  a  status  of  utilisation  is  drawn.  If 
sufficient  limits  are  available  for  allocation, 
the  same  are  again  put  up  for  allocation 
through  prevalent  allocation  procedures. 
The allocation of the limits and its utilisation 
status is drawn from respective custodians of 
the entities.

A combination of two methods viz. open 
bidding and first come first served (FCFS) is 
used  for  allocation  of  debt  limits.  However 
during 2009-10 in corporate debt category all 
the allocation was through FCFS only.

Details  of  debt  limits  allocated  to  FIIs 
and sub-account though these two processes 
in this financial year are:

provision.  The  same  was,  accordingly, 
clarified  by  SEBI,  vide  an  interpretative 
circular  dated  August  6,  2009.  The  said 
circular, inter-alia, provided that an acquirer 
holding 55 percent to 75 percent of the shares 
or  voting  rights  in  a  company  may  further 
acquire  upto  a  maximum  of  five  percent 
in  such  company,  in  one  or  more  tranches, 
without  any  restriction  on  the  time-frame 
within which the same can be acquired.

listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  on  stock 

29

Annual Report 2009-10

exchanges. The Office of Investor Assistance 
and  Education  (OIAE)  acts  as  the  single 
window  interface,  interacting  with  investors 
seeking assistance of SEBI.

Investors can submit their grievances in 
any form i.e. plain paper, post card, via e-mail 
etc., at the Head Office at Mumbai or at any 
of  the  Regional  Offices  at  Delhi,  Chennai, 
Kolkata and Ahmedabad. Besides, grievances 
can  also  be  filed  in  standardised  forms  that

grievances  through  the  SEBI  website  (www.
sebi.gov.in). All complaints received by SEBI 
(excluding  those  which  refers/pertain  to 
investigation) are individually acknowledged 
with  unique  number,  which  facilitates 
tracking.

Dedicated  investor  helpline  telephone 
numbers  are  available  for  investors  seeking 
general  guidance  pertaining  to  securities 
markets  and  to  provide  assistance  in  filing 
grievances.  Dedicated  personnel  manning 
the helpline also guide the investors in filing 
up the grievance submission forms as well as 
in determining the appropriate authority for 
their first recourse. Guidance is also provided 
to approach the appropriate authority if their 
grievance is outside the purview of SEBI.

The  grievances  lodged  by  investors 
are  taken  up  with  the  respective  listed 

companies  and  are  continuously  monitored. 
The  company  is  required  to  respond  in 
prescribed  standard  format  in  the  form  of 
Action Taken Report (ATR). Upon the receipt 
of  ATR  the  status  of  grievances  is  updated. 
Where  the  response  of  the  company  is 
insufficient/inadequate,  follow  up  action  is 
initiated.

Grievances  pertaining  to  brokers  and 
depository  participants  are  taken  up  with 
concerned stock exchange and depository for 
redressal  and  monitored  through  periodic 
report  obtained  from  the  stock  exchanges 
and  depositories.  Grievances  pertaining  to 
other intermediaries are taken up with them 
directly for redressal.

System)

SEBI is in the process of upgrading the 
investor grievance redressal mechanism. The 
upgraded mechanism would be a web-based, 
centralised grievance redress system for SEBI. 
The  software  for  the  new  system  is  being 
developed by the National Informatics Centre 
(NIC),  Ministry  of  Information  Technology, 
New Delhi.

The  salient  features  of  the  new  system 

are:

a)  Centralised  complaints  tracking  system 

for entire SEBI.

b)  Grievance  pertaining  to  any  of  the 
Regional  Offices  of  SEBI  can  be  lodged 
from anywhere.

c)  All complaints and Action Taken Report 

to be in electronic mode

d)  Action  taken  and  the  current  status  of 
the  complaint  can  be  accessible  to  the 
investors, online.
Facility  for  online  updation  of  Action 
Taken Reports.

e) 

iv.   Issuance of No Objection Certificate

Companies  raising  capital  through

To  begin  with  BSE  and  NSE  shall 
identify  the  suspended  companies 
which  are  active  by  filing  return  with 
Register of Companies and issue notices 
to  them  for  non-redressal  of  investor 
grievances and non-compliance of listing 
agreement.

BSE  and  NSE  shall  submit  a  report  to 
SEBI in respect of each such suspended 
company  and  their  Directors  and 
Compliance  Officers  which  fails  to 
redress  the  complaints  for  appropriate 
regulatory actions by SEBI.

vi.  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Investor  Protection  and  Education 
Fund) Regulations, 2009
The  Regulations  governing  the 
administration  of  the  Investor  Protection 
and Education Fund (IPEF), were notified on 
May  19,  2009.  These  Regulations  inter  alia 
provide  for  amounts  that  can  be  credited  to 
the fund, its utilisation and also an Advisory 
Committee  for  recommending  utilisation 
of  the  fund.  During  the  year  2009-10,  the 
Advisory Committee met thrice and provided 
inputs  and  suggestions  which  are  under 
various stages of implementation.

vii.  Investor Awareness Division (IAD)

A  separate  division  namely,  the 
Investor  Awareness  Division  (IAD), 
was  created  to  rejuvenate  and  to  bring 
focused  attention  on  the  activities  of  the 
Board  pertaining  to  investor  education 
and  awareness.  IAD  also  handles  work
pertaining  to  financial  literacy  initiatives  of 
the Board.

with  the  designated  stock  exchange,  which 
is  released  by  the  stock  exchange  only  after 
SEBI issues a No Objection Certificate (NOC). 
One of the criteria for issuance of NOC to the 
companies is the  satisfactory  redressal of all 
investor grievances received by SEBI against 
the company.

In  2009-10,  76  NOCs  were  issued  to 
applicant  companies.  In  34  Cases,  NOCs 
were  not  issued  as  the  applications  were 
incomplete or due to unsatisfactory record of 
grievance redressal on their part.

v. 

Investor Grievances against Suspended 
Companies
It  was  observed  that  several  companies 
who  fail  to  redress  investor  grievances  and 
compiling with listing agreement with stock 
exchanges  and  letters  addressed  to  them 
are  returned  undelivered,  are  not  taking 
any  remedial  measures  despite  trading  in 
their  shares  have  been  suspended  by  the 
stock  exchanges.  It  was  also  observed  that 
some  of  these  companies  were  active  in 
their  business  and  filing  their  return  with 
Registrar  of  Companies  to  avoid  declaring 
them as vanishing companies and subsequent 
regulatory actions.

As  recommended  by  a  sub-committee 
constituted in this regard, following course of 
actions are taken:

• 

BSE and NSE display on their respective 
websites  the  names  of  the  companies 
suspended  as  on  date  and  the  names 
of  directors  with  their  DIN/PAN, 
compliance  officers  and  promoters

investor  protection  initiatives  of  the  Board. 
Towards  educating  investors  and  to  spread 
awareness, SEBI continues it association with 
Investor’s Associations (IA) who play a role in 
this regard by conducting investor education 
workshops. Educative material developed by 
SEBI was distributed in these workshops. At

Board. Some of the measures pursuant to the 
feedback  and  suggestions  received  from  the 
IA include:

details  pertaining  to  arbitration  and 
penal  action  against  the  trading 
members and depository participants.

b)  Client  Registration  Procedure:  With 
a  view  to  instill  greater  transparency 
and  discipline  in  the  dealings  between 
the  clients  and  the  stock  brokers,  SEBI 
has  prescribed  requirements  related 
to  dealings  between  a  client  and 
stock  broker.  Some  of  the  prescribed 
requirements  are  client  registration

c)  Sending  Clients  Trade  Details 
by  Exchanges:  To  pre-empt  the 
unauthorised  trading  by  some  brokers 
in  their  client’s  account,  NSE,  BSE 
and  MCX-SX  have  started  sending 
daily  client’s  trade  details  directly  to 
a  few  randomly  selected  clients  for 
their  verification  and  reporting  of  any 
unauthorised  trade  or  discrepancies  in 
trade.

18 schools have implemented the program in 
their schools and more schools are expected 
to implement in the coming years.

SEBI  has  also  taken  up  with  Central 
Board  of  Secondary  Education  (CBSE)  to 
introduce financial literacy in school syllabus 
as an essential life skill at school level.

b)  Association  with  Non-Government 

Organisations (NGOs)
SEBI  explored  the  possibility  of 
associating  with  NGOs  and  other  entities, 
having  experience  in  the  field  of  financial 
literacy.  SEBI  has  partnered  with  Meljol, 
an  NGO  having  experience  in  the  field 
of  promoting  child  rights  and  financial 
education  in  schools.  The  pilot  program 
to  cover  14,550  students  in  281  schools 
through  196  trained  teachers  in  Akola 
and  Thane  districts  of  Maharashtra,  has 
commenced.  This  program  covers  schools 
in  rural  and  tribal  areas  of  Maharashtra, 
having  high  concentration  of  children  from 
underprivileged communities.

by providing investors the wherewithal 
to  make  informed  choice,  all  stock 
exchanges  were  advised  to  post  all 
their  regulatory  orders  and  arbitration 
awards  issued  against  listed  companies 
and  clearing/trading  members  on  their 
websites.

e)  Guidelines  Obtaining  Power  of 
Attorney  (PoA):  To  prevent  unfair 
practice of insisting PoA from all clients 
and  misuse  of  PoA  obtained  by  some 
brokers  and  depository  participants, 
SEBI  has  issued  a  set  of  guidelines  to 
be  followed  by  brokers  and  depository 
participants for obtaining PoA only if it 
is required by clients.

f)  Waiver  of  arbitration  fee:  BSE 
has  waived  the  fees  for  arbitration 
proceedings for claims up to Rs.10 lakh 
for clients as being followed by NSE.

Financial Literacy
School Programs
SEBI initiated financial literacy program 
for  school  students  jointly  with  NISM  in 
2008-09 and positioned it as an important life 
skill  at  the  school  level  targeting  8th  and  9th 
standard students.

In  2009-10  this  initiative  was  taken 
further in which 72 teachers from 36 schools 
were  trained  through  2  workshops.  Study 
material in the form of kits were distributed. 
About  1600  such  kits  were  distributed. 
Participant  teachers  were  given  the  training 
kits  free  of  cost  and  were  also  presented  a 
certificate  of  participation.  During  the  year,

for  the  purpose.  Empanelment  of  Resource 
Person  for  the  western  region  has  already 
commenced.  These  empanelled  Resource 
Persons would also supplement the investor 
education  programs  that  are  conducted 
through  IAs  recognised  by  SEBI,  stock 
exchanges,  depositories  and  trade  bodies 
like AMFI, Association of National Exchange 
Members etc.

X.   Retrospect and Prospects

i.   Retrospect

Indian  economy,  after  witnessing  a 
slowdown  during  2008-09  due  to  global 
financial crisis recovered at a moderated pace 
of 7.4 percent. The increase in manufacturing 
and  industrial  activity  pulled  up  the  overall 
growth rate amidst improved global business 
environment.

The  securities  market  recovered  with 
the  BSE  Sensex  closing  above  the  14,000 
mark on May 18, 2009 post announcement of 
election results. Thereafter, it witnessed a brief 
correction to close at 13,400 on July 13, 2009 
before embarking on an upward trajectory. It 
recorded its highest close at 17,711 on March 
30,  2010.  Nifty  recorded  its  highest  close  at 
5,303 on the same day. BSE Sensex increased 
(year-on-year)  by  80.5  percent  and  Nifty  by 
73.8  percent  in  end-March  2010  over  end-
March 2009. Turnover in the cash segment of 
NSE increased by 50.4 percent to Rs.41,38,023 
crore  and  in  BSE  it  was  up  by  25.3  percent 
to  Rs.13,78,809  crore,  reflecting  increased 
activity in Indian markets. Reflecting the price 
appreciation,  market  capitalisation  (of  BSE) 
to  GDP  ratio  and  the  traded  value  (of  BSE 
and NSE together) to GDP ratio increased to 
100 percent and 89.5 percent, respectively in 
2009-10 from 55.4 percent and 69.1 percent a 
year  ago.  The  recovery  in  securities  market 
was broad-based with a majority of the sectors 

36

registering  price  rise.  Besides  FIIs,  mutual 
funds  and  retail  investors  increased  their 
positions  in  the  secondary  market.  Due  to 
strong  global  and  domestic  macro-economic 
fundamentals, overall market sentiment was 
buoyant throughout the major part of the year.
Derivatives  market  in  India  witnessed 
buoyant  activity  during  2009-10.  In  equity 
derivatives  segment,  there  were  five  indices 
and  190  stocks  as  underlying  on  which 
derivates contracts were traded as on March 
31,  2010.  Turnover  in  equity  derivatives 
segment of NSE increased by 60.4 percent to 
Rs.1,76,63,665  crore  during  2009-10  over  the 
previous fiscal. Currency futures market saw 
introduction  of  contracts  on  new  currency 
pairs  namely,  Euro-Indian  Rupee  (INR), 
Pound  Sterling-INR  and  Japanese  Yen-
INR  apart  from  the  existing  US  Dollar-INR 
ones  from  February  1,  2010.  Turnover  in 
the  currency  futures  segment  of  NSE  was 
Rs.17,82,608  crore  during  2009-10  against 
Rs.1,62,563 crore during 2008-09 (Aug. 2008 - 
Mar. 20009). Turnover in currency futures at 
MCS-SX stood at Rs.19,44,654 during 2009-10 
against Rs.1,48,826 crore during 2008-09 (Oct. 
2008 - Mar. 2009).

The primary market witnessed improved 
activity  during  2009-10.  The  number  of 
companies  which  accessed  the  primary 
market  was  76  in  2009-10  compared  to 
47  in  2008-09.  Amount  mobilised  was 
Rs.57,555  crore  during  2009-10,  as  against 
Rs.16,220  crore  mobilised  during  2008-09. 
The number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) 
increased  to  39  in  2009-10  from  21  in  2008-
09  and  the  number  of  rights  issue  increased 
to  29  from  25  during  the  same  period. 
Resource mobilisation through the Qualified 
Institutions’  Placement  Mode  (QIP)  gained 
prominence during 2009-10 as 62 issues raised 
Rs.42,729  crore  compared  to  2  issues  raising 
Rs.189 crore duing 2008-09.

friendly and to mitigate risks associated with 
the system.

As part of its efforts to make the market 
more efficient, transparent, cost effective and 
safe, the measures like ‘in person verification 
of clients’, regulation of credit rating agencies, 
introduction  of  several  exchange  traded 
derivatives,  standardising  the  contracts 
size,  revision  of  trading  hours,  etc  have 
been  initiated  by  SEBI.  In  its  endeavour 
for  development  of  corporate  debt  market, 
number  of  initiatives  have  been  introduced 
and some more measures are in the offing in 
coming years.

A  series  of  measures  have  been 
introduced for mutual funds for empowering 
the investors so that the mutual fund industry 
can  become  more  resilient  and  achieve 
sustainable growth.

Investor  assistance  and  investor 
education are the prime objectives of SEBI as 
a regulator. As part of the investor education 
initiatives, SEBI has launched many initiatives 
during the past one year through organising 
seminars,  workshops,  investors’  meet  etc.
This  would  help  in  achieving  financial 
inclusion  for  the  investors  in  the  country.  It 
has introduced financial literacy programmes 
in  schools  curriculum  in  collaboration  with 
NISM.  In  years  to  come,  it  proposes  to 
launch  many  such  programmes  for  investor 
education and financial literacy.

In  the  coming  years,  SEBI  would 
continue  its  efforts,  with  a  clear  objective 
of  investor  protection  through  investor 
education  and  market  development.  The 
broad direction in which SEBI plans to move 
will be guided by twin beacons i.e., reduction 
of transaction costs and cutting down the time 
taken in completing the transactions.

There  was  a  net  inflow  of  resources  to 
mutual  funds  during  2009-10.  With  private 
sector mutual funds contributing a major part 
of  the  mobilisation,  there  was  a  net  inflow 
of resources to all mutual funds at Rs.83,080 
crore in 2009-10 compared to a net outflow of 
resources  of  Rs.28,296  crore  in  2008-09.  The 
exposure  of  mutual  funds  to  debt  securities 
increased vis-à-vis equity. The FIIs continued 
to  invest  in  Indian  market.  The  number  of 
SEBI registered FIIs went up to 1,713 by end 
March 2010 from 1,635 a year ago. Their net 
purchase in equities was USD 23,248 million 
in  2009-10  against  a  net  sales  of  USD  10,324 
million in the previous year.

ii.   Prospects

The  Indian  Securities  market  remained 
stable  during  2009-10,  as  the  global  markets 
too  witnessed  improved  stability  with 
indication  of  prospects  of  firm  recovery. 
However,  fiscal  concerns  remain  strong  as 
sovereign  risks  continue  to  be  a  cause  of 
concern  in  some  European  countries.  SEBI 
would  continue  with  its  efforts  to  deepen 
and  widen  the  Indian  market  and  take 
appropriate  regulatory  measures  to  make 
them resilient enough to withstand volatility.
SEBI has been pursuing to its objectives 
of  investor  protection,  investor  education, 
and  market  developments.  During  the  year, 
it has initiated a series of policy initiatives in 
primary market to make the market investor 
friendly  and  to  mitigate  risks.  Among  the 
others, the measures include introduction of 
the  concept  of  anchor  investor,  introducing 
pure  auction  in  the  FPO  process,  extension 
of  ASBA  mechanism  and  strengthening  of 
the  regulatory  framework  governing  public 
offerings. It would continue to work towards 
making the issue process transparent, investor

PART TWO: REVIEW OF TRENDS AND OPERATIONS

Indian  securities  markets  witnessed 
sharp  turnaround  in  2009-10.  Where  as 
the  markets  were  in  downswing  in  2008-
09  in  consonance  with  the  downward 
spiral  in  global  equity  markets  triggered 
by  international  financial  crisis,  beginning 
of  the  financial  year  2009-10  witnessed 
upward  swing  in  the  market.  Fresh 
upward  movement  was  triggered  following 
unambiguous  results  in  the  union  elections 
and  a  period  of  stability  across  the  market 
got  initiated.  The  upward  swing  following 
the election results was so sudden and strong 
that Indian stock exchanges were shut down 
temporarily due to operation of circuit filters.
In global arena, concerns for deepening 
of  recession  pervaded  in  the  developed 
economies  got  replaced  with  concerns  for  a 
double dip. However, as the year progressed, 
the picture at global markets became better.

Foreign  Institutional  Investors  (FIIs) 
made  a  record  net  purchase  in  the  Indian 
equity  market  in  2009-10,  of  Rs.1,42,658 
crore  surpassing  the  previous  high  of  2007-
08  inflows  (Rs.66,179  crore).  This  reflects 
confidence in Indian economy and the same 
was  also  highlighted  in  Economic  Survey 
2009-10. Large FII inflows in the country led 
to strengthening of Rupee against US Dollar.
There  was  a  substantial  improvement 
in  the  resource  mobilisation  by  corporates 
in  the  primary  market  in  2009-10  compared 
to  the  previous  year.  Similarly,  mobilisation 
of  resources  by  mutual  funds  exceeded 
redemptions resulting in substantial inflows.

1.

PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET
The primary market segment witnessed 
positive trend during 2009-10. Earlier, in 2008-
09, the volatility in stock markets, slowdown 
in economic growth, slackening of expansion 

plans  by  corporates  and  poor  investor 
response had led to a sharp fall in the number 
of  issues  and  amounts  raised  through  the 
primary market.

I.  Resource Mobilisation

During  2009-10,  76  issues  accessed  the 
primary  market  and  raised  Rs.57,555  crore 
through public (47) and rights issues (29) as 
against 47 issues which raised Rs.16,220 crore 
in  2008-09  through  public  (22)  and  rights 
issues (25) (Table 2.1). Due to better financial 
environment,  there  were  39  IPOs  during 
2009-10  as  against  21  during  2008-09.  The 
amount  raised  through  IPOs  during  2009-10 
was significantly higher at Rs.24,696 crore as 
compared  to  Rs.2,083  crore  during  2008-09. 
The share of public issues in the total resource 
mobilisation increased to 85.6 percent during 
2009-10 from 22.1 percent in 2008-09 whereas 
share  of  rights  issues  declined  from  77.9 
percent in 2008-09 to 14.5 percent in 2009-10 
(Chart 2.1).

Chart  2.1  represents  the  relative  share 
of  the  three  modes  of  resource  mobilisation 
namely,  IPOs,  FPOs,  and  rights  issues.  It  is 
observed  that  the  share  of  IPOs  has  ranged 
from 12.8 percent to 85.1 percent; FPOs from 
zero percent to 80.9 percent and rights issues 
from 4.3 percent to 77.9 percent.

There  were  three  public  issues  of  non-
convertible  debentures  (NCDs)  amounting 
to Rs.2,500 crore in 2009-10 as compared to a 
single issue of Rs.1500 crore in 2008-09 which 
shows  better  appetite  among  investors  for 
NCDs  in  2009-10  as  compared  to  previous 
year.

In  order  to  make  Indian  markets  more 
competitive  and  efficient  and  to  facilitate 
quicker  resource  mobilisation  by  companies 
from  institutional  investors,  an  additional

mode for listed companies to raise funds from 
domestic  market  in  the  form  of  Qualified 
Institutional Placement (QIP) was introduced 
in May 2006. Securities which can be issued 

through  QIP  are  equity  shares  or  any 
securities  other  than  warrants,  which  are 
convertible into or exchangeable with equity 
shares.

39

Annual Report 2009-10

QIP as a mode of resource mobilisation 
picked  up  pace  during  2007-08  raising 
Rs.25,525 crore from the market. However, it 
declined in 2008-09 to Rs.189 crore reflecting 
the  general  subdued  trend  in  primary 
markets.  Similarly,  number  of  companies 
accessing QIP route also declined from 36 in 
2007-08 to two in 2008-09.

In contrast to the previous financial year, 
2009-10  proved  to  be  a  better  year  for  QIP 
issues.  In  2009-10,  Indian  companies  raised 
Rs.42,729 crore by way of 62 QIP issues which 
is the highest amount raised under QIP route 
in last three years (Table 2.2).

The  reason  for  decline  in  resource 
mobilisation  through  QIP  route  in 
2008-09  was  delay  of  expansion  plans  and 
conservation of cash by Indian companies to 
counter uncertainty in the global markets.

II.  Sector-wise Resource Mobilisation

Sector-wise  classification  reveals  that 
70 private sector and six public sector issues 
mobilised resources through primary market 
during  2009-10  as  compared  to  47  private 
sector  issues  in  2008-09.  These  companies 
raised  Rs.57,555  crore  though  76  issues  in 
2009-10  as  compared  to  Rs.16,220  crore 
through  47  issues  in  2008-09  (Table  2.3). 
The  share  of  private  sector  in  total  resource 
mobilisation  declined  from  100  percent  in 
2008-09 to 45.9 percent in 2009-10 (Chart 2.2). 
The analysis of last eight years since 2002-03 
reveals  that  2008-09  was  the  only  financial 
year  wherein  the  public  sector  companies 
did  not  participate  in  resource  mobilisation 
through primary market.

III.  Size-wise Resource Mobilisation

About  87.7  percent  of  resource 
mobilisation  was  through  public  issues  of 
issue-size above Rs.500 crore during 2009-10 
compared to 78.1 percent during the previous 
financial year (Table 2.4). Also, the number of 
issues under category of issues having size of 
Rs.500 crore or above increased to 21 in 2009-
10 from six in 2008-09.

The average size of the issue more than 
doubled  in  2009-10  to  Rs.757  crore  from 
Rs.345 crore in 2008-09. Not only the average 
size of issues improved substantially in 2009-
10, but also the fact that issues under Rs.100 
crore  constituted  just  2.2  percent  of  total 
resources  mobilisation  shows  that  bigger 
issues were clearly the flavour of the market.
There  were  30  mega  issues  in  2009-10

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

The  largest  mega  issue  during  2009-10 
was  of  a  Public  Sector  Undertaking  (PSU), 
namely,  NMDC  Limited  (Rs.9,967.3  crore) 
which was followed by again PSUs, namely, 
NTPC  Ltd  (Rs.8,478.8  crore)  and  NHPC 
Ltd  (Rs.6,038.6  crore).  This  was  part  of 
Government  of  India’s  disinvestment  plan 
under which Government offloaded part of its 
stake in NMDC and NTPC through FPOs and 
in NHPC through IPO. The combined size of 
these three issues constituted almost half (45.3 
percent) of the total resources mobilised by all 
companies in 2009-10 through mega issues.

IV.  Industry-wise Resource 

Mobilisation
Industry-wise  classification  reveals  that 
Power  sector  accounted  for  43.9  percent  of 
total  resource  mobilisation  in  the  primary 
market  (Table  2.6)  as  number  of  power 
sector  companies,  namely,  Adani  Power, 
Indiabulls Power, NTPC, NHPC etc, accessed 
the  primary  market.  The  power  sector  was 
followed  by  Banks/FIs  with  5.5  percent, 
Cement  and  Construction  with  4.8  percent 
and  Entertainment  sector  with  4.3  percent. 
In terms of number of issues, Entertainment

SECONDARY SECURITIES 
MARKET

I.   Equity Market in India

Equity  markets  witnessed  significant 
uptrend  during  2009-10  as  compared  to 
downward  and  volatile  trend  in  2008-09. 
However,  at  times,  the  domestic  markets 
reflected  the  uncertainties  in  international 
financial  market  during  the  financial  year 
under review.

Markets  were  characterised  by  some 
bouts  of  volatility  during  the  year,  but  it 
rewarded  investors  by  giving  five  year  best 
return  in  2009-10.  The  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P 
CNX  Nifty  appreciated  by  80.5  percent  and 
73.8  percent,  respectively,  over  March  31, 

2009  (Chart  2.3).  The  BSE  Sensex  increased 
7819 points to close at two year high level at 
17528 on March 31, 2010 from 9709 on March 
31, 2009. The S&P CNX Nifty also increased 
2228 points to close at 5249 points at the end 
of March 2010 over 3021 at the end of March 
2009  mainly  driven  by  higher  growth  rate, 
positive  sentiments  in  market,  better  global 
environment, and FII inflows.

Indian markets had recorded substantial 
decline  and  volatility  in  2008-09.  However, 
the  environment  improved  in  2009-10  and 
got  better  with  every  subsequent  quarter.  In 
tandem  with  the  increase  in  stock  prices  in 
2009-10,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in 
turnover and market capitalisation across the 
board (Table 2.7).

In  the  cash  segment,  the  turnover  at 
BSE  and  NSE  increased  by  25.4  percent  and 
50.4  percent  respectively  during  2009-10 
as  compared  to  decline  witnessed  at  BSE 
and  NSE  by  30.3  percent  and  22.5  percent,

respectively  during  2008-09.  Derivatives 
turnover  showed  substantial  decline  at  BSE 
by 98.1 percent while that at NSE gained by 
60.4 percent over the previous year.

In  2009-10,  global  equity  markets 
improved  significantly  and  some  markets 
especially  emerging  markets  showed  sharp 

turnaround.  This  was  unlike  the  situation 
witnessed in 2008-09 when the global equity 
markets  were  dominated  by  the  financial 
turmoil  and  the  signs  of  severe  recession 
inflicted by the deteriorating financial markets.
During  2009-10,  all  the  equity  markets 
witnessed  uptrend,  however,  in  different 

45

Annual Report 2009-10

magnitude.  The  upward  trend  was  the 
highest  for  BUX  index  of  Hungary  (118.9 
percent)  followed  by  Argentina  IBG  (112.7 
percent)  and  Russian  CRTX  index  (104.8 
percent).  However,  the  Indian  benchmark 
indices  namely  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX 
Nifty gave year on year return of 80.5 percent 
and 73.8 percent respectively in 2009-10.

II.  Performance of Sectoral Indices

There  was  an  across  the  board  increase 
in  broad-based  and  sectoral  indices  in  2009-
10. Among the broad-based indices of shares 
listed  on  BSE,  BSE  100,  BSE  200  and  BSE 
500  recorded  an  increase  of  88  percent,  93 
percent and 97 percent respectively over the 
previous  year  (Chart  2.5).  Similarly,  among 
the indices of shares listed on NSE, the S&P 
CNX  500,  CNX  Nifty  Junior  and  CNX  Mid-
cap increased by 88 percent, 148 percent and 
126 percent respectively in 2009-10 (Table 2.8).

The  BSE  Small-cap  index  recorded  an 
increase  of  161.7  percent  in  2009-10. Among 
the  sectoral  indices,  highest  increase  was 
recorded by BSE Metal index (210.2 percent), 
BSE Consumer Durables (159.7 percent) and 
BSE  Auto  index  (150.6  percent)  (Table  2.8 
and 2.9). While the metal index reflected the 
strengthening  of  metal  prices,  the  general 
upward trend in the economy and industrial 
production  got  reflected  in  increase  in  the 
capital goods and auto indices.

The  movement  of  sectoral  indices  at 
NSE is depicted in Chart 2.6. During 2009-10, 
the  highest  increase  was  witnessed  in  CNX 
IT  (152.6  percent),  followed  by  CNX  Bank 
(128.9  percent)  and  CNX  Petrochemicals 
(114.7  percent).  Of  the  other  indices  at  NSE, 
the  highest  increase  was  witnessed  in  CNX 
Nifty Junior (148.2 percent), followed by Nifty 
Midcap 50 (131.2 percent), and CNX Midcap 
(126.1 percent).

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

III.  Turnover in the Indian Stock Market
In  tandem  with  the  upward  trend  in 
equity  prices,  there  was  an  increase  in  the 
trading volumes in stock exchanges in 2009-
10.  During  2009-10,  turnover  of  all  stock 
exchanges  in  the  cash  segment  increased 
by  43.3  percent  to  Rs.55,18,470  crore  from 
Rs.38,52,579 crore in 2008-09 (Table 2.10). BSE 
and NSE together contributed 99.9 percent of 
the turnover, of which NSE accounted for 74.9 
percent  in  the  total  turnover  in  cash  market 
whereas  BSE  accounted  for  24.9  percent 

to  the  total.  Apart  from  NSE  and  BSE,  the 
only  two  stock  exchanges  which  recorded 
turnover during 2009-10 were Calcutta Stock 
Exchange  Ltd.  and  UPSE.  There  was  hardly 
any  transaction  on  other  stock  exchanges. 
Month-wise, BSE and NSE together recorded 
the highest turnover in June 2009 followed by 
July 2009 and May 2009 (Table 2.11).

City-wise  distribution  of  turnover  of 
cash segments at NSE and BSE indicates the 
all-India  spread  of  the  stock  markets  (Table 
2.12). As in the earlier years, Mumbai/Thane

The  market  capitalisation  of  BSE 
increased  by  99.8  percent  to  Rs.61,65,619 
crore  in  2009-10  from  Rs.30,86,075  crore  in

V.  Stock Market Indicators

The  market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio 
is  an  important  parameter  for  evaluation  of 
stock  markets.  The  liquidity  of  the  market 
can be measured by the traded value to GDP 
ratio, i.e., value of the shares traded to GDP 
at  current  market  prices.  Excluding  2008-09, 
since  2003-04,  there  has  been  a  considerable 
improvement  in  the  market  capitalisation  to

GDP  ratio.  The  BSE  market  capitalisation  to 
GDP  ratio  had  improved  from  43.4  percent 
in  2003-04  to  100.0  percent  in  last  financial 
year.  Similarly,  at  NSE  also  the  ratio  has 
increased  from  40.5  percent  to  97.5  percent 
over the same period (Table 2.15). Moreover, 
uptrend in the stock market in 2009-10 led to 
substantial  increase  in  market  capitalisation 
to GDP ratios of BSE and NSE. It increased to 
almost double of its value from the previous 
year figures at both the exchanges.

The  turnover  to  GDP  ratio  was  the 
highest in 2009-10 under derivatives segment. 
The  all-India  cash  turnover  to  GDP  ratio 

increased to 89.5 percent in 2009-10 from 69.1 
percent in 2008-09. In the derivative segment 
also, the turnover to GDP ratio increased from 
197.7  percent  in  2008-09  to  286.6  percent  in 
2009-10.

The  valuation  of  the  shares  might  be 
gauged  from  the  price-earning  ratio.  The 
AS  30  index  of  Australia  and  NASDAQ 
Composite  of  the  U.S.  had  the  highest  P/E 
ratio  in  2009-10.  Among  the  indices  of 
emerging markets analysed, SHCOMP index 
of  China  and  TWSE  index  of  Taiwan  had 
higher P/E ratio in 2009-10 than that of Indian 
benchmark indices (Chart 2.7).

Annual Report 2009-10

At the end of March 2010, the P/E ratio 
of  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  were 
21.3  and  22.3  respectively  as  compared  to 
13.7  and  14.3  respectively  as  on  March  31, 
2009  (Table  2.16).  The  P/E  ratio  of  Indian 
indices witnessed significant increase in May 
2009  after  the  results  of  Union  Government 
elections were declared and steadily increased 
thereafter. However, towards the last quarter, 
there was marginal decline in the valuations 
of  majority  of  broad  based  and  sectoral 
indices.

Price  to  book  value  ratio  is  the  ratio  of 
market  value  of  equity  to  the  book  value  of 
equity. There was an increase in the P/B ratio 
of  indices  in  2009-10  compared  to  2008-09. 
The P/B ratio was the highest for the CNX IT 
index at 7.2, followed by BSE 100 at 4.1, and 

the benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and S&P 
CNX Nifty at 3.9 and 3.7, respectively (Table 
2.17).

VI.  Volatility in Stock Markets

Average  daily  volatility  of  a  stock  or 
index is measured by calculating the standard 
deviation  of  logarithmic  returns  during  a 
certain period. In 2009-10, the stock markets 
around  the  world  displayed  lesser  volatility 
as compared to 2008-09. Month-wise, average 
daily  volatility  in  the  Indian  benchmark 
indices  was  the  highest  in  May  2009  (Table 
2.18). The lowest volatility in the benchmark 
indices was noticed during March 2010.

The annualised volatility of BSE Sensex 
decreased from 43.6 percent in 2008-09 to 29.2 
percent  in  2009-10.  Similar  trend  was  also

observed for S&P CNX Nifty, which recorded 
annualised volatility of 29.4 percent in 2009-10 
compared to 41.5 percent in the previous year.

An international comparison of volatility 
in  stock  returns  indicates  that  volatility 
was  lesser  in  2009-10  in  both  emerging  and 
developed  markets  (Table  2.19  and  Chart 
2.8)  as  compared  to  that  in  2008-09.  During 
2009-10, volatility was high in majority of the 
markets in the month of April 2009 and May 
2009 as compared to other months in the year. 
As per Bloomberg data, Indian markets were 
the third most volatile in the world. Among 
the  developed  markets,  the  annualised

BSE and NSE. The number of securities listed

in  BSE  was  3,371  as  compared  to  3,246  in 
2008-09 (Table 2.20). Similarly, the number of 
securities traded in NSE was higher at 1,401 
in 2009-10 compared to 1,301 in 2008-09. The 
percentage  share  of  securities  traded  at  BSE 
above  100  days  marginally  increased  from 
87.2  percent  in  2008-09  to  88.6  percent  in

VIII.  Activities of Stock Exchanges

Over  the  years,  NSE  and  BSE  have 
emerged as the nation-wide stock exchanges 
of  the  country  contributing  more  than  99 
percent of the total turnover. Apart from NSE 
and  BSE,  only  Calcutta  Stock  Exchange  Ltd. 
and UPSE reported some transactions (Table 
2.22).

The  number  of  shares  traded  and 
delivered increased at BSE, NSE, and Calcutta 
Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  The  value  of  shares 
delivered  also  increased  at  these  stock 
exchanges.  Of  the  total  shares  traded,  NSE’s 
share  was  65.9  percent,  followed  by  BSE 
which  constituted  33.9  percent  of  the  total 
shares  traded.  NSE  had  a  share  of  74.6 
percent in the total value of shares delivered 
followed by BSE with 25.4 percent share.

Majority  of  the  other  stock  exchanges 
were  inactive  and  their  operations  were 
confined  to  their  subsidiaries,  which, 
have  taken  membership  of  BSE  and  NSE.

in  derivatives  is  dominated  by  NSE,  which 
has  a  share  of  more  than  99  percent  of  the 
total  turnover.  Over  the  years,  derivatives 
market  has  generated  turnover  substantially 
higher  than  that  of  the  equity  segment. 
During  2009-10,  turnover  of  derivatives 
market was 4.6 times of the cash turnover on 
all-India equity exchanges (Chart 2.9).

The turnover in the derivatives segment 
at NSE recorded a mixed trend during 2009-
10  (Table  2.27).  The  highest  turnover  was 
recorded  in  November  2009  (Rs.16,61,816 
crore)  followed  by  July  2009  (Rs.15,73,509 
crore) and February 2010 (Rs.15,69,877 crore). 
Growth  in  the  derivatives  turnover  at  NSE 
was the highest in June 2009 when turnover 
rose by 24.8 percent, followed November 2009 
(10.1  percent)  and  April  2009  (9.9  percent). 
The average daily turnover at NSE in 2009-10 

increased  by  59.1  percent  to  Rs.72,097  crore 
from Rs.45,311 crore in 2008-09.

The  total  number  of  contracts  traded 
in  the  derivative  segment  of  NSE  rose 
marginally  by  3.4  percent  to  67,92,93,922 
in  2009-10  from  65,73,90,497  in  2008-09, 
whereas,  at  BSE,  the  number  of  contracts 
traded  declined  substantially  from  4,96,502 
in  2008-09  to  9,026  in  2009-10.  The  value 
of  the  contracts  traded  in  the  derivative 
segment  of  NSE  increased  by  60.4  percent 
to  Rs.1,76,63,665  crore  in  2009-10  from 
Rs.1,10,10,468  crore  in  2008-09,  whereas  the 
turnover  at  the  derivatives  segment  of  BSE 
declined  to  Rs.234  crore  in  2009-10  from 
Rs.11,775 crore in 2008-09. The open interest 
in  the  derivative  segment  increased  by  69.8 
percent to Rs.97,978 crore at the end of 2009-
10 from Rs.57,705 crore at the end of 2008-09.

A  clear-cut  change  was  seen  in  the 
product  composition  and  turnover  in  the 
derivatives  market  in  India  (Table  2.28). 
Futures  in  general  and  single  stock  futures, 
in  particular,  used  to  dominate  derivatives 
product  in  India  with  over  86  percent  share 
in  total  derivatives  turnover  every  year. 
However,  the  picture  has  been  changing 
in  last  couple  of  years  in  favour  of  Index 
Options.  During  2009-10,  the  largest  share 
in  the  total  derivatives  turnover  has  been 
contributed  by  Index  options  with  45.5 
percent  share  in  it  whereas  the  share  of 
index options in the total turnover in 2008-09 
was  33.9  percent.  In  2009-10,  Index  options 
were  followed  by  Single  Stock  Futures  (29.4 

percent) and Index Futures (22.3 percent). The 
share of single stock options improved from 
2.1 percent in 2008-09 to 2.9 percent in 2009-
10 (Chart 2.10).

Product-wise  share  in  the  open  interest 
shows that the notional value of outstanding 
contracts  was  the  highest  for  Index  Options 
(Rs.47,808  crore)  followed  by  single  Stock 
Futures  (Rs.32,053  crore),  Index  Futures 
(Rs.14,979 crore), and Stock Options (Rs.3,137 
crore).  The  tables  2.29  to  2.32  show  the 
product-wise trends in the derivative market 
in India during the recent years.

The transactions undertaken by trading-
cum-clearing  members  constituted  57.2

Box 2.1: Currency Options

Currency  options  trading  began  in  the  1970s  in  the 
venue  of  the  listed  futures  and  options  markets  of 
Chicago,  Philadelphia,  and  London.  Trading  was 
concentrated  in  currency  options  on  only  a  handful 
of major exchange rates. A structural change occurred 
in  the  1990s,  when  the  bulk  of  trading  in  currency 
options  migrated  “upstairs”  to  bank  dealing  rooms, 
to  the  detriment  of  the  organised  exchanges.  Once 
installed  in  the  domain  of  the  inter  bank  foreign 
exchange market, option trading exploded in volume. 
Further, currency options began to key off of the full 
gamut of exchange rates.

A  currency  option  is  similar  to  a  stock  or  an  index 
option except that the underlying asset is a currency 
rather  than  a  stock  or  an  index.  In  a  currency 
option, the buyer of option gets the right but not the 
obligation  to  buy  (call  option)  or  sell  (put  option)  a 
predetermined amount of currency against the other 
at  a  predetermined  exchange  rate  on  or  before  a 
predetermined date in future. The buyer of an option 
is  called  ‘holder’  whereas  the  seller  of  an  option 
is  called  ‘writer’.  The  holder  enjoys  asymmetrical 
payoff unlike a symmetrical payoff in case of a futures 
contract.

The  market  for  currency  options  is  the  deepest  in 
terms of trading volumes and most liquid of all types 
of options markets in the world. One reason for this 
is that the currency options are attractive investments 
for speculators since they require a limited investment 
and  do  not  have  any  risk  other  than  losing  the 
premium  paid  up  front.  This  limited  downside  and 
unlimited upside makes currency options as popular 
trading instruments.

Currency options are predominantly traded over the 
counter (OTC) and are subjected to lesser regulations 
as compared to exchange traded products. However, 
Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange,  the  International 
Securities Exchange, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange 
which  have  permitted  exchange  traded  currency 
options. Outside USA, currency options are traded on 
centres  including  Singapore,  Amsterdam,  Paris  and 
Brussels.

In  the  United  States,  exchange-traded  foreign 

exchange  options  were  introduced  in  1982.  The 
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  has 
jurisdiction over options on foreign currencies traded 
on national securities exchanges, while the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates options 
on  foreign  currency  futures  and  options  on  foreign 
currencies traded on exchanges that are not securities 
exchanges.

Exchange-traded  currency  options,  like  exchange-
traded  futures,  utilise  standardised  contracts 
with  respect  to  the  amount  of  the  underlying 
currency,  the  exercise  price,  and  the  expiration  date. 
Transactions  are  cleared  through  the  clearinghouses 
of  the  exchanges  on  which  they  are  traded,  and  the 
clearinghouses  guarantee  each  party  against  default 
of  the  other.  In  general,  the  option  buyer  who  has 
no  further  financial  obligation  after  he  has  paid  the 
premium  is  not  required  to  make  margin  payments. 
On  the  contrary,  the  option  writer  who  takes  all  the 
financial risk is required to put up initial margin and 
to make additional (maintenance) margin payments if 
the market price moves adversely to his/her position.

It  is  difficult  to  be  precise  about  overall  size  of 
currency  options  market  because  the  majority  of 
trading in currency options is done over the counter 
and  never  gets  reported.  However,  some  rough 
estimates are reported in a survey done by the Bank 
for International Settlements (BIS) every three years.

As  per  latest  triennial  survey  available,  BIS  survey 
2007,  the  average  daily  turnover  of  currency  options 
more  than  doubled  from  USD  87  billion  in  1998  to 
USD  212  billion  in  2007.  Thus,  there  is  significant 
increase in the use of currency options among traders. 
As  per  previous  triennial  BIS  surveys,  the  average 
daily  turnover  of  currency  options  in  2001  and  2004 
were USD 60 billion and 117 billion respectively which 
shows  decline  in  traded  volumes  at  the  start  of  new 
millennium but they have picked up speed after dot 
com burst.

The  RBI-SEBI  Standing  Technical  Committee 
is  working  on  the  operational  framework  for 
introduction of exchange traded currency options on 
USD-INR currency pair.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

Box 2.2: Comparative Study of Futures on USD: INR versus OTC 

Currency Forward Market

Background:
Currency  futures  trading  (USD/INR  pair),  in  India 
started  on  August  29,  2008  on  the  National  Stock 
Exchange  (NSE),  followed  by  trading  on  MCX  Stock 
Exchange  (MCX-SX)  and  thereafter  on  Bombay 
Stock  Exchange  (BSE).  Trading  in  currency  futures, 
however, mainly takes place on NSE and MCX-SX. A 
comparison  of  the  two  markets  i.e.  Exchange  traded 
futures  and  the  OTC  currency  forward  market  in 
USD:INR has been carried out based on the following 
parameters:
(i)  Turnover  in  USD:  INR  futures  vis-à-vis  OTC 

currency forward market.

(ii)  Bid-Ask  spread  in  exchange  traded  USD:INR 

market vis-à-vis OTC currency forward market.

(iii)  Difference  in  the  futures  and  forward  rates  for 

USD: INR for same duration contracts.

Turnover in USD: INR futures vis-à-vis 
OTC forward market:
It can be seen from the Table below that the exchange 
traded  Indian  currency  futures  market  has  grown 
considerably since trading started in August 2008. The 
turnover in USD:INR futures as a percentage of OTC 
currency  forward  turnover  has  increased  from  7.2 
percent in November, 2008 to 80.4 percent in October, 
2009.

Bid Ask spread in Exchange traded USD: INR 
market vis-à-vis OTC currency forward market:
The bid ask spread gives an indication of the cost and 
ease  with  which  a  contract  can  be  traded. A  narrow 
(tight)  bid  ask  means  that  the  costs  of  entering  and 
exiting a trade are low. Consequently, a liquid market 
requires the bid ask spread to be narrow.

It can be observed from the Table below that around 
95  percent  of  the  trading  at  NSE  and  99  percent  of 
trading at MCX-SX in USD: INR futures takes place at 
a narrow spread of less than or equal to half a paisa as 
against only 7 paise for OTC currency forward market.

Box 2.2: Comparative Study of Futures on USD: INR versus OTC 

Currency Forward Market (contd.)

Difference in the futures and forward rates on 
USD: INR for same duration contracts:
The  Graph  below  plots  the  difference  between  one 
month futures and forward rates on USD: INR, for the 
same duration contracts. It can be seen that the rates in 
the two markets are getting gradually aligned.

Based on the above comparison between the Exchange 
traded USD: INR futures and OTC currency forward 
market, the following can be concluded:

(a)  The  turnover  in  USD:  INR  futures,  both  in 
absolute  terms,  as  well  as  a  percentage  of  OTC 
currency  forward  turnover,  has  been  increasing 

ever  since  the  inception  of  the  currency  futures 
trading.

(b)  Almost all the trading in Exchange traded USD: 
INR  futures  market  takes  place  at  a  spread  of 
less  than  or  equal  to  half  a  paisa,  whereas  the 
comparable  figure  for  the  currency  forward 
market is around 7 paise.

(c)  While the USD: INR futures and the forward rates 
diverged at the beginning of trading in the futures 
market; the rates have gradually converged which 
reflects  disappearance  of  arbitrage  opportunities 
between the two markets.

C.  Trends in Interest Rates Derivatives

Trading  in  10  Year  Notional  coupon 
bearing  Government  of  India  (GoI)  security 
Futures  started  at  NSE  on  August  31,  2009. 

The  trends  in  turnover  and  open  interest  in 
Interest  Rate  Derivatives  (10  Year  Notional 
coupon bearing GoI security Futures) at NSE 
is depicted in Table 2.36.

3. TRENDS IN THE BOND MARKET

I.  Corporate Bond Market

The  trend  in  corporate  bond  markets, 
viz.,  OTC  trades  and  trades  reported  on  the 
exchanges is shown in Table 2.37. The number 
of  trades  in  corporate  bonds  during  2009-

10  increased  by  68.5  percent  in  comparison 
to  2008-09.  In  comparison  to  increase  in 
number  of  trades,  increase  in  the  volume 
of  trades  during  2009-10  is  very  significant. 
This increase is mainly attributed to increase 
in  volume  of  trades  reported  at  FIMMDA 
by  218.5  percent  followed  by  NSE  at  206.9 
percent and BSE at 42.9 percent.

placements have also remained as one of the 
preferred  modes  of  raising  debt  funds.  The 
rise in funds mobilised could also be possibly 
attributed  to  issuers  preferring  the  domestic 
debt markets as a primary source of corporate 
debt.

II.  Wholesale Debt Market

During  2009-10,  turnover  in  the 
Wholesale  Debt  Market  (WDM)  segment 
increased to Rs.5,63,816 crore from Rs.3,35,950 
crore  in  2008-09.  The  net  traded  value  and 
average  daily  traded  value  increased  by 
67.8  percent  and  66.3  percent,  respectively 
during the same period (Table 2.40). Also, the 
number of trades increased by 49.3 percent to 
24,069 in 2009-10 from 16,129 in 2008-09. The 

net  traded  value  started  increasing  towards 
the  start  of  second  quarter  and  in  the  third 
quarter.  The  highest  turnover  was  recorded 
in November 2009 (Rs.64,999 crore) followed 
by  September  2009  (Rs.58,674  crore)  and 
January  2010  (Rs.57,036  crore).  Number  of 
trades was the highest for July 2009 followed 
by November 2009.

Instrument-wise  break  up  of  the 
securities  traded  at  the  WDM  segment  of 
NSE indicates the dominance of Government 
securities  though  the  share  of  the  G-sec  in 
the traded value decreased to 58.2 percent in 
2009-10  from  69.8  percent  in  2008-09  (Table 
2.41).  The  share  of  Treasury  bills  marginally 
declined from 16.9 percent in 2008-09 to 16.5

‘others’ which include mainly corporate debt 
securities, increased from 4.4 percent in 2008-
09 to 9.9 percent in 2009-10. The share of PSU/
institutional bonds also rose from 8.9 percent 
in 2008-09 to 15.4 percent in 2009-10.

Trading members dominated the WDM 
segment with a share of 49.3 percent in total 
turnover  in  2009-10  as  compared  to  44.7 
percent  in  2008-09  (Table  2.42).  While  the 
share  of  Indian  banks  marginally  increased 
to 19.9 percent in 2009-10 from 18.1 percent in 
2008-09, that of financial institutions, mutual 
funds,  primary  dealers  and  foreign  banks 
declined over the previous year.

4. MUTUAL FUNDS

Mutual  funds  play  an  important  role 
in  mobilising  the  household  savings  for 
deployment  in  capital  markets.  The  gross 
mobilisation  of  resources  by  all  mutual 
funds  during  2009-10  was  at  Rs.1,00,19,022 
crore  compared  to  Rs.54,26,353  crore  during 
the  previous  year  indicating  an  increase 
of  84.7  percent  over  the  previous  year 
(Table  2.43).  Redemption  also  rose  by  82.2 
percent to Rs.99,35,942 crore in 2009-10 from 
Rs.54,54,650  crore  in  2008-09.  All  mutual 
funds,  put  together,  recorded  a  net  inflow 
of Rs.83,080 crore in 2009-10 as compared to 
an outflow of Rs.28,296 crore in 2008-09. The

at  the  end  of  March  2010  from  Rs.4,17,300 
crore at the end of March 2009.

Unlike  the  previous  year,  private 
sector  mutual  funds  dominated  resource 
mobilisation  efforts  during  2009-10.  In  fact 
the  net  inflow  was  the  highest  from  private 
sector  mutual  funds  at  Rs.54,928  crore  as 

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

against  a  net  outflow  of  Rs.34,018  crore 
in  2008-09  (Table  2.44).  UTI  mutual  fund 
recorded  a  net  inflow  of  Rs.15,653  crore 
compared to net outflow of Rs.3,659 crore in 
2008-09. Net inflows were recorded by public 
sector mutual funds in 2009-10 amounting to 
Rs.12,499  crore  compared  to  Rs.9,380  crore 
in  the  previous  year.  While  all  the  open-
ended and interval schemes of mutual funds 
recorded positive net inflows, the close-ended 
schemes  witnessed  net  outflows  during  the 
financial year.

Gross  mobilisation  of  resources  under 
open-ended  schemes  during  2009-10  was 
Rs.99,76,363  crore,  of  which,  about  76.8 
percent  was  raised  by  the  private  sector 
mutual funds followed by public sector funds 
(14.4  percent)  and  UTI  MF  (8.8  percent). 
Similarly,  gross  resources  mobilised  under 
close-ended schemes stood at Rs.25,551 crore 
in 2009-10, of which private sector accounted 
for  88.6  percent  followed  by  public  sector 
funds (5.8 percent) and UTI MF (5.6 percent).
Scheme-wise  pattern  reveals  the 
domination of income/debt oriented schemes 
in total resource mobilisation during 2009-10 
(Table  2.45).  During  2009-10,  there  was  net 
outflow  from  balanced  schemes  and  Fund

FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL 
INVESTMENT
Foreign  Institutional  Investors  play  an 
important  role  in  Indian  securities  markets. 
Since  1992-93,  when  FIIs  were  allowed 
entry  into  Indian  financial  markets,  foreign 
institutional  investment  has  increased  over 
the  years  except  in  1998-99  and  2008-09.  In 
tandem with the boom in stock markets and 
sound  global  scenario,  investments  by  FIIs 
into India were quite high in last few years, 
particularly since 2003-04. FIIs made a record 
investment  in  the  Indian  equity  market  in 
2009, surpassing the 2007 inflows.

Annual Report 2009-10

The  gross  purchases  of  debt  and 
equity  by  FIIs  increased  by  37.7  percent  to 
Rs.8,46,438 crore in 2009-10 from Rs.6,14,579 
crore  in  2008-09  (Table  2.50).  The  combined 
gross  sales  by  FIIs  increased  by  6.6  percent 
Rs.7,03,780  crore  from  Rs.6,60,389  crore 
during the same period in previous year. The 
total net inflow of FII was Rs.1,42,658 crore as 
against an outflow of FII was Rs.45,811 crore 
in 2008-09. This was the highest net inflow for 
any financial year so far.

Cumulative  investment  by  FIIs  at 
acquisition cost, which was USD 59.1 billion 

at  the  end  of  March  2009,  increased  to  USD 
89.3  billion  at  the  end  of  March  2010  (Chart 
2.11).

During  2009-10,  there  was  a  net  inflow 
in  the  equity  segment  by  FIIs  amounting 
to  Rs.1,10,220  crore  (Table  2.51).  The  debt 
segment also witnessed a positive net inflow 
of  Rs.32,438  crore.  Thus,  FII  poured  a  net 
Rs.1,42,658 crore in Indian markets.

Month-wise,  the  net  FII  inflow  was 
the  highest  in  equity  segment  in  May 
2009  (Rs.20,017  crore)  followed  by  March 
2010  (Rs.19,928  crore)  and  September  2009

PART THREE: REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKET

This part of the Report delineates the functions of SEBI as specified in 

Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992.

1.

INTERMEDIARIES

I.  Streamlining the Registration 

Process of Intermediaries
The  entire  procedure  of  registration 
and  renewal  has  been  streamlined  and 
has  been  made  more  transparent  during 
2009-10.  The  status  report  on  registration/
renewal  of  applications  of  intermediaries 
is  put  on  SEBI  website  on  a  monthly 
basis  giving  a  clear  position  whether  the 
application  is  pending  with  SEBI  or  with 
the  intermediary.  If  it  is  pending  with 
SEBI,  the  date  of  receipt  of  letter  from  the 
intermediary  is  also  mentioned  against  the 
status  of  application,  clearly  indicating  that 
how  long  the  application  is  pending  with 
SEBI. If it is pending with intermediary, it is 
mentioned  that  information  is  awaited  from 
the applicant. By and large, replies are being 
sent  to  the  intermediaries  within  30  days. 
It  has  also  been  mentioned  on  the  website 
that  in  case  their  application  has  remained 
unattended, the applicant should not hesitate 
in  writing  to  the  concerned  Division  Chief 
(DC)  or  Executive  Director(ED).  Respective 
e-mail IDs of concerned DC and ED have also 
been given.

While  processing  registration/renewal 
applications where quasi-judicial actions have 
been initiated by SEBI against the applicant, 
SEBI has started seeking details of corrective 
measures  taken  by  the  applicant.  All  the 
applicants  now  inform  in  detail  the  steps 
taken  by  them  to  prevent  such  violations 
in  the  future.  This  step  taken  by  SEBI  will 
improve  the  compliance  culture  among  the 
intermediaries.

II.  Registered Intermediaries other 

than Stock Brokers and Sub-
brokers
During  2009-10,  a  mixed  trend  was 
observed  in  the  number  of  intermediaries 
registered.  During  the  year,  the  highest 
increase  in  absolute  terms  was  observed  in 
case of merchant bankers (27) and depository 
participants (DPs) of CDSL (27) followed by 
DPs  of  NSDL  (13). A  decline  was  witnessed 
in  the  number  of  bankers  to  an  issue  and 
underwriters  during  2009-10.  However,  the 
decline  in  registered  exclusive  underwriters 
was probably due to allowing other registered 
intermediaries  like  merchant  bankers,  stock 
brokers  etc.  also  to  act  as  underwriter.  The 
details are provided in Table 3.1.

Some of the intermediaries’ applications 
for registration were in the process, the details 
of which are provided in Table 3.1a.

III.  Registration of Stock Brokers

During  2009-10,  312  new  stock 
brokers  were  registered  with  SEBI  in  cash 
segment  (Table  3.2).  There  were  160  cases 
of  cancellation/surrender  of  brokership  as 
compared  to  140  in  2008-09. Applications  in 
the process of registration are given in Table 
3.2a.  The  total  number  of  registered  stock 
brokers  as  on  March  31,  2010,  increased  to 
8,804 from 8,652 in 2008-09 (Table 3.3).

The  number  of  registered  brokers  was 
highest  in  National  Stock  Exchange  Ltd. 
(NSE)  (1,310)  followed  by  Bombay  Stock 
Exchange Ltd. (BSE) (1,003), Inter-Connected 
Stock Exchange Ltd. (ISE) (943) and Calcutta 
Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  (908).  The  number  of

the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act, 
1956.  Presently,  there  are  21  recognised 
stock  exchanges,  including  United  Stock 
Exchange of India Limited which was granted 
recognition on March 22, 2010 for a period of 
one year. Out of which, eight stock exchanges 
have  permanent  recognition  (Table  3.7). 
During the year, renewal of recognition was 
granted to 11 Stock Exchanges (Table 3.8).

Renewal  has  not  been  granted  to 
Coimbatore  Stock  Exchange  Ltd.  (CSX)  as  it 
failed to make an application for renewal of 
recognition  which  expired  on  September  17, 
2006. The matter is under litigation before the 
Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Madras. 
Pursuant  to  SEBI  circular  dated  December 
29,  2008  on  ‘Guidelines  for  exit  option  for 
regional stock exchanges’, CSX has expressed 
its desire to surrender its recognition.

off-site inspections, enquiry against violations 
of  rules  and  regulations,  enforcement 
and  prosecutions  are  essential  features  of 
effective  enforcement  of  regulation.  SEBI 
conducts  inspections  either  directly  or 
through  organisations  like  stock  exchanges, 
depositories  etc.  Inspections  on  a  periodic 
basis were conducted to verify the compliance 
levels  of  intermediaries.  Specific/limited 
purpose  inspections  were  conducted  on  the 
basis  of  complaints,  references,  surveillance 
reports,  specific  concerns,  etc.  Stock 
exchanges and depositories were also directed 
by SEBI to carry out periodic/specific purpose 
inspections of their members/participants.

improve  quality  of  inspection  reports  and 
follow up action. In the year 2009-10, actions 
were  initiated  on  the  basis  of  inspections 
carried out during the year as well as in case 
of inspections done in the earlier years.

The  findings  of  the  inspections  were 
communicated  to  the  intermediaries  and 
discussed  with  them  wherever  necessary,  to 
ascertain their views and action was initiated 
in  accordance  with  the  seriousness  of  the 
violation.  Further,  intermediaries  were  also 
specifically  advised  about  the  areas  where 
improvement/corrective steps were required. 
They  are  now  required  to  report  to  SEBI 
about  the  corrective  steps  taken  by  them 
and  also  place  the  same  before  their  board/
partners/proprietor, as the case may be. These 
steps taken by SEBI will improve the level of 
compliance among the intermediaries.

i. 

Inspection  of  Stock  Brokers/Sub-

Further, SEBI vide circular dated August 
22, 2008, advised the stock exchanges to direct 
their stock brokers/clearing members to carry 
out  complete  internal  audit  on  a  half  yearly 
basis  by  independent  auditors.  The  focus  of 
the  internal  audit  is  to  assess  the  efficacy  of 
the  internal  controls  and  soundness  of  the 
risk monitoring system of the trading/clearing 
member.

Internal auditors are required to submit 
their  audit  reports  to  the  entity.  The  entity 
would  place  the  report  before  its  Board  of 
Directors/Proprietors/Partners  and  shall 
forward  the  same  along  with  para-wise 
comments  to  the  respective  stock  exchange 
within  three  months  of  the  end  of  the  half 
year period.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

By and large all the active stock brokers/
clearing  members  of  the  three  major  stock 
exchanges  (NSE,  BSE  and  MCX-SX)  have 
submitted  the  internal  audit  report  for 
the  half  year  ended  March  31,  2009  and 
September 30, 2009, to the stock exchanges.

The  major  findings  pointed  out  in  the 
internal  audit  reports  were  discussed  by 
SEBI  with  the  stock  exchanges.  Based  on 
the  findings  and  experience  gained,  stock 
exchanges  also  revised  the  guidelines  for 
internal audit in consultation with SEBI.

Workshops  for  the  training  of  the 
auditors  were  organised  by  SEBI  in 
coordination with NISM and stock exchanges 
to improve the quality of internal audit.

SURVEILLANCE

I.  Mechanism of Market Surveillance
An  effective  surveillance  mechanism 
is  one  of  the  prime  requirements  for  well 
functioning  securities  market.  The  stock 
exchanges  are  the  first-level  regulators  and 
are  charged  with  the  primary  responsibility 
of  safe-guarding  the  integrity  of  the  market 
and  ensuring  that  the  market  is  performing 
in  accordance  with  the  stipulated  norms 
and  practices.  The  Integrated  Surveillance 
Department  of  SEBI  is  in  charge  of 
overall  market  surveillance  and  scope  of 
its  activities  includes  monitoring  market 
movements  and  detecting  potential  breach 
of  Regulations,  analysing  the  trading  in 
securities  and  initiation  of  appropriate 
action  wherever  warranted.  To  enhance 
the  efficacy  of  the  surveillance  function, 
SEBI  has  put  in  place  a  comprehensive 
Integrated  Market  Surveillance  System 
(IMSS)  which  generates  alerts  arising  out 
of  unusual  market  movements.  SEBI  also 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

ii.  As a surveillance measure, SEBI made an 
SMS  alert  mandatory  for  all  depository 
accounts  operated  through  Power 
of  Attorney  (PoA)  except  in  case  of 
accounts held by non-individuals, Non-
residential Indians and foreign nationals.

iii.  SEBI advised exchanges to issue circulars 
on  facility  of  BTST  (Buy  Today  Sell 
Tomorrow)  advising  members  not 
to  encourage  investors  by  issuing 
advertisements highlighting such facility.

iv. 

v. 

In  order  to  protect  the  interest  of 
investors,  exchanges  were  advised  to 
send  letters/emails  daily  to  investors 
on  random  basis  indicating  their  stock 
market transactions.

SEBI  issued  a  caution  to  investors  on 
investment  advice  offered  by  websites, 
advertisements,  SMS,  emails,  astrology 
etc.  and  investors  were  advised  to  take 
well informed investment decisions.

V. 

Integrated Market Surveillance 
System
During  the  year,  the  integrated  market 
surveillance  system  (IMSS)  continued  to 
provide  assistance  to  SEBI  in  monitoring 
the market and in discharging its regulatory 
functions effectively. The system is being used 
for  detecting  aberrations,  analysing  them 
and  identifying  the  cases  for  investigation 
and  for  taking  further  action,  wherever 
warranted.  The  purpose  of  this  exercise  is 
to  promote  market  integrity  and  to  ensure 
orderly  conduct  of  the  market.  IMSS  is  also 
being  used  for  monitoring  the  activities  of 
market participants as well as issuing suitable 
instructions  to  stock  exchanges  and  market 
participants.  Wherever  required,  findings 
enabled  by  IMSS  are  shared  with  stock 
exchanges  for  appropriate  action  ensuring 
that  stock  exchanges  continue  to  act  as  the 
first level regulator for proactively detecting 
and examining abnormal trading pattern.

To  accommodate  growing  volumes  of 
transactions  in  the  securities  market  and 
currency  markets,  IT  infrastructure  of  IMSS 
was  upgraded  during  the  year  in  order  to 
enhance  capacity  and  ensure  further  scaling 
of operations.

VI.  Data Warehousing and Business 

Intelligence System
During  the  last  couple  of  years,  the 
Indian  securities  market  has  witnessed  a 
phenomenal  growth  in  terms  of  size  and 
depth  which  is  reflected  in  stupendous 
increase  in  number  of  daily  transactions. 
It  was  felt  that  the  existing  Integrated 
Market  Surveillance  System  which  helped 
in  enhancing  efficacy  of  the  surveillance 
functioning  needed  to  be  complemented 
with  an  additional  system  that  would 
provide a quantum leap to the investigation 

100

and  research  functions  of  SEBI.  The 
proposed  system  is  required  to  support 
multidimensional  historical  data,  have  the 
capability  for  pattern  recognition  to  quickly 
identify  abnormal  situations/transactions, 
and  provide  an  analytic  environment  that 
accelerates  investigations  and  research 
functions.

SEBI, therefore, decided to implement a 
Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence 
System (DWBIS). The DWBIS system will be 
having the following components:
•  Data  warehousing,  data  mining  and 

• 

• 

predictive forecasting capabilities,
Scenario  development,  research,  and 
what-if analysis platform and
Sophisticated  drill  down  reporting  and 
charting tool.
The  system  envisages  integration  of 
data  available  from  stock  exchanges  (cash 
and  derivatives  segments)  and  depositories 
into a single integrated data warehouse. The 
DWBIS  is  expected  to  generate  reports  that 
will  better  serve  SEBI  to  identify,  detect  and 
investigate  aberrations  and  market  abuses 
that undermine market integrity.

SEBI  initiated  the  process  for 
implementing  the  proposed  DWBIS  by 
appointing  a  high  level  technical  committee 
comprising eminent technical experts to study 
the  technical  matrix  of  SEBI’s  requirements 
and frame a set of parameters. After following 
the  process  of  global  competitive  bidding, 
the vendor to implement DWBIS system was 
selected.  Phase  I  of  the  DWBIS  system  is 
scheduled for completion in November 2010.

VII. Implementation of Wadhwa 

Committee Report
SEBI  had 

investigated  certain 
irregularities  in  the  transactions  in  the 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

shares  issued  through  21  IPOs  (Initial 
Public  Offerings)  during  the  period  from 
2003  to  2005,  before  their  listing  on  the 
stock  exchanges.  SEBI  upon  completion  of 
investigations  directed  certain  persons,  not 
to  buy,  sell  or  deal  in  the  securities  market, 
including  in  IPOs,  directly  or  indirectly,  till 
further  directions  and  initiated  proceedings 
against  these  persons  in  accordance  with 
SEBI Act and Regulations to disgorge illegal 
gains  and  take  appropriate  action  including 
penalties.  Proceedings  against  such  persons 
are at various stages.

A committee was set up by SEBI under 
the  Chairmanship  of  Justice  K.P.  Wadhwa, 
former Judge of the Supreme Court of India 
(Wadhwa Committee), to advise/recommend 
the  procedure  of  identification  of  persons 
who  have  been  deprived  in  these  21  IPOs 
and  the  manner  in  which  reallocation  of 
shares  to  such  persons  should  take  place. 
The  Wadhwa  committee  submitted  its 
report  giving  recommendations  on  the  said 
issues  and  also  recommended  appointment 
of  an  administrator  for  overseeing  and 
managing  reallocation  work.  In  pursuance, 
SEBI  appointed  Shri  Vijay  Ranjan,  Retd. 
Chief  Commissioner  (Income  Tax),  as  the 
Administrator  to  undertake  the  task  of 
disbursement  of  the  recovered  amounts  to 
the  identified  persons.  In  pursuance  of  the 
recommendations  of  the  committee,  the 
disbursement  of  reallocation  amount  to 
identified persons is under progress.

VIII.  Enforcement
i)  Orders
a) 

Interim Order against Mr. Dipak Patel 
(Portfolio  Manager  of  M/s.  Passport 
India  Investment  (Mauritius)  Limited)

101

by  M/s.  Passport  India  Investment 
(Mauritius)  Limited,  a  sub-account  of 
M/s. Passport Capital LLC. It was prima 
facie  observed  that  Mr.  Dipak  Patel, 
Portfolio Manager of M/s. Passport India 
Investment  (Mauritius)  Limited  was

in  violation  of  provisions  of  SEBI 
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair 
Trade  Practices  relating  to  Securities 
Market) Regulations, 2003. This activity 
continued from January 2007 till January

an  interim  order  dated  May  28,  2009 
with following directions:
•  Mr.  Dipak  Patel,  Portfolio  Manager 
of  M/s.  Passport  India  Investment

Annual Report 2009-10

b) 

c) 

Interim  Order  in  the  matter  of  M/s. 
GHCL Ltd.
A  complaint  was  received  by  SEBI 
wherein  it  was  alleged  that  M/s. 
GHCL  Ltd.  were  reporting  false 
shareholding  details  of  the  promoters 
in  their  quarterly  filing  with  the  Stock 
Exchanges.  The  said  filing  is  required 
under clause 35 of the Listing Agreement 
with each NSE and BSE.

On  examination,  SEBI  found  that  M/s. 
GHCL  had  filed  false  shareholding  of 
the  promoters  repeatedly  over  the  four 
quarters  of  2008,  thereby  misleading 
the  investors  about  commitment  of  the 
promoters towards the company.

In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an 
ad-interim  order  dated  April  20,  2009 
directing  M/s.  GHCL  Ltd.,  its  promoter 
entities,  Chairman,  Managing  Director 
and  the  Company  Secretary  of  M/s. 
GHCL Ltd. not to buy, sell or deal in the 
securities  market  until  further  orders. 
Further,  SEBI  directed  M/s.  GHCL 
Ltd.  to  reconcile  and  file  the  correct 
shareholding  details  with  the  stock 
exchanges.

Interim  Order  in  case  of  entities 
connected to Mr. Ketan Parekh
SEBI, in the course of its routine market 
surveillance,  received  information 
regarding the execution of synchronised 
deals  in  certain  scrips  by  entities 
namely,  M/s.  Maruti  Securities  Limited 
(“MSL”),  M/s.  Kundan  Leasing  and 
Finance  Private  Limited  (“KLFPL”), 
M/s. Chandra Financial Services Private 
Limited  (“CFSPL”),  M/s.  Jay  Investrade 
Private  Limited  (“JIPL”)  and  M/s.  HSM 
Financial  Services  Private  Limited 

(“HSM”).  The  information  received  by 
SEBI  indicated  that  the  said  entities 
had  executed  synchronised  deals  in 
five  scrips  namely  M/s.  Cals  Refineries 
Limited  (“Cals”),  M/s.  Confidence 
Petroleum India Limited (“Confidence”), 
M/s.  Bang  Overseas  Limited  (“Bang”), 
M/s.  Shree  Precoated  Steels  Limited 
(now  known  as  M/s.  Ajmera  Realty 
and  Infra  India  Limited)  (“SPSL”) 
and  M/s.  Temptation  Foods  Limited 
(“TFL”).  The  acts  of  connected  clients 
were  prima  facie  in  violation  of  SEBI 
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair 
Trade  Practices  relating  to  Securities 
Market) Regulations, 2003.

SEBI  observed  that  atleast  five  of  the 
connected clients appear to be related to 
Mr. Shirish Maniar, who was implicated 
by CBI along with Mr. Ketan Parekh in 
the  M/s.  Madhavpura  Mercantile  Co-
operative  Bank  case.  Mr.  Ketan  Parekh 
along  with  the  companies  belonging  to 
him  is  already  debarred  by  SEBI  from 
dealing in securities market.

In view of the above, SEBI vide interim 
order  dated  June  4,  2009,  restrained 
26  persons/entities  from  accessing  the 
securities market and further prohibited 
them from buying, selling or dealing in 
securities  market,  directly  or  indirectly, 
till further orders.

d) 

Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  RTS 
Power Corporation Limited
SEBI  received  complaints  from  the 
brokers  wherein  it  was  mentioned  that 
the  brokers  suspected  that  trading 
carried  out  in  the  scrip  of  M/s.  RTS 
Power  Corporation  Limited  (RTS)  was 
fraudulent in nature. Upon investigation, 

102

SEBI  found  out  that  Mr.  Konde,  Mr. 
Jadhav,  Mr.  Waje,  Ms.  Hetal  Patel  and 
Mr. Rajesh Patel prima facie colluded to 
misuse  the  stock  exchange  mechanism 
to  profitably  exit  from  their  positions 
in  the  scrip  RTS  on  February  11,  2009. 
They had orchestrated a plan to default 
in  the  pay-in  obligation  of  the  buy 
clients who provided an exit to the seller, 
thereby  defrauding  the  stock  brokers. 
It  was  observed  that  buyers  and  sellers 
had  dealings  with  common  financiers 
such  as  M/s.  OM  Associates  and  M/s. 
Bhavani  Trading  Co,  for  routing  funds 
between  them.  It  is  also  pertinent  to 
note  that  Mr.  Konde  and  Ms.  Hetal 
Patel  traded  through  a  different  set  of 
stock  brokers  on  February  11,  2009, 
as  against  their  regular  stock  brokers 
and  selected  well  capitalised  stock 
brokers who could absorb the impact of 
their  default.  Thus,  the  conduct  of  Mr. 
Konde, Mr. Jadhav, Mr. Waje, Ms. Hetal 
Patel,  Mr.  Rajesh  Patel  and  Mr.  Chetan 
Shah  was  prima  facie  in  violation  of 
Regulation  4(2)  (a)  and  4(2)  (g)  of  SEBI 
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair 
Trade  Practices  Relating  to  Securities 
Market) Regulations, 2003.
In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed 
an  interim  order  dated  June  5,  2009 
prohibiting  Mr.  Mukesh  G  Konde,  Mr. 
Ashok Narayan Waje, Mr. Nitesh Ashok 
Jadhav, Ms. Hetal Patel, Mr. Rajesh Patel, 
Mr.  Chetan  Shah,  M/s.  Om  Associates 
and M/s. Bhavani Trading Company from

buying,  selling  or  dealing  in  securities 
market, directly or indirectly, till further 
orders and directing BSE to withhold the 
payout of February 11, 2009 of Ms. Hetal 
Patel and Mr. Chetan Shah in a separate 
escrow account, till further orders.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

e) 

Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  Alka 
Securities Ltd.
During  the  course  of  preliminary 
examination during the period November 
2008 to March 2009, SEBI observed that 
the  promoters  of  M/s.  Alka  Securities 
Ltd. used the off-market route to transfer 
shares  of  the  company  to  42  entities
(1st level entities) and these entities have 
either  dealt  the  said  shares  in  market 
or  transferred  to  317  entities  (2nd  level 
entities)  who  in  turn  had  dealt  in  the 
said  shares  at  BSE.  The  trading  activity 
by  the  promoter/company  connected 
entities  prima-facie  suggests  circular 
trading  activity  with  an  intention  of 
creating  the  volume  so  as  to  give  the 
market  a  false  impression  about  the 
liquidity  of  the  scrip.  Further,  the 
company,  its  promoters  and  directors, 
prima  facie,  appeared  to  have  failed 
to  provide  mandatory  disclosures  for 
change in their shareholdings on various 
occasions  whereas  the  shareholding 
disclosures made to BSE were incorrect 
and  apparently  false.  This  activity 
continued in the period after March 2009.
In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an 
interim  order  dated  July  28,  2009  with 
following directions:-
•  The  promoters  of  M/s.  Alka 
Securities  Limited  viz.  Ms.  Alka 
M  Pandey,  Mr.  Ravi  Pandey,  Mr. 
Mahesh  Natvarlal  Kothari,  Ms. 
Anjuben Kothari, Mr. Brijesh Kothari, 
Ms.  Dimple  Kothari,  Mr.  Mahendra 
Pandey and Mayuresh Esatate Agent 
were  restrained  from  accessing 
the  securities  market  and  further 
prohibited  from  buying,  selling, 
dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner 
whatsoever, till further orders.

103

Annual Report 2009-10

•  The  stock  brokers,  M/s.  Alka 
Securities  Limited  and  M/s. 
Mahesh  Kothari  Shares  and  Stock 
Brokers  Limited  were  prohibited 
from  buying,  selling  or  dealing  in 
any  securities  on  their  respective 
proprietary/own  account,  and 
also  not  to  take  fresh  clients  with 
immediate effect till further orders.

•  M/s.  Alka  Securities  Limited  not  to 
issue any equity shares or any other 
instrument  convertible  into  equity 
shares,  in  any  manner,  and  not  to 
alter  its  capital  structure  in  any 
manner, till further directions in this 
regard.

•  All  the  entities  involved  not  to 
buy,  sell  or  deal  in  the  securities  of 
M/s. Alka  Securities  Limited  in  any 
manner, till further directions in this 
regard.

f)  Order in the matter of M/s. KLG Capital 

Services Ltd.
Investigation  was  conducted  in  the 
scrip  of  M/s.  KLG  Capital  Services 
Ltd,  wherein  it  was  observed  that 
Mr.  Hemant  R.  Patel,  Mr.  Praveen 
Mohnot  and  Mr.  N.  Ravichandran, 
who  are  executives  of  M/s.  SKIL 
Infrastructure Limited (SKIL), and their 
relatives, namely, Ms. Priyanka Singhvi, 
daughter  of  Mr.  Praveen  Mahnot, 
and  Ms.  Anita  Ravichandran,  wife  of 
Mr.  N.  Ravichandran,  communicated 
unpublished price sensitive information 
(UPSI) and/or dealt in the shares of M/s. 
KLG during February 22-27, 2008 while 
in  possession  of  UPSI.  Therefore,  these 
entities  violated  various  provisions  of 
SEBI Act, 1992 and the SEBI (Prohibition 
of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992.

Subsequent  to  hearing  granted  to  the 
entities  in  the  matter,  an  order  was 
issued with the following directions:
•  Mr.  Hemant  Patel  and  Mr. 
Praveen  Mohnot  were  restrained 
from  buying,  selling  or  dealing 
in  the  securities  market  in  any 
manner  whatsoever,  or  accessing 
the  securities  market,  directly  or 
indirectly  and  holding  position  of 
Director in the Board of Directors of 
any  listed  company  for  a  period  of 
five years.

•  Mr. N. Ravichandran was restrained 
from  buying,  selling  or  dealing 
in  the  securities  market  in  any 
manner  whatsoever,  or  accessing 
the  securities  market,  directly  or 
indirectly  and  holding  position  of 
Director in the Board of Directors of 
any  listed  company  for  a  period  of 
two years.

•  Mrs.  Priyanka  Singhvi  and  Mrs. 
Anita Ravichandran were restrained 
from  buying,  selling  or  dealing 
in  the  securities  market  in  any 
manner  whatsoever,  or  accessing 
the  securities  market,  directly  or 
indirectly for a period of five years.

•  Further,  these  entities  were  ordered 
to  disgorge  an  amount  of  Rs.5.5 
crore.

g)  Order  in  the  matter  of  public  issue  of 

M/s. Pyramid Saimira Theatre Ltd.
An  investigation  into  the  allotment 
of  4,22,200  shares  reserved  for  the 
employees (employee category) by M/s. 
Pyramid  Saimira  Theatre  Ltd.  (PSTL) 
in  its  initial  public  offer  in  December 
2006  revealed  that  PSTL  allotted  98.5 
percent  of  shares  under  the  employee 

104

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

category to seven persons who were not 
its  employees.  In  collusion  with  PSTL, 
these  seven  persons  donned  the  cloak 
of  ‘employee’  on  the  eve  of  the  public 
issue  for  four  to  six  months,  applied 
for  shares  in  the  employee  category 
and  received  the  allotment,  sold  the 
shares  soon  after  listing  and  made  an 
unlawful  gain  of  Rs.2,31,94,612.  But 
for  the  artifice  employed  by  PSTL  and 
the  seven  persons,  there  would  have 
been  a  shortfall  in  subscription  in  the 
employee  category,  which  would  have 
gone  to  other  categories  having  over 
subscription.  This  artifice  employed  by 
PSTL is prohibited under regulation 3(b) 
and (c) of the PFUTP Regulations.
SEBI  passed  an  order  dated  June  25, 
2009,  restraining  five  entities  from 
dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner 
whatsoever  or  accessing  the  securities 
market,  directly  or  indirectly,  for  a 
period  of  three  years.  Further,  these 
entities  were  ordered  to  disgorge  an 
amount of Rs.1.2 crore.
In  this  same  matter,  SEBI  passed  an 
order dated November 10, 2009 against 
PSTL, restraining PSTL from dealing in 
securities in any manner whatsoever or 
accessing the securities market, directly 
or indirectly, for a period of seven years. 
PSTL  has  also  been  directed  to  include 
the  order  in  the  agenda  of  their  next 
annual general body meeting.

h)  Cease  and  desist  order  against  Dr. 

Nalamothu Venkata Krishna
SEBI  had  noticed  an  online  offer  made 
by  Dr.  Nalamothu  Venkata  Krishna 
in  his  blog  “stockmarketguide.in” 
soliciting  unpublished  price  sensitive 
insider  information  like  those  relating 

105

to  stake  sale,  mergers,  acquisitions 
or  any  significant  news  or  events 
from  the  people  who  have  access  to 
insider  information  and  promised  to 
reward  the  person  who  parted  with 
such  insider  information  by  sharing 
profits  with  them.  Such  a  solicitation 
of  insider  information  was  observed  to 
be  in  violation  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of 
Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. SEBI 
passed  a  cease  and  desist  order  dated 
November 18, 2009 directing Dr. Krishna 
to  cease  and  desist  from  issuing  or 
continuing to issue online offer soliciting 
unpublished price sensitive information, 
communicating  directly  or  indirectly 
any inside information received, trading 
directly  or  indirectly  on  the  basis 
of  inside  information  received  and 
recommending  or  counseling  trading 
in  scrips  for  which  inside  information 
is received. Investors are also cautioned 
not to avail of the online offers made by 
Dr. Krishna in this regard, or any similar 
proposals  contained  in  advertisements, 
in print or electronic media.

i)  Order  in  the  matter  of  M/s.  Kwality 

Dairy India Limited
In  view  of  the  increase  in  the  price  of 
the  shares  of  M/s.  Kwality  Dairy  India 
Limited an examination was carried out 
by  SEBI  to  look  into  the  dealing  of  the 
shares of the company. It was observed 
that certain entities were carrying out a 
cycle  of  off-market  transfer  and  market 
transaction i.e. purchase through market, 
which  was  repeated  a  number  of  times 
among  them.  Thus,  by  trading  in  a 
circular and synchronised manner these 
entities  had  generated  fictitious  trades 
and given a false misleading impression 
of large volumes of trading in the scrip.

Annual Report 2009-10

j) 

In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed 
an  interim  order  dated  December  1, 
2009  inter-alia  directing  entities  Mr. 
Bhupendra  Singh  Rathore,  Ms.  Leela 
Surana  R.,  M/s  Mahasagar  Securities, 
and  Mr.  Rajesh  Kumar  Vyas  not  to 
buy, sell or deal in the securities in any 
manner  till  further  directions  in  this 
regard  and  the  sub-broker  M/s.  Surana 
Capital  Market  not  to  buy,  sell  or  deal 
in  the  securities  of  M/s.  Kwality  Dairy 
India Limited in any manner till further 
directions  in  this  regard.  Further,  sub-
broker  was  directed  not  to  buy,  sell  or 
deal in the securities in its own account 
in  any  manner  till  further  directions  in 
this regard.

Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  S  J 
Corporation Ltd.
SEBI carried out examination in the scrip 
of  M/s.  S.  J.  Corporation  Ltd  (SJCL)  for 
the period March 18, 2008 to October 1, 
2009 based on a BSE report. Examination 
revealed as follows:
•  From  January  28,  2009  the  price 
of  the  scrip  started  to  move  up 
significantly,  however,  prior  to  that 
there were hardly any trades.

•  A  few  promoter  related  entities 
contributed  greater  than  49  percent 
to  the  rise  in  price  and  most  of  the 
trades were of one share each.

In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an 
interim  order  dated  February  5,  2010, 
directing  16  entities  including  Mr. 
Savjibhai D. Patel and Ms. Usha S. Patel, 
the  promoters  of  M/s.  S.  J.  Corporation 
Ltd.,  to  restrain  from  buying,  selling 
or  dealing  in  the  shares  of  M/s.  S.  J. 
Corporation  Ltd.,  either  directly  or 
indirectly,  in  any  manner,  till  further 
directions in this regard.

k) 

Interim Order in matter of M/s. Bank of 
Rajasthan Ltd.
SEBI  received  a  reference  from  the 
Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  regarding 
annual  financial  inspection  of  the  M/s. 
Bank  of  Rajasthan  Limited  (BoR).  SEBI 
investigation followed the trail of funds 
provided  in  the  RBI  reference  and 
examined  the  movement  of  shares, 
whether on-market or off-market, for all 
named  entities,  including  those  prima 
facie found to be connected to the M/s. 
Tayal  group  or  other  front  entities. 
During the examination it is prima facie 
established that the entities had acted in 
concert with the promoters of BoR with 
the  common  objective  of  substantially 
acquiring  shares/voting  rights  in 
BoR  indirectly  for  the  promoters  for 
the  purposes  of  camouflaging  their 
acquisition.

With  a  view  to  protect  the  interest  of 
investors  and  securities  market  from 
such  acts,  SEBI  passed  an  interim 
ex-parte  order  dated  March  8,  2010 
restraining  100  entities/persons  from 
accessing  the  securities  market  and 
further  prohibiting  them  from  buying, 
selling  or  dealing  in  securities  in  any 
manner  whatsoever,  with  immediate 
effect, till further directions.

l)  Order  in  matter  of  M/s.  Jaybharat 

Textiles
In  the  matter  of  M/s.  Jaybharat  Textile 
and  Real  Estate  Ltd  (JTREL)  and  M/s. 
KSL  and  Industries  Ltd  (KSLIL)  SEBI 
had  passed  an  ex-parte  interim  order 
dated September 7, 2007 against certain 
entities  who  are  apparently  connected 
to  the  promoters  of  JTREL  and  KSLIL, 
directing  them  not  to  buy,  sell  or  deal 

106

in  shares  of  JTREL  and  KSLIL  directly 
or indirectly, in any manner, till further 
directions  in  this  regard  and  pending 
investigations.  Further  a  team  of  SEBI 
officials  had  visited  M/s.  Mondkar 
Computers  Pvt.,  the  Registrar  (RTA) 
of  JTREL  and  collected  information 
and  records  on  shareholding  of  the 
above  entities  since  September  2006.  It 
was  noticed  from  the  data  that  a  large 
block  of  shares  was  held  mostly  in  the 
physical form by 19 entities listed under 
public  shareholding  in  the  category  of 
‘Individuals’  holding  nominal  share 
capital  in  excess  of  Rs.  one  lakh’, 
constituting  27.8  percent  of  the  share 
capital of the company.

Investigations  have  revealed  that  these 
certain  shareholders  shown  under  the 
public  holding  category  of  JTREL  were 
actually  linked  to  the  promoters  of  the 
company.  Considering  the  combined 
shareholding  of  such  entities  with  that 
of the promoters as publicly declared, it 
prima facie appears that the promoters, 
directly  or  indirectly,  control  as  much 
as  97  percent  of  the  share  capital  of 
the  company  since  September  2006. 
Therefore,  the  acts  of  company  and 
entities  under  the  control  of  promoters 
are  prima  facie  in  violation  of  Listing 
Agreement, Regulation 3 and 4 of SEBI 
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair 
Trade  Practices)  Regulation  2003  and 
Regulation  7,  8,  10  and  11  of  SEBI 
(Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and 
Takeover) Regulations, 1997

In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an 
order  dated  March  12,  2010  restraining 
the company, JTREL from accessing the 
securities market and further prohibiting 
the company, its promoters and 24 other 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

entities  from  buying,  selling  or  dealing 
in  shares  directly  or  indirectly  in  any 
manner whatsoever, till further orders.

ii)  Consent orders:

Many  proceedings  are  settled  through 
consent  orders  as  per  the  SEBI  circular 
dated April 20, 2007. Some of the major 
consent  orders  passed  during  the  year 
are:

a)  M/s.  Pyramid  Saimira  Theatre  Ltd. 

(PSTL)
SEBI  had  conducted  investigations 
into  the  alleged  irregularities  in  the 
allotment  of  employee  quota  shares  in 
the  Initial  Public  Offer  (IPO)  of  M/s. 
Pyramid  Saimira  Theatre  Ltd  (PSTL) 
The  investigations  prima  facie  revealed 
that Mr. Sanjay Jhabak and Mr. Dheeraj 
Jain cornered the employee quota shares 
of  PSTL  in  collusion  with  the  company 
and some other persons in the IPO and 
made  an  unjust  profit  of  Rs.53,69,028 
and  Rs.54,75,079  by  selling  the  shares 
immediately  on  listing.  The  above 
persons  preferred  consent  proceedings 
and paid Rs.80, 53,542 and Rs.82, 12,619 
respectively as consent terms.

b)  M/s. Nissan Copper Limited

SEBI  conducted  investigation  into 
dealings  on  the  first  date  of  listing  of 
shares  of  M/s.  Nissan  Copper  Limited 
(NCL) upon noticing abnormal price rise 
in the shares of NCL. The investigations 
prima  facie  found  that  the  certain 
entities  had  allegedly  arranged  for  the 
subscription  in  the  QIB  portion  of  the 
IPO  of  NCL.  They  had  agreed  that 
upon listing of the shares of NCL, these 
entities  would  provide  an  assured  exit 
for the QIB at a predetermined price by 

107

Annual Report 2009-10

entering  into  structured  transactions. 
SEBI  passed  an  ad  interim  ex-parte 
order dated January 17, 2007, inter alia, 
directing  NSE  and  BSE  to  withhold 
the  profits/gains  of  these  entities  in  a 
separate  escrow  account.  Some  of  the 
entities applied for consent in the above 
matter.
Consent order was passed in respect of 
the  M/s.  Parklight  Securities  Ltd.,  Mr. 
Rupesh  B  Brambhatt,  Mrs.  Sonal  U. 
Vora, Mrs. Sonali D. Vora, Mr. Uday H. 
Vora, Mr. Dhiren H. Vora, Mr. Rajesh B. 
Brambhatt,  M/s.  Safal  Realty  Pvt.  Ltd., 
M/s. Parklight Investment Ltd. and M/s. 
H. Nyalchand Financial Services Ltd for 
an  amount  of  Rs.17.68  crore.  Consent 
order was also passed in respect of M/s. 
Forney  Funds  Advisors  Pvt.  Ltd.  and 
Mr. R. K. Goyal, director of M/s. Forney 
Funds Advisors Pvt. Ltd. for an amount 
of Rs.1.5 crore.

IPO irregularities:
SEBI  conducted  investigations  into  the 
dealings  in  various  IPOs  during  the 
period  2003-05  and  found  that  certain 
entities (key operators) acted in concert 
with financiers and through medium of 
thousands  of  fictitious/benami  demat 
accounts  cornered  shares  meant  for 
retail investors. Thereafter, key operators 
transferred  shares  to  financiers,  on  or 
before the day of listing, who ultimately 
sold them in the market after listing and 
made huge ill-gotten gains.

Some of the entities applied for consent 
and  consent  order  was  passed  in 
respect  of  Mr.  Gautam  N  Jhaveri  and
Mr.  Javeri  Gautambhai  for  Rs.2.7  crore, 
Mr.  Manoj  Sekseria  for  Rs.2.2  crore,
Mr.  Jitendra  Lalwani  for  Rs.9.6  crore, 

Mr. Sheelu Lalwani for Rs.5.2 crore, Mr. 
Dharmesh  K  Katakia  for  Rs.  one  crore, 
Mr.  Dharmesh  Bhupendra  M  for  Rs.1.1 
crore.

iii.  Prevention of Money Laundering

Money  Laundering  is  globally 
recognised as one of the largest threats posed 
to the financial system of a country. The fight 
against  terrorist  financing  is  another  such 
emerging  threat  with  grave  consequences 
for both the political and economic standing 
of  a  jurisdiction.  Rapid  developments  and 
greater  integration  of  the  financial  markets 
together  with  improvements  in  technology 
and  communication  channels  continue  to 
pose  serious  challenges  to  the  authorities, 
and  institutions  dealing  with  anti  money 
laundering  and  combating  financing  of 
terrorism (AML and CFT).

The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering 
Act  ,  2002  (PMLA)  and  Rules  framed  there 
under brought into force with effect from July 
01,  2005  has  been  a  significant  step  towards 
India  joining  the  global  war  against  money 
laundering and financing of terrorism.

SEBI  in  the  current  year  continued  its 
focused  efforts  to  bolster  the  regulatory 
framework and minimise the risk emanating 
from  money  laundering  and  terrorist 
financing.  In  pursuance  of  these  efforts, 
SEBI  issued  three  circulars  containing  key 
obligations  required  to  be  fulfilled  by 
securities  market  intermediaries  on  areas 
relating to AML and CFT.

In the first circular issued in the month 
of September 2009, directions were provided 
to intermediaries that they were permitted to 
take  counter  measures  against  clients  from 
high  risk  countries  or  countries  that  do  not 
or insufficiently  apply  Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF) standards. Following this, SEBI

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

Box 3.1: IPO Irregularities and Reallocation of Disgorged Amount

SEBI had investigated allotments made in Initial Public 
Offers (IPOs) during the period 2003-05. Investigation 
revealed that certain entities (key operators) and their 
financiers  had  cornered  shares  reserved  for  retail 
applicants  in  these  IPOs  by  making  applications  in 
the retail category through thousands of benami IPO 
applicants.  They  also  used  benami  demat  accounts 
opened through various Depository Participants (DPs) 
to  receive  shares  pursuant  to  allotment.  Subsequent 
to the receipt of IPO allotment, these benami allottees 
had  transferred  shares  to  their  key  operators  as  per 
understanding  between  them.  These  key  operators 
in turn transferred the shares to their financiers who 
had originally made funds available for executing the 
game-plan. The financiers in turn sold most of these 
shares on the first day of listing. The entire operations 
in these IPOs was planned, financed and executed by 
these  key  operators  and  financiers,  with  the  help  of 
benami  applicants  and  certain  DPs.  The  gains  made 
by these financiers were treated as unlawful gains as 
their  actions  were  found  to  be  in  violations  of  SEBI 
(Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices 
Relating to Securities Markets) Regulations, 2003, SEBI 
(Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 and 
provisions of SEBI Disclosure and Investor Protection 
Guidelines,  2000,  and  their  actions  had  resulted  in 
denying allocation of shares meant for retail applicants 
to genuine retail applicants who had made only one 
application each.

27,  2006  against  129  entities.  SEBI  identified  24  key 
operators  and  89  financiers  who  cornered  shares  in 
various IPOs and made unlawful gains of around Rs 
89 crore. Appropriate enforcement proceedings were 
initiated against them. Subsequently post investigation 
and following due course of law, a total of 104 orders 
have been passed (including 13 adjudication orders). 
In  respect  38  entities  proceedings  are  pending  at 
various  stages.  Status  of  proceedings  against  entities 
named in ad interim ex parte order as on 31st March 
2010 is appended below in the table.

Hon’ble  SAT  while  upholding  orders  of  SEBI 
simultaneously  settled  following  legal  issues  in  an 
appeal filed by Himani Patel against SEBI’s order(s).

•  Power  of  Disgorgement:  Hon’ble  SAT  while 
upholding the SEBI Order of disgorgement held 
that “It	is	thus	clear	that	a	person	who	has	unjustly	
enriched	 himself	 by	 his	 unlawful	 conduct	 should	 be	
required	 to	 disgorge	 the	 illegal	 gains	 made	 by	 him.	
We	have	already	held	that	the	conduct	of	the	appellant	
in	 cornering	 large	 number	 of	 shares	 in	 the	 retail	
category	 of	 Suzlon	 IPO	 was	 fraudulent	 and	 that	 by	
her	wrongful	conduct	she	had	unjustly	enriched	herself	
to	 the	 extent	 of	 Rs.33,52,636/-.	 The  whole  time 
member was justified in requiring the appellant to 
disgorge the aforesaid amount. No fault can thus 
be found with any part of the order passed by the 
whole time member.”

SEBI  had  passed  two  ad  interim  ex  parte  order  cum

Box 3.1: IPO Irregularities and Reallocation of Disgorged Amount (contd.)

and	Investor	Protection)	Guidelines,	2000	to	mean	an	
investor	who	applies	or	bids	for	securities	of	or	for	a	
value	of	not	more	than	Rs.	one	lakh.	A	reading	of	this	
definition	 makes	 it	 clear	 that  it  is  inherent  that  a 
person  who  wants  to  apply  as  a  retail  investor 
must  not  exceed  the  limit  and  if  one  were  to 
apply  in  different  names,  it  is  obvious  that  he 
is  trying  to  manipulate  the  provisions  of  the 
guidelines and corner shares more than what he 
may otherwise be entitled to.”.

•  Authority To Pass Multiple Orders: In disposal 
of  various  enforcement  actions  initiated  against 
the wrong doers in IPO irregularities, SEBI issued 
orders  against  a  few  of  them  simultaneously 
imposing monetary penalties on them, directing 
them  to  disgorge  unlawful  gains  made  by 
them  and  debarring  them  from  participating  in 
securities market for appropriate periods of time. 
In the matter of Himani Patel, Hon’ble SAT upheld 
these multiple orders/directions passed by SEBI.

Reallocation of Disgorged Amount
A  Committee  was  set  up  by  SEBI  under  the 
Chairmanship of Justice D. P. Wadhwa, former Judge 
of the Supreme Court of India (Wadhwa Committee) 
to advise/recommend the procedure of identification 
of persons who have been deprived on account of IPO 
irregularities and the manner in which reallocation of 
shares to such persons should take place. The Wadhwa 
committee  submitted  its  report  and  the  report  was 
placed  in  public  domain  through  SEBI  website  on 
December 29, 2009.
The  Wadhwa  committee  while  concluding  that 
reallocation  in  terms  of  shares  will  not  be  practical 
enunciated  three  principles  in  its  report  for 
identification  of  deprived  persons,  amount  and  the 
method of reallocation, as under:
I.  Quantification  of  the  amount  of  unjust 
enrichment:  The  gains  associated  with  the 
number of shares allotted to applicants who had 
illegally  cornered  shares  in  the  IPOs  shall  be 
treated as unjust allotments/enrichment.
Identification  of  “deprived”  applicants:  The 
totally  unsuccessful  applicants  shall  have  a  call 
on  the  reallocation.  These  applicants  will  be 
considered for the amount which is the difference 
of  closing  price  of  shares  on  the  first  day  of 
listing/trading at NSE and the IPO issue price.

II. 

III.  Basis  for  re-allocation  amongst  deprived 
applicants:  The  totally  unsuccessful  applicants 
shall  be  reallocated  money  value  as  computed 
above from recovered unjust gains, till they each 
receive the gains associated with minimum shares 
allotted to the lowest category in the IPO.

The  Wadhwa  committee  had  recommended 
appointment  of  an  administrator  for  overseeing 
and  managing  the  reallocation  work.  In  pursuance 
SEBI  appointed  an  administrator  to  undertake  the 
task  of  disbursement  of  the  recovered  amounts 
to  the  identified  persons.  In  pursuance  of  the 
recommendations of the committee 1,357,848 unique 
investors  were  identified  as  unsuccessful  applicants 
in one or more of the 21 IPOs listed out in the Justice 
Wadhwa Committee report.
The  disbursement  of  reallocation  amount  to  all 
eligible investors numbering approximately 12.75 lakh 
investors  from  the  amount  disgorged  in  the  matter 
of  IPO  irregularities  commenced  on  April  12,  2010. 
Among  the  deprived  investors,  there  were  83,112 
investors  who  were  eligible  for  reallocation  amount 
of Rs.20/- or less. Keeping in view the administrative 
costs  involved,  no  disbursement  was  made  to  such 
investors  who  were  eligible  for  reallocation  amount 
of Rs.20/- or less.
About  8.0  lakh  investors  were  eligible  for  a 
reallocation  amount  of  more  than  Rs.20/-  but  less 
than Rs.300/- each. SEBI is making reallocation for the 
full  eligible  amount  to  all  such  investors  amounting 
to a total of Rs.9.0 crore. This covers 59 percent of all 
the identified investors who are eligible for receiving 
some reallocation.
The  remaining  4.8  lakh  investors  each  of  who  are 
eligible  for  a  reallocation  amount  of  more  than 
Rs.300/- are being paid in the first instance, a sum of 
Rs.300/- each amounting to Rs.14.3 crore.
The  first  sets  of  reallocation  cheques  were  handed 
over  by  Shri  Pranab  Mukherjee,  Hon’ble  Finance 
Minister  of  India  at  a  function  held  on  SEBI 
Foundation Day at New Delhi in the presence of Shri 
Salman  Khursheed,  Minister  of  State  (Independent 
Charge), Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
This  is  the  first  step  in  reallocation  process  and  as 
further  disgorgement  amount  is  realised  further 
reallocation will be made.

issued a circular in October 2009 directing all 
intermediaries  to  ensure  that  at  the  time  of 
account opening and subsequently thereafter, 
the  name  of  their  client  is  checked  against 
the  list  put  out  by  the  UN  Security  Council 
and  take  action  as  prescribed.  In  addition, 
it  also  describes  the  procedure  that  is  to  be 
followed  for  the  freezing  of  financial  assets 
of  a  client  suspected  of  financing  terrorism. 
In  February  2010,  SEBI  had  issued  a  master 
circular  consolidating  the  requirements  and 
obligations pertaining to the area of AML and 
CFT. The master circular replaced the master 
circular  SEBI  had  issued  in  the  preceding 
financial  year.  In  the  same  manner  as  the 
preceding circular, the current master circular 
contains  specific  provisions  to  give  effect 
to  the  relevant  49  recommendations  of  the 
FATF  and  incorporated  the  various  changes 
in  law  reflected  through  the  issuance  of 
other  SEBI  circulars  as  well  as  amendments 
to  the  PMLA  Act,  and  Rules  thereunder. 
Thus,  the  master  circular  serves  as  a  single 
reference  point,  containing  legislative  and 
regulatory  obligations  to  be  fulfilled  by 
market intermediaries.

In  addition,  SEBI  has  also  appointed  a 
nodal  officer  under  the  Unlawful  Activities 
Prevention  Act,  to  act  as  a  facilitator  of  the 
Central  Government  in  carrying  out  the 
procedure for freezing the financial assets of 
any client suspected of financing terrorism in 
the securities market.

SEBI  has  consistently  in  coordination 
with  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit-India 
(FIU-IND)  organised  and  participated 
in  meetings  with  the  stock  exchanges, 
depositories  and  depository  participants, 
stock  brokers  and  mutual  funds,  registrars 
and  transfer  agents  etc  wherein  further 
guidance  to  different  intermediaries  was 

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

provided for enhancing their compliance with 
the legislative requirements. Officers of SEBI 
also participated in seminars and workshops 
organised  jointly  by  stock  exchanges  (NSE 
and  BSE)  and  the  depositories  (NSDL 
and  CDSL)  for  enhancing  the  compliance 
standards  by  stock  brokers  and  depository 
participants.  Of  note,  is  a  workshop 
conducted jointly by the Australian FIU and 
FIU-IND  that  was  attended  by  SEBI  and 
intermediaries of the securities market where 
efforts were made to identify typologies that 
would  help  regulators  and  intermediaries 
to  better  identify  and  capture  situations  of 
money laundering and terrorist financing.

INVESTIGATION
Timely completion of Investigation cases 
and  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive 
action  in  case  of  violations  of  established 
securities laws is important for protection of 
investors’  interest,  ensuring  fair,  transparent 
and  orderly  functioning  of  the  market.  It  is 
also vital for improving the confidence in the 
integrity of the securities market. Importance 
of effective and credible use of investigation 
has  also  been  underscored  by  IOSCO  in  its 
“Principles for the Enforcement of Securities 
Regulation”.

Keeping  the  above  objectives  and 
Principles  of  Securities  Regulations  in  view, 
SEBI initiates investigation to examine alleged 
or suspected violations of laws and obligations 
relating  to  securities  market.  The  possible 
violations  may  include  price  manipulation, 
creation  of  artificial  market,  insider  trading, 
capital  issue  related  irregularities,  takeover 
related  violations,  manipulation  of  financial 
results,  non-compliance  of  disclosure 
requirements  and  any  other  misconduct  in 
the securities markets.

Annual Report 2009-10

I.  Process of Investigation

The steps involved during investigation 
process  include  an  analysis  of  market  data 
(order  and  trade  log,  transaction  statements 
etc.),  static  data  (KYC  documents,  bank 
records, financial results, events around major 
corporate  developments,  call  detail  records 
etc.) and if required interviewing of entities. 
The purpose of such investigation is to gather 
evidence  and  to  identify  persons/entities 
behind  irregularities  and  violations  so  that 
appropriate  and  suitable  regulatory  action 
can  be  taken,  wherever  required.  Outcome 
of  investigation  in  the  form  of  enforcement 
action is a clear signal to the market players 
to  comply  with  the  law  and  expected 
standards of conduct in the market.

II.  Trends in Investigation Cases

Since  1992-93,  SEBI  has  undertaken 
1,359  investigation  cases.  In  1,264  cases 
investigations  have  been  completed.  Apart 
from  enforcement  action,  an  important 
attendant  benefits  resulting  from  such 
investigations  is  contribution  to  the  policy 
changes  with  a  view  to  further  strengthen 
the regulatory and enforcement environment. 
During 2009-10, 71 new cases were taken up 
for investigation and 74 cases were completed 
(Table 3.19 and Chart 3.3).

Recent experience and trends in the type 
of  investigation  cases  undertaken  by  SEBI 
indicate that technology and newer methods 
are being used by violators of securities laws 
to  conduct  their  business  in  the  market.  In 
the  cases  that  are  referred  to  Investigation 
Department,  significant  increase  in  the 
number  of  cases  with  alleged  front  running 
has  been  observed  over  the  last  two  years. 
13  cases  of  front  running  were  referred  to 
Investigation  Department  in  the  years  2008-
09  and  2009-10.  As  front  running  involves 
leakage  of  information  from  sources  such

as  the  institutional  client  desk  or  brokers/
traders  handling  such  institutional  orders, 
a  proper  investigation  into  these  cases 
should  help  to  put  in  place  or  strengthen 
the existing systems and procedures, so that 
the  possibility  of such institutions  becoming 
sources for leakage of trading information is 
reduced, in the future.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

In 2009-10, in a couple of cases of market 
manipulation,  use  of  a  large  number  of 
front  entities/widely  distributed  network  of 
persons/entities was found to be perpetrating 
unfair  and  fraudulent  trade  practices  in  the 
market.  In  view  of  the  urgency  to  protect 
genuine  investors  from  such  manipulations, 
SEBI  invoked  powers  under  the  SEBI  Act 
and  issued  necessary  directions  to  prevent 
damage to the integrity of the market. These 
cases  also  highlight  the  importance  of  an 
effective  Customer  Due  Diligence  (CDD) 
regime,  a  thorough  “In-Person”  verification 
process  and  continuous  monitoring  of 
transactions by the registered intermediaries.

In  one  case  of  inter  regulatory 
cooperation,  on  receipt  of  information 
about possible manipulation in the books of 
accounts of a company, where purchase/sale 
amounting  to  hundreds  of  crore  of  rupees 

was  linked  to  bogus  entities,  SEBI  passed 
ad  interim  ex-parte  order  prohibiting  the 
company from raising any further capital in 
any manner, directly or indirectly, whatsoever 
till further orders. A formal investigation was 
also ordered in the matter.

i.  Nature of Investigation Cases Taken Up
During  the  year  2009-10,  about  62 
percent of the cases taken up for investigation 
pertain  to  market  manipulation  and  price 
rigging,  as  against  about  68  percent  of  such 
cases  in  the  previous  year.  Other  cases 
pertain to insider trading, takeover violations, 
irregularities  in  capital  issues,  and  other 
irregularities.  Since,  several  investigation 
cases  involve  multiple  allegations  of 
violations,  strict  classification  under  specific 
category  becomes  difficult.  Such  cases  are 
classified  on  the  basis  of  main  charge/
violations.

113

Annual Report 2009-10

ii.  Nature of Investigation Cases Completed
During  2009-10,  about  62  percent  of 
the  cases  completed  pertain  to  market 
manipulation and price rigging as compared 
to 75 percent in the previous year. Other cases 
in which investigation was completed pertain 

to capital issue related manipulation, insider 
trading, takeovers etc.

III.  Regulatory Action

After  completion  of  investigation, 
further  penal  action  is  initiated  as  per  the 
recommendations  made  in  the  investigation 
reports  and  as  approved  by  the  competent 
authority.  Action  is  decided  based  on 
the  principles  of  objectivity,  consistency, 
materiality and quality of evidence available, 
after  thorough  analysis  and  appreciation  of 
facts.  The  action  included  issuing  warning 
letters,  initiating  enquiry  proceedings 
for  registered  intermediaries,  initiating 
adjudication proceedings for levy of monetary 
penalties,  passing  directions  under  Section 
11  of  SEBI  Act  and  initiating  prosecution 
and  referring  matter  to  other  regulatory 
agencies.  As  a  matter  of  policy,  SEBI  has 
continued to lay greater emphasis on issuance 
of  prohibitive  directions  under  Section  11 
of  the  SEBI Act,  1992.  These  directions  have 
the  strong  and  salutary  effect  of  deterrence 
as  well  as  an  effective  tool  to  deal  with 
emergent  situations  requiring  a  timely  and 
faster  response.  Thus  as  against  230  such 

115

directions  during  2008-09,  SEBI  issued  691 
such directions during 2009-10. A detail break

to  strengthen  their  systems  and  improve 
compliance standards.

ii.   Payment of Penal Interest

SEBI has made it mandatory that mutual 
funds  must  pay  interest  at  the  rate  of  15 
percent per annum for delays in the dispatch 
of  repurchase/redemption  proceeds  to  the 
unit holders. The mutual funds are required 
to  report  these  cases  of  delays  to  SEBI  on  a 
bi-monthly  basis.  During  2009-10,  mutual 
funds paid Rs.8,47,116.7 to 1,722 investors for 
delay in dispatch as against Rs.22.6 lakh paid 
to 1,142 investors in 2008-09.

SEBI  had  made  it  mandatory  that,  in 
the  event  of  failure  of  dispatch  of  dividend, 
the AMC(s)  shall  be  liable  to  pay  interest  at 
the rate of 15 percent per annum to the unit 
holders.  The  mutual  funds  are  required  to 
report these cases of delays to SEBI on a bi-

paid  Rs.28,703.4  to  84  investors  for  delay  in 
dispatch.

iii.  Adjudication Proceedings

Two  adjudication  proceedings  were 
completed  during  the  period.  No  penalty 
was  imposed  in  both  the  cases,  however,  in 
one  case  the  AMC  had  applied  for  consent 
and paid Rs.1,25,000 towards the terms of the 
consent.
iv.  Show Cause Notices

During 2009-10, five show-cause notices 
were  issued  to  five  mutual  funds.  Of  these,

violation  of  advertisement  code  and  one  for 
changing the fundamental attributes without 
following the procedure under SEBI (Mutual

of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations,  1997 
and  a  sum  of  Rs.63,80,000  was  received  as 
monetary penalty.

V.  Regulatory Actions against FIIs

During  2009-10,  one  adjudication 
proceeding was initiated against one Foreign 
Institutional Investor. Directions were issued 
under  Section  11(1),  11(4)  and  11(B)  of  SEBI 
Act,  1992  against  Barclays  Bank  PLC  and 
Societe Generale:

a.  Barclays Bank PLC

Based  on  the  Offshore  Derivative 
Instruments (ODI) Reports submitted during 
the  period  January  2006  and  January  2008 
by  Barclays  Bank  PLC,  it  was  observed 
that  it  had  issued  ODIs  to  UBS  AG,  with 
Reliance  Communications  Limited  (‘RCom’) 
as the underlying. When SEBI sought further 
information,  Barclays  submitted  that  upon 
review,  the  counterparty  of  the  transactions 
was not UBS AG as earlier reported by it but 

121

Annual Report 2009-10

was  Hythe  Securities  Limited  (‘Hythe’),  an 
entirely new entity which did not form part 
of  any  of  the  submissions  previously  made 
by  Barclays  to  SEBI.  From  the  information 
submitted  by  Barclays,  it  was  observed 
that  the  ODIs  which  were  issued  by  it  to 
Hythe  Securities  Limited  (originally  stated 
to  be  issued  to  UBS  AG)  were  onward 
issued  to  another  entity  Pluri  Emerging 
Companies  PCC  Cell  E  Emerging  Markets 
Growth  Fund.  However,  from  the  ODI 
monthly  reports  submitted  by  Barclays,  it 
was  observed  that  that  was  no  mention  of 
any back to back issuance of the ODI to any 
other entity. Barclays stated that the error in 
the  reporting  had  occurred  due  to  manual 
compilation of the ODI reports in December 
2006  and  error  in  data  entry  level  and  that 
after  improvements  in  its  systems  for  ODI 
reporting  in  2008  and  2009,  the  errors  in 
reporting continued to be carried forward in 
the new system. Barclays had not only failed 
to  provide  true,  fair  and  complete  details  of 
the  ODI  activity  undertaken  by  it  but  also 
prima  facie  violated  the  provisions  of  FII 
Regulations by furnishing false and incorrect 
information to SEBI. Full and fair disclosure 
forms  the  cornerstone  of  FII  regulation  by 
SEBI.  As  the  source  of  funds  available  with 
an  FII  comes  from  Offshore,  by  its  very 
nature SEBI has no direct access to verifying 
the nature of the funds. In other words, SEBI 
places almost absolute faith and unqualified 
reliance  on  the  ability  of  an  FII  to  carry  out 
the basic regulatory and prudential oversight.
SEBI  as  a  regulator  requires  fair,  true 
and  correct  information  for  assessing  and 
monitoring  FII  activity  in  the  securities 
market.  When  a  registration  is  granted  to 
an FII, SEBI presupposes that the FII has the 
capacity  to  exercise  the  necessary  oversight 
and ensure the integrity and accuracy of the 
data it provides to SEBI under the regulations 

122

applicable. Given that Barclays had provided 
incorrect  reporting  Barclays  has  been  non 
compliant  with  the  provisions  of  the  FII 
regulations  Accordingly,  SEBI  directed  vide 
order dated December 09, 2009 Barclays Bank, 
Plc  under  Sections  11(1),  11(4)  and  11B  of 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
Act, 1992, not to issue/subscribe or otherwise 
transact in any fresh/new Offshore Derivative 
Instrument till such time as Barclays satisfies 
SEBI  that  it  has  put  adequate  systems, 
processes and controls in place to ensure true 
and correct reporting of its ODI transactions 
to  SEBI.  Barclays  shall  furnish  a  certificate 
from  an  auditor  of  international  standing  to 
this end.

b.  Societe Generale

From  the  reports  submitted  by  Societe 
Generale,  during  the  period  January  2006 
and  January  2008,  it  was  observed  that 
Societe  Generale  had  issued  certain  ODIs/
PNs  to  Hythe  Securities  Limited  (‘Hythe’), 
with  Reliance  Communications  Limited  as 
the  underlying.  While  providing  details  of 
all  the  ODIs/PNs  entered  into  with  Hythe, 
Societe  Generale  acknowledged  that  there 
had  been  errors  in  its  reporting  to  SEBI  of 
transactions  with  Hythe.  Subsequently,  it 
was  also  observed  that  those  ODIs/PNs  had 
been  onward  issued,  and  that  Hythe  is  not 
the  end  beneficiary.  Societe  Generale  failed 
to  adhere  to  ‘know  your  client’  norms  as  it 
had  little  or  no  relevant  knowledge  of  the 
ultimate beneficiary of the ODIs issued by it. 
Societe  Generale  failed  to  provide  true,  fair 
and  complete  details  of  the  ODIs/P-Notes 
activity undertaken by it and also prima facie 
violated the provisions of FII Regulations by 
furnishing false and incorrect information to 
SEBI. Vide an order under section 11(1), 11(4) 
and 11B of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India Act, 1992, dated January 16, 2010, SEBI 

directed Societe Generale, a registered FII, not 
to issue, subscribe or otherwise transact in any 
new ODIs or P-Notes in India till such time it 
provides a true and correct reporting of its ODI 
and P-Notes transactions to SEBI Furthermore, 
given  the  aforesaid  prima  facie  violations, 
Societe  Generale  was  also  required  to  show 
cause  as  to  why  appropriate  proceedings 
including  cancellation  of  its  certificate  of 
registration as a Foreign Institutional Investor 
should not be initiated.

VI.  Regulatory Actions against Stock 

Brokers and Sub-brokers

a. 

Illegal trading outside stock exchanges:
Based on a complaint regarding alleged 
illegal  trading  being  carried  out  by  a  sub 
broker Shri Bhadresh Sanghvi (Trade Name:

inspection. Their inspection revealed that the 
sub-broker was involved in illegal trading. In 
order to prevent further harm to the investors 
and  the  securities  market,  SEBI  restrained, 
vide order dated December 21, 2009, the sub-
broker from buying, selling or dealing in the 
securities market in any manner whatsoever 
or accessing the securities market, directly or 
indirectly, either for himself or for his clients 
till  further  instructions.  SEBI  also  ordered 
inspection  of  the  books  and  records  of  the 
sub-broker.

b.  SEBI  order  in  the  matter  of  M/s. 
Pinnacle Share Registry Private Limited
SEBI  had  conducted  an  inspection  of 
the  share  transfer  records  of  M/s.  Parsoli

Transfer  agent  viz.  M/s.  Pinnacle  Shares 
Registry Private Limited based on complaints 
received from investors on alleged fraudulent 
transfer and dematerialisation of shares from

their  accounts.  SEBI  had  passed  an  interim 
order dated February 20, 2009 under Sections 
11(1),  11(4)  and  11  B  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992 
prohibiting  M/s.  Pinnacle  Shares  Registry 
Private Limited from entering into any fresh 
agreements  with  client  companies  in  its 
operations as registrar to an issue and share 
transfer agent till further orders.

Subsequently,  SEBI  passed  an  order 
dated  October  14,  2009  under  Regulation  28 
(2)  of  the  SEBI  (Intermediaries)  Regulations, 
2008  canceling  the  certificate  of  Registration 
granted  by  SEBI  to  M/s.  Pinnacle  Shares 
Registry Private Limited [PSRPL] as Registrar 
to an Issue and a Share Transfer Agent, with 
effect from February 28, 2010.

c. 

SEBI  order  in  the  matter  of  M/s. 
Sterling  Holiday  Resorts  (India) 
Limited
SEBI  passed  an  order  dated  November 
10,  2009  under  Section  11  B  of  the  SEBI 
Act,  1992,  read  with  Section  19  of  the 
Depositories Act,  1996,  against  M/s.  Sterling 
Holiday Resorts (India) Limited for failing to 
dematerialise 2,99,800 shares of M/s. Gujarat 
Industrial  Investment  Corporation  Limited. 
M/s. Sterling Holiday Resorts (India) Limited 
was  directed  to  dematerialise  the  2,99,800 
shares  of  the  company  standing  in  the

f.  Mr.  Vishnu  Prakash  Bajpai  Vs  SEBI 

(Crl.M.C.1182/2009)
SEBI  had  launched  prosecution  against 

126

M/s.  N.R.Plantations  (India)  Limited  and  its 
directors for an offence u/s 24 (1) of SEBI Act 
read  with  the  CIS  Regulations.  Mr.  Vishnu 
Prakash Bajpai was arrayed as an accused in 
the  complaint  alleging  that  he  was  a  person 
in  charge  and  responsible  for  the  affairs 
of  the  company  during  commission  of  the 
offence.  The  captioned  application  was  filed 
by  Mr.  Vishnu  Prakash  Bajpai  in  the  High 
Court  of  Delhi,  seeking  quashing  of  the 
complaint against him stating that he was not 
a director or a person in charge of the affairs 
of the company. The petitioner relied on the 
Memorandum and Articles of Association of 
the  company,  Form-32  and  the  statement  in 
lieu of prospect in support of his contentions. 
SEBI  relied  on  the  letters  written  by  the 
company showing the petitioner as a director.
The  Hon’ble  High  Court  has  held  that 
the jurisdiction to quash a complaint cannot 
be  exercised  when  the  pleadings  in  the 
complaint  prima  facie  reveal  commission  of 
an offence and the complaint is not frivolous 
or  fictitious.  The  Court  further  held  that 
even  if  it  is  proved  that  the  petitioner  was 
not  a  director  of  the  company,  he  can  still 
be liable if it is proved that he was in charge 
of  the  affairs  of  the  company.  The  Court 
has  also  observed  that  the  violations  of  CIS 
Regulations  pleaded  in  the  complaint  are 
continuing  in  nature  and  the  documents 
relied on by the petitioner does not prove that 
he was neither a director nor was responsible 
for  the  affairs  of  the  company  for  the  entire 
period  during  which  the  offence  continued. 
Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.

holding that the amount mobilised from the 
investors are not yet refunded and the offence 
is continuing one.

The  aforesaid  order  of  the  Magistrate 
was  challenged  in  the  present  Criminal 
Revision  Application  before  the  Hon’ble 
High  Court  of  Madras.  The  Hon’ble  High 
Court  vide  order  dated  September  18,  2009, 
dismissed  the  application,  observing,  inter 
alia,  that  “the  revision  petitioners  have 
to  repay  the  collected  amount  from  the 
investors,  but,  still  they  have  not  repaid 
the  same,  so  it  is  continuing  offence.  If  the 
obligation continues and it is not discharged, 
the default constitutes a continuing offence”. 
The  court  has  also  held  that  the  non 
compliance  of  Regulations  73  and  74  for 
winding  up  the  company  is  continuing 
in  nature  and  as  such  the  offences  is  also 
continuing  in  nature.  Further,  Section  24 
of  the  SEBI  Act  is  amended  with  effect 
from  October  29,  2002  and  the  offence 
under  section  24  became  punishable  with 
imprisonment  for  a  term  which  may  extend 
to ten years or with fine which may extend to 
twenty five crore rupees or with both. Hence 
the complaint is not barred by limitation.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market

Box 3.2: Consent and Compounding Scheme of SEBI

SEBI settles the pending enforcement actions such as 
prosecution,  adjudication,  section  11  B  proceedings, 
etc.  through  the  consent  process  in  accordance  with 
its circular dated April 20, 2007. The process broadly 
followed is as under:

On receipt of an application from the concerned entity 
for  settlement,  an  internal  Committee  of  Division 
Chiefs  after  meeting  the  applicant  examines  if  the 
terms offered by it are appropriate for settlement. The 
Internal Committee (IC) comprise of one Chief General 
Manager  not  dealing  with  any  of  the  Enforcement 
Actions,  one  Officer  not  below  the  rank  of  Deputy 
General Manager each from the concerned Operational 
Department and from Legal/Enforcement Department. 
The terms finally offered by the applicant are placed 
before  the  High  Powered  Advisory  Committee 
(HPAC) which is headed by a former Judge of a High 
Court,  an  Ex-Chairman  of  Public  Sector  Bank  and 
a  Chartered  Accountant  as  members,  to  ascertain  if 
the  terms  are  fair  and  reasonable.  The  HPAC,  after 
taking  into  account  facts  and  circumstances  of  the 
case and the factors specified in the Circular, makes its 
recommendations  accepting,  declining  or  suggesting 
modifications  in  the  terms  offered  by  the  applicant. 
A  panel  of  two  Whole  Time  Members  considers  the 
recommendations  of  the  HPAC  and  takes  a  decision 
whether  to  settle  the  enforcement  action  on  the  said 
terms  or  decline  the  settlement.  On  compliance  of 
the  terms  of  settlement,  as  approved  by  the  panel, 
a  consent  order  is  passed  by  SEBI,  if  the  matter  is 
pending before it. The agreed consent terms are placed 
before the Securities Appellate Tribunal or Courts, as 

the case may be, if the matter is pending before them, 
for  appropriate  orders.  In  case  of  compounding,  the 
approved  compounding  terms  are  submitted  before 
the Court for its consideration.

Till  March  31,  2010,  SEBI  has  approved  904 
applications  settling  various  kinds  of  enforcement 
actions.  These  include  68  consent  applications 
where  after  the  consent  terms  were  placed  before 
the  Securities  Appellate  Tribunal  and  the  Supreme 
Court,  consent  orders  were  passed  by  the  Securities 
Appellate  Tribunal  and  the  Supreme  Court 
respectively.  The  number  (904)  also  includes  63 
compounding  applications  where  the  compounding 
orders were passed by the respective criminal courts. 
SEBI has also rejected 535 applications and declined 
to pass consent orders for various reasons including 
the  reason  that  the  terms  of  settlement  proposed 
by  the  applicants  were  not  found  adequate.  Apart 
from an amount of Rs.27,26,18,007 collected towards 
disgorgement, a sum of Rs.89,15,78,253 was collected 
towards  settlement  charges  and  Rs.1,40,60,450  was 
collected  towards  legal  and  administrative  charges. 
The  amount  received  towards  settlement  charges  is 
remitted  to  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India  and  the 
amount received towards disgorgement is retained in 
separate account for distribution to the unsuccessful 
investors  in  IPO  irregularities  as  recommended  by 
Justice  Wadhwa  Committee.  Besides  the  amount, 
the settlement in 120 cases includes debarment from 
dealing  in  securities  market/suspension  of  certificate 
of registration for different periods.

ii.  Mr. Yogesh Bhansali -HUF & Others vs. 
SEBI  (Civil  Appeal  D.NO.  2506/2010, 
date of order: 11/02/2010)
Pursuant  to  investigations,  SEBI  passed 
an  order  against  the  Appellant  directing 
impounding of ill gotten gains of Rs.41.6 lakh 
with  interest  and  debarment  from  securities 
market, for cornering shares meant for Retail 
Individual Investor’s quota.

Hon’ble SAT vide order dated September 
23,  2009  while  dismissing  the  appeals, 
held  that  ‘As  found  in  the  impugned 
orders,  multiple  applications  in  different 
combinations  were  filed  by  the  applicants 
with a view to hoodwink the issuer company 
and  to  escape  the  weeding  out  of  their 
applications  at  the  threshold’.  Hon’ble 
SAT  further  held  that  ‘the  conduct  of  the 
appellants  herein  is  similar,  if  not  more 
devious,  to  the  conduct  of  Ms.Himani  Patel 
in  Appeal  No.154/2008  and  for  the  reasons 
stated therein we have no doubt in our mind 
that their conduct was fraudulent. They have 
deprived  a  larger  number  of  genuine  retail 
investors  from  their  dues’.  Accordingly, 
Hon’ble  SAT  held  that  the  appellants  are 
guilty  of  violating  Section  12A  of  the  SEBI 
Act,  1992  and  regulations  3  &  4  of  the 
SEBI(PFUTP)  Regulations,  2003.  Hon’ble 
SAT also imposed a cost of Rs.50,000/- on the 
appellant.

The appellants challenged the said order 
of  SAT  before  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  and 
the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  dismissed  the 
appeals.

Appeal  No.  326/2009,  date  of  order:

Appeal  was  filed  against  SAT  order 
dated October 21, 2009. The Hon’ble SAT vide 
said order had upheld the SEBI’s order dated 
February  08,  2006  directing  the  Petitioner 
Company to make repayment to the investors 
and wind up the schemes in accordance with 
SEBI  CIS  Regulations,  1999.  The  company

petition under Article 226 of the Constitution 
against the Union of India, SEBI and the BSE, 
inter-alia,  for  a  direction  upon  the  Union  of 
India  and  SEBI  to  withdraw  the  recognition 
granted  to  BSE  for  alleged  non-compliance 
with  the  provisions  of  Sections  7  and  9  of 
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act, 
1956.  A  further  direction  was  also  sought 
for  cancellation  of  SEBI  registration  of  all 
relevant  90  members  of  the  BSE  allegedly 
for  fraudulently  inducing  investors  to  trade 
in  forged  scrips  of  M/s.  Presto  Finance 
Ltd.  and  to  declare  the  Rules,  Bye-laws 
and  Regulations  of  the  BSE  as  illegal,  void 
and  ultra  vires  the  1956  Act  as  also  the 
Constitution of India.

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  dismissed  the 
petition  vide  judgment  dated  January  19, 
2010.  However,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 
directed  BSE  to  publish  in  the  Gazette  all 
those  Bye-laws  which  were  not  published 
earlier.  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  inter  alia, 
held as follows;

"Before parting, we would, however, indicate 
that  even  if  the  1956  Act  did  not  contemplate 
publication of the pre-recognition Rules and Bye-
laws,  the  position  is  and  would  continue  to  be 
rather ambivalent if the amended Rules and Bye-
laws were published in the Official Gazette while 
the main Rules and Bye-laws remain unpublished. 
It may, therefore, be in the fitness of things to have 
the said Rules and Bye-laws also published in the 
Official Gazette and the State Gazette to prevent 
questions  similar  to  those  raised  in  this  Special 
Leave Petition from being raised in future."

iv.  SEBI  vs.  Mr.  Ajai  Agarwal  (Civil 
Appeal  No.1697/2005,  date  of  order: 
25/02/2010)
The  Hon’ble  SAT  had  set  aside  the 
prohibitions  imposed  on  the  respondent 
by  SEBI  for  alleged  mis-statement  in  the 

142

prospectus  in  the  IPO  of  M/s.  Trident  Steel 
Ltd.  The  order  of  SEBI  was  set  aside  on  the 
ground  that  provision  of  Section  11B  of  the 
SEBI Act, 1992 cannot be invoked in respect of 
the alleged misconduct which took place at a 
point of time when section 11B was not on the 
statute book. SEBI filed an appeal against the 
said order before the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  vide  Order 
dated  February  25,  2010  upheld  SEBI’s 
findings  against  the  appellant.  It  was  held 
that ‘it may be noticed that Section 11B of the Act 
was invoked even at the show cause notice stage. 
Therefore,  it  cannot  be  said  that  any  provision 
has  been  invoked  in  the  midst  of  any  pending 
proceeding initiated by the Board. The respondent 
was, thus, put on notice that SEBI is invoking its 
power under Section 11B which was available to 
it under the law on the date of issuance of show 
cause notice’.

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  observed  that 
the  conduct  of  the  respondent  and  the 
prohibition  from  dealing  in  securities  for 
a  period  of  five  years  imposed  on  the 
respondent  may  not  be  equated  to  ‘offence’ 
and  ‘penalty’.  The  order  passed  by  SEBI  is 
restraining  the  respondent  from  accessing 
the  securities  market  and  same  is  totally 
different from the definition and meaning of 
“offence”. The order is not “penalty”. Hence, 
the protection available under Article 20(1) of 
the Constitution is not tenable in the present 
matter.

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  further  held 
that  the  SEBI  Act  (1992)  is  pre  eminently  a 
social  welfare  legislation  seeking  to  protect 
the  interests  of  the  common  men  who  are 
small investors. The Hon’ble Supreme Court 
also  held  that  ‘Provisions  of  Section  11B 
being  procedural  in  nature  can  be  applied 
retrospectively.

M/s.  Oasis  Media  Matrix  Ltd,  a  listed 
company  had  been  earning  marginal  profits 
during  the  period  2002-2005.  The  company 
had  reissued  forfeited  shares.  SEBI  carried 
investigations  relating  to  reissue  of  shares 
and  found  that  promoters  of  the  company 
offloaded  the  reissued  shares,  which  were 
not  listed.  It  was  also  found  that  there  was 
no consideration against the reissued shares. 
SEBI  found  the  appellants  to  have  violated 
Regulation  3  (a),  to  (d)  of  SEBI  (PFUTP) 
Regulations,  2003  and  were  restrained  from 
dealing in securities for a period of two years 
vide order dated February 14, 2008.

challenged  before  Hon’ble  SAT  in  Appeal

Corporation (KSFC) alleged that a fraud was 
perpetrated  by  the  appellant  and  its  share 
transfer  agent  M/s.  Karvy  Computershare 
Pvt.  Ltd.  in  transferring  the  pledged  shares 
to  a  third  party.  SEBI  vide  order  dated 
March  28,  2008  debarred  the  appellants  for 
a  period  of  five  years,  for  illegally  issuing 
duplicate share certificates though the original 
certificates  continued  to  remain  with  KSFC 
and  thereby  violating  Regulation  3  (a),  (c) 
and (d) and Regulation 4 (2) (h) of the SEBI 
(PFUTP)  Regulations,  2003.  SAT  vide  order 
dated November 18, 2008 upheld the findings

dismissed the appeal.

The  short  but  important  question  that 
arose  for  consideration  before  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in the aforesaid appeals filed 
by  SEBI  were  as  to  whether  the  Hon’ble 
SAT  exercising  power  under  Rules  21  of 
SAT  (Procedure)  Rules,  2000  can  convert 
the  suspension  of  certificate  of  registration 
imposed  by  SEBI  into  monetary  penalty. 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  set  aside  the  order 
of SAT converting suspension of certificate of 
registration  imposed  by  SEBI  to  a  monetary 
penalty  and  agreed  with  SEBI  that  SAT  has 
no power to convert the nature of the penalty. 
Hon’ble Supreme Court, inter alia held :

for two months for violation of Section 12 of

to an unregistered sub-broker.

Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  Hon’ble, 
SAT dated December 09, 2009, the appellant 
had filed the captioned appeal. The Hon’ble

the  parties  declined  to  issue  notice  as  there

dismissed the appeal accordingly.

ix.  M/s.  Kajol  Impex  Ltd  vs.  SEBI  (Civil 
Appeal  No  223/2010,  date  of  order: 
22/01/2010)
SEBI investigated dealings in the scrip of 
M/s. Shree Yaax Pharma & Cosmetics Limited 
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‘the  company’) 
for the period of June 11, 2004 to August 10, 
2004.  During  the  course  of  investigations, 
SEBI  issued  several  summons  requiring  the 
appellant  to  furnish  the  details  regarding 
its  dealings  in  the  shares  of  the  company. 
The appellant failed to comply with the said 
summons/notices.

SEBI  initiated  adjudication  proceedings 
under  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  and  the 
Adjudicating  Officer  imposed  a  penalty 
of  Rs.25  lakh  on  the  appellant  for  non 
compliance of summons issued.

The  appellant  filed  appeal  No  167/2009 
before  the  Hon’ble  SAT.  The  Hon’ble  SAT 
observed that by not furnishing the requisite 
information  and  by  not  appearing  before

prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in 
securities and associating with the securities 
market  in  any  manner  whatsoever  for  a 
period  of  one  year  for  having  found  guilty 
of  indulging  in  synchronised  trades  on  a 
large  scale  in  number  of  scrips  resulting  in 
artificial  creations  of  volumes  and  price  in

The Hon’ble High Court, while disposing off 
the matter, gave liberty to the petitioner to file

before  the  SEBI  authorities  to  show  that  the

High Court
The  captioned  writ  petition  was  filed 
by the Indian Bank Mutual Fund (Petitioner) 
challenging  the  order  dated  November  30, 
1999  passed  by  SEBI  and  the  order  dated 
February  18,  2000  passed  by  the  Central 
Government  upholding  SEBI’s  order.  Vide 
the  impugned  orders  the  mutual  fund  was 
directed  to  pay  dividend  for  the  financial 
Year  1996-97  to  Asian  Institute  of  Transport 
Department  (AITD)  for  the  units  it  issued 
under the Ind-Jyoti Scheme, 1990 (Plan – A).

and the Central Government.

III.  Securities Appellate Tribunal

i.  M/s. Wealth Sea Properties and Others. 
vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 98 of 2008, date of 
order: 13/07/2009)
Appeal  was  filed  challenging  SEBI’s 
letter whereby the request of the acquirer for 
second re-valuation of the shares of the Target 
Company was refused. Hon’ble SAT allowed 
the  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  there  were 
discrepancies in the report of the independent 
valuer  and  appointed  M/s.  Delloitte  Touche 
as independent valuer to assess the values of 
the shares of the target company on the date 
of the acquisition.

the grounds inter alia that (i) it was contrary 
to  the  SEBI  Act,  as  the  SEBI  Act,  does  not 
include  mutual  fund  distributors  under 
its  purview;  (ii)  it  extinguishes  the  right 
to  trade  and/or  profession  of  the  small 
individual  distributor  and  is  therefore 
unconstitutional  and  bad  in  law.  Hon’ble 
High  Court  dismissed  the  writ  petition 
holding  that  section  11(1)  of  the Act  is  very 
widely  worded,  sub-section  2  does  not 
restrict  or  narrows  down  the  wide  scope  of 
sub-section 1. Sub-section 2 is not exhaustive 
of  the  power  and  authority  of  SEBI.  Under 
sub-section  1,  SEBI  can  regulate  payment 
of  commission  or  state  that  there  shall  not 
be  any  entry  load.  SEBI  is  controlling  and 
regulating  new  issues  by  mutual  fund 
managers.  While  doing  so,  they  are  entitled 
and empowered to issue circulars in respect 
of  entry  load  in  the  new  mutual  fund.  The 
power  conferred  upon  SEBI  under  section 
11(2)(b)  relates  to  both  registration  as  well 
as the regulation. It is not possible to accept 
the  contention  that  without  registration  of 
distributors,  SEBI  cannot  control  or  regulate 
their working. SEBI is an expert body, which 
is  entitled  to  regulate  the  market  and  has 
now  issued  circular  dated  June  30,  2009.  In 
economic  matters  and  matters  relating  to 
finance, courts are reluctant to interfere unless 
clear violation of Article 14 is made out.

ii.  M/s.  MPS  Greenery  Pvt  Ltd  vs.  SEBI, 
(WP  No.  1971/2001,  date  of  order:

Kolkata High Court
SEBI  vide  its  order  dated  September  3, 
2002  had  directed  the  M/s.  MPS  Greenery, 
which found to have been running collective 
investment  schemes  without  obtaining 
registration  from  SEBI  as  per  SEBI  CIS 
Regulations, to wind up its existing schemes,

ii.  M/s.  Eight  Capital  Masters  Fund  and 
Others.  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal  no.  111  of 
2008, date of order: 22/07/2009)
Acquirers  were  allotted  two  types  of 
debentures  i.e.  Compulsorily  Convertible 
Debentures  and  Optionally  Convertible 
Debentures (OCD) which were to be converted 
into the equity shares of the target company. 
Post  conversion  of  OCDs,  acquirers  were 
to  trigger  the  Takeover  Regulations.  They 
made a public announcement for which they 
calculated the offer price by taking the date of 
Board resolution authorising the preferential 
allotment  of  OCDs  (March  3,  2006)  as  the 
reference  date  in  terms  of  explanation  (ii) 
to  regulation  20(11).  Vide  the  observation 
letter  dated  August  29,  2008,  SEBI  advised 
the  acquirers  to  recalculate  the  offer  price 
by reckoning the public announcement (PA) 
date (January 22, 2008) as the reference date. 
Aggreived with the same, acquirer preferred 
an  appeal  before  Hon’ble  SAT.  Hon’ble  SAT 
held  that  as  the  Takeover  Code  triggers 
only  on  acquisition  of  voting  rights  and  not 
otherwise  therefore,  “preferential  allotment” 
as mentioned in Explanation (ii) to regulation 
20(11)  of  the  Takeover  Regulations  means 
the  preferential  allotment  of  shares  carrying 
voting rights. In the present case, meeting of 
the  Board  of  Directors  when  the  resolution 
to  allot  the  shares  carrying  voting  rights 
pursuant  to  conversion  of  debenture  was 
held on January 26, 2008. Therefore, it is the 
date  of  Board  resolution  which  authorised 
the  preferential  allotment  to  be  taken  as  the 
reference date.

iii.  M/s.  Hamlet  Holding  Aps  and  Others 
vs.  SEBI  and  Others  (Appeal  no. 
12/2009, date of order: 05/08/2009)
The appellant had challenged the SEBI’s 
observation  issued  on  the  draft  letter  of 

146

offer  for  the  public  offer  of  M/s.  Disa  India 
Limited  (Target  Company)  due  to  indirect 
acquisition of 74 percent shares in the Target 
Company.  The  appellant  had  calculated  the 
offer  price  in  terms  of  regulation  20(12)  by 
taking  the  date  of  public  announcement  for 
the  Target  Company.  SEBI  had  advised  the 
merchant  banker  to  calculate  the  offer  price 
also  by  taking  the  date  of  Stock  and  Share 
Purchase  Agreement  (i.e.  March  08,  2008) 
as the date of PA for the parent company in 
terms  of  regulation  20(12)  of  the  Takeover 
Regulations.  Hon’ble  SAT  held  that  word 
“public announcement” as used in Takeover 
Regulations  has  a  specific  connotation. 
Regulation  20(12)  applies  only  in  case  of 
indirect acquisition made through acquisition 
of  parent  company  which  is  Indian  listed 
company.  It  has  no  application  where  the 
parent company is unlisted Indian company 
or  where  it  is  a  foreign  company  whether 
listed  or  unlisted.  Since,  in  the  present  case 
parent  company  was  a  foreign  company, 
no  PA  in  terms  of  Regulation  20  (12)  of  the 
Takeover  Regulations  was  required  to  be 
made.  As  there  was  no  date  for  PA  for  the 
parent  company,  the  acquirer  was  right  in 
calculating the offer price by taking the date 
of PA for the Target Company only.

iv.  Mr. Deepak Mehra vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 

140 of 2009, date of order: 22/08/2009)
In  the  present  appeal,  letter  dated  June 
22,  2009  issued  by  SEBI  under  the  SEBI 
(Informal  Guidance)  Scheme,  2003  on  the 
proposed  acquisition  by  M/s.  MTN  of  35 
percent  of  GDRs  and  giving  the  rights  to 
the GDR holders to exercise voting rights in 
M/s.  Bharti  Airtel  Limited,  was  challenged. 
Hon’ble  SAT  dismissed  the  appeal  holding 
that  a  letter  issued  under  the  Informal 
Guidance Scheme is not an order in terms of 

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

Takeover  Regulations.  In  terms  of  Stock 
Purchase Agreement acquirer was also paying 
non-compete  fees  to  the  promoters  which 
amounted to 6.7 percent of the offer price per 
share. SEBI advised merchant banker to revise 
the offer price by including non-compete fees 
also.  In  this  appeal,  acquirer  impugned  the 
said advice. Hon’ble SAT allowed the appeal 
holding  that  in  the  present  case  payment 
of  extra  consideration  to  promoters/sellers 
was justified as non-compete, because sellers 
were  competent  enough  to  give  competition 
to  the  acquirers.  Hon’ble  SAT  further  held 
that  under  regulation  20(8)  of  the  Takeover 
Regulations,  SEBI  can  look  into  whether  a 
payment which is being called non-compete is 
actually a non-compete or not even when it is 
less than 25 percent of the offer price.

vii.  Dr.  Jayaram  Chigurupati  vs.  SEBI 
and  Mr.  Narayanan  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal 
Ns.  137  &  139  of  2009,  date  of  order: 
07/10/2009)
This  appeal  was  filed  impugning  a 
communication  by  SEBI  whereby  SEBI 
informed  the  appellant  that  the  price 
calculated by the acquirers (i.e. M/s. Daiichi) 
was  in  accordance  with  the  Takeover 
Regulations.  In  this  case  M/s.  Zenotech 
(Target Company) was acquired by the M/s. 
Ranbaxy  (PAC)  and  M/s.  Zenotech  became 
the subsidiary of M/s. Ranbaxy. Subsequently, 
M/s.  Daiichi  (Acquirer)  acquired  M/s. 
Ranbaxy  (Parent  Company)  and  thereby 
resulting  into  indirectly  acquiring  M/s. 
Zenotech.  Hon’ble  SAT  allowed  the  appeal 
holding  that  in  cases  of  indirect  acquisition, 
for  the  purpose  of  determining  acquirer 
and  PAC,  in  terms  of  regulation  20(4)
(b),  the  relevant  date  is  the  date  of  public 
announcement for the target company. Thus 
it makes no difference that at the time of PA 

section  15T  of  the  SEBI  Act,1992  and  hence 
is  not  appealable  before  SAT.  Hon’ble  SAT 
further  held  that  appeal  before  SAT  under 
section  15T  lies  against  an  order  passed  by 
SEBI  and  not  against  inaction  of  SEBI.  The 
remedy for the appellant, if any, in such cases 
lies elsewhere.

v.  Mr. M. Z. Khan vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 98 

of 2008, date of order: 08/09/2009)
This  appeal  was  filed  challenging  the 
inaction  of  SEBI  in  not  adjudicating  on  the 
issue  of  alleged  violation  of  the  regulation 
12  of  the  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  1997  by 
the  M/s.  Burren  Energy  Limited  (acquirer) 
and  M/s.  Unocal  Bharat  Limited  (PAC)  in 
acquiring  the  shares  and  control  in  the  M/s. 
Hindustan  Oil  and  Exploration  Company 
(target company). Hon’ble SAT dismissed the 
appeal inter alia on the following grounds:
a) 

Inaction  of  SEBI  cannot  be  challenged 
under section 15T before SAT;

c) 

b)  Principle of constructive res judicata and 
principle contained in order 2 Rule 2 of 
the C.P.C.;
Suppression  of  material  facts  by  the 
appellant  from  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 
while withdrawing the SLP(C) No. 15404 
of 2008.
Hon’ble  SAT  also  imposed  a  cost  of 

Rs.50,000/- on the appellant.

vi.  M/s.  Tata  Tea  Limited  vs.  SEBI 
(Appeal no. 136 of 2008, date of order: 
15/09/2009)
M/s.  Tata  Tea  Limited  (acquirer)  had 
acquired  24.2  percent  shares  of  the  M/s. 
Mount  Everest  Mineral  Water  Limited 
(Target  Company)  by  virtue  of  the  two 
agreements  dated  June  1,  2007  for  which 
he  made  the  Public Announcement  on  June 
4,  2007  under  regulation  10  and  12  of  the 

147

Annual Report 2009-10

for  the  parent  company  (M/s.  Ranbaxy)  by 
the  M/s.  Daichi,  M/s.  Ranbaxy  could  not  be 
treated  as  PAC  with  M/s.  Daichi  as  it  was 
itself  a  target  company.  Therefore,  acquirer 
and PAC were required to calculate the offer 
price  for  the  target  company,  by  taking  into 
consideration  the  acquisition  made  by  the 
M/s.  Ranbaxy  (PAC),  in  the  target  company, 
26  weeks  prior  to  date  of  making  of  PA  by 
the M/s. Daiichi for the parent company (M/s. 
Ranbaxy).

viii. M/s. Subhkam Ventures (I) Pvt. Ltd vs. 
SEBI (Appeal No. 08/2009, date of order: 
15/01/2010)
The  appeal  was  filed  by  M/s.  Subhkam 
Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (the acquirer) challenging 
the  SEBI’s  observation  letter  whereby  the 
merchant banker was advised to disclose the 
regulation  12  of  the  Takeover  Regulations 
also  in  the  letter  of  offer  as  the  Share 
Subscription  &  Shareholder  Agreement 
(SS&SHA)  signed  by  the  acquirers  were 
giving  the  controlling  rights  to  the  acquirer, 
in the M/s. MSK Projects (India) Ltd (Target 
Company).  In  the  present  case  acquirer  had 
made  offer  under  the  regulation  10  only. 
Hon’ble SAT while allowing the appeal held 
that  the  word  ‘control’  is  a  proactive  and 
not  a  reactive  power.  Control  really  means 
creating  or  controlling  a  situation  by  taking 
the  initiative.  Power  by  which  an  acquirer 
can only prevent a company from doing what 
the latter wants to do is by itself not control 
since the acquirer is only reacting rather than 
taking the initiative. In the light of aforesaid 
observations, after deliberating upon various 
clauses  of  the  said  agreement,  Hon’ble  SAT 
held  that  the  protective  provisions  under 
SS&SHA  were  in  the  nature  of  standards  of 
good  corporate  governance  and  to  protect 
the interests of the acquirer and none of the 

148

clauses of the SS&SHA taken individually or 
collectively demonstrated control in the hands 
of the acquirer.

ix.  M/s.  S.  Kumars  Nationwide  Ltd.  vs. 
BSE  and  Others.  (Appeal  N0.  151  of 
2008, date of order: 07/08/2009)

This  appeal  was  filed  against  refusal 
of  in-principle  approval  for  listing  by  the 
BSE of 63,76,195 and 16,66,665 equity shares 
of  M/s.  S.  Kumars  Nationwide  Ltd.  issued 
on  a  preferential  basis  to  its  promoters, 
under  the  Corporate  Debt  Restructuring 
(CDR)  scheme  approved  by  a  CDR  Cell. 
The  in-principle  approval  was  refused 
for  violations  of  clause  13.4.1,  13.3.1  (f) 
and  13.3.1  (g)  of  the  SEBI  (Disclosure  and 
Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000  (since 
repealed).  Hon’ble  SAT  allowed  the  appeal 
and exercising the powers of the Board given 
under clause 17.2A.1 of the SEBI (Disclosure 
and  Investor  Protection)  Guidelines,  2000 
granted  exemption  to  the  appellant  from 
the  provisions  of  clause  13.3.1  (f)  and  (g) 
of  the  guidelines  and  directed  BSE  to  grant
in-principle  approval  as  sought  by  the 
appellant.

x.  M/s.  PGFL  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal  No. 

138/2009, date of order : 17/09/2008)

The  appellant  had  challenged  SEBI’s 
order dated September 17, 2008 directing the 
company  and  their  director  to  not  to  access 
the capital market for a period of 10 years for 
its failure to make repayment to the investors 
and  wind  up  the  schemes  in  accordance 
with SEBI CIS Regulations. The Hon’ble SAT 
observed  that  the  company  had  not  made 
repayment  of  the  money  collected  from 
investors  in  accordance  with  the  SEBI  CIS 
Regulations  and  also  continued  mobilising

increase the price of the scrip.

xii.  Mr.  Dilip  S.  Pendse  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal 

No. 80/2009, date of order: 19/11/2009)
The  appeal  was  filed  against  the  order 
dated March 31, 2009 of SEBI restraining the 
appellant  from  accessing  securities  market 
for a period of five years from the date of the 
order for alleged insider trading. The Hon’ble 
SAT vide its order dated November 19, 2009 
while allowing the appeal observed that ‘The 
charge of Insider trading is one of the most serious 
charges  in  relation  to  the  securities  market  and 
having regard to the gravity of this wrong doing, 
higher must be the preponderance of probabilities 
in establishing the same.’

xiii.  Ms.  Himani  Patel  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal 

No.154/2008, date of order: 07.09.2009)
The  appellant  preferred  an  appeal 
against  the  order  of  SEBI  dated  October  31, 
2009,  wherein  he  was  directed  to  disgorge 
the  ill  gotten  gain  of  Rs.33.5  lakh  together 
with  interest  at  the  rate  of  10  percent  and 
prohibited him from dealing in the securities 
market  for  a  period  of  three  years,  for 
having  cornered  shares  meant  for  the  retail 
individual  investors  in  the  initial  public 
offerings.  A  penalty  of  Rs.55  lakh  was  also 
imposed  by  the  AO  for  violation  of  section 
12A  of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992,  Regulation  3 
of  the  SEBI  (FUTP)  Regulations,  2003  and 
the  provisions  of  the  SEBI  (Disclosure  and 
Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000.

The  Hon’ble  SAT,  while  upholding 
SEBI’s power to disgorge the illegal gains, also 
observed that ‘The conduct of the appellant is 
not only subverted the allotment process but 
was also fraudulent in nature…… the whole 
time  member  was  justified  in  requiring  the 
appellant to disgorge the aforesaid amount.’ 

funds  despite  the  restraint  order  passed  by 
SEBI on December 6, 2002. The Hon’ble SAT 
dismissed  the  appeal  and  upheld  the  SEBI’s 
order.

xi.  M/s. Dimensional Securities Pvt. Ltd vs. 
SEBI  (Appeal  No.  143  of  2009,  date  of 
order: 29/06/2009)
The  appeal  was  filed  challenging  the 
order  dated  September  18,  2008  of  the 
Adjudicating  Officer  of  SEBI  imposing  a 
penalty  of  Rs  2,00,000  on  the  Appellant,  a 
Stock  Broker,  for  violating  Regulation  4(1) 
&  4(2)  (a)  (b)  (e)  and  (g)  of  SEBI  (PFUTP) 
Regulations,  2003  and  Clauses  A(1),  (2),  (3), 
(4)  and  (5)  of  Code  of  Conduct  specified 
under  Regulation  7  of  SEBI  (Stock  Brokers 
and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992 in respect 
of  its  dealings  in  the  scrip  of  M/s.  Soft  BPO 
Global Services Limited.

The  appellant  had  placed  several  buy 
orders  on  behalf  of  its  clients  before  the 
trading  session  started  for  the  day.  The 
investigation  report  showed  that  2009  of 
such  orders  out  of  2,122  orders  placed  were 
automatically  rejected  by  the  exchange 
mechanism.  However,  there  was  a  steep 
increase in the price of the scrip from Rs.15.2 
to  Rs.230.4  within  a  period  of  34  days.  The 
Adjudicating  Officer  held  that  the  broker 
had failed to exercise due care and diligence, 
thereby  violating  the  Code  of  Conduct 
prescribed  for  stock  brokers  and  abetted  its 
client in manipulating the price of the scrip.

The  Hon’ble  SAT  while  allowing  the 
appeal  held  that  the  rejected  orders  did  not 
affect  the  market  mechanism  and  could  not 
contribute  to  the  creation  of  any  volume 
whatsoever and therefore could not affect the 
price of the scrip. Also, the trades executed by 
the  broker  did  not  constitute  any  significant 

149

The  Hon’ble  SAT  dismissed  the  appeal  and 
imposed costs of Rs.50,000/- on the appellant.

xiv.  M/s.  Triumph  International  Finance 
India  Limited  vs.  BSE  and  Others. 
(Appeal No. 183 of 2009, date of order: 
09/02/2010)
The  captioned  appeal  was  filed  against 
the order of AO dated June 30, 2009 imposing 
a  monetary  penalty  of  Rs.  five  lakh  on  the 
appellant  for  not  disclosing  the  acquision 
of  shareholding  while  acting  in  concert 
with  other  noticees  and  thereby  violating 
Regulation 7 of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 
1997  in  the  scrip  of  M/s.  Adani  Exports 
Limited.  The  Hon’ble  SAT,  vide  its  order 
dated  February  9,  2010  while  allowing 
the  appeal  observed  that  close  business 
association  between  two  or  more  persons  is 
not  sine  qua  non  for  establishing  ‘persons 
acting in concert’.

xv.  Ms. Bhanuben Jaisukhlal Shah vs. SEBI 
(Appeal  No.  271/2009,  date  of  order: 
05/03/2010)
The  appeal  raises  an  issue  of 
interpretation  of  “Spot  Delivery  Contract” 
as  defined  in  section  2(i)(b)  of  the  SCR Act, 
1956.  The  appellant  contended  that  it  does 
not  mandate  the  acceptance  of  money/
consideration  between  parties,  but  it  only 
speak  about  the  transfer  of  securities  from 
one  account  to  another  by  depositories.  The 
Appellant  further  contended  that  section 
13  of  SCRA  would  not  be  applicable  as  per 
exception  provided  in  section  18(1)  of  the 
SCRA.  Hence,  the  appellant  is  not  liable  for 
violation of Section 13 read with section 2(i) 
of the SCRA.

The Hon’ble SAT while dismissing the appeal 
held that;

“The central government by its notification 

150

dated November 29, 1957 had made the provisions 
of  Section  13  applicable  to  the  area  comprising 
Greater  Bombay  with  which  we  are  concerned. 
Going  only  by  provision  of  section  13  of  the 
Act  read  with  the  notification  issued  by  the 
Central  Government,  no  person  could  execute 
the transactions in securities in Greater Bombay 
otherwise  than  through  member  of  a  recognised 
stock  exchange(s)  or  through  or  with  such 
member(s).  Section  18(1)  of  Act,  however, 
carves out an exception. It provides that nothing 
contained  in  Section  13  shall  apply  to  spot 
delivery contracts. A combined reading of Sections 
13 and 18(1) would lead us to conclude that as a 
general  Rule,  every  contract  in  securities  should 
be executed through members of recognised stock 
exchange (s) or through or with such member(s) 
and  the  only  exception  thereto  is  spot  delivery 
contract(s)”.

The Hon’ble SAT further held that;

“The  Parliament  then  inserted  clause 
(b) in Section 2(i) of the Act. This clause did 
not bring about any change in the definition 
of  spot  delivery  contract.  Clause  (a)  of  the 
amended  definition  remains  the  same  as 
the  definition  prior  to  the  amendment. 
Clause (b) was inserted only to explain what 
“actual  delivery”  would  mean  in  respect  of 
the  securities  held  in  dematerialised  form. 
According  to  Clause  (b),  when  securities 
are  transferred  from  one  beneficial  account 
to  another,  it  would  be  treated  as  “actual 
delivery”  of  securities  within  the  meaning 
of Clause (a). It is, thus clear that Clause (b) 
is  not  an  independent  clause,  but  only  an 
explanation  to  the  words  “actual  delivery” 
as  used  in  Clause  (a).  We  cannot,  therefore 
accept  the  argument  of  the  appellant  that 
Clause  (b)  is  an  independent  clause  and 
that  the  spot  delivery  contract  is  completed 
with the mere transfer of securities from the 

account  of  one  beneficial  owner  to  that  of 
another  without  reference  to  the  payment 
of consideration. This could never be. If that 
were  so,  the  contract  itself  would  become 
void being without consideration.”

IV.  Proposed Amendments

SEBI  has  sent  certain  proposals  to 
Central  Government  for  amendments  to 
Securities  Laws.  Some  of  the  important 
amendments proposed to various statutes are

relevant  exemption  sections.  No  penalties 
were  imposed  by  the  Central  Information 
Commission on SEBI or any of its employees 
under the Act.

SEBI’s  endeavor  has  always  been  to 
be  transparent  in  providing  information 
to  the  citizens  on  the  issues  relating  to  the 
functions  of  the  Regulatory  Authority.  By 
doing  so,  SEBI  has  been  implementing  the 
Right  to  Information  Act,  2005  in  its  true 
letter  and  spirit.  Towards  this  end,  SEBI 
has  initiated  several  steps  in  bringing  about 

greater  transparency  in  dissemination  of 
information by the various intermediaries and 
details  of  complaints,  status  of  redressal  of 
complaints, arbitration details/orders etc. are 
now available on exchange websites.

During  2009-10,  SEBI  took  various 
other  initiatives  to  maintain  transparency 
in  its  functions  including  disclosure  of  most 
of  the  information  on  a  regular  basis.  The 
implementation  of  the  Right  to  Information 
Act,  2005  in  SEBI  has  contributed  towards 
attaining  the  SEBI's  objective  of  protection 
and  education  of  the  investors  of  securities

It	was	clarified	that,	issue	and	listing	of	non-convertible	debt	securities,	
whether	 issued	 to	 the	 public	 or	 privately	 placed,	 is	 to	 be	 done	 in	
accordance	 with	 the	 provisions	 of	 the	 SEBI	 (Issue	 and	 Listing	 of	
Debt	 Securities)	 Regulations,	 2008.	 Issue	 of	 debt	 securities	 that	 are	
convertible,	either	partially	or	fully	or	optionally	into	listed	or	unlisted	
equity	 will	 be	 guided	 by	 the	 disclosure	 norms	 applicable	 to	 equity	
or	 other	 instruments	 offered	 on	 conversion	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 SEBI	
(Disclosure	and	Investor	Protection)	Guidelines,	2000.
In	 order	 to	 incentivise	 long	 term	 investors	 it	 was	 considered	
necessary	 that	 exit	 loads/Contingent	 Deferred	 Sales	 Charge	 (CDSC)	
which	are	beyond	reasonable	levels	are	credited	to	the	mutual	fund	
scheme	 immediately.	 Further,	 in	 order	 to	 empower	 the	 investors	 in	
deciding	the	commission	paid	to	distributors	in	accordance	with	the	
level	 of	 service	 received,	 to	 bring	 more	 transparency	 in	 payment	 of	
commissions	 and	 to	 incentivise	 long	 term	 investment,	 various	 steps	
such	as	abolition	of	entry	load	for	all	mutual	fund	schemes,	suitable	
disclosures	 regarding	 distribution	 of	 upfront	 commission	 etc.	 were	
taken.
To	 bring	 in	 parity	 between	 domestic	 Venture	 Capital	 Funds	 and	
Foreign	 Venture	 Capital	 Investors	 (FVCIs),	 it	 was	 decided	 that	 the	
applicants	 desirous	 of	 registering	 with	 SEBI	 as	 FVCIs	 had	 to	 obtain	
firm	commitment	from	their	investors	for	contribution	of	an	amount	
of	at	least	USD	one	million	at	the	time	of	submission	of	applications	
seeking	registration	as	FVCIs	before	the	start	of	operations.
It	 was	 clarified	 that	 the	 revised	 filing	 fee	 for	 mutual	 fund	 schemes	
would	 be	 applicable	 to	 those	 scheme(s)	 whose	 scheme	 information	
document(s)	had	been	filed	with	SEBI	on	or	after	July	1,	2009.
SEBI	 (Disclosure	 and	 Investor	 Protection)	 Guidelines,	 2000	 were	
amended	 to	 include	 compulsory	 listing	 of	 IPO	 on	 at	 least	 one	 stock	
exchange	 with	 nationwide	 trading	 terminals,	 changing	 eligibility

deliveries,	if	any,	of	the	shares	traded	on	cum-basis	may	be	directly	
closed	out.	In	case	of	such	direct	close-out,	the	mark-up	price	would	
be	as	stated	in	SEBI	circular	no.	SMD/POLICY/Cir-08/2002	dated	April	
16,	2002.

Pursuant	 to	 the	 recommendations	 made	 by	 the	 Secondary	 Market	
Advisory	 Committee	 of	 SEBI,	 it	 was	 decided	 that	 in	 case	 of	 a	 buy	
transaction	 in	 cash	 market,	 VaR	 margins,	 extreme	 loss	 margins	 and	
mark	to	market	losses	together	should	not	exceed	the	purchase	value	
of	the	transaction.	Further,	in	case	of	a	sale	transaction	in	cash	market,	
the	existing	practice	will	continue.

It	 was	 decided	 that,	 the	 mutual	 funds,	 while	 reporting	 their	 trades	
in	corporate	bonds	should	also	report	their	inter-scheme	transfers	on	
the	 BSE/NSE/FIMMDA	 reporting	 platforms.	 The	 mutual	 funds,	 or	
the	 brokers/intermediaries	 acting	 on	 their	 behalf	 should	 ensure	 that	
inter-scheme	 transfers	 are	 indicated	 separately	 while	 reporting	 the	
same.	The	authorised	stock	exchanges	and	FIMMDA	were	instructed	
to	put	in	place	suitable	systems	to	capture	the	aforesaid	inter-scheme	
transfers.	Such	trades	should	be	reported	distinctly	from	other	OTC	
trades.
Instructions	 were	 issued	 to	 all	 registered	 merchant	 bankers	 for	 due	
compliance	 in	 case	 of	 changes	 in	 the	 draft	 offer	 documents	 due	 to	
developments	 before	 the	 offer	 document	 is	 filed	 with	 Registrar	 of	
Companies	 (RoC)	 or	 Designated	 Stock	 Exchange	 (DSE)	 which	 may	
result	 in	 major	 deviations	 from	 the	 draft	 offer	 document	 that	 was	
available	in	public	domain.	Accordingly,	it	was	decided	to	classify	the	
changes	 in	 offer	 documents	 which	 may	 call	 for	 (i)	 filing	 of	 updated	
offer	 document,	 with	 the	 Board	 along	 with	 fees	 and	 (ii)	 filing	 of	
updated	offer	document,	with	the	Board,	without	fees.
Pursuant	 to	 amendment	 of	 SEBI	 (Portfolio	 Managers)	 Regulations

IDR	 issuances,	 Chapter	 VIA	 of	 the	 SEBI	 (Disclosure	 and	 Investor

DIP	Guidelines	mainly	relate	to	the	disclosure	of	financial	information	
pertaining	to	the	issuing	company	and	the	extent	of	applicability	of	the	
DIP	Guidelines	to	IDR	issues.

It	was	clarified	that	for	the	purpose	of	payment	of	commission,	both

clarifications	 were	 issued	 with	 respect	 to	 the	 interpretation	 of	 the	
proviso	inserted	by	the	aforesaid	amendment.

In	order	to	have	parity	among	all	classes	of	unit	holders,	it	was	decided	
that	no	distinction	among	unit	holders	should	be	made	based	on	the	
amount	of	subscription	while	charging	exit	loads.

Mutual	 funds	 were	 directed	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 with	 the	 circular	
regarding	 parity	 among	 all	 classes	 of	 unit	 holders	 on	 the	 basis	 of	
exit	 load	 on	 or	 before	 August	 24,	 2009.	 Mutual	 funds	 were	 further

more	efficient	and	effective,	SEBI	(Disclosure	and	Investor	Protection)	
Guidelines,	 2000,	 were	 amended	 to	 rationalise	 the	 rights	 issue
