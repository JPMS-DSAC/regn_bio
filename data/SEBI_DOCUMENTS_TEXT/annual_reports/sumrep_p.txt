Part One: Policies and Programmes

The policy initiatives undertaken during 2005-06 were as follows:
(cid:1) SEBI Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) Guidelines, 2000
relating  to  book-building  issues  were  amended  to  introduce  a
specific allocation of 5  per  cent  for  Mutual Funds,  proportionate
allotment  to  Qualified  Institutional  Buyers  (QIBs)  and  margin
requirement for QIBs.

(cid:1) In  order  to  ensure  faster  and  hassle-free  refunds,  it  was
decided  to  extend  the  facility  of  electronic  clearing  services
to  refunds  arising  out  of  public  issues,  initially  at  15  centers
where  clearing  houses  are  managed  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of
India (RBI).

1

(cid:1) In order to ensure availability of floating stocks on a continuous
basis  and  maintain  uniformity  for  the  purpose  of  continuous
listing,  it  was  decided  to  amend  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines,  2000
prescribing minimum public shareholding of 25 per cent in case
of all listed companies barring a few exceptions.

(cid:1) In  order  to  assist  the  investors,  particularly  the  retail  investors,
in-principle approval was given for grading of IPOs by the rating
agencies  at  the  option  of  the  issuers.  SEBI  will  not  certify  the
assessment made by the rating agencies.

(cid:1) In order to rationalise the disclosure requirements, it was decided
to  do  away  with  voluminous  and  repetitive  disclosures  in  case
of rights issues and public issues by the listed companies which
have  a  satisfactory  track  record  of  filing  periodic  returns  with
the stock exchanges and have a comprehensive mechanism for
satisfactory redressal of investor grievances.

(cid:1) It  was  decided  to  permit  an  issuer  company  making  a  rights
issue to despatch an abridged letter of offer which shall contain
disclosures  as  required  to  be  given  in  the  case  of  an  abridged
prospectus.

(cid:1) It was decided to permit a listed company to fix and disclose the
issue price in case of a rights issue, any time prior to fixing of the
record date in consultation with the designated stock exchange,
and in case of public issue through fixed price route, at any time
prior to filing of the prospectus with the Registrar of Companies.
(cid:1) In order to facilitate additional resource mobilisation, a company
is  permitted  to  issue  further  shares  after  filing  a  draft  offer
document  with  SEBI,  provided  full  disclosures  as  regards  the
total  capital  to  be  raised  from  such  further  issues  are  made  in
the draft offer document.

(cid:1) Listed  companies  were  advised  to  comply  with  the  provision  of
revised  Clause  49  of  the  Listing  Agreement  on  corporate
governance,  including  appointment  of  the  independent  directors
by December 31, 2005.

2

(cid:1) In  order  to  facilitate  execution  of  large  trades  without  impacting
the  market,  the  stock  exchanges  were  permitted  to  provide  a
separate  trading  window  for  block  deals  subject  to  certain
conditions. BSE and NSE activated this window with effect from
November 14, 2005.

(cid:1) SEBI advised the depositories/DPs not to levy any charges when
a Beneficiary Owner (BO) transfers all securities lying in his/her
account  to  another  branch  of  the  same  Depository  Participant
(DP)  or  to  another  DP  of  the  same  depository  or  another
depository,  provided  the  BO  accounts  at  the  transferee  DP  and
at transferor DP are one and the same.

(cid:1) In order to prevent off-market trades prior to the commencement
of  trading,  SEBI  advised  depositories  that,  in  case  of  IPOs,  the
ISINs  of  securities  should  be  activated  only  on  the  date  of
commencement of trading on the stock exchanges.

(cid:1) Following  recommendations  of  the  Jagdish  Capoor  Committee,
it was decided to resume in phases registration under the MAPIN
Regulations  to  obtain  the  Unique  Identification  Number  (UIN)
with  biometric  impression  for  a  trade  order  value  of  Rs.5  lakh
and above.

(cid:1) In  order  to  streamline  the  settlement  system  consistent  with
IOSCO  CPSS  Task  Force  recommendations,  transactions
executed  on  the  stock  exchanges  would  be  necessarily  settled
through  the  clearing  corporation/clearing  house  of  the  stock
exchanges.

(cid:1) As  a  further  safeguard  to  the  issuance  of  contract  notes,
additional  conditions  were  prescribed  such  as  sending  of
Electronic Contract Notes (ECNs) to a designated e-mail ID and
retention  of  acknowledgements  of  receipt/proof  of  delivery  only
to  such  clients  who  have  consented  for  the  same.  Wherever
the  ECNs  have  not  been  delivered  or  have  been  rejected  by

3

the  e-mail  ID  of  the  client,  the  broker  is  obligated  to  send  the
physical  contract  note(s)  within  the  stipulated  time  under  the
extant SEBI Guidelines.

(cid:1) On  the  basis  of  information  provided  by  depositories  regarding
establishment  of  connectivity  with  both  depositories,  stock
exchanges were advised to shift the shares of certain companies
from  Trade-for-Trade  segment  to  Rolling  Settlement  subject  to
their  having  at  least  50  per  cent  of  non-promoter  holdings  in
demat mode as per Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement.

(cid:1) A  Committee  was  set  up  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  G.
Anantharaman,  Whole  Time  Member,  SEBI  to  “Review  and
Examine  the  Future  of  the  Regional  Stock  Exchanges  (RSEs):
Post-Demutualisation”. According  to  the  terms  of  reference,  the
Committee  has  to  deliberate  and  advise  on  the  future  role  of
RSEs,  the  manner  of  dealing  with  assets  in  the  event  of
withdrawal of recognition and the process of divestment of their
shareholding.

(cid:1) Based  on  recommendations  of  the  Secondary  Market  Advisory
Committee,  the  trading  member  position  limit  for  stock-based
derivatives has been revised.

(cid:1) SEBI allowed mutual funds to participate in the derivatives market

in the same manner as the FIIs, subject to position limits.

(cid:1) The  eligibility  criteria  for  introduction  of  derivatives  on  stocks  of
companies  undergoing  restructuring  have  been  prescribed
whereby, it has been specified that derivatives can be introduced
on stocks of large companies undergoing corporate restructuring
on the first day of listing subject to certain conditions.

(cid:1) In  order  to  expedite  the  Corporatisation  and  Demutualisation
(C  and  D)  of  stock  exchanges,  SEBI  approved  and  notified  C
and  D  schemes  of  19  stock  exchanges  during  2005-06.  The
NSE and OTCEI have been exempted from submitting C and D

4

schemes  as  they  were  already  notified  as  corporatised  and
demutualised  stock  exchanges  vide  notifications  dated  March
23, 2005 and September 15, 2005, respectively.

(cid:1) Based  on  recommendations  of  the  Madhukar  Committee,  the
SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations,  1996  were  amended  and  a
notification  was  issued  on  January  12,  2006  permitting  mutual
funds  to  introduce  Gold  Exchange  Traded  Funds  (GETFs)  in
India subject to certain investment restrictions.

(cid:1) According  to  the  SEBI  Guidelines  dated  December  12,  2003,
every  mutual  fund  scheme  should  have  at  least  20  investors
and holding of a single investor should not be more than 25 per
cent of the corpus. SEBI clarified that this stipulation is applicable
at  the  portfolio  level.  Moreover,  if  there  is  a  breach  of  25  per
cent  limit  by  an  investor  over  the  quarter,  a  rebalancing  period
of one month would be allowed.

(cid:1) In  order  to  facilitate  the  unit  holders  to  claim  tax  benefit
associated with the payment of Securities Transaction Tax (STT),
it  was  decided  to  allow  mutual  funds  to  share  the  unique  client
code of their schemes/plans with the unit holders.

(cid:1) Mutual  funds  were  permitted  to  invest  in  ADRs,  GDRs  and
foreign  securities.  In  case,  disclosures  to  this  effect  were  not
made  in  the  offer  document,  all  mutual  funds  were  advised  to
send  a  written  communication  to  the  investors  about  the
proposed  investment.

(cid:1) The  Venture  Capital  Funds  were  allowed  to  invest  in  securities
of foreign companies subject to conditions stipulated by RBI and
SEBI from time to time.

(cid:1) The  cumulative  debt  investment  limit  for  FII  investment  in  debt
securities  for  2006-07  has  been  revised  upward  by  the
Government  within  the  overall  limit  of  External  Commercial
Borrowings  (ECBs).  While  such  limit  for  Government  securities

5

(G-sec),  including  Treasury  Bills,  was  raised  from  US  $  1.75
billion  to  US  $  2.0  billion,  the  same  for  the  corporate  debt  was
increased from US $ 0.5 billion to US $ 1.5 billion.

(cid:1) In  order  to  provide  flexibility  to  corporate  restructuring,  SEBI
(Substantial  Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations,
1997 is being amended to provide for removal of restrictions on
market  purchases  and  preferential  allotments.  The  outgoing
shareholders  can  sell  entire  stake  to  the  incoming  acquirer  in
case  of  takeover.  However,  if  the  target  company’s  minimum
public  shareholding  falls  below  the  prescribed  minimum,  the
restoration  should  take  place  through  a  framework  provided  by
the revised Clause 40A of the Listing Agreement.

(cid:1) In  order  to  simplify  the  existing  framework,  the  SEBI  (Delisting
of Securities) Guidelines, 2003 were amended making it possible
for  stock  exchanges  to  delist  the  shares  of  companies  non-
compliant with the Listing Agreement.

Part Two: Review of Trends and Operations

(cid:1) The  revival  of  the  primary  market,  which  started  in  2003-04,
gathered  momentum  in  2004-05,  and  was  further  invigorated  in
2005-06.

(cid:1) Strong  macro-economic  fundamentals,  sustained  growth  of  the
manufacturing sector, active institutional support lent by FIIs and
mutual  funds,  positive  investment  climate,  sound  business
outlook,  encouraging  corporate  results  and  buoyant  secondary
market  induced  large  number  of  companies  to  raise  resources
from the primary market.

(cid:1) During  2005-06,  139  companies  accessed  the  primary  market
through  public  and  rights  issues  and  mobilised  Rs.27,382  crore
compared  to  60  companies  raising  Rs.28,256  crore  in
2004-05.

6

(cid:1) Excluding offer for sale, the amount raised during 2005-06 stood
at  Rs.27,104  crore,  which  was  higher  than  that  of  Rs.25,056
crore mobilised in the previous year.

(cid:1) All  the  public  issues  through  IPOs  in  2005-06  emanated  from
the  private  sector  companies,  except  one  i.e.,  Gujarat  State
Petronet Ltd., which was a public sector non-financial company.

(cid:1) The sector-wise classification reveals that private sector garnered
Rs.20,199  crore  through  131  issues  in  2005-06  whereas  public
sector mobilised Rs.7,183 crore through 8 issues.

(cid:1) Industry-wise, banks/ financial institutions continued to dominate
and mobilised Rs.12,439 crore (45.4 per cent) in 2005-06 through
12 issues.

(cid:1) The  Indian  stock  market  witnessed  unprecedented  buoyancy
during  2005-06  and  thereby  surpassed  many  of  its  previous
records.

(cid:1) The  BSE  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  appreciated  by  73.7  per
cent  and  67.1  per  cent,  respectively  over  March  31,  2005.  The
BSE  Sensex  gained  by  4787  points  during  the  financial  year  to
close at an all time high of 11280 on March 31, 2006. The S&P
CNX Nifty also added 1367 points to close at a high of 3403 on
March 31, 2006.

(cid:1) Commensurate  with  rise  in  the  stock  prices,  the  turnover  and
market capitalisation in the cash segment increased significantly
in  2005-06.  Turnover  in  cash  segment  was  Rs.23,90,103  crore,
a  rise  of  43.4  per  cent  over  the  previous  year.  BSE  market
capitalisation  rose  by  77.9  per  cent  to  Rs.30,22,190  crore  over
the previous year.

(cid:1) The  market  capitalisation  to  GDP  ratio  increased  significantly
during  2005-06  and  reached  an  all-time  high  of  about  85.6  per

7

cent.  There  was  also  a  significant  rise  in  the  traded  value  to
GDP ratio which rose from 53.4 per cent in 2004-05 to 67.7 per
cent in 2005-06.

(cid:1) The  rise  in  the  traded  value  to  GDP  ratio  of  the  derivatives
segment, which jumped from 82.1 per cent in 2004-05 to 136.6
per cent in 2005-06, was more impressive.

(cid:1) Among  the  sectoral  indices,  the  highest  gain  was  recorded  by
BSE  Capital  Goods  index  (156.0  per  cent),  followed  by  BSE
Consumer  Durables  index  (115.4  per  cent),  BSE  FMCG  index
(110.1 per cent) and BSE Auto index (101.2 per cent).

(cid:1) The  valuation  of  the  shares  could  be  gauged  from  the  price-
earnings  (P/E)  ratio.  In  contrast  to  the  trend  in  the  previous
year, the P/E ratios of major indices scaled upward in 2005-06.

(cid:1) The annualised volatility of BSE Sensex, measured by standard
deviation  of  log  returns,  declined  to  16.3  per  cent  in  2005-06
from  23.8  per  cent  in  the  previous  year.  A  similar  trend  was
also observed for S&P CNX Nifty.

(cid:1) About 86 per cent of the shares were traded for more than 100
days  at  BSE  in  2005-06  compared  to  81  per  cent  in  2004-05.
However, the percentage share of this group of shares declined
modestly  from  96  per  cent  to  92  per  cent  in  NSE  during  the
same period.

(cid:1) The  number  of  companies  signed  up  for  dematerialisation  at
NSDL rose from 5,537 in 2004-05 to 6,022 in 2005-06. In CDSL,
the  number  of  companies  signed  up  also  increased  from  5,068
in 2004-05 to 5,479 in 2005-06.

(cid:1) During  2005-06,  the  turnover  of  derivatives  market  was  307.4
per  cent  of  the  cash  market  turnover  at  NSE  and  202.2  per
cent of the combined cash market turnover of BSE and NSE.

8

(cid:1) The total number of contracts traded in the derivatives segment
of  NSE  more  than  doubled  to  15,76,19,271  in  2005-06  from
7,70,17,185 in 2004-05.

(cid:1) The  average  daily  turnover  rose  by  89.7  per  cent  to  Rs.19,220

crore in 2005-06 compared to Rs.10,131 crore in 2004-05.

(cid:1) Open  interest  increased  by  82.7  per  cent  to  Rs.38,469  crore  at
the  end  of  March  2006  compared  to  Rs.21,052  crore  a  year
ago.

(cid:1) The  gross  mobilisation  of  resources  by  all  mutual  funds  during
2005-06  stood  at  Rs.10,98,149  crore  compared  to  Rs.8,39,708
crore  during  the  previous  year  –  an  increase  of  30.8  per  cent
over the year.

(cid:1) The  net  mobilisation  of  resources  by  all  mutual  funds  at
Rs.52,779  crore  in  2005-06  was  the  highest  ever  in  a  single
year compared to Rs.2,200 crore in 2004-05 and Rs.46,808 crore
in 2003-04.

(cid:1) There  were  592  mutual  fund  schemes  as  on  March  31,  2006,
of  which,  325  were  income/debt  oriented  schemes,  231  were
growth/equity  oriented  schemes  and  the  remaining  36  were
balanced  schemes.

(cid:1) The  total  assets  under  management  by  all  mutual  funds  rose
substantially  by  55.0  per  cent  to  Rs.2,31,862  crore  at  the  end
of March 31, 2006 from Rs.1,49,600 crore a year ago.

(cid:1) The  gross  purchases  of  both  debt  and  equity  by  FIIs  increased
by  59.9  per  cent  to  Rs.3,46,978  crore  in  2005-06  from
Rs.2,16,953  crore  in  2004-05.  However,  the  net  investment  by
FIIs  in  2005-06  declined  by  9.6  per  cent  to  Rs.41,467  crore  in
2005-06  from  Rs.45,881  crore  in  2004-05  mainly  due  to  large
net outflows from the debt segment.

9

(cid:1) The  net  investment  by  FIIs  in  equity  was  Rs.48,801  crore  in

2005-06, the highest ever in a single year.

(cid:1) Several factors are responsible for increasing confidence of FIIs
on the Indian stock market which, inter alia, include strong macro-
economic  fundamentals  of  the  economy,  transparent  regulatory
system, abolition of long-term capital gains tax and encouraging
corporate  results.

(cid:1) India  has  a  developed  Government  securities  (G-sec)  market.
G-sec  yields  increased  across  the  entire  maturity  spectrum  in
2005-06  due  to  pressure  arising  out  of  high  level  of  sovereign
borrowing and pick up in the non-food credit.

(cid:1) Although  the  public  issue  of  bonds  were  conspicuous  by  their
absence  in  2005-06,  corporate  sector  mobilised  large  amount
of resources (Rs.83,827 crore) by way of private placements.

2004-05,  collection  of  fees  was  high  due  to  one-time  receipt  of
arrears from the brokers and sub-brokers.

(cid:1) In  order  to  further  enhance  efficacy  of  the  surveillance  function,
SEBI  decided  to  put  in  place  a  world-class  comprehensive
