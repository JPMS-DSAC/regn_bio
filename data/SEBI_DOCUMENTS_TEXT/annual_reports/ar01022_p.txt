PART II  
REVIEW  OF  THE  TRENDS  AND  OPERATIONS  OF  THE  SECURITIES 
MARKET 
 
A] PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET 
 
Capital Raised During 2001-02 
 
The  investment  activity  in  the  primary  market  recovered  moderately  during  2001-02  from  its 
subdued performance in 2000-01 as the total capital raised through equity and bonds registered a 
rise of 23.5 per cent as against a decline of 21.9 per cent in 2000-01. In absolute terms, total 
funds mobilised through 35 issues increased to Rs. 7,543 crore in 2001-02 from Rs. 6,108 crore 
through  151  issues  in  2000-01.  During  the  year,  the  primary  market  was  accessed  by  fewer 
issuers  as  compared  to  the  previous  year  but  the  funds  mobilized  were  higher  than  the  funds 
raised in the previous year. The market received a number of issues of a large size during the 
year under review than the previous year as the issues with value of more than Rs. 100 crore 
accounted for nearly 95 per cent of the total amount mobilised during the current year than that 
of 73 per cent in the previous year.  Average  size  of  issue  thus  increased  to  Rs.  216  crore  in 
2001-02 from Rs. 40 crore during the previous year due to a mega issue in the telecom sector of 
Rs. 834 crore. The banking and financial institutions mobilised Rs. 5,142 crore. The market, thus 
was dominated by issues of bigger size of banks and financial institutions accounting for 68 per 
cent of the total funds raised by all issuers as compared to a lower share of 51 per cent in 2000-
01. The pattern of fund mobilisation through primary market in the financial year 2001-02, was 
thus  distinctively  different  from  the  one  observed  in  the  year  2000-01.  There  was  a  structural 
change in the capital raised as the share of public issues declined to 86 per cent in 2001-02 from 
88 per cent in 2000-01, and share of rights issues increased from 12 per cent to 14 per cent. The 
market witnessed good response of investors subscribing more than 88 per cent of total equity 
issued on premium . The IPO market during 2001-02 was subdued as there were only 7 IPOs 
accounting only for 16 per cent of the total resources mobilised compared to 40 per cent during 
2000-01 and 35 per cent in 1999-2000.  
 
Industry-wise, telecommunication industry raised an amount of Rs. 834 crore during the current 
financial year through one issue which is lower than Rs. 922 crore that it raised during 2000-01 
through  two  issues.  There  was  no  issue  during  1998-99  by  telecommunication  industry.  The 
share of capital raised by the engineering and chemical companies increased to 10 per cent and 3 
per  cent  during  2001-02  respectively,  from  0.4  per  cent  and  0.5  per  cent  during  2000-01, 
respectively. Information and technology companies raised only Rs.39 crore through 6 issues as 
compared to Rs.804 crore through 89 issues in 2000-01. There were no issue in the  health care 
and entertainment . Thus new economy companies in 2001-02 showed slack investment growth.   
  

Public and Rights Issues  
 
Of the 35 issues which entered the market in 2001-02, 20 were public issues for mobilising an 
amount of Rs. 6,502 crore as compared to Rs. 5,378 crore in 2000-01, showing an increase of 21 
per cent as against a fall of 14 per cent in the previous year.  The rights issues, however, recorded 
better  performance  by  mobilising  Rs.  1,041  crore  during  the  current  year  under  review  as 
compared to an amount of Rs. 729 crore in the previous year, recording a growth of 43 per cent.  
In terms of percentage share public issues accounted for 86 per cent and rights issues 14 per cent.

Month-wise Trends in Capital Mobilisation 
 
Data on month-wise capital mobilisation reveal that nearly half of the capital or Rs.3,770 crore 
capital resources was raised during the fourth quarter of the year under review. During 2000-01, 
investment  activity  was  more  broad  based  throughout  the  year  except  for  the  month  of 
September 2001 and February 2002 when the amount raised were Rs.1,274 crore and Rs.1,157 
crore, respectively. (Table 2.2)

Average size of issues was higher during 2001-02 than that noticed in 2000-01. Thus, in 2001-02 
average size of issues was Rs. 215 crore whereas in the financial year 2000-01, it worked out to 
Rs. 41 crore mainly because of larger number of mega issues  in current  financial year. During 
2001-02, 51 per cent  of the total 35 issues (i.e. 18 issues) were of the size of more than Rs. 100 
crore each compared to 2000-01, when most of the issues were of the size of less than Rs. 100 
crore each.  In 2000-01, out of the 151 issues 133 issues were of the size of less than Rs. 100 
crore.

The capital raised by the listed companies recorded a sharp increase of 87 per cent in 2001-02 as 
against a decline of 34 per cent in 2000-01.  On the other hand, the capital raised through Initial 
Public Offers (IPOs) showed a substantial decline of 56 per cent in 2001-02 as compared to an 
increase of 0.1 per cent in the previous year. In absolute term during 2001-02, 7 IPO issues came 
in the market for raising Rs.1,202 crore as compared to 114 issues during 2000-01 for mobilising 
Rs.2,722 crore. The average size of IPO issues shot up to Rs.172 crore in 2001-02 due to their 
mega size, from Rs. 24 crore in 2000-01. In terms of percentage share, while IPOs contributed 
only 16 per cent during 2001-02 as compared to their share of 40 per cent during 2000-01, the 
listed companies’  share increased from 60 per cent to 84 per cent because of sharper increase in 
the amount raised by them.  Thus, the IPOs did not sustain their role of resource mobilisation 
from  the  primary  market  compared  to  the  listed  companies  recording  an  evidence  that  new 
companies did not enter the capital market to promote capital promotion and growth. (Table 2.5)

The average size of seasoned issues rose to Rs.227 crore per issue in 2001-02 from Rs.91 crore 
per  issue  in  2000-01.  On  the  other  hand  IPO’s  average  size  of  issues  increased  from Rs.24.0 
crore  to  Rs.172  crore  reflecting  that  a  more  large  size  of  issues  came  from  the  companies 
approaching the primary market for the first time particularly from Banking/FIs with a average 
size of Rs.367 crore compared to Rs.242 crore per issue in 2000-01.

Sector-wise Analysis of Capital Mobilisation 
 
As  in  the  previous  year,  the  investment  activity  in  the  primary  market  was  by  and  large 
dominated  by  the  private  sector.  The  private  sector’s  share  however,  declined  to  88  per  cent 
mobilising  Rs.6,601  crore  through  only  30  issues  in  2001-02,  declined  from  97  per  cent 
mobilising  Rs.5,893  crore  through  148  issues  during  2000-01.  Joint  sector  did  not  enter  the 
market. There were 5 issues by public sector which mobilised Rs.942 crore accounting for 13 per 
cent of the total capital raised in 2001-02 as against 3 issues with Rs.215 crore in 2000-01 (Table 
2.6).

Industry-wise Analysis of Resource Mobilisation 
 
Allocation of resources to various industries by the primary market is an important indicator of 
industrial diversification, its growth and perceptions of the entrepreneurs. A notable feature of 
resource mobilisation has been the sharp decline in case of infotech industry from Rs.804 crore 
in 2000-01 to Rs.38 crore in 2001-02,  followed  by  finance  from  Rs.440  crore  to  Rs.33  crore, 
cement  and  construction  from  Rs.82  crore  to  Rs.27  crore  and  telecom  from  Rs.922  crore  to 
Rs.834 crore. (Table 2.8) 
 
Resource raising activity shows high concentration as five industries were on top raising 97 per 
cent of the total capital raised in the financial year 2001-02. During the previous year top five 
industries  shared  94  per  cent  of  the  total  funds  mobilised.  Industry-wise  Banking  and  FIs 
substantially increased their share from 51 per cent in 2000-01 to 68 per cent in 2001-02 because 
of large mobilisation by ICICI and Industrial Development Bank of India. It would be noticed 
that during the current year under review, old economy companies entered the market in a big 
way and mobilised Rs.196 crore as compared to Rs.286 crore during the previous year.

In  2000-01,  information  technology,  entertainment  and  finance  were  among  the  top  five 
industries  on  the  basis  of  capital  raised,  alongwith  banking/FIs  and  telecommunications.  
However,  this  year  top  five  industries  in  terms  of  capital  mobilisation  are  Banking/FIs, 
telecommunication,  engineering,  chemical  and  textiles.  The  old  economy  industries  thus 
appeared to have bounced back and emerged as major funds mobiliser in 2001-02. 
    
Banks and financial Institutions entered market with 14 issues in the financial year 2001-02. Out 
of  these  14  issues  9  issues  were  launched  by  ICICI  Ltd.  These  were  basically  9  trenches  of 
umbrella issue of bonds. IDBI also made 3 trenches of bond issue in 2001-02. The other 2 issues 
were  equity  issue  to  public  by  Punjab  National  Bank  and  rights  issue  of  equity  shares  by 
Dhanalakshmi  Bank.  Details  of  these  issues  by  banks/financial  Institutions  are  given  in  Table

information technology sector.  This year number of these type of issues have come down for 
reasons already stated above.  As a result, the share of southern  
region in terms of both number of issues and funds mobilised decreased as compared to 2000-01.

B] SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET 
 
Price Behaviour in the Secondary Securities Market During 2001-02 
 
The  stocks  prices  in  the  secondary  market  remained  subdued  and  were  dominated  by  bearish 
sentiment during 2001-02. Almost all major stock market indicators like market capitalisation, 
turnover, P/E ratio showed a falling trend during 2001-02. However, the fall in major indices and 
other market indicators was substantially less than that noticed during 2000-01.  The BSE Sensex 
on a point to point basis decreased from 3604 as on March 30, 2001 to 3469 as on March 28, 
2002, a fall of 4 per cent, the S&P CNX Nifty witnessed a decline of 2 per cent from 1148 as on 
March 30, 2001 to 1129 as on March 28, 2002. On the contrary, the other indices, on a point to 
point basis namely the BSE Natex, the S&P CNX 500 and the BSE Dollex registered a rise of 2 
per cent, 3 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, during the current year under review (Table 
2.15). 
 
However, the stocks’  prices suffered several reversals during the year under review on account 
of several factors such as investor perception of slowing down of global economies combined  
with reports on the irregularities in the trading of shares on the Indian stock markets. The BSE 
Sensex had lost 177 points by March 2, 2001 and further  625 points on March 30, 2001 over the 
closing of March 1, 2001. The other indices also suffered similar losses. The bearish movement 
in stocks prices were further precipitated by stock market crash in USA following the terrorist 
attack on September 11, 2001 and massive sales of stocks by FIIs in September 2001. The BSE 

Sensex dropped to 2681 as on September 17, 2001 and further to 2600 by September 21, 2001 
from 3184 as on September 10, 2001 recording a loss of 503 points and 584 points respectively. 
The  Sensex  picked  up  slowly  and  reached  3287  by  November  21,  2001  and  to  3443  by 
December 10, 2001, before coming down sharply to 3132 by December 27, 2001 following the 
terrorist  attack  on  the  Indian  Parliament.  Despite  such  reversals,  the  stock  prices  regained 
stability  as  the  BSE  Sensex  recovered  to  3402  as  on  January  7,  2002  and  further  to  3469  by 
March 28, 2002. These trends were visible in the movement of other indices also. The S&P CNX 
Nifty  which  had  risen  to  1115  as  on  December  10,  2001  from  987  as  on  November  7,  2001 
declined  to  1020  as  on  December  27,  2001  shedding  nearly  95  points.  Thereafter  the  Nifty 
recovered to 1189 by February 27, 2002 before declining to 1130 by March 28, 2002.

Table 2.16 summarises the daily movement in BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty during 2001-02. 
Of the 247 trading days at BSE, the Sensex recorded increases on 119 trading days and declines 
on 128 trading days. For the S&P CNX Nifty, there were increases in the index on 118 trading 
days and declines on 129 trading days. However, out of 247 trading days, the Sensex showed a 
nominal  increase  for  107  days  and  decline  for  119  days  of  around  2.5  per  cent.  It  would  be 
observed that the swings in Sensex as well as Nifty for almost entire financial year were within 
the range of 2.5 per cent and less than that.

93 points or 3 per cent  during the year. The monthly movement of S&P CNX Nifty reflected a 
similar trend. It declined from an average of 1116 in April 2001 to 949 in September 2001 but 
thereafter recorded a gradual rise to register an average of 1159 by March 2002. Thus the Nifty

crore  by  December  2001  but  it  rose  back  to  Rs.  6,36,861  crore  by  March  2002.  Thus  market 
capitalization at NSE  had a decline of 3 per cent during 2001-02. On the contrary the market 
capitalization at BSE recorded a rise of  7 per cent during the same period from Rs. 5,71,553 
crore  in  March  2001  to  Rs.  6,12,224    crore  in  March  2002.  In  absolute  terms,  the  decline  in

Trends in Turnover at Major Stock Exchanges 
 
Turnover on stock exchanges reflect the transaction activity of the market players in the stocks 
market.  The turnover figures demonstrate not only change in price of shares but also variation in 
volume traded.  It is also a sign of size of market and liquidity.  The liquidity allows investors to 
alter  their  portfolios  and  cheaply  makes  investment  less  risky.    However,  the  average  daily 
turnover  at  BSE  and  NSE  which  had  markedly  declined  from  Rs.4,051  crore  and  Rs.  5,028 
respectively crore in March 2000 to Rs. 2,151 crore and Rs.2,868 crore respectively in March 
2001 declined further to Rs.1,354 crore and Rs. 2,330 crore in March 2002 . Over the period 
March 2001 to March 2002 there was a fall of  37 per cent in case of  average daily turnover at 
BSE and 19 per cent in case of NSE . (Table 2.17)  
 

Market Capitalisation of New Economy Stocks 
 
Market  capitalisation  of  new  economy  stocks  is  presented  in  Table  2.18.    The  share  of  new 
economy  companies  in  total  market  capitalisation  was  22  per  cent  in  2001-02  of  total  market 
capitalisation of BSE.  Of the total BSE market capitalisation information technology shared 16 
per cent and telecom 4 per cent, whereas media and publishing accounted for 2 per cent.  Within 
new  economy  stocks  information  technology  accounted  for  72  per  cent  of  total  market 
capitalisation  of  new  economy  stocks  followed  by  telecommunications  with  20  per  cent  and 
media  and  publishing  9  per  cent.    Though  the  overall  share  of  new  economy  stocks  as  a 
percentage of total market capitalisation at BSE did not undergo any noticeable change but the 
intra  composition  of  new  economy  underwent  some  change  .Thus  the  share  of  information 
technology in the market capitalisation of new economy stocks  declined from 74 per cent to 72 
per cent, that of media & publishing increased from 7 per cent to 9 per cent and the telecom 
sector had a marginal rise from 19.3 per cent to 19.5 per cent.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)1 
 
The  analysis  of  movement  of  share  index  can  also  be  made  on  the  basis  of  Relative  Strength 
Index  (RSI)  which  studies  the  relative  strength  of  stocks  prices  in  relation  to  their  previous 
positions.  RSI  of  Sensex  for  the  period  2001  -  02  (April-March)  mostly  hovered  within  the 
equilibrium territory of 30 to 70. The standard parameters in RSI analysis are: 
Overbought territory = above 70 
Equilibrium territory = 30 to 70 and  
Oversold territory = below 30 
 
During  the  financial  year  2001-02,  though  the  RSI  of  both  the  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty 
witnessed  northward  as  well  as  southward  movements  but  remained  inside  the  equilibrium 
territory  (range  30  –  70)  for  major  periods  of  time.  A  case  in  point  is  the  movement  of  RSI 
during  April,  May,  July,  August  and  October  2001  as  also  for  January  and  March  2002  for 
Sensex and Nifty as well. During these months RSI for both the indices regularly exhibited to

Technical Trading Systems” , Trend Research, June 1978.

and  fro  movements  mostly  forming  new  tops  and  bottoms.  Despite  such  swings  the  RSI 
remained contained within the equilibrium territory during such periods.  Extreme movements 
during the period into overbought /oversold territories have been very few. This portends well 
for the Indian markets as it possibly indicates more of secular trends ruling the market in the long 
run allaying fears of any persisting excessive volatility for long term period. (Annexure 3 & 4 )

The  frequency  distribution  of  companies  according  to  number  of  days  they  are  traded  is 
presented  in  Table  2.19.  It  would  be  observed  from  the  table  that  during  2001-02,  1,238 
companies were traded for more than 100 days and formed 23 per cent of the total number of 
traded companies whereas in 2000-01, a larger number of 1,596 companies or 41 per cent of the 
total traded companies were traded for more than 100 days. Companies traded rarely also form a 
significant number. In 2000-01, 26 per cent of the traded companies were traded for 1 to 10 days 
whereas this percentage declined slightly to 25 per cent in 2001-02. 
 
Comparative Analysis of Trading Pattern of Companies at NSE and BSE 
 
Table 2.20 presents a comparative analysis of frequency distribution of companies according to 
number of days they were traded. As such, NSE recorded a better performance in 2001-02 as 78 
per cent of companies were traded at NSE for more than 100 days compared to only 23 per cent 
at BSE.  On the other hand a large number of companies forming nearly 25 per cent were traded 
for 1 to 10 days in case of BSE and 4 per cent at NSE.  Thus NSE performance was better in 
terms of trading.

Movement in Daily Volatility 
 
Daily volatility is calculated as standard deviation of natural log of daily returns on the indices 
for  the  respective  months. Volatility  in  stock  prices  in  India  showed  by  and  large  a  declining 
trend except for certain months.  The BSE Sensex, which had a volatility of 2.4 per cent in April 
2001, witnessed an improved performance as it was only 0.9 per cent in May 2001 and further 
lower at 0.6 per cent in August 2001. However September 2001 was marked by a pronounced 
volatility  in  the  market  as  was  reflected  in  the  BSE  Sensex  measuring  at  2.8  per  cent  but  by 
March 2002 volatility receded to 1.3 per cent.   Volatility of BSE Natex, which was 2.7 per cent 
in April 2001, declined to 0.7 per cent in August 2001 but rose back to 1.1 per cent in March 
2002.  The  S&P  CNX  Nifty  demonstrated  a  volatility  of  2.2  per  cent  in  April  2001  which 
decreased to as low as 0.5 per cent by August 2001. The Nifty Junior which saw a volatility level 
of 2.6 per cent in April 2001 ended the financial year with a volatility of 1.1 per cent in March 
2002.  
 
It may be noted that during 2001-02, the Sensex daily volatility declined from 2.4 per cent in 
April 2001 to 0.7 per cent in August 2001.  The volatility, however, sharply jumped up to 2.8 per 
cent in September 2001.  This is the month when Natex also show high volatility following   the 
September  11,  2001  crash  of  the  Nasdaq  market.    The  volatility  at  BSE  Sensex,  thereafter 
declined  to  0.9  per  cent  in  January  2002  before  rising  to  1.5  per  cent  in  February  and  again 
declining  to  1.3  per  cent  in  March  2002.    The  pattern  of  movement  of  Natex  volatility  was 
similar to Sensex volatility. It showed high volatility in September 2001 at 2.9 per cent which 
declined to 1.1 per cent in month of March 2002. The indices of S&P CNX Nifty and CNX Nifty 
junior registered the same trend in their respective volatility. (Table 2.21 & 2.22)

Stock Exchange-Wise Trends in Volume of Business 
 
Total  turnover  of  business  at  23  stock  exchanges  in  2001-02  declined  significantly  to  Rs. 
8,95,725 crore as compared to Rs. 28,80,803 crore in 2000-01. The performance of various stock 
exchanges can be viewed in terms of their share in total turnover of all the stock exchanges.  The 
share of NSE showed an increase to 57.3 per cent in the current financial year as compared to 
46.5 per cent last year, while the share of BSE marginally decreased to 34.3 per cent in 2001-02 
from 34.7 per cent in 2000-01.  On the other hand, share of Calcutta Stock Exchange declined 
substantially to 3.0 per cent from 12.3 per cent and that of Delhi from 2.9 per cent to 0.7 per cent 
during the same period.  It would be observed that several stock exchanges like Bhubaneshwar, 
Jaipur, Guahati, Mangalore, Magadh, SKSE, Coimbatore did not report any turnover activity in 
2001-02 or reported very nominal turnover showing their unviability. The decline in turnover on 
several of the exchanges is having an impact on the viability of the exchanges.  (Table 2.24)

The bad deliveries in relation to net deliveries have shown a marked decline. The ratio of bad 
deliveries to net deliveries declined from 0.026 per cent in April 2001 to 0.003 in March 2002 at 
BSE. This ratio was higher in 2000-01 ranging between 0.01 and 0.11 per cent.  At NSE bad 
deliveries  sharply  declined  and  the  performance  of  the  stock  exchange  corroborated  with  the 
performance of BSE. Bad Delivery Ratio was a negligible 0.0008 per cent in April 2001 and was 
nil in March 2002.  Probably dematerialisation of trade and other binding conditions on brokers 
and investors have resulted in fall in bad deliveries.  (Table 2.26)

Liquidity Movement  
 
Liquidity is accepted as one of the conditions for smooth market functioning.  The variations in 
the  degree  of  liquidity  affects  the  price  discovery  process  and  efficiency  of  the  market.  For 
definition purposes, the liquidity of the market is the situation in which a large trade in  shares 
can be transacted without having any material impact on the price of shares.  Liquidity in the 
market has shown improvement during the recent years. The growth of the liquidity is measured 
in terms of value-traded ratio and turnover ratio. (Table 2.27). 
 
The traded value ratio indicates volume of trading in relation to the size of the economy.  On the 
other hand turnover ratio shows trading in relation to the size of the market.  It would be seen 
from the Table 2.28 that traded value ratio, which was 14.9 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 rose to 
52.7 per cent by 2001-02 in case of BSE but declined to 14.7 per cent in 2001-02.   In case of 
NSE, this ratio rose from 26.6 per cent in 1997-98 to 70.6 per cent in 2000-01 but it declined to 
24.6 per cent in 2001-02. The turnover ratio at BSE rose from 37.0 per cent in 1997-98 to 50.1 
per cent in 2001-02.  Similarly the turnover ratio at NSE rose from 76.8 per cent in 1997-98 to 
80.5 per cent in 2001-02.  Both the ratios reflect improvement in the liquidity in the market.  The 
performance  of  the  market  can  also  be  seen  in  terms  of  market  cap-GDP  ratio  or  market 
capitalisation ratio.  The market capitalisation ratio indicates the size of the market. At BSE the 
market capitalisation which was 40.3 per cent in 1997-98 moved upto nearly 52 per cent in 1999-
2000 but fell to 29.4 per cent by 2001-02. The market capitalisation to GDP ratio at NSE also 
moved in a similar pattern rising from 34.6 per cent in 1997-98 to 58.1 per cent in 1999-2000 
and thereafter, decelerated to 30.6 per cent in 2001-02.

Performance of Dematerialisation  
 
Dematerialisation  of  shares  has  been  becoming  popular  with  the  investors  as  well  as  the 
companies as technological progress has become a part of stocks market in India. Based on the 
recommendation of SEBI’s Working Group on dematerialisation, all the listed scrips have been 
put in the list for compulsory settlement of trades in dematerialised form for all investors. Total 
no of companies connected with NSDL and CDSL are 4172 and 4284 respectively as at the end 
of the financial year under review.  
 
According to information furnished by the NSDL and CDSL number of dematerialised securities 
(equity shares and debt securities) increased from 15,500 million as on end March 2000 to 39000 
million as on end March 2001 and further to 56480 million as on end March 2002. The increase 
in number of dematerialised scrips reflects fast pace in institutionalisation of paperless trading in 
equities. Depository participants of NSDL and CDSL also increased from 300 as on end March 
2001 to 377 as on end March 2002. The value of dematerialised securities increased from Rs. 
4,35,000 crore as on March 31, 2001 to Rs. 4,66,916 crore at the end of March 2002. There has 
been  an  increase  in  the  beneficiary  accounts  opened  with  the  depository  participants  from 
34,97,279 as on March 31, 2001 to 38,46,711 as on March 31, 2002.  
 
The volume of dematerialised securities constitutes around 99.7 percent of the total delivery of 
securities at the NSE and BSE together. 10 Stock Exchanges viz. NSE, BSE, CSE, DSE, MSE, 
OTCEI, BgSE, LSE, ICSI and ASE have established connectivity with both the depositories for 
settlement and clearing of dematerialised trading.

P/E Ratio and Correlation Analysis 
 
The prevalent decline in the international stock indices was reflected in the downward slide in 
P/E  ratios  of  many  foreign  indices  with  the  exception  of  Dow  Jones  of  USA,  the  Korean 
Composite, the Malaysian KLC Index, Singapore Straits and the BSE Sensex. The P/E ratios as 
at end-March 2002 when compared to that of end March 2001 reveal that the Shanghai A Share 
Index declined from 55.1 as at end Mar 2001 to 36.6 as end Mar 2002 followed by the  Nikkei 
Index with corresponding figures of 50.2 to 42.0 . At the bottom the Thai Stock Index had a P/E 
ratio of 12.9 as at end March 2001 which slid to 9.5 as at end March 2002. In terms of positive 
trend in movement of P/E ratios, the P/E ratio of Dow Jones increased from 19.7 to 29.9 that of 
South Korean Composite increased from 8.6  to 15.4, the KLC index from 18.2 to 20.8, and the 
P/E ratio of Singapore Times Index increased from 14.2 to 22.9 between March 2001 and March 
2002. The BSE Sensex, however, fared better than many other countries in terms of stability as 
the P/E ratio of the index underwent a nominal rise of 1.4 per cent between March 2001 and 
March  2002  whereas  the  S&P  CNX  Nifty  had  an  increase  of  18.0  per  cent  during  the  same 
period. (Table 2.29)

Table  2.30  provides  co-efficient  of  correlation  between  Indian  indices  and  Dow  Jones  and  
NASDAQ indices.  The BSE Sensex and Dow Jones indices demonstrated high correlation during 
the few months in 2001-02.  The correlation co-efficient was as high as 0.50 in September 2001 
followed by a co-efficient of 0.29 in May 2001.  The correlation co-efficient in other months was 
also  positive  and  high  during  the  months  of  July  2001  and  January  2002.    The  correlation  was 
negative only in June 2001. The correlation between the Sensex and NASDAQ was positive during 

10  months  in  2001-02. However, co-efficient  of  correlation  was  of  higher  value  in  case  of  S&P 
CNX Nifty and Dow Jones.  The relationship between the Indian and US stocks  prices was strongly 
reflected  following  the  terrorist  attack  on  the  USA  on  September  11,  2001  squeezing  the  stocks 
indices in USA as well as at home.

Derivatives Trading 
 
Trading  in  Derivative  Contracts  commenced  in  June  2000  with  the  launch  of  index  futures 
contract  on  BSE-30  Sensex  and  S&P  CNX  Nifty  in  the  Derivative  Segment  of  the  Stock 
Exchange,  Mumbai  (BSE)  and  the  Futures  &  Options  (F&O)  Segment  of  the  National  Stock 
Exchange of India Ltd (NSE). 
 
The  year  2001-02  recorded  a  healthy  growth  of  the  derivative  markets  both  in  term  of  the 
derivative  contracts  available  for  trading  and  in  term  of  volumes  of  contracts  traded  on  the 
Derivative Segment of BSE and the F&O Segment of NSE.

In June 2001, Option contracts on BSE-30 Sensex were launched on the Derivative Segment of 
BSE and Options on S&P CNX Nifty Index were launched on the F&O Segment of NSE. The 
Index Option Contracts are premium settled European style option. 
 
SEBI also permitted trading in premium settled American style Stock Option Contracts in June 
2001. The stock option contracts permitted are cash settled. At the time of specifying the risk 
containment measures, the SEBI prescribed the eligibility criteria of stock also on which option 
contacts  could  be  permitted.  The  eligibility  criteria  is  based  on  the  turnover,  market 
capitalisation, minimum non-promoter holding and volatility of the stock vis-à-vis the index. The 
eligibility criteria were specified to ensure the safety and integrity of the derivative market. At 
that time 31 stocks were found to meet the eligibility criteria. The trading in Stock Options of 
these 31 stocks started on the Derivative Segment of BSE and the F&O Segment of NSE in July 
2001.  
 
In  August  2001,  the  SEBI  constituted  an  Advisory  Committee  on  Derivatives.  Based  on  the 
recommendation  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Derivatives,  in  November  2001,  the  SEBI 
permitted Single Stock Futures on the stocks in which stock option contracts were permitted (the 
stocks  mentioned  at  Table-2.34). The Single Stock Future Contracts are cash settled contracts 
and  were  launched  on  the  derivative  Segment  of  BSE  and  the  F&O  Segment  of  NSE  in 
November 2001.

The Members in NSE more than double those in BSE in all Categories. While both in BSE and 
in NSE the number of Trading Members far exceeds that of Other Categories.  
 
Other Issues 
 
In the year 2001-02, SEBI also specified the criteria for adjustment of contracts at the time of 
corporate actions like, rights, bonus, stock-split, consolidation etc. At the same time a sub-group 
was also formed which would advice the exchanges on the adjustments required at the time of 
corporate  actions  like,  mergers,  extraordinary  dividends  etc.,  in  line  with  international  best 
practices. 
 
SEBI had permitted Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) to trade in the Derivative Contracts. 
RBI granted approval to FIIs in June 2000 to trade only in Index Futures Contracts on the BSE & 
NSE.  RBI  had  also  mandated  that  the  exposure  of  FIIs  in  derivatives  could  not  exceed  their 
exposure in the Equity Market. In February 2002, RBI permitted FIIs to trade in all exchange 
traded  derivative  contracts  subject  to  position  limits  prescribed  for  FII  and  sub-accounts.  The 
position  limits  of  FIIs  and  their  sub-account’s  are  monitored  by  the  Exchanges  in  the  manner 
specified by SEBI.         
 
Developments in Government Debt Market 
 
Activity in the wholesale debt market  
 
The Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) in the government securities recorded a significant growth 
in 2001-02.  The value of net trade during 2001-02 increased to Rs.9,47,191 crore as compared 
to Rs.4,28,582 crore in 2000-01 showing a rise of 121 per cent.  The trade in WDM segment 
shows  large  variations  from  month  to  month  position.    It  ranged  between  Rs.46,285  crore  in 
April  to  Rs.1,11,736  crore  in  January  during  the  year  2001-02.  During  2000-01  also  the 
variations were of similar magnitude.  With regard to average net traded value of debt, it stood at 
Rs.3,277 crore during 2001-02 rising from Rs.1,483 crore during the previous year.  The average

The distribution of trades according to participants is furnished in Table 2.37 below.  It would be 
observed that the Indian banks’  share marginally increased in 2001-02 ranging between 31.7 per 
cent and 41.6 per cent as compared to 25 per cent and 38 per cent in 2000-01. On the other hand 
foreign banks’  share decreased to the range of 10.5 per cent and 16.2 per cent from 13 per cent 
and 24 per cent implying that foreign banks have not participated in a big way during the current 
financial year.  The trading members have substantially increased their share to the range of 18.8 
per cent and 27 per cent from the range of 20 per cent and 25 per cent particularly in the later 
half of the current financial year. Thus, government securities market was dominated by Indian 
banks, trading members and primary dealers.

C]  MUTUAL  FUNDS 
 
Resources Mobilised by Mutual Funds 
 
During 2001-02, the mutual funds mobilised a gross amount of Rs.1,64,523 crore    (US $ 33.75 
billion) compared to an amount of Rs. 92,957 crore  (US $ 20.21 billion) during the previous 
year 2000-01 recording a sharp growth of about 77 per cent over the previous year. 
 
After adjustment of repurchases and redemptions, there was net inflow of funds of        Rs. 7,175 
crore (US $ 1.47 billion) as compared to a net inflow of Rs.9,128.1 crore (US $ 1.99 billion) 
during the previous year 2000-01.  
 
Net inflow of funds in the mutual funds industry amounted to Rs.12,724.5 crore during the first 
11  months  of  the  year  i.e  during  April  2001  to  February  2002.  However,  there  were  heavy 
repurchases/redemptions in the last month of the year (i.e. March) and as a result net inflow of 
funds during the entire year 2001-02 declined to Rs.7,175.2 crore. The major outflow of funds in 
March was in debt-oriented schemes and mainly in liquid/money market schemes.  
 

Sector-wise analysis of data shows that private sector mutual funds mobilised a  net amount of 
Rs.13,050 crore in 2001-02 as compared to net inflow of Rs.9,849.6 crore during the previous 
year 2000-01.  UTI  has  shown  a  large  outflow  of  funds  of  Rs.7,284  crore  during  the  financial 
year 2001-02 as against net inflow of Rs.323 crore during  2000-01 and net inflow of Rs.4,548 
crore during the year 1999-2000. Other public sector mutual funds showed net inflow to the tune 
of Rs.1,409.3 crore during 2001-02 as against an  outflow of Rs.745 crore and Rs.1,045 crore 
during 1999-2000 and 2000-01, respectively.  (Table 2.38)

Scheme-wise analysis of data shows that during the financial year 2001-02, there was net inflow 
of  funds  only  in  the  income/debt  oriented  schemes  whereas  the  balanced  schemes  and 
growth/equity oriented schemes faced outflow of funds (Table 2.40).

The following observations are made from the Tables 2.42-c, 2.42-d & 2.42-e :- 
 
?  Out of a total of 3.08 crore investors in the mutual funds industry, 2.44 crore or 79.15 per 
cent  of  the  total  investors  are  in  UTI.  The  percentage  of  total  investors  in  private  sector 
mutual funds is 13.50 per cent (0.41 crore) and public sector mutual funds is 7.35 per cent 
(0.23 crore).

?  The same trend has been observed in case of individual investors also. Out of a total of 3.02 
crore investors under the category of ‘individuals’, the total number of individual investors is 
the largest in UTI with 79.43 per cent, followed by private sector mutual funds with  13.23 
per cent and public sector mutual funds with 7.34 per cent. Thus it is observed that UTI has 
the largest number of small individual investors who contribute 72.61 per cent to UTI’s total 
net  assets.  However  in  case  of  private  and  public  sector  mutual  funds  the  corporates  and 
institutions are the largest contributors to the net assets to the tune of  61.80 per cent and 
57.59 per cent respectively. 

 
 

Offer Documents Received from Mutual Funds and Cleared by SEBI 
 
During  the  year  2001-02,  SEBI  received  64  offer  documents  as  against  75  offer  documents 
received during the previous year 2000-01. The decline in number of offer documents might be 
due  to  the  reason  that  most  of  the  mutual  funds  have  already  launched  various  open-ended 
schemes for different investment objectives.   
 
SEBI  cleared  66  offer  documents  (including  4  offer  documents  filed  for  conversion  of  close 
ended schemes into open ended schemes) during the year in comparison to 59 offer documents 
(including  6  offer  documents  for  conversion  into  open-ended  schemes)  cleared  during  the  last 
year.  The  66  offer  documents  which  were  cleared  during  the  year  also  included  some  offer 
documents which were filed during the last financial year by the mutual funds. The observations 
were communicated in case of all offer documents in 21 working days in accordance with the 
Regulations.  
 
Features of Offer Documents Received 
 
The following trend has been observed in case of 64 new offer documents received by SEBI for 
launching new schemes by the mutual funds during the year 2001-02: 
 
?  46 offer documents have been received for launching debt-oriented / income schemes, out of 

include sector specific schemes and tax saving schemes. 

?  3 offer documents are for balanced schemes investing in equities as well as debt securities.   
? 
 2 offer documents have been received for conversion of old close-ended schemes into open-
ended schemes.  

                       
Schemes Launched  
 
49 new schemes were launched during the year besides, 5 schemes which were converted from 
close to open-ended schemes have been launched during the year. There has been an increase in 
the number of new schemes launched during the year. During the last year 2000-01, only 29 new 
schemes were launched and 4 schemes were converted from close ended schemes to open ended 
schemes.  
 
Assured Return Schemes of Mutual Funds 
 
Some of the schemes which assured returns in the offer documents faced difficulties in meeting 
the  assurances.  SEBI  in  pursuing  its  objective  to  protect  the  interest  of  investors  has  been 
directing the AMCs/Sponsors to honour their commitments of paying assured returns.

During the year 2001-02, the sponsors/AMC have contributed Rs.21.18 crore in case of MMIS 
89 Scheme and Rs.0.03 crore in case of MMIS 98(I) Scheme of SBI Mutual Fund and Rs.0.41 
crore in case of Dhanavarsha (8) and Rs. 0.30 crore in case of Dhanavarsha (10) scheme of LIC 
Mutual Fund towards the assured returns.  In case of UTI, UTI utilised the Development Reserve 
Fund (DRF) to the tune of Rs.25.50 crore to meet its commitment in the MIP 96 (III) Scheme. 
 
According to available information, the sponsors and asset management companies of 8  mutual 
funds excluding UTI,  have contributed a total amount of Rs. 2,430.37 crore to meet the shortfall 
in  case  of  26  schemes  as  on  March  31,  2002.  It  may  be  mentioned  here  that  most  of  these 
schemes were launched even before the enactment of SEBI Act 1992.  
 
The  details  of  these  schemes,  contributions/commitments  made  by  the  asset  management 
companies or the sponsors are given in Table 2.43.

It  can  be  observed  that  during  the  last  decade  there  has  been  a  gradual  increase  in  the  FII 
investment.  This  reflects  an  increase  in  the  in  the  level  of  confidence  of  the  FIIs  and  also  a 
vindication of the reforms process carried out by SEBI to make the Indian capital markets more 
efficient, transparent and investor friendly.  The trend of FII investment is shown in Table 2.44.

Net FIIs investment was positive almost for all the months during 2001-02 except the month of 
September 2001 when net investment was negative at US $ 113 million on account of sudden 
increase in sales which exceeded purchases by about 16 per cent following the terrorist attacks 
on the USA.  However, there has been a gradual increase in the FIIs investment in the country 
reflecting continued confidence of the FIIs in the Indian securities market . In Rupee terms, the 
net investment for 2001-02 was lower at Rs. 8,755 crore as compared to the net investment of 
Rs. 9,934 crore in 2000-01. The monthly investment figures are given below in Table 2.45.

As  can  be  seen  from  the  above  table  that  FIIs  were  net  sellers  only  during  the  month  of 
September  2001.  This  might  have  been  a  reaction  to  the  attack  on  World  Trade  Centre,  New 
York.  This  negative  trend  reversed  in  the  next  month  and  the  FIIs  were  net  purchasers  in  the 
Indian markets.  
   
Another  development  in  the  transactions  of  FIIs  was  that  their  total  turnover  declined  during 
2001-02. Their gross purchase and sales at Rs. 49,220 crore and Rs. 41,165 crore respectively 
suffered a decline of 32.6 per cent and 35.8 per cent respectively.  
 
Monthly net investment vis-à-vis corresponding gross purchases and sales figures since January

E] SUBSTANTIAL  ACQUISITION OF SHARES AND TAKE-OVERS 
 
During the year 2001-02, 81 letters of offer for making open offers were filed with SEBI. Under 
the SEBI (Substantial acquisition of shares and Takeovers), Regulations, 1997, a category of non 
applicability  of  open  offer  obligations  was  introduced  to  automatically  exempt  certain 
transactions  from  open  offer  which  may  become  necessary  in  the  overall  commercial  and 
business interest of the company. During the year, 275 reports were filed under this category. 
The transactions, which are not covered under the said category, are required to be submitted to 
the Takeover Panel for exemption from open offer.  During the year, 28 such applications were 
submitted out of which exemption from making open offer was granted in respect of 16 cases.

F] INVESTIGATION, ENFORCEMENT AND SURVEILLANCE(IES) 
 
Market Surveillance 
 
Market  Surveillance  plays  a  key  role  in  ensuring  stability  and  integrity  of  the  markets.  The 
Market Surveillance Division of SEBI keeps a proactive oversight on the surveillance activities 
of the stock exchanges.  
 
SEBI’s market surveillance essentially focuses on: 
?  policy formulation for introduction of surveillance systems at the stock exchanges to bring 

integrity and stability in the Indian securities markets; 

?  overseeing  the  surveillance  activities  of  the  stock  exchanges  including  the  monitoring  of 

market movements by them; 
inspection of such surveillance functioning of the stock exchanges; and 

? 
?  preparation of reports and studies on market movements, which SEBI circulates, periodically to 

the Government of India and to securities markets regulators from other countries. 

 
The primary responsibility of market surveillance has been entrusted to the stock exchanges. The 
SEBI keeps an oversight on market monitoring by exchanges and in exceptional circumstances it 
analyses the same. When appropriate, on the basis of reports received from the stock exchanges 
or  specific  complaints,  preliminary  enquiries  are  conducted  to  determine  whether  the  trading 
raises  suspicion  of  market  manipulation  and/or  insider  dealing.  At  times,  on  exception  basis 
only, cases are taken up suo-moto also. In case an analysis of the trading information leads to a 
suspicion of market abuse, like occurrence of market manipulation or insider dealing or other 
misconduct, investigations are initiated. 
 
The Market Surveillance systems are developed and consolidated on a continuous basis.  Some 
of the surveillance systems that have been put in place are briefly given below: 
 
?  Reporting by stock exchanges through periodic and event driven reports; 
?  Establishment of independent surveillance cells in stock exchanges; 
? 
? 

Inspection of surveillance functioning of stock exchanges;  
Imposition of trading restrictions including suspension of trading in scrips by exchanges to 
prevent market manipulation; 

?  Formation  of  Inter-Exchange  Market  Surveillance  Group  for  interactive  and  effective 

decision making on surveillance issues and co-ordination between stock exchanges; 
Implementation  of  On-line  automated  surveillance  system  (Stock  Watch  System)  at  stock 
exchanges. 

?  Development  of  database  on  violations,  contraventions  and  cases  of  non-compliance  by 

? 

members and companies for internal use in surveillance and monitoring. 

?  Designation of senior official for co-ordination and information sharing with other exchanges 

over surveillance related issues. 

?  Development of an enforcement manual and improvement in the process and documentation 

of surveillance and investigation activity. 

Mechanism for a Fair and Transparent Securities Market  
 

In order to make the securities markets fair and transparent and for enhanced investor protection, 
the SEBI had taken further initiatives in the year, as given below: 
 
Strengthening of insider trading regulations 
 
While insider-trading regulations were framed in 1992, it was felt that there was no framework for 
prevention of insider trading. A group was set up under the Chairmanship of Shri Kumar Mangalam 
Birla, member, SEBI, to suggest measures to be taken for strengthening of the regulations as well as 
requirements of procedures, code of conduct and reporting for entities in  the capital market which 
may have access to non-public information.  
 
The Insider Trading (Amendment) Regulations were notified on February 20, 2002. The following 
changes have been made through these amendment regulations for enhancing market transparency 
and for strengthening the insider trading regulations:  
  
1.  Strengthening Existing Provisions 
 
Several  existing  provisions  were  amended  to  strengthen  the  regulations.  These  amendments 
include  changes  in  the  definition  of  connected  person,  broadening  the  meaning  of  dealing  in 
securities, redefining the term 'deemed to be connected', reframing the term 'unpublished price 
sensitive information’, and amendments to the procedure of investigations, in addition to other 
amendments. 
 
2.  Incorporation  of  disclosure  requirements  by  insiders  such  as  directors  and  large 

shareholders 

 
A new regulation has been included providing for initial and continual disclosure of shareholding 
by directors or officers and substantial shareholders (holding more than 5 per cent shares/ voting 
rights) of listed companies. These disclosures are to be made to the companies, which have to 
inform  the  stock  exchanges  within  the  prescribed  time  period.  This  requirement  will  further 
enhance transparency in the market. 
 
3.    Creation  of  preventive  framework  consisting  of  code  of  conduct  for  listed  companies  and 
other entities associated with securities markets 
 
To create a preventive framework to curb insider trading, all listed companies and other entities 
associated with securities market are now required to adopt a code of conduct on the lines of the 
model code specified in the regulations. The codes of conduct cover the following aspects: 
 
?  Maintaining confidentiality of “Unpublished Price Sensitive Information” 
?  Trading restrictions such as Trading windows, restricted lists of securities and Pre clearance 

of trades 
Internal reporting Requirements for transactions in securities  

? 
?  Provisions for internal enforcement and penalty to be imposed by companies/ other entities 

for contravention of code of conduct  

 

4. Creation of a code of corporate disclosure practices for listed companies 
 
Listed  companies  are  now  required  to  adopt  a  code  for  corporate  disclosure  to  improve 
transparency in the market and fairness in the dissemination of information by corporates to the 
market. This code covers the areas of : 
 
?  Prompt disclosure of price sensitive information by listed companies 
?  Responding to market rumours 
?  Timely Reporting of shareholdings/ ownership and changes in ownership 
?  Disclosure of Information with special reference to Analysts, Institutional Investors 
?  Dissemination of information by companies including through company websites.

It  is  necessary  to  have  a  proper  method  for  dissemination  of  price  sensitive  and  other  important 
information  relating  to  companies  and  market  to  the  public  so  that  they  can  make  informed 
investment decisions. The stock exchanges have been advised to display such information on their 
terminals in the quickest possible manner. 

Dealing with market rumours     
Market  rumours  can  do  considerable  damage  to  the  normal  functioning  and  behaviour  of  the 
securities  market.  It  is,  therefore,  essential  to  have  quick  verification  of  such  rumours  from  the 
corporates as well as from other entities whenever necessary. Companies are required to designate 
compliance  officers  who  can  be  contacted  by  the  stock  exchanges  whenever  such  verification  is 
needed.  Exchanges  are  required  to  take  up  quick  verification  of  rumours  and  ensure  proper 
dissemination  of  the  relevant  information.  Exchanges  routinely  scan  newspapers  to  verify 
unconfirmed news reports and disseminate information to the market. In addition, exchanges have 
also been advised to verify rumours pertaining to specific market entities. 
 
Co-ordination and sharing of information 
Information sharing between exchanges is crucial in light of multiple listings and memberships, 
and also in the context of derivatives trading. After discussion on this issue with exchanges, it 
was decided that exchanges would designate a senior level official handling surveillance function 
to co-ordinate with other exchanges on surveillance matters. Major exchanges have instituted co-
ordination in crucial areas related to market functioning, and also meet periodically to discuss 
relevant issues.  
 

Greater responsibility and accountability of the surveillance cells of the stock exchanges 
 
The  SEBI  has  initiated  several  steps  in  order  to  bring  about  greater  responsibility  and 
accountability in discharging the surveillance functions by stock exchanges. 
 
Reporting by stock exchanges  
 
For overseeing and supervising of the surveillance activity at stock exchanges, the SEBI receives 
both periodic as well as event driven reports from exchanges.  
 
The  periodic  reports  comprise  of  weekly  reports  which  include  details  about  overall  trading 
statistics, member deactivations, scrip suspension, instances of rumor verifications, working of 
stock watch system and reporting on exception basis, any happenings, trends, events, specific 
actions/  decisions  which  have  bearing  on  safety  and  integrity  of  market.  The  monthly  report 
gives  details  about  analysis/investigations  taken  up  by  the  exchanges  following  investor 
complaints  forwarded  by  SEBI  or  otherwise,  outcome  of  the  same  and  actions  taken  by  the 
exchange  against  members/  issuers,  and  reporting  on  exception  basis,  any  happenings,  trends, 
events, specific actions/ decisions which have bearing on safety and integrity of market. 
 
Documentation 
Surveillance  cells  of  stock  exchanges  have  been  advised  to  devise  an  internal  system  of 
documentation of their surveillance activities, identification of scrips for further analysis, taking 
up cases for investigation, as well as investigation reports, and follow-up actions. 
 
Surveillance staff strength at exchanges 
To  improve  the  functioning  of  the  surveillance  cells  of  stock  exchanges,  it  was  decided  that 
exchanges  will  take  steps  to  assess  manpower  requirements  and  deploy  adequate  staff  for 
surveillance  and  monitoring.  Exchanges  are  also  required  to  provide  appropriate  training  and 
certification to surveillance staff and facilitate process of certification. 
 
Development of the stock exchanges as Self-Regulatory Organisations  
The  securities  market  has  a  layered  structure  for  its  regulation.  Under  the  Securities  Contract 
Regulation Act (SCR) Act, 1956, the stock exchanges are the hands-on operating and regulating 
agencies for this market. They also regulate the brokers. Stock exchanges organise, monitor and 
regulate trading in securities and other related affairs. For performing all these operations, Stock 
Exchanges exercise various controls and powers, conferred in them by the SCRA and their Bye 
Laws and Rules, including the following: 
 
a. 

b. 

Monitor market trading activity including price and volume movements, trading data and 
broker positions.  
Putting  restrictions  on  trading  in  the  cases  of  specific  scrips  as  warranted  by 
circumstances such as 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 

putting trading on spot basis 
imposing higher margins 
suspension of trading  
de-listing of scrips, etc.  

Analysis and investigation into abnormal trading activity 
Taking action  against members including  
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
v. 

imposing fines / penalties 
de-activation of terminals 
suspension of trading 
expulsion from exchange 
declaring a member defaulter, etc. 

c. 
d. 

 
Thus, the exchanges are the first level regulators and the primary responsibility of monitoring 
and surveillance of market activity lies with them. Over the years, the SEBI has taken a number 
of steps to strengthen the role of exchanges as effective self-regulatory organisations. 
 
Setting  up  of  independent  surveillance  cells  directly  reporting  to  the  exchange  executive 
directors,  development  of  exchange  level  surveillance  capabilities  like  stock  watch  system, 
provision  of  staff  exclusively  for  surveillance  function,  development  of  examination/ 
investigation skills at exchanges through training programs etc. are further initiatives taken by 
the SEBI in this direction. 
 
For  performing  self-regulatory  functions  of  monitoring  and  surveillance  of  market  activity, 
exchanges  have  the  necessary  tools  and  systems.  The  exchanges  have  direct  and  immediate 
access to the trading data such as trade logs, order logs, broker positions, and also client details 
after  client  codes  were  made  mandatory.  Through  the  measures  listed  above,  SEBI  has 
endeavored  to  ensure  that  exchanges  are  equipped  both  technically  and  in  terms  of  skilled 
manpower to conduct monitoring and analysis of the same. 
 
On  the  basis  of  surveillance  and  examination  conducted  by  them,  exchanges  take  up 
investigations. Enforcement actions such  as  levy  of  fines/  penalties/  suspension  of  trading  etc. 
are initiated by exchanges on the basis of such investigations. In appropriate cases, exchanges 
make reference to SEBI for further investigations by SEBI. In the year 2001-02, among the total 
number  of  investigation  cases  undertaken  by  SEBI,  42  cases  were  of  the  nature  of  further 
investigations taken up by SEBI on reference from exchanges. Major exchanges conducted suo-
moto investigations in more than 203 other cases. As part of its oversight of surveillance activity, 
SEBI also takes up cases for investigations, but this is done on exception basis only. In the year 
2001-02,  in  42  cases,  exchanges  were  asked  by  SEBI,  on  the  basis  of  complaints/  references 
received, to conduct investigations/ send details to SEBI. In some of these cases, exchanges had 
already initiated investigations on their own. 
 

Stock Watch System – an On-line Automated Surveillance System 
 
The SEBI had asked the exchanges to develop and implement an online market monitoring and 
surveillance system on the basis of basic parameters specified by SEBI.  Major exchanges have 
implemented the real time alert generation systems at a basic level. However, as the hardware 
and  software  is  vendor  supplied  and  is  different  in  different  exchanges,  the  implementation 
differs  from  exchange  to  exchange.  Benchmarking  of  parameters,  prioritisation  of  alerts  and 
connectivity with various databases are also being implemented. In the case of some exchanges, 
some  of  the  alerts  have  not  been  activated  due  to  improper  benchmarking.  Population  of  the 
databases has been done partially, because of non-availability of information in electronic form, 
since this information is getting filed with the exchanges in paper form.  Some other constraints/ 
limitations faced by exchanges in implementation of the system are as follows: 
 
?  Limitation of hardware to handle increasing volumes 
?  Software bugs 
?  Benchmarking of parameters for the alerts to be thrown up by the system 
? 
 
Investigations by exchanges 
Based on their on-line and off-line surveillance activity, exchanges conduct investigations into 
trading  activity  in  scrips.  SEBI  has  endeavoured  to  improve  the  quality  of  investigations 
conducted  by  exchanges  through  the  inspections  of  exchange  surveillance  functioning  and 
through  informal  feedback  to  exchanges.  Exchanges  are  also  advised  to  take  action  based  on 
their own bye-laws, rules and regulations in the cases investigated by them.The SEBI has also 
advised exchanges to take up more investigations related to merger/takeover announcements and 
place more emphasis on identifying insider trading cases by examining trading activity around 
the time of major announcements by corporates. 
 
Inspection of surveillance cells of stock exchanges 
During 2001-02, SEBI inspected functioning of surveillance cells of 7 stock exchanges. The areas 
examined during these inspections include : 
?  Functioning of surveillance cell of the exchange with respect to detection of price volume 

Introduction of trading in new segments/ markets 

aberrations and abnormal market movements 

?  Functioning of stockwatch system for detection of price volume aberrations 
?  Market monitoring for identifying market abuse such as price rigging, insider trading etc. 
?  Procedure for taking up investigations by exchanges 
?  Procedure for conducting investigations 
?  Status of investigations 
?  Rumour verification by exchanges 
? 
 
Investigations 
 
Investigations are carried out with a view to gather evidence of alleged violations of securities 
market  such  as  price  rigging,  creation  of  artificial  market,  insider  trading,  public  issue  related 
irregularities  and  other  misconduct,  as  well  as  to  find  out      persons/entities  behind  these 

Imposition of special margins on scrips 

irregularities and violations. The SEBI has been strengthening its investigation activities over the 
years and these activities were further strengthened during 2001-02.  
 
Pursuant  to  completion  of  investigation,  various  actions  like  administrative  directions  and  penal 
actions  under  the  SEBI  Act,  1992and  the  various  SEBI  rules  and  regulations  were  undertaken. 
These  actions  include  monetary  penalties,  warning,  suspension  of  activities,  cancellation  of 
registration, refund of issue proceeds, prohibition of dealing in securities and access to the capital 
market etc. 
  
Investigation proceedings 
 
During 2001-02, investigations were taken up in several cases alleging market manipulations and 
price  rigging,  issue  related  manipulations,  insider  trading  and  non-compliance  of  regulations  of 
mutual funds and take-over of companies. The details of these are given in Table 2.47 and Graph

Summary of representative investigation cases 
 
During 2001-02, 111 cases were taken up for investigation.  These cases pertained to allegations 
of  market  manipulations  and  price  rigging,  issues  related  manipulations,  insider  trading,  non-
compliance with Takeover Regulations, mis-statement in the prospectus, etc.  Out of these 111 
cases, investigations were taken up in 86 cases of alleged market manipulation and price rigging, 
1  case  of  issue  related  manipulations,  16  fresh  cases  of  alleged  insider  trading,  etc.    Such 
investigations  coupled  with  effective  market  surveillance  under  the  oversight  of  SEBI  have 
resulted in significant reduction in cases of market manipulation and price rigging.  
 
During 2001-02, investigations in 11 cases of market manipulation and price rigging, 6 cases of 
insider  trading,  1  case  of  takeover  code  violations  were  completed.    The  investigations  into 
market manipulation cases have brought out that certain persons / entities created artificial market 
and manipulated the prices of certain scrips. 
 
Prosecutions 
 
SEBI  initiated  prosecution  proceedings  in  109  cases  in  2001-02 bringing the total prosecution 
proceedings initiated so far to 192 in the last six years. Out of these, 51 prosecution proceedings 
were  initiated  under  the  powers  delegated  to  SEBI  under  the  Companies  Act.    Likewise,  9 
prosecution  proceedings  were  initiated  for  violations  of  the  SEBI  (Substantial  Acquisitions  of 
Shares and Take-overs) Regulations, 1997. Similarly, 12 prosecution proceedings were initiated 
for violations of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to the 
securities market) Regulations, 1995, 2 for violations of the SEBI (Insider Trading) Regulations, 
1992  and  other  13  were  initiated  for  non-cooperation  during  the  investigation  proceedings.  In

in 20 cases in the financial year 2000-2001, which involved 98 persons. This increased to 109 
cases in the year 2001-02 cases involving 604 persons. The aggregate number of persons against 
whom prosecution proceedings had been initiated by SEBI till the end of 2000-2001 was 555.  
This  number  increased  to  604  solely  for  the  year  2001-02  thereby  bringing  the  total  to  1159 
persons. The breakup of the cases and the number of persons involved are given in Table 2.54.

Important Pronouncements Relating to Securities Laws 
 
High Court Cases 
 
Anand Rathi vs. SEBI – Bombay High Court 
 
In the wake of the fall of the market, preliminary inquiry that was conducted by SEBI, revealed, 
prima  facie,  involvement  in  market  manipulations  by  Shri  Rathi  and  his  concerns.    And  to 
prevent  further  mischief,  an  order  was  passed  by  SEBI  restraining  Mr.Rathi  and  his  concerns 
from undertaking any fresh business as brokers under Section 11 read with  Section 11B of the 
SEBI Act,1992 till further orders.  Mr.Rathi averred in his petition filed before the Bombay High 
Court  that  the  impugned  order  was  in  violation  of  principles  of  natural  justice  and  Article 
19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.   
 
The question came up before the Hon’ble  High  Court  was “ whether SEBI had powers under 
Section 11 or 11B of the SEBI Act to pass the impugned order.  While considering the question 
as  to  whether  the  SEBI  has  authority  in  law  under  Sections  11  and  11B  to  order  interim 
suspension, the Hon’ble High Court observed that Section 11B is an enabling provision enacted 
to empower the SEBI Board to regulate securities market in order to protect the interests of the 
investors.  Such an enabling provision must be so construed as to subserve the purpose for which 

it has been enacted.  Thus, the SEBI has ample authority in law to take the action under Section 
11B  as  had  been  taken  by  it.    It  was  further  observed  by  the  Hon’ble Court that “  SEBI as a 
regulator of securities market is empowered to take all necessary measures to protect the interests 
of  the    investors  and  the  capital  market.    The  SEBI  is  fully  competent  and  is  empowered  by 
Sections 11 and 11B to pass interim order in aid of the final orders.  The SEBI is charged with 
duty to protect the public and the integrity of the capital markets and as a regulator, it is certainly 
empowered  to  order  suspension  as  an  interim  measure  pending  investigation  into  serious 
allegations of manipulations and insider trading.  Therefore, the submission that the SEBI had no 
power to pass the impugned order was overruled. 
 
While dismissing the appeal, the Hon’ble High Court observed that “  the impugned order has 
been  passed  not  by  way  of  punishment  or  penalty  but  only  by  way  of  an  interim  measure, 
pending  enquiry  into  the  manipulations.    The  pre-decisional  natural  justice  is  not  always 
necessary when ad interim orders are made pending investigation or enquiry, unless so provided 
by the statute and rules of natural justice would be satisfied if the affected party is given post-
decisional hearing.  The Court further observed that “  it is not always necessary to grant prior 
opportunity  of  hearing  when  ad  interim  orders  are  made  and  the  principles  of  natural  justice 
would  be  satisfied  if  post-decisional  hearing  is  given,  if  demanded. The High Court reiterated 
that “  natural justice cannot be imprisoned in a straight-jackets of caste-iron formula.” 
 
“  SEBI  was  justified  in  taking  action  to  curb  further  mischief  in  order  to  instill  and  maintain 
public confidence in the integrity of the capital market.”  
 
B.P. Plc vs. SEBI  -  Bombay High Court  
 
In the instant case, Burma Castrol was a subsidiary of B.P.Amocco plc. and Castrol India was a 
subsidiary  of  Burma  Castrol.    B.P.Amocco  issued  a  public  announcement  by  way  of  a  Press 
Release on  March 14, 2000 wherein it categorically stated that it had agreed to recommend a 
cash offer to buy Burma Castrol for Rs.16.25 pound for per share of Burma Castrol and the same 
had been agreed to by both the Boards of B.P.Amocco and Burma Castrol.  In the said offer, 
more than 51 per cent of shareholders of BC had indicated the offer to be unconditional.  After 
July 7, 2000, B.P.Amoco acquired control over Castrol India by the said declaration. 
 
The  issue  came  up  before  the  High  Court  was  “  whether  the  relevant  date  for  purpose  of 
acquisition  of  Castrol  India  was  March  14,  2000  or  July  7,  2000.”    The  High  Court  while 
upholding the decision of SEBI and the SAT confirmed that “  the decision to acquire control 
over the target company was very apparent and clear from the public announcement made on 
March 14, 2000 and not on July 7, 2000 as per regulation 29(2)(b) of the Takeover Code.  While 
deciding this issue, the High Court, inter alia, came up with the pronouncements such as…  a) the 
word `acquirer’  does not only mean that “  only a person who has already acquired shares but also 
who agrees to acquire not only shares but also voting rights and control of and over the target 
company.  b)  A public offer can be made by a public announcement even before obtaining the 
required  regulatory  approval.    The  appeal  of  B.P.Amoco  was  dismissed  upholding  the  order 
passed by the SEBI and the SAT. 
 
Shirish Finance & Investment (P.) Ltd. Vs.  M.Sreenivasulu Reddy - High Court of Bombay. 

 
The  question  came  up  before  Hon’ble  High  Court  was  “  whether  the  acquisition  of  shares  in 
Herbertsons Ltd. by some of the defendants was in breach of the SEBI 1994 Regulations and 
further, whether the conversion of debentures of the company into shares in favour of defendant 
no.2 was in breach of the Takeover Regulations,1994. 
 
The  Hon’ble  High  Court  observed  that  “  in  the  1997  Takeover  Code,  there  are  at  least  three 
matters in regard to which the Regulations are merely clarificatory and the declaratory.  In this 
regard, a reference may be  made to (I) definition of `acquirer’  which has been defined to mean 
any person who directly or indirectly acquires or agrees to acquire shares for voting rights in the 
target  company  or  acquires  or  agrees  to  acquire  control  over  the  target  company  either  by 
himself  or  with  any  person  acting  in  concert  with  the  acquirer;  (ii)    regulation  3(1)(k)  which 
makes  it  explicit  what  was  implicit  in  regulation  3  of  1994  Regulations  by  providing  that  the 
exemption under clause (k) ( acquisition of shares in unlisted companies ) shall not be applicable 
if, by virtue of acquisition or change of control of any unlisted company, the acquirer acquires 
shares or voting rights or control over a registered company; and (iii) regulation 10 wherein the 
addition of the words `if any’  has clarified that an acquirer need not be an existing shareholder. 
However, so far as acquisition of unlisted companies is concerned, under the 1997 Regulations, 
regulations 10 or 12 thereof will apply to the acquisition of shares in unlisted companies in the 
category  of  cases  enumerated  under  the  Explanation,  to  which  the  1994  Regulations  may  not 
have applied. 
 
In view of regulation 3(d), Chapter III of the Regulations does not apply to acquisition of shares 
in companies whose shares are not listed on any stock exchange.   
 
The Hon’ble High Court while dismissing the appeal observed that “  the object of the Takeover 
Regulations  is  to  bring  about  transparency  in  the  dealing  of  securities,  and  also  to  enable  the 
existing shareholders to take informed decision to accept or not to accept the public offer that 
may be made by a person who seeks to acquire substantial shares in the company. There is no 
rational basis for a distinction between an acquirer who is an existing shareholder, and an acquire 
who  is  not,  since  the  regulatory  measures  are  designed  primarily  to  regulate  the  substantial 
acquisition of shares by any acquirer, not necessarily a member of the company.  Therefore, the 
words ` an acquirer who holds shares’  carrying 10 per cent or less of voting rights must include 
an acquirer whose holding in a company may be nil.  Less than 10 per cent of the voting rights 
must  include  nil  shareholding  in  the  context  of  regulations  9  and  10  of  the  Regulations.    The 
acquirer not holding shares in the company will not be bound by the regulatory provisions of the 
Regulations, nor by the prohibitions and mandatory requirements thereof. 
 

K. K. Modi  vs. Securities Appellate Tribunal -  Bombay High Court 
 
The  question  that  came  up  before  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  was  whether  or  not  the  MPL  was 
acting in concert or deemed to be acting in concert with the acquirers. 
 
While overruling the view that MPL was acting in concert with the acquirer, the Hon’ble High 
Court, inter alia, observed that the co-promoter can only be held to be acting in concert with the 
acquirer only if evidence on record clearly establishes that promoter shares common objective or 
purpose of substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights for gaining control over the target 
company with the acquirer.  
 
While dismissing the instant appeal, the Hon’ble High Court observed that “  If Modipoin Ltd. is 
neither an acquirer nor a person acting or deemed to be acting in concert with the acquirer, it 
must fall in the category of other shareholders of the target company, and its shareholding must 
be treated as `public shareholding’  within the meaning of regulation 2(1)( j ).”  
 
Appeals Before SAT 
 
Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. vs. SEBI 
 
In  the  instant  case,  Sterlite  had  made  a  public  offer  for  acquisition  of  equity  of  INDAL  by 
offering a price of Rs.221/- per share against an offer for acquisition of 20 per cent equity @ 
Rs.175/- per share by Alcan.  Sterlite’s bid failed as INDAL’s shareholders preferred the Alcan’s 
bid.    During  that  time,  the  price  of  Sterlite’s  shares  rose  very  rapidly  and  abnormally  but  it 
touched  a  low  within  one  month  of  failure  of  its  bid  for  acquisition.    The  SEBI  through  its 
investigation  revealed  that  a  set  of  persons  known  as  D  Group  had  cornered  large  chunk  of 
shares of Sterlite at BSE and NSE resulting in distortion of market equilibrium and due to that 
payment crisis occurred at BSE.  One DV belonging to D Group bought 6 lakh shares of Sterlite 
at instance of BSE authorities to avert a payment crisis on the stock exchange due to failure of 
some brokers to meet their obligations.  The transactions were entered at midnight and money 
was  provided  thorugh  a  loan  from  same  associate  of  Sterlite.    Sterlite  parked  share  using  D 
Group and later bailed out brokers in event of payment crisis through a loan from its associate.  
SEBI found a nexus between D group and Sterlite and Sterlite provided a loan to ED through 
MALCO. Sterlite was held guilty of violating regulation 4(a) and 4(d) of the Takeover Code read 
with section 11(1) and 11(2)(e) of the SEBI Act.  Chairman passed order under section 4(3) read 
with section 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act prohibiting Sterlite from accessing the capital market 
for a period of two years and ordered initiation of proceedings under section 24 read with section 
27 of the SEBI Act. 
 
The question came up, inter alia, before SAT was whether the impugned order under section 11B 
of the SEBI Act was remedial, preventive or punitive.  SAT while setting aside the impugned 
order held that under section 11B, SEBI is incompetent to issue a direction which tantamounts to 
imposition of penalties.  The order under section 11B to debar Sterlite from accessing the capital 
market was a penalty and the action taken by the SEBI under section 11B was not preventive or 
remedial as contended by the SEBI but penal as it has taken away the Sterlite’s right to mobilise 
funds from the public to carry on its business.  SAT further held that in the absence of sufficient 

material  evidence  to  establish  that  the  Sterlite  had  directly  or  indirectly  indulged  in  market 
manipulation, the impugned order holding Sterlite guilty of violating regulation 4(a) and 4(d) of 
PFUTP Regulations cannot sustain. 
 
Eaton Corporation vs. Chairman,SEBI 
 
The question before SAT was whether in the instant case there was a proposal of merger.  The 
said case was covered under automatic exemption under regulation 3(1)(j)(ii) of the Takeover  
Code,1997.    The  backdrop  of  this  case  was  that  EII  merged  with  AVI  which  had  in  turn  a 
wholly-owned  subsidiary  by  the  name  `AC’  and  `AC’  had  a  fully-owned  subsidiary  by  the 
name`VI’.  `VI’  held 51 per cent in the share capital of its subsidiary VSIL.  Scheme of merger 
was as per agreement and plan of merger entered into among Eaton Corporation, EII and AVI 
and had approval of Laws of State of Ohio.  Due to the said agreement, it resulted in change of 
ownership  of  VSIL’s  ultimate  holding  company,  so  the  control  over  VSIL  had  also  changed.  
The question came up before SAT was whether Eaton Corporation having acquired control over 
VSIL was required to make a public announcement to acquire shares from shareholders of VSIL 
in terms of regulation 12. 
 
SAT,  inter  alia,  held  that  as  a  result  of  change  in  the  ownership  of  VSIL’s  ultimate  holding 
company, the control over VSIL had also changed.  Even if there was no direct acquisition of 
shares in VSIL by the appellant, in the light of the change in control of the said VSIL effected by 
way of acquisition of AVI by the Eaton as a result of the merger, it could not be said that Eaton 
had not acquired control over VSIL.  The acquisition was indirect but regulation 12, read with 
regulation 2(b) of the Takeover Code took care of direct and indirect acquisition. 
 
SAT  while  allowing  the  appeal,  inter  alia,  observed  that  “  since  the  case  is  exempted  from 
complying with the requirement of regulation 12, issuance of the impugned order asking Eaton 
Corporation  to  comply  with  the  requirement  of  regulation  12  cannot  hold  good.”    “  Once  an 
acquisition falls under any one of the automatic exemption categories provided under regulation 
3(1)(j)(ii)  of  the  Takeover  Code,  there  is  no  requirement  to  knock  off  that  exemption.”    An 
exemption provided by the law cannot be taken away simply by an administrative order.”  
 
Ch.Kiron Margadarsi Financiers vs. Adjudicating Officer,SEBI 
 
In the instant Case, the Adjudicating officer imposed penalty on the appellant for violating the 
provisions of regulation 10 of the Takeover i.e. acquisition of shares of more than 15 per cent in 
APL without making an open offer. 
 

The Tribunal while allowing the appeal observed that “  the appellant’s acquisition entitling it to 
exercise  voting  rights  was  below  10  per  cent  benchmark  provided  in  regulation  10.    Section 
15H(ii) of the SEBI Act which the Adjudicating Officer had invoked for the purpose of imposing 
penalty is applicable only if a person who is required under the Act, Rules or Regulations made 
thereunder, fails to make a public announcement to acquire shares at a minimum price.  What 
attracts the regulation is the acquisition of shares / voting rights which will entitle the person 
acquiring the shares to exercise voting rights beyond certain limits specifically provided in the 
regulation, say 10 per cent in regulation 10 of the Takeover Code.  Thus, it is clear that a plain 
acquisition even  if it exceeds 10 per cent of the paid up capital of the company will not attract 
regulation 10, unless the acquisition entitles the acquirer to exercise 10 per cent or more of the 
voting rights in the company. 
 
Rhodia S.A. vs.SEBI and 3 ors.   
 
The appellant Rhodia acquired the UK company and as a result the Indian company also became 
its subsidiary. In that context, Rhodia made an application to the SEBI seeking exemption from 
the  requirement  of  making  public  offer  to  the  shareholders  of  the  Indian  Company  under  the 
Takeover Code.  SEBI received complaints from shareholders of the Indian company alleging 
that  Rhodia  had  taken  over  the  Indian  company  without  making  the  requisite  pubilc  offer.  
However, Rhodia was directed to make a public offer to the shareholders of A&W India by SEBI 
order.

result not in a position to tender shares in a public offer which was required to be made by June 
14, 2000 should not be entitled for any compensation for the delay involved in making public 
offer and the consequential delay in the payment of the purchase consideration.  Those persons 
who  were  holding  shares  of  the  Indian  company  as  on  June  14,  2000  and  continue  to  be 
shareholders on the closure day of the public offer made in terms of the directions given by SEBI

was holding on June 14, 2000  are tendered in response to the belated public offer.
