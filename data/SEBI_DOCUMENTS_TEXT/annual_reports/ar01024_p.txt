Prakash Mani Tripathi held a meeting with the Chairman and other Senior Officials of the Board

Promotion of Official Language 
 
Board's endeavour has always been to implement the Official Language Policy of Government of 
India in its offices as well as in the capital market.  In furtherance of this objective, the Board has 
brought  out  number  of  valuable  publications  in  bilingual  form.      These  publications  include 
"Capital Market Guide" originally written in Hindi, which proved very useful in educating the 

investors of Capital Market.  The Board has taken number of initiatives to make available the 
material related to securities market in Hindi as well as in regional languages.   
 
To  facilitate  smooth  implementation  of  Official  Language  Policy  and  in  order  to  bring 
uniformity in the interpretation of meanings of various words and phrases prevailing in financial 
market, SEBI brought out a book titled "SEBI Rajbhasha Sahayika".  In addition to this, SEBI 
also published books like Rajbhasha Sandarshika, Hindi Aashu-Tankan Sandarshika and Vidhi 
Karya  Sahayika  so  as  to  provide  reference  material  to  its  employees  so  that  they  do  not  face 
much difficulty in implementing the Official Language in their day-to-day work. 
 
Owing to globalization of capital market, new terminology has emerged and the Hindi equivalent 
of  these  terms  are  not  available.    Keeping  in  mind  the  problems  faced  by  Indian  investors  in 
interpretation of these new terms in Hindi, Official Language Division is putting its best efforts 
to establish suitable Hindi equivalents of these new concepts.   
 
In addition to creating a conducive atmosphere for implementation of Official Language Policy 
in  its  offices,  the  SEBI  also  coordinated  with  other  agencies/institutions  for  effective 
implementation of the Official Language. The Board is determined to accelerate the progress of 
implementation of Official Language in the capital market in future.

The  responsibilities  and  activities  of  Information  Systems  Department  include  framing  of  IT 
policy and development of centralised database system for dissemination of information across

security.  
 
During the year, appropriate Security/Audit trail mechanism was implemented over the existing 
application software packages relating to Foreign Institutional Investment, Legal, Intermediaries 
Administration,  Take-overs,  Initial  Public  Offering,  Action  Taken  Reports,  etc.,  to  ensure
