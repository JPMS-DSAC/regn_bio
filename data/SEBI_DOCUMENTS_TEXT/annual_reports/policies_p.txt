BOARD OF INDIA

SEBI functions within the legal framework of
the SEBI Act, 1992. The statutory objectives
of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act, 1992
are fourfold:

able  to  raise  resources  at  reasonable  cost,
conduct  themselves  in  accordance  with  the
highest  standards  of  corporate  governance,
and diligently meet their regulatory obligations.

G Protection of the interests of investors in

securities;

G Development of the securities market;

G Regulation of the securities market; and

G Matters  connected 

therewith  and

incidental thereto.

In  keeping  with  these  objectives,  SEBI  has
set  for  itself  strategic  aims  in  the  four  key
spheres  which  encompass  SEBI’s  activities,
namely, investors, issuers, intermediaries and
regulatory regime.

To the investors, SEBI strives to assure that
their  rights  are  protected,  they  are  able  to
make informed choices and decisions and the
market is fair in its financial dealings.

issuers,  SEBI  strives  to  provide  a
To  the 
transparent,  efficient  market  where  they  are

To the intermediaries, SEBI strives to provide
a  market  in  which  they  can  compete  freely
and  operate  in  a  manner  which  gives  the
investors and market participants confidence
that  the  market  is  efficient,  orderly  and  fair.
In  the  regulatory  regime,  SEBI  seeks  to
ensure transparency - that it always remains
appropriate, proportionate and effective.

With  these  strategic  aims  in  view,  SEBI  has
been  constantly  reviewing  and  reappraising
its policies and programmes, formulating new
policies  and  regulations  to  cover  areas
hitherto unregulated or inadequately regulated
and implementing them in a manner so as to
promote  the  growth  of  the  market  with
transparency, fairness, efficiency and integrity.

The  major  policy  reforms  and  developments
in  the  Indian  capital  market  during  2003-04
are presented in Box 1.1.

Issue Norms
G In order to ensure the high quality of issuers accessing the primary securities market, SEBI has introduced

an additional criteria of ‘net tangible assets’, ‘minimum number of allottees in public issue’ and ‘profitability’.

documents. The offer documents should contain information relating to financial statements as per the Indian
Accounting Standards.

to  market  expectations,  the  companies  have  been  provided  with  some  flexibility  in  the  indication  of  price
band either movable or fixed floor price in the Red Herring Prospectus. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs)
have been prohibited from withdrawing their bids after the closure of bidding.

have been advised to disclose the details of bulk deals. Stock exchanges were advised to amend Clause 41
of  the  Listing  Agreement  to  make  it  mandatory  for  the  listed  companies  to  publish  the  number  of  investor
complaints received, disposed of, unresolved alongwith their quarterly results.

Enhance Market Safety and Reduce Credit Risk
G Clearing and settlement cycle time has been further contracted to T+2 with effect from April 1, 2003 and this
measure  is  expected  to  result  in  faster  settlement,  higher  safety  and  lower  settlement  risk  in  the  Indian
capital market.

Mutual Funds
G With a view to strengthening the position, specifying accountability and protecting the interest of investors,

SEBI has defined the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Fund Manager of mutual funds.

1. CURTAIN RAISER: THE

ENVIRONMENT FOR CAPITAL
MARKET

General Economic Environment

I.
Real GDP witnessed a growth of 8.1 per cent
during the year 2003-04 as compared to 4.0
per  cent  growth  in  the  year  2002-03.  Even
though  growth  was  experienced  in  all  the
three  segments  of  the  economy,  viz.,
manufacturing,  services  and  agriculture,  the
rebound in performance in agriculture sector
exhibiting  the  growth  to  9.1  per  cent  during
the year 2003-04 against the negative growth
to  5.2  per  cent  in  the  previous  year,  had
substantial  impact  on  the  record  breaking
performance.  In  fact,  trade,  hotels,  transport
and communication together performed very
well in the increased growth of 10.9 per cent
in  2003-04  as  compared  to  7.0  per  cent
growth  in  2002-03.  The  loss  of  growth  in
mining and quarrying industries from 8.8 per
cent  in  2002-03  to  4.0  per  cent  in  2003-04
was  very  well  absorbed  without  a  negative
impact  on  the  overall  growth  of  GDP.  Thus,
the  high  GDP  growth  of  8.1  per  cent  during
2003-04  seems  to  have  been  propelled  by
the  growth  rates  of  over  5.0  per  cent  in
sectors  like  agriculture,  forestry  and  fishing,
manufacturing,  electricity,  gas  and  water
supply,  construction,  trade,  hotels,  transport
and communication, financing, insurance, real
estate and business services, and community,
social  and  personal  services.  The  share  of
agriculture  sector  to  GDP  increased
marginally  from  21.95  per  cent  to  22.16  per
cent  during  2003-04.  While  the  share  of
industry to GDP declined marginally from 22
per cent in 2002-03 to 21.70 per cent in 2003-
04,  the  share  of  services  sector  to  GDP,
increased slightly from 56.05 per cent in 2002-
03 to 56.13 per cent in 2003-04.
Gross  Domestic  Savings  (GDS)  increased
from  23.5  per  cent  in  2001-02  to  24.2  per
cent of the GDP at market prices. The steady
growth of Gross Domestic Savings (GDS) at
current  prices  has  been  facilitated  by
improvement  in  the  personal  disposable
income emanating from high GDP growth and

4

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

low inflation rates. There was growth in both
the  financial  and  physical  assets  owned  by
the household sector during the year 2002-03
as compared to that in 2001-02. The savings
in term of physical assets by households was
higher  at  Rs.3,04,851  crore  compared  to
Rs.2,54,407 crore in financial assets as at the
end  of  the  year  2002-03.  There  has  been
some  shift  in  the  movement  of  household
savings to physical assets which indicates that
household  savings  in  the  system  are  being
driven  not  only  by  current  incomes  but  also
on expected future cash flows.
Further, the composition of household savings
in financial assets reflects that the share of
investment by households in shares and
debentures has gone up to 3.9 per cent in 2002-
03 from 2.8 per cent in 2001-02 – a marginal
increase of 1.1 per cent. In 1999-2000, shares
and debentures accounted for 7.5 per cent of
the total household financial savings which
dropped to 4.2 per cent in 2000-01 and further
to  2.8  per  cent  in  2001-02  and  has  now
increased to 3.9 per cent in 2002-03. In the
contractual savings also, there was a rise from
30.6 per cent in 2001-02 to 32.6 per cent in
2002-03. However, the share of household
investments in bank deposits declined from 39.8
per cent in 2001-02 to 37.4 per cent in 2002-
03. The investments of households in financial
assets as a per centage of GDP at current
market prices declined from 11.1 per cent in
2001-02 to 10.3 per cent in 2002-03.
There  has  been  a  substantial  growth  in
foreign  exchange  reserves  in  recent  years.
The  foreign  exchange  reserves  including
reserve tranche position in IMF increased to
US$  1,12,959  million  in  2003-04  from  US  $
76,100  million  in  2002-03  due  to  the  strong
confidence reposed by international investors
in  the  Indian  economy  leading  to  large
portfolio  investments.  The  financial  markets
too experienced a decline in real interest rates
and easy liquidity situation.
The  market  witnessed  availability  of  wide
spectrum  of  financial  products  including
derivatives for the investors leading to stock
market boom in the country.

2. REVIEW OF POLICES AND

PROGRAMMES

Primary Securities Market

I.
The reforms process continues unabated with
significant changes in the capital market. For
the  first  time,  in  the  history  of  Indian  capital
market, a public offer of more than Rs.10,000
crore  was  made  by  a  listed  Government  of
India  company.  The  primary  market  has
witnessed  a  highly  encouraging  response
from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). For
the  first  time  in  a  single  month,  that  too  at
the fag end of the fiscal year, a large amount
was  mobilized  by  several  public  and  private
sector  companies,  amounting  to  more  than
three times the total amount mobilized in the
previous  year.  All  these  have  been  possible
because of many proactive issuer as well as
investor friendly regulatory reforms initiated by
SEBI.  In  addition,  disclosure  and  corporate
governance  standards  have  been  enhanced
so  that  not  only  Indian  investors  but  also
foreign  investors  repose  confidence  in  the
market.  Testimony  of  this  lies  in  the  number
of public issues, amount mobilized, variety of
investors and increasing response from new
issuers accessing the Indian primary market.

Information and Investor Protection

A.
SEBI  has  been  pro-active  and  dynamic  in
responding  to  national  and  international
challenges  in  the  primary  securities  market
and to make the Indian market more scientific,
transparent  and  investor-centric,  SEBI  has
taken several new policy initiatives. A few of
them are briefly discussed in this section.

minimum number of allottees in a public issue,
etc. Issuers unable to fulfil these requirements
can also access primary market provided:

i.

ii.

The  project  has  been  appraised  by
financial 
institutions/scheduled
commercial banks who have participated
in  the  project  to  the  extent  of  15  per
cent; or

The issue is made through book building
route  with  participation  by  QIBs  to  the
extent of at least 50 per cent.

Subject  to  the  fulfilling  of  other  criteria
including minimum number of allottees.

b. Enhanced Disclosure Requirement
Reliable  and  dependable  information  is
expected  to  help  investors  to  take  informed
decisions about investment in primary market.
The  prospectus  should  contain  all  relevant
and  necessary  information  about  the  issuer
and the securities under issue. SEBI aims to
ensure that the prospectus is the single most
important source of information for investors
to base their investment decision.

Towards  this  objective,  offer  documents  of
domestic issuers have been made to contain
additional  information  such  as  PAN  number/
voter identity number/driving license number
of  the  promoters  of  the  company,  etc.
“Management  discussions  and  analysis
(MDA)  and  accounting  and  other  ratios”  are
required to be contained in the offer document
and these are expected to provide information
relating  to  the  management’s  view  on  the
performance of the company.

Issue Standards

a.
With  a  view  to  facilitating  quality  issuers  to
access capital market, several reforms have
been  introduced  during  the  year  and  they
include: track record of financial performance,
best of accounting polices, introduction of new
parameters  such  as  net  tangible  assets,

Transparency and Governance

c.
Enhanced  corporate  governance  standards
are expected to create sustainable value for
stakeholders.  Confidence  of  investors  in  the
market  place  will  increase  if  corporate

B. Other Policy Initiatives

a. Definition of Small Investor

(Primary Market)

The  basis  of  defining  a  ‘small  investor’  has
been  changed  from  number  of  shares  to
value of application made by him. An investor
is now considered to be a small investor when
he/she invests Rs.50,000/- or less.

b. Book Building Guidelines
SEBI  has  been  constantly  reviewing  and
making changes in the book building process
so  as  to  make  price  discovery  immune  to
artificial factors and responsive to the market
forces.  Companies  have  now  been  given
flexibility in terms of indicating either a movable
price  band  or  a  fixed  floor  price  in  the  Red
Herring  prospectus.  Qualified  institutional
buyers have been prohibited from withdrawing
their bids after closure of bids, QIB definition
has  been  enlarged  to  include  insurance
companies, pension and provident funds.

c. Greenshoe Option
Unexpected  developments  may  have  an
adverse  impact  on  price  of  newly  listed
securities. The facility of greenshoe option
introduced by SEBI facilitates the investment
bankers to stabilize the post listing price of the
security. This measure is expected to mitigate
volatility and enhance investor confidence.

d. Debt Instruments and Debenture

Trustees

SEBI  has  reviewed  the  role  of  debenture
trustees  as  well  as  provisions  concerning
issuance of debt instruments. Consequently,
it  has  carried  out  several  amendments,  for
example  prohibition  of  willful  defaulters  from
making  further  debt  issue,  requirement  of
investment  grade  rating,  execution  of  trust
deed within three months, etc.

e. Designated Stock Exchange
Pursuant  to  withdrawal  of  the  concept  of
regional  stock  exchange,  companies  have

been granted an option to choose one stock

for  the  purpose  of  finalization  of  basis  of
allotment.

recommendations  of  the  Committee  have
been,  put  on  hold  for  the  time  being,  owing
to  representations  received  from  various
market participants.

Employee Stock Option Scheme

f.
SEBI  (ESOP  and  ESPS)  guidelines  have
been modified to  inter-alia include provisions
of  mandatory  disclosures  of  employee
compensation cost using fair value of ESOPs/
ESPS,  calculated  based  on  option  pricing
model  and  also  the  impact  of  the  same  on
profits  and  EPS  of  the  company.  This  is  in
addition to expensing of the said cost in the
financial statements based on either intrinsic
or  fair  value.  The  amendments  have  also
included  provisions  to  facilitate  faster  listing
of shares arising out of exercise of ESOP etc.

g. Bonds by Foreign Entities
Multilateral development institutions and other
supra-national  organizations  have  been
permitted to access the domestic market and
list  the  rupee  denominated  securities  on
Indian  stock  exchanges.  SEBI  has  prepared
a  model  listing  agreement  to  be  signed  by
such  entities  before  they  access  and  seek
listing.  Subsequently,  Asian  Development
Bank  floated  rupee  denominated  bond  on
private placement basis for Rs.500 crore and
these bonds have been listed on NSE.

h. Corporate Governance
SEBI  constituted  a  Committee  on  Corporate
Governance under the Chairmanship of Shri
N.R. Narayanamurthy to frame new standards
for  corporate  governance.  Based  on  the
recommendations  of  the  committee  and  the
submission  of  public  comments,  the  listing
agreement  has  been  amended  suitably.  All
the  listed  companies  with  paid  up  capital  of
Rs. 3 crore and above, or networth of Rs.25
crore and above, at any time in the history of
the  companies  are  covered  under  these
corporate  governance  principles  with  effect
from March 31, 2004. Implementation of the

respect to physical scrips.

Central Listing Authority (CLA)

j.
Standardization  of  listing  requirements  and
implementation  of  the  same  across  all
exchanges  are  very  important  prerequisites
for a uniform national market. To achieve this
objective  SEBI  has  set  up  a  single  listing
authority called ‘Central Listing Authority’. The
Regulations  for  setting  up  of  this  authority
were  notified  on  August  21,  2003.  The  CLA
has  been  set  up  under  the  presidentship  of
Justice  M  N  Venkatachaliah,  former  Chief
Justice of India.

Secondary Securities Market

II.
Market micro structure of secondary securities
market  and  its  robustness  are  sine  qua  non
for  promoting  investors’  confidence  and
maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  market.
Trading, clearance and settlement are some
of  the  major  functions  of  the  secondary
market. Globalization of economies and rapid
changes in information technology have made
countries and exchanges virtually borderless.
Rapid  changes  in  technologies  have  made
transactions  less  costly  and  faster.  Some  of
these  developments  have  had  significant
impact  on  the  way  stock  exchanges  are
organized,  managed,  supervised  and
monitored.  Indian  capital  market  regulator,
SEBI,  has  been  continuously  responding  to
changes  and  challenges  offered  by  macro-
micro economic forces towards making Indian
capital market the most efficient, transparent

and  clean.  The  regulator  has  initiated  many
measures during the year 2003-04. A few of
these measures are discussed below:

A. Margin Trading
Liquidity is one of the important characteristics
of  a  financial  market.  Illiquidity  can  lead  to
“liquidity  risk”  which  has  been  reported  to
drive  away  institutional/high  net  worth
investors  from  the  market.  Illiquidity / poor
liquidity  is  known  to  have  caused  high
transaction  costs.  With  a  view  to  providing
more  liquidity  in  the  Indian  equity  market,
SEBI has initiated steps to introduce margin
trading with effect from April 1, 2004.

The salient features of margin trading include:
It  is  available  only  with  respect  to  the
a.
securities  in  Group  1  of  the  stock
exchanges,  i.e.  securities  having  mean
impact cost of less than or equivalent to
one per cent and having traded at least
for 80 per cent (plus or minus 5 per cent)
of the days in the previous 18 months;

b. Only corporate brokers with net worth of
at  least  Rs.3  crore  are  eligible  to  offer
this facility;

g.

A  broker  may  use  his  own  funds  or

Total indebtedness of a broker shall not
exceed 5 times his net worth;

A broker is expected to be prudent and
should  ensure  that  no  concentration
takes place in any single client;

The  initial  and  maintenance  margin  for
the client, shall be a minimum of 50 per
cent and 40 per cent respectively, to be
paid in cash; and

The  arbitration  mechanism  of  the
exchange  shall  not  be  available  for
grievances arising out of this facility.

regulatory developments in other jurisdictions

B. Securities Lending and Borrowing
Both  buyers  and  sellers,  in  the  securities
market,  need  to  have  equal  opportunities
either to carry on margin trading and /or short
sales.  One-sided  facilities  can  lead  to
imbalances. Most of the major markets in the
world  provide  facilities  to  over  come  the
problems  of  short  sales/failed  trades  so  that
delivery is ensured. One of the mechanisms
that  is  available  to  ensure  non  failure  of
delivery  is  through  Securities  Lending  and
Borrowing (SLB). SLB also facilitates liquidity
and  price  discovery.  SLB  is  expected  to
facilitate  securities  prices  to  achieve  the
equilibrium level.

The SLB was formulated in 1997 under which,
approved  intermediaries  were  permitted  to
carry  on  SLB  activities.  Subsequently,  SEBI
stopped granting further registration. Now the
registration  process  has  been  restarted.  In
order  to  address  the  issue  of  settlement
shortage  through  borrowing  and  lending  of
securities,  the  clearing  corporation/clearing
house has been allowed to get registered as
an  approved  intermediary  with  SEBI.  Once
registered,  these  entities  may  borrow
securities  on  behalf  of  the  member  for  the
purpose of meeting short falls subject to some
of the following conditions:

a.

b.

c.

The  clearing  corporation  (CC)  /clearing
house  (CH)  shall  borrow  the  required
securities  to  meet  the  short  fall  on  the
day of settlement for a maximum period
of  7  trading  days,  excluding  the  day  of
borrowing;
The  defaulter  selling  broker  may  make
a delivery within 3 trading days from the
due date i.e. settlement date; and
In  the  event  of  selling  broker  failing  to
make delivery within 3 days, the CC/CH

Box 1.2: Margin Trading and Securities Lending
Box 1.2: Margin Trading and Securities Lending

Margin trading: It is a trading in the securities market with borrowed resources – funds or securities. As margin
trading  is  providing  a  facility  to  investors  to  trade  in  the  market  with  the  margin  money,  it  is  essentially,  a
leverage mechanism. It arises in a market where there is insufficient flow of the supply and demand forces due
to lack of adequate funds. Margin trading injects liquidity in the market and provides an avenue of investment for
risk taking investors and those willing to finance them.

Margin trading enables the investors to increase their purchasing/selling power and raises the possibility to reap
substantial profits if the market movements are according to one’s expectations. It injects liquidity into the system
which  in  turn  adds  to  the  depth  of  the  market  and  leads  to  an  effortless  formation  of  prices.  It  mitigates  the
quantum of failed trades by supporting the buy and sell sides of trades for smooth settlement. A sound margin
policy can alter the credit flow in the economy. When the stock prices rise continuously, imposing a high margin
requirement would lower the demand for stocks and thus halt the rising trend in prices

On the flip side, certain adverse effects of margin trading have also been noticed. J.K.Galbraith had mentioned
margin loans as a major cause for the gravity of the market downturn that brought forth the Great Depression. A
low  margin  requirement  in  stock  index  futures  was  cited  by  Brady  Commission  as  a  reason  for  1987  crash.
Margin loans reduce the credit available for more legitimate uses i.e. it affects the way credit is allocated.
The  risks  accompanying  margin  trading  would  be  mitigated  if  a  well  drafted  and  active  margin  trading  policy  is
instituted. Further there is a need for a uniform and standardized margin requirement across the board. Otherwise
each brokerage house would set margins as per its whims and fancies. Competition would force them to impose
a set of low margins which would lead to a spate of possible margin calls in the event of a down turn and lead
to a possible enhanced volatility in the market.
Margin trading is an important form whereby the integration of money and capital markets is achieved. In many countries
there are margin requirements that impose specific limits on the amounts that brokers and institutions can lend.

US Scenario
The  Securities  Exchange  Act,  1934  had  stated  three  reasons  for  imposing  the  Federal  Reserve  margin
requirements:  (1)  to  re-allocate  credit  for  more  productive  uses,  (2)  to  protect  investors  from  having  too  much
debt, and (3) to reduce stock price volatility. It would be pertinent to mention here that the business models for
the margin trading and securities lending are different in different markets. SEC limits the aggregate indebtedness
of a broker towards all other persons to 1500 per cent of its net capital. The Federal Reserve, NYSE and NASD
have instituted rules that govern margin trading.

Margin trading in Japan
Margin trading in Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) began in 1951 i.e. two years after it restarted its operation. The
stocks  traded  in  TSE  are  divided  into  three  categories:  largest  stocks  which  occupy  90  per  cent  of  the  market
capitalization  of  TSE,  newly  listed  stocks  and  the  foreign  category  which  includes  non-Japanese  stocks.  Until
November  1991,  trading  on  margin  was  allowed  only  in  the  first  category.  From  December  of  that  year,  some
selected newly listed stocks were also included in the permitted category.

Present Status of Margin trading in India
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 did not permit a broker to take up any fund based activity. Hence,
there was an apprehension that brokers would not be able to lend funds for margin trading in view of provisions
therein. This was examined by SEBI in 1997 and a view was taken that a broker cannot lend funds as a regular
business  activity  or  lending  of  funds  cannot  be  his  prime  activity.  The  margin  trading  issues  were  reviewed  by
SEBI  in  2003  and  based  on  the  recommendation  of  its  advisory  committee,  the  member-brokers  have  been
allowed to provide margin trading facility to their clients, in the cash segment.
The Reserve Bank of India has instructed the commercial banks to provide loans to individuals against physical
securities up to Rs.10 lakh and Rs.20 lakh for securities held in demat form. Further, guidelines were issued in
November 2001, allowing Banks to finance margin trading within the overall ceiling of 5 per cent prescribed for
exposure  to  capital  market,  a  minimum  margin  of  40  per  cent  of  the  funds  lent  for  margin  trading,  shares
purchased  to  be  in  demat  mode  under  pledge  to  the  lending  bank  and  Bank’s  Boards  to  prescribe  necessary
safeguards to ensure that no nexus develops between inter-connected stock broking entities/stock brokers and
the bank in respect of margin trading.
As per the guidelines issued by SEBI, securities having mean impact cost of less than or equal to 1 and having
traded on at least 80 per cent (+/-5 per cent ) of the days for the previous eighteen months, have been categorized
as Group 1. The securities in Group 1 are eligible for margin trading facility. Only corporate brokers with a “net
worth” of at least Rs.3 crore would be eligible to offer margin trading facility to their clients. For the purpose of
providing  the  margin  trading  facility,  a  broker  may  use  his  own  funds  or  borrow  from  scheduled  commercial
banks and/or NBFCs regulated by RBI. A broker shall not be permitted to borrow funds from any other source.

to follow other conditions imposed on settlement, delivery, trading days, recovery from the defaulting broker, etc.
The  exchanges  and  the  clearing  house/corporation  have  been  asked  to  monitor  the  shortages  in  securities  in
every exchange at the time of delivery/settlement and if need arises, take appropriate action against any frequently

C. Secondary Market for Corporate Debt
Integrated  development  of  all  segments  of
financial  markets  is  necessary  to  mitigate
arbitrage  opportunities  and  also  to  reduce
risk-return  imbalances  between  the  market
segments.  Equity  and  debt  markets  are  two
important segments of financial markets. Any
unequal  development  between  two  markets
will lead to inefficiency in the market structure.
In  India,  the  issuance  of  corporate  debt  has
been  substantial  but  most  of  it  has  been
issued  through  private  placement  and  this
privately  placed  debt  is  generally  not  listed
on  the  stock  exchange  thus  eluding  liquidity

and transparency. In order to provide greater
transparency and protect interest of investors
in debt securities, SEBI has prescribed some
of  the  major  conditions  to  be  complied  with
by corporates for listing privately placed debt
securities, for example:

a.

b.

The company shall make full disclosures
as  per  the  Companies  Act,  1956,  SEBI
(Disclosure  and  Investor  Protection)
Guidelines  2000  and  the  Listing
Agreement with the stock exchanges.
The  debt  securities  shall  carry  credit
rating  from  a  recognized  credit  rating
agency.  Each  company  shall  appoint  a
debenture trustee registered with SEBI.

Box 1.3: Private Placement of Securities
Box 1.3: Private Placement of Securities

Private Placement
Private  Placement  is  defined  as  issuance  of  securities  to  fewer  than  50  persons,  without  issuing  prospectus/
letter  of  offer  and  without  seeking  permission  for  listing  on  the  stock  exchanges  for  the  debt  securities  issued.
This definition is derived on the basis of non-compliance of Rule 19 (2) (b) of SC(R) Act, 1957 a pre-condition
for  listing  of  the  securities  to  be  issued.  Over  the  past  years,  private  placement  has  emerged  as  an  additional
method of raising funds by the corporate sector. The specified investors of private placement include institutional
buyers, high networth individuals and corporates.

Relevance of Private Placement
A  private  placement  is  essentially  resorted  to  when  a  corporate  desires  to  raise  funds  in  a  timely  and  cost
effective manner. It affords flexibility, time saving and easy access to funds, which are necessary in a scenario
where  interest  rates  are  dynamic  and  subject  to  quick  changes.  The  decision  for  a  public  issue  at  large  or  a
private placement with limited number of persons largely hinges upon the amount to be raised, the reputation of
the  issuer,  the  frequency  with  which  the  issuer  has  tapped  the  market  for  funds  in  the  past,  the  time  frame  for
actually raising the money, the willingness to administer a large number of small ticket holdings and the price to
pay.

It  is  time  saving  and  cheaper,  i.e.,  no  cost  on  advertisement  and  limited  expenses  on  printing  and  brokerage.
Hence, issue cost for private placement is lower than public issues. It is argued that private placement ensures
accuracy  in  pricing  and  the  price  is  known  at  the  time  of  launch  itself.  It  caters  to  specific  investor  needs  and
issuer  preferences;  leads  to  innovation  and  development  of  new  products.  It  is  also  flexible  as  the  issuer  can
alter  the  terms  of  issue  later  on,  depending  on  the  market  conditions.  Funds  can  be  accessed  in  quicker  time
compared to public issues, where a number of formalities have to be completed post-issue.

Private  placements  are  neither  underwritten  nor  do  they  have  any  minimum  subscription  requirement.  These
private placement issues can be tailored to meet specific requirements. The terms and conditions of issuers are
negotiable  on  each  deal.  The  instruments  made  under  private  placement  are  confidential  and  provide  inherent
advantages to the corporates.

Issues of Private Placements
In  India,  the  private  placement  market  has  been  in  existence  for  a  long  time,  although  it  acquired  prominence
only  from  1990-91.  This  market  has  become  an  important  avenue  for  sourcing  funds  by  both  the  private  and
government  sector.  The  public  sector  has  been  the  major  mobiliser  of  resources  through  private  placements.
Most  of  the  private  placements  were  in  the  form  of  long  term  issues  of  three  to  seven  years.  In  recent  times,
innovative  bonds  with  call/put  options  have  been  introduced,  which  have  improved  liquidity  for  both  the  issuer
and the borrower.
In 2003, the SEBI Secondary Market Advisory Committee made the following recommendations:
G A  listed  company  issuing  debt  securities  on  private  placement  basis  should  make  full  disclosures  on  its

websites or to stock exchanges and SEBI.

G Even  unlisted  companies  making  private  placement  of  debt  securities  and  getting  them  listed  on  the  stock
exchanges will have to make disclosures in line with Listing Agreements and other regulatory requirements.
G For  other  denominations,  the  relaxation  is  only  with  regard  to  the  modalities  of  disclosure,  and  not  with

regard to quality and nature of disclosures.

G For  a  listed  company  (either  equity  or  debt)  issuing  debt  securities  either  on  private  placement  basis  or
through  public  issue,  the  same  exhaustive  disclosure  requirements,  as  are  normally  required  under  the
Companies Act, SEBI Guidelines and the Listing Agreement of the stock exchanges, will be applicable.

G An  unlisted  company  making  private  placement  of  debt  securities  and  intending  to  list  them  should  also

make similar disclosures.

G However, if the securities are not proposed to be listed, SEBI-registered intermediaries should be discouraged

from associating with issuance and trading of such securities.

G Companies must appoint debenture trustees for all securities issued through private placement.
G Once these securities are listed, the continuing disclosures, as stipulated under the Listing Agreement, shall

be made by listed companies also with respect to all outstanding debt issues.

Recent Regulations
SEBI  introduced  structured  regulations  September,  2003  to  regulate  private  placement  effectively.  These
comprehensive guidelines state that all listed companies making issue of debt securities on a private placement

basis and listed on the stock exchange should make full disclosures and enter into Listing Agreement with the
exchanges. Debt securities should carry a credit rating of not less than investment grade and they should be in
the  demat  form.  The  trading  in  privately  placed  debts  should  take  place  only  between  qualified  institutional
investors (QIIs) and high networth individuals (HNIs), in standard denomination of Rs.10 lakh.

Private Placement Market in Other Countries
The United States of America (USA)
The private placement market in the United States has been in existence for a very long time providing access
to  domestic  as  well  as  international  issuers.  In  the  US  market,  debt  instruments  are  predominantly  privately
placed.  Since  mid-1960s,  as  much  as  one-third  of  long  term  debt  and  equity  offerings  issued  by  domestic  and
foreigners  used  to  be  privately  placed.  The  US  bond  market  recorded  phenomenal  growth  in  the  late  1980s
which was essentially due to increased resort to the private placement of bonds. The life insurance companies
of  the  US  are  the  most  active  investors  in  this  market.  The  share  of  foreigners  in  the  total  amount  of  private
placement is also on the rise.

In  1972,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  introduced  Rule  144,  allowing  resale  of  privately
placed  instruments  after  a  two-year  lock-in-period  and  unlimited  transfer  after  three  years.  In  April,  1990,  Rule
144A  was  put  into  effect,  permitting  qualified  institutional  buyers  (QIBs)  to  trade  on  privately  placed  securities
without  a  two  year  holding  restriction  and  these  securities  were  exempted  from  registration  with  the  SEC.  The
QIBs include life insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, foreign and domestic commercial
banks.  The  rationale  behind  adopting  Rule  144A  was  to  increase  the  liquidity  in  the  private  placement  market
and  to  lower  the  differential  between  private  and  public  yields.  The  other  one  was,  of  course,  to  attract  the
foreign investors.

In November 1992, Rule 144A was amended, allowing bank trust funds and master trusts for pension funds to
buy unregistered bonds and stocks.

The United Kingdom (The UK)
Unlike in the US, the private placement market in the UK is not well established. English Law had a traditional
private placement exemption, but in general this was too narrow to constitute an adequate mechanism through
which a bond issue can flow. According to Section 59 and 60 of the Companies Act, 1985, “consequently where
an issuing house places the whole or part of a new issue privately with a few institutional investors like pension
funds which have agreed to hold the securities as long-term investments, the investments should appear to be
made  to  the  public”.  This  implies  that  since  there  was  no  issue  to  the  public,  the  prospectus  requirements  did
not apply.

Japan
Under the Japanese Securities and Exchange Law, private placement of issues need not be registered and no
filing of document in the form of prospectus is required. While the Securities and Exchange Law defines a public
offering and secondary distribution as solicitation towards “many unspecified persons”, offer to a small group of
specified  persons  can  be  termed  as  ‘private  placement’.  In  Japan,  most  domestic  bonds  and  municipal  bonds
are privately placed.

Private placement market in Japan is accessed mainly by the issuers from the Third World countries and private
companies of Japan, which do not have enough credibility to float public issues. Hence, private placement in the
Japanese  market  is  not  significant.  However,  the  private  placement  market  operates  according  to  the  certain
guidelines prescribed by the Trustee Banks Committee, 1977.

Germany
In  Germany,  private  placement  of  securities  is  made  in  the  form  of  certificate  of  indebtedness  in  the  domestic
Deutschemark  market.  The  certificates  creating  payment  liability  are  treated  as  debts  and  are  transferable
instruments.  The  issuers  get  the  inherent  advantage  of  saving  the  costs  involved  in  public  issues.  Normally,

every  intermediary,  listed  company  and
investor,  as  specified  by  SEBI  from  time  to
time, to make an application for the allotment

the  central  database  is  allotted  to  each
applicant. In terms of these regulations, SEBI
has  appointed  NSDL,  as  the  designated
service  provider.  SEBI  has  subsequently
issued  a  notification  on  November  25,  2003
and  December  8,  2003 
to  specify
intermediaries and their related persons who
are required to obtain the unique identification
number.

E. Risk Containment Measures
Integrity of market is sacrosanct in the capital
market. Many important measures have been
initiated  during  the  year  to  promote  integrity
of Indian market.

Pro-account Trading

a.
With  a  view  to  checking  the  practice  of
execution of orders in proprietary account of
member  and  later  transferring  it  into  client
account,  it  was  mandated  that  the  facility  of
placing  orders  on  “pro-account”  through
trading terminals, shall be generally extended
only  at  one  location  of  the  members  as
specified / required by the members.

b. Payment and Deliveries
Brokers and sub-brokers have been directed
not  to  accept  cash  from  the  clients  whether
against obligation or as margin for purchase
of  securities  and  /or  give  cash  against  sale
of  securities  to  the  clients.  All  the  payments
received/made  from/to  clients  should  be
through banking channels.

c. New Trading Segment
Stock  exchanges  are  required  to  take  prior
approval  of  SEBI  before  starting  any  new
trading segment.

d. Usage of Software
To safeguard the interest of securities market,
all  stock  exchanges  were  advised  to  obtain
an undertaking in the form of an affidavit from
the  members  on  the  exchange  to  the  effect
that the members as well as their sub-brokers
use only authorized software.

F. Disclosures
To enhance disclosure standards the following
measures have been initiated.

a.

b.

Insiders  and  promoters  are  required  to
disclose  as  per  Insider  Trading  and
Takeover Regulations.

A  broker  is  required  to  disclose  to  his
client  his  proprietary  as  well  as  client
trading  details.  All  the  bulk  deals  in
excess of 0.5 per cent of the number of
equity  shares  of  the  company  listed  on
the stock exchanges are required to be
disclosed to the exchange/public.

c. Members  of  the  stock  exchanges  are
required  to  obtain  risk  disclosure
documents signed by their clients.

d. Companies  are  required  to  publish  the
status of investor complaints along with
the quarterly results.

e. Companies  have  been  asked  to  speed
up redressal of investors grievances and
they  have  been  brought  under  the
purview of arbitration mechanism of the
stock exchanges.

III. Mutual Funds
In  many  developed  markets,  institutional
investors namely mutual funds, pension funds,
insurance  companies  and  other  alternative
investment  vehicles  are  major  drivers  of

capital  markets.  In  India,  mutual  funds  have
been  active  in  the  primary  as  well  as  in  the
secondary  capital  market.  Both  structurally
and  functionally  Indian  mutual  funds  have
acquired  the  best  expertise  available  in  the
world. SEBI has taken many measures during
the  year  to  develop  this  industry  and  to
protect the interest of the investors.

A. Corporate Governance /

Professionalism

Governance  and  disclosure  standards  are
important  pillars  of  the  industry.  Good
governance standards enhance confidence of
the investors in mutual fund the industry. The
following  measures  have  been  taken  in  this
direction.

a. Certification and Code of conduct
With  a  view  to  utilizing  the  services  of
experienced  distributors/agents, 
the
certification  standards  have  been  relaxed  in
certain categories of agents/distributors.

b. Role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

and Fund Manager (FM)

The  positions  of  CEOs  and  FMs  have  been
strengthened  as  they  hold  a  specific
accountability  to  protect  the  interest  of  the
investors.  CEOs  are  required  to  ensure
mutual fund compliance as per the regulations
and  the  Fund  Managers  are  required  to
ensure investment as per the objective of the
scheme and interest of unitholders.

c.

Investment/Trading in Securities by
Employees of Asset Management
Companies and Mutual Fund Trust
Companies

In  consonance  with  SEBI  (Insider  Trading)
Regulations, the time validity of transactions
by employees of AMCs and mutual fund trust
companies  has  been  cut  down  to  one  week
and the time limit for purchase and sale has
been reduced to 30 days.

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

d. Unique Client Code (UCC)
Mutual Funds have been instructed to obtain
UCC either from the Bombay Stock Exchange
or  National  Stock  Exchange  before
commencing  trading  on  behalf  of  the
schemes/clients.

e. Uniform Cut Off Time
One of the main objectives of a regulator is to
provide fairness to all concerned in the market
place.  To  achieve  this,  SEBI  has  issued  the
Guidelines  for  uniform  cut  off  timing  for
applicability of net asset value (NAV) of mutual
fund schemes/plan (s). This is applicable both
for subscription and redemption.

f. Minimum Number of Investors
Skewed distribution of investors may lead to
some  anomalies  in  the  management  and
distribution  of  funds.  Therefore,  SEBI
prescribed  that  each  scheme  of  an  an
individual plan should have a minimum of 20
investors  and  that  no  single  investor  should
account  for  more  than  25  per  cent  of  the
corpus.

g. Bank Account Number and PAN by

Investors

Reliable and up to date information of market
participants  is  essential  for  regulatory
effectiveness.  Towards  this  objective,  SEBI
has been strengthening the process of “know
your  client”.  Mutual  funds  have  also  been
advised  to  collect  adequate  information
regarding  the  investors,  wherever  the  total
value of investment is Rs.50,000/- or more.

B. Prudential Investment
Mutual funds have been advised that they can
invest  in  short-term  deposit  with  disclosures
to  trustees  along  with  the  reasons  for
investment. SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations,
1996 contain prudential investment norms for
investing  in  debt  securities.  Government
securities  issued  by  the  Centre/State

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

Part-I Policies and Programmes

Government  or  on  its  behalf  by  the  RBI  are
exempt from the prudential investment norms.

For the Investors

E.
a. Nomination  facility  for  unitholders  of

Indian  mutual  funds  have  been  permitted  to
invest  in  equities  of  listed  overseas
companies by the Government of India. SEBI
has  decided  to  permit  each  mutual  fund  to
invest up to 10 per cent of its net assets as
on  January  31,  of  each  relevant  year  in
foreign securities. However, the minimum and
maximum investment limits are fixed at US$
5 million and US$ 50 million respectively for
each  mutual  fund  irrespective  of  the  size  of
the assets.

It  has  been  clarified  that  mutual  funds  can
invest  in  interest  rate  derivatives  subject  to
disclosures in offer documents.

C. New Products

Fund of Funds (FoFs)

a.
Indian  mutual  funds  have  been  permitted  to
float  Fund  of  Funds  (FoFs)  and  invest  in
funds  of  other  mutual  funds.  The  FoFs
schemes will be subject to maximum limit on
expenses  to  the  extent  of  0.75  per  cent  of
net  assets  and  other  restrictions  and
disclosures.

D. Disclosure Standards
In order to provide effective and appropriate
communication to the investors and improve
standards of disclosures in advertisement, to
implement regulatory intent effectively and to
remove  difficulties  in  the  application  of
regulations,  the  following  guidelines  have
been issued:

a.

b.

c.

d.

Standardization in hoarding/posters;

Advertisements  through  audio-visual
media;

Promotional activities, sales literature;

Performance advertisements; and

mutual funds

SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations  were
amended  by  including  a  provision  for  the
AMCs to provide an option to the unitholder(s)
so  that  nomination  can  also  be  in  favour  of
the Central Government, State Government,
a  local  authority,  any  person  designated  by
virtue of his office or a religious or charitable
trust.

IV. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)
Institutionalization  of  financial  markets  is
gaining  importance  worldwide  and  India  is
marching  ahead  in  this  respect.  FIIs  have
become  an  important  segment  of  the  Indian
capital  market.  All  past  records  have  been
broken and new history has been created in
terms of fresh investment by FIIs in 2003-04.
This  shows  the  confidence  and  faith  of  FIIs
in Indian market and in its regulatory system.

A. Regulatory Initiatives with respect to

FIIs

With  a  view  to  monitoring  the  investment
through  offshore  derivatives  issued  against
underlying  Indian  securities  (collectively
known as participatory notes) , SEBI inserted
Regulation  20A  in  the  FII  Regulations  ,
making it mandatory for the FIIs to report the
issuance/renewal/cancellation/ redemption of
such  instruments.  The  FII  regulations  have
been  further  amended  stating  that  FIIs  can
issue offshore derivatives against underlying
securities  listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  on
any stock exchange in India only in favour of
regulated entities subject to compliance with
“know your client” requirements. Further , FIIs
or  sub-accounts  have  to  ensure  that  no
downstream issue or transfer of such offshore
derivative  instrument  will  be  made  to  any
person other than a regulated entity.

The FII Regulations have also been amended
to  allow  FIIs  to  participate  in  delisting  offers

S E C U R I T I E S
AND  EXCHANGE
BOARD OF INDIA

so as to extend the exit opportunity (provided
to all other shareholders) to them. FIIs have
also been allowed to participate in sponsored
ADR/GDR  programs  as  well  as 
in
disinvestment of securities by the Government
of India.

Investor Awareness/ Assistance and
Investor Education/Protection

investor
SEBI  has  a  comprehensive 
grievances processing mechanism. Office of
Investor Assistance and Education (OIAE) is
the single window interface of SEBI with the
investors.  OIAE  accepts  grievances  of  all
investors  who  prefer  to  file  their  complaints
with  SEBI  for  matters  falling  within  its
jurisdiction. A standardized complaint format
is  available  at  all  SEBI  offices  and  on  the
SEBI  website  for  the  convenience  of
investors. Complaints received from investors
are  acknowledged  and  a  reference  number
is  sent  to  the  complainant.  Complaints  are

taken  up  with  the  concerned  entities  either
directly by OIAE or by the Investor Complaint
Cell  of  the  concerned  department.  SEBI
officers also hold meetings with the company
officials to impress upon them their obligation
to redress the grievances of investors. Action
u/s  11B  and  15C  of  SEBI  Act  is  initiated
against recalcitrant companies.

Internet Based Response System

A.
As  a  new  endeavour  in  investor  assistance,
a  simple  and  effective  internet  based
response  system  to  investor  complaints  has
been  set  up.  When  an  investor  files  a
complaint electronically, a system generated
acknowledgement letter is issued to him/her.

B. Securities Market Awareness

Campaign (SMAC)

SEBI  launched  a  comprehensive  education
campaign aimed at investors in the securities
market  –  “Securities  Market  Awareness

Shri G N Bajpai, Chairman, lighting the lamp at First Investor Education Programme conducted
by Interconnected Stock Exchange

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

Part-I Policies and Programmes

Campaign”  (SMAC).  The  motto  of  the
campaign is – ‘An Educated Investor is a
Protected Investor.’

The nation wide launch of this campaign was
flagged off by the then Hon’ble Prime Minister,
Shri  Atal  Bihari  Vajpayee,  on  January  17,
2003,  who  in  his  speech  highlighted  the
importance of an empowered investor in the
economic development of the country.

Following  the  national  launch,  the  campaign
has  already  been  extended  to  12  states.  In
Bangalore,  Kolkata  and  Chennai,  the
Governors of the respective states launched
the campaigns. In Hyderabad and Rajkot, the
Chief  Ministers  of  the  concerned  states
inaugurated  the  programmes  and  extended
considerable support to the programme.

While  the  national  as  well  as  the  state  level
launches have been aimed at generating wide
and  adequate  publicity  and  visibility  for  the
campaign,  the  structural  foundation  of  the
campaign  is  based  on  the  continued  and
active  participation  of  market  participants,
market intermediaries, Investors Associations
etc.,  who  have,  under  the  aegis  of  SEBI,
undertaken to organise workshops at various
cities/medium and small towns in the country
to  spread  SEBI’s  message  of  “Invest  with
Knowledge”. The details of the campaign are
discussed below:

a. Workshops
The workshops are aimed at reaching out to
the common investors and are held in small
and  medium  towns  and  cities  all  over  the
country. At the workshops, the investors are
educated  about  the  functioning  of  the
securities market, the basic fundamentals of
investment  and  risk  management  and  the
rights and responsibilities of an investor. The
message is couched in simple language, with
lectures  and  discussions  conducted  in  the
local/regional language.

20

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 - 2004

In an attempt to decentralize the campaign
keeping in mind the geographical spread of the
investors in the country, SEBI has enlisted the
support,  directly  as  well  as  indirectly,  of
investors’ associations, market participants,
ICAI, ICSI, reputed banks etc. Till March 2004,
more than 370 workshops were conducted in
around 235 cities/towns in the country. To
accelerate  the  speed  of  coverage  of  the
programme and to increase the number of
workshops to be conducted each month, a
meeting  of  market  participants/  stock
exchanges was held wherein it was decided to
conduct at least 1500 workshops, spread over
350 towns/cities, across all the states, by March,
2005. It was also decided that each state be
allocated to a market participant(s), who will be
responsible for conducting the agreed number
of workshops in each of those states.

Letters  were  sent  to  all  the  Hon’ble  MPs  of
both  the  Lok  Sabha  and  Rajya  Sabha
narrating therein the details of the Securities
Market Awareness Campaign and requesting
them  to  indicate  names  of  centres  in  their
constituencies  where  SEBI  could  organize
workshops for investor education. Continuous
efforts  are  being  made  to  arrive  at  venues
and dates to hold such workshops according
to  the  convenience  of  the  concerned
Members of Parliament. Accordingly, several
workshops  have  been  held  in  the  centres
indicated by the MPs.

In  addition  to  the  above  workshops,  stock
exchanges  have  been  requested  to  hold  an
“Open  House”  for  investors,  once  a  month
(preferably  on  the  first  Saturday  of  each
month),  in  their  premises.  At  these  “Open
Houses”, the exchanges have been requested
to  invite  the  compliance  officers  of  listed
companies (majority of complaints are against
listed companies), mutual funds, stock brokers
and  other  market  intermediaries  to  not  only
address/educate  the  investors  but  to  also
attend  to  their  grievances.  The  response  of
the stock exchanges to this initiative of SEBI

has been very positive.

b. Audio-Visual Clip
At the time of the national level launch, SEBI
presented an audio-visual clip depicting some
of the concerns of the common investor and
detailing  the  theme  of  the  Securities  Market
Awareness  Campaign.  This  short  but
extremely  effective  audio-visual  helps  to  set
the tone at all the workshops being organized
across the country.

c. Distribution of Educative Materials
SEBI  has  prepared  a  standardized  reading
material  and  presentation  material  for  the
workshops.  In  addition,  reference  guides  on
the  following  topics  have  been  prepared  for
distribution:
G Rights and responsibilities of investors;
G Substantial  acquisition  of  shares  and

takeovers;

G Simple  “dos  and  don’ts”  relating  to
various aspects of the securities market;
and

G Mutual funds.

These  reference  guides/booklets  have  been
translated  into  Hindi  and  the  workshop
material  has  been  translated  into  10  major
regional  languages  in  order  to  cover  a
substantial portion of the investor base in the
country. Till date, during the current financial
year,  approximately  2.40  lakh  reference
guides/brochures/  pamphlets/  material  etc.
have been distributed across the country.

Investor Website

d.
With  a  view  to  making  relevant  information
available  to  the  investor  at  one  place,
a 
website
(http://investor.sebi.gov.in)  has  been
operationalised  and  the  information  content
on this website is augmented periodically.

dedicated 

investor 

All the booklets/pamphlets prepared by SEBI

in  a  bilingual  form.  In  response  to  the
feedback received from investors, frequently
asked  questions  (FAQs),  pertaining  to  the
important  regulations  framed  by  SEBI  have
been  posted  on  this  website.  In  addition,  a
glossary of commonly used terms relating to
capital market also appears on this site.

e. Advertisements
SEBI  has  prepared  simple  “dos  and  don’ts”
for investors relating to various aspects of the
securities  market.  While  these  simple
messages  have  been  put  on  the  investor
website and have been printed in the form of
leaflets  to  be  distributed  across  the  country,
it  was  felt  that  these  messages  could  be
spread  across  the  investor  base  by  way  of
advertisements  in  newspapers,  especially  in
the  regional  newspapers.  Keeping  the  cost
constraint in mind, it was decided that these
advertisements  could  be  released  in
association with market participants, with the
name  and  logo  of  the  market  participants
appearing  in  the  advertisements  along  with
the name and logo of SEBI. This has provided
inducement to the market participants to bear
the  cost  of  these  advertisements  and  the
response has been overwhelming.

Till  March  2004,  over  700  advertisements
relating to various aspects of securities market
appeared  in  48  different  newspapers/
magazines, covering approximately 111 cities
and 9 regional languages, apart from English
and Hindi.

All India Radio

f.
With regard to educating investors through the
medium  of  radio,  All  India  Radio  was
requested to allot free slots to SEBI on their
various  programmes.  AIR  allotted  five  free
slots  in  the  month  of  January,  2004  in  its
programme 
“People’s  Corner”.  This
programme  is  aimed  to  create  awareness
among  the  common  public  regarding  the
functioning  of  various  public  service

to  reach  out  to  a  large  number  of  investors.

A forty second filmlet with a short cautionary
message is being aired on television.

h. Grievances Redressed

SEBI  has  received  27,85,660  grievances
from investors, of which, a total of 26,32,632

VI. Retrospect and Prospects

A. Retrospect
2003-04  was  a  significant  year  in  terms  of
challenges  and  opportunities.  Nearly  all
segments of Indian capital market registered
new  records.  Secondary  spot  market,
derivatives, primary market, mutual funds and
foreign  institutional  investors  -  all  these
segments  created  records  of  sorts  by
registering  a  high  turnover,  a  high  rate  of
return, a large amount of mobilization, a large
custody of assets under management and the
highest fresh investment interest, respectively.

Physical  infrastructure  of  capital  market  has
been put to its severest test in the year 2003-
04.  A  number  of  Public  Sector  Enterprises
(PSEs)  accessed  the  capital  market  with
some  of  the  biggest  issues  in  the  history  of

Indian  capital  market.  Most  of  these  issues
came  in  a  close  succession,  putting  heavy
workload  on  various  categories  of
intermediaries. The Indian derivatives market
segment  has  become  one  of  the  largest
markets  in  the  world  in  terms  of  number  of
contracts traded.

SEBI has set for itself a vision – “To be the
most  dynamic  and  respected  regulator
globally”  and  carefully  crafted  a  strategic
action  plan(SAP),  in  consonance  with  its
objectives.  The  objective  is  to  help  the
securities  market  and  to  address  the
structural, systemic and operational risks
of  the  market.  The  full  team  of  SEBI  is
working assiduously to achieve the activities
of SAP. Some of the activities are continuous
in  nature  and  all  efforts  are  being  made  to
complete the remaining tasks in the years to
come. The major milestones crossed by SEBI
during  the  year  have  already  been  listed  in
this chapter.
