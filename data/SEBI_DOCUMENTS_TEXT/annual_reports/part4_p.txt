(Third

Amendment)  Regulations,  2006

1996 were further amended by the captioned
Amendment  Regulations  on August  03,  2006
vide  S.O.  No.  1254  (E).  The  amendments
mainly  concerned  provisions  for  capital
protection  oriented  schemes  and  for  increase
in fees.

The  provisions  relating  to  capital

protection oriented schemes are as follows:

a) A  new  Regulation  2(ea)  was  inserted
which  defines 
‘capital  protection
oriented  schemes’  to  mean  schemes  of
mutual  funds  which  are  designated  as
such and which endeavour to protect the
capital invested therein through suitable
orientation of their portfolio structure.

b)

Listing  of  capital  protection  oriented
schemes is not mandatory.

c) Capital  protection  oriented  schemes

have to be close-ended.

d) Units  of  capital  protection  oriented
schemes  cannot  be  repurchased  by  the
AMC before the end of maturity period.

e) Units  of  capital  protection  oriented
schemes have to be rated by a registered
credit rating agency from the view point
of  ability  of  its  portfolio  structure  to
attain  protection  of  capital  invested
therein.

recovery 

Since, it was felt that long-term investors
stand  to  lose  by  bearing  the  burden  of
unamortised  initial  issue  expenses  in
case  of  redemption  of  units  in  the  short
term  by  other  investors,  it  was  decided
to  mandate 
the
proportionate initial issue expenses from
proceeds payable to investors exiting the
scheme before total amortisation of such
expenses  in  the  books  of  the  scheme.
New sub-Regulations (3A), (3B) and (3C)
were  inserted  in  Regulation  49  which
inter  alia  requires  that  when  a  mutual
fund  repurchases  units  in  a  close-ended
scheme,  it  shall  deduct  an  amount
representing  proportionate  initial  issue
expenses  or  part  thereof  remaining
unamortised.  This 
is
applicable  to  close-ended  schemes
launched  after  the  commencement  of
these  Amendment  Regulations.  It  was
also  provided  that  the  amount  so
recovered  shall  be  credited  to  the
unamortised initial issue expenses of the
scheme.

fund is not in the form of standard bars
which comply with good delivery norms
of  LBMA,  has  to  be  assayed  and
converted  into  such  standard  bars  prior
to valuation, as mentioned above.

If  without  triggering  the  above
provision,  an  acquirer  is  desirous  of
consolidating  his  holding  without
the  target  company  breaching  the
minimum  public  shareholding
requirement,  he  may  make  an  open
offer to the shareholders of the target
company to acquire their shares. The
size  of  such  offer  should  be  the
lesser of the following:

 Twenty  per  cent  of  the  voting  capital  of

the company; or

 Such  other  lesser  percentage  of  the
voting capital of the company as would,
assuming  full  subscription  to  the  offer,

shareholding in a target company falling
below  the  limits  mentioned  in  the
Listing  Agreement  could  be  made  only
in  compliance  with  the  Delisting

The  SAT  has  erroneously  relied  on  the
judgment in the case of Hindustan Steel
Limited vs. State of Orissa (AIR 1970 SC
253)  as  the  said  case  has  no  application
in  the  present  case  which  relates  to
imposition  of  civil  liabilities  under  SEBI
Act  and  Regulations;  and  is  not  a
criminal  /  quasi-criminal  proceeding.

Imputing mens rea into the provisions of
Chapter  VIA  is  against  the  plain
language  of  the  statute  and  frustrates
entire purpose and object of introducing
Chapter VIA which was  to  give  teeth  to

SEBI  vs.  Bhoruka  Financial  Services

of 2006

SEBI had passed ad-interim orders dated
August  19,  2005  and  August  24,  2005  under
Section  11  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  issuing  various
directions  against  the  sellers/promoters  of

by  another

was challenged before SAT by BFSL.

In  its  final  order  dated  May  10,  2006,
passed  in  the  above  appeal,  SAT  held
as follows: “Sub-section (4) of Section 11
of  SEBI  Act,  1992  does  not  permit  the
Board  to  exercise  the  power  to  issue
interim orders or directions without first
ordering  an  enquiry  or  investigation.
The  said  power  cannot  be  exercised
unless  an  enquiry  or  an  investigation  is
pending. This will not denude the Board
of  its  power  to  issue  interim  orders  and
directions  in  cases  of  urgency.  The
legislature  has  made  its  intention  clear
that  interim  direction  /  order  could  be

Supreme  Court

SEBI  vs.  Shriram  Mutual  Fund  &

a) A  penalty  of  Rs.2  lakh  was  imposed  by
Adjudicating  Officer  (AO)  on  Shriram
Mutual Fund (SMF) as it had repeatedly
exceeded  the  permissible  limits  of
transactions through its associate broker,
in  terms  of  Regulation  25(7)  (a)  of  SEBI

b) On an appeal by SMF, SAT vide its final

The  Hon’ble

on  May  23,  2006.  Hon’ble  Supreme

settled the issues, as under:

for  contravention  of  the  provisions  of  a
Civil Act.

Penalty 
is  attracted  as  soon  as
contravention of the statutory obligation
as  contemplated  by

established,  and  therefore  the  intention
of the parties committing such violation
becomes  immaterial.

the  Act 

Unless  the  language  of  the  statute
indicated  the  need  to  establish  the
element  of  mens  rea,  it  is  generally
sufficient  to  prove  that  a  default  in
complying with the statute has occurred.

Once  the  contravention  is  established,
the  penalty  has  to  follow  and  only  the
quantum of penalty is discretionary.

provision and it is not necessary that the
Board  should  in  every  case  pass  an
interim  order  /  direction  where  an
enquiry / investigation has been ordered.
There  could  be  cases  where  the  Board
may  order  an  enquiry  /  investigation
and  pass  final  orders  /  directions  only
on  its  completion.  This  will  depend
upon  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the
complaint  received.”  After  observing
these principles, SAT set aside the orders
dated  August  19,  2005  and  August  24,
2005  but  upheld  the  order  dated

Special  Civil  Application  No.  of  9971
of  2006  -  Soumil  Bhavnagari  and
Others  and  Allied  Matters  -  Gujarat
High  Court

intermediaries 

SEBI  vide  order  dated  April  27,  2006
relating to IPO irregularities issued directions
against  more  than  hundred  persons,
including 
and  non-
intermediaries.  The  aforesaid  SEBI  order
came  in  the  wake  of  the  rampant  cornering
of  shares  in  IPOs.  The  petitioners  were
identified  by  SEBI  as  financiers  /  key
operators,  who  indulged  in  cornering  of

shares meant for retail investors. The Hon’ble
Gujarat  High  Court  dismissed  all  petitions
upholding the SEBI order which directed the
petitioners not to buy, sell or deal in securities
market  including  IPOs  directly  or  indirectly
till  further  directions.

The  petitioners  argued  that  in  order  to
exercise powers under Section 11(4), there are
certain conditions precedent, such as pending
enquiry  or  investigation  or  completion  of
such  enquiry  or  investigation,  and  that  SEBI
had  not  complied  with  these  ‘conditions
precedent’  and  there  is  no  whisper  of  an
investigation  or  enquiry  against 
the
petitioners.  The  Hon’ble  Court  held  that  if
the  interpretation  as  suggested  by  the
petitioners is accepted, SEBI will be denuded
of  the  majority  of  its  powers.  Once  there  is
an  investigation  which  may  not  be  against
an  individual,  but  from  the  outcome  of  that
investigation  SEBI  comes  to  know  that  there
is  sufficient  material  which  in  its  opinion  is
good  enough  to  resort  to  the  measures
contemplated  in  clause  (a)  to  (e)  of  the
subsection  (4)  of  section  11  of  SEBI  Act,  it
can  do  so  against  such  person.  Further,  the
Hon’ble  Court  held  that  the  investigation  is
not  against  a  ‘person’  rather  it  is  against  a
‘transaction’, 
is
empowered  to  undertake  investigation.

in  which  case  SEBI 

Further, the petitioners had proposed to
submit  an  undertaking  that  they  will  not
participate in the ensuing IPOs and they will
not  be  dealing  with  105  securities.  In  this
regard,  Hon’ble  High  Court  concurred  with
SEBI’s  stand  that  SEBI  is  open  to  revise,
review, modify, and even in case of necessity,
ready to recall the order, if the person against
whom  the  order  is  passed  approaches  SEBI
and  satisfies  SEBI  about  one’s  bona  fides.  The
Hon’ble  Court  held  that  interim  injunction
obtained  by  one  of  the  petitioners,  Shri
Soumil Bhavnagari stands vacated in view of
the  order  and  it  is  open  for  SEBI  to  file  a
separate application for restitution of the gain

verification of the materials and records
placed  before  the  Court,  the  petitioner,
has  approached  this  Court  instead  of
agitating  the  issues  before  SEBI  which
are  canvassed  before  this  Court,  and
filed the writ petition on hand invoking
jurisdiction  under  Article  226  of  the
Constitution,  which  is  premature  and
cannot be sustained.

b) Whether  SEBI  is  empowered  to  pass
interim  orders  and  that  too  through  its
Whole  Time  Member,  pending
adjudication of Show Cause notice :

The  court  held  that,  “when  CSX  is
regarded as a ‘State’ within the meaning
of  Article  12  of  the  Constitution  and
once  it  had  become  a  stock  exchange
under  the  control  of  SEBI,  it  could  be
superseded  by  an  order  made  under
SC(R)A  by  the  SEBI  under  the  powers
delegated  to  it  and  there  is  no  question
of  a  Stock  Exchange  ceasing  to  do  its
business  as 
such  by  unilateral
withdrawal of their licence”.

It  was  further  held  that,  “the  functions
of  the  Central  Government  under
SC(R)A  by  delegation  became  the
function  of  the  Board  under  Section
11(2)(i)  and  when  once  it  became  the
function  of  the  Board,  the  statute  itself
authorises  the  delegation  of  such
function  of  the  Board  under  Section  19
to  the  Chairman  or  its  officers.  Section
11(2)(a)  of  SEBI  Act  empowers  SEBI  to
regulate  the  business  of  the  stock
exchanges  and  any  other  securities
market  and  this  specific  power  vested
with SEBI enables it to pass appropriate
directions  to  the  stock  exchanges.
Exercise  of  such  power  by  SEBI  is
further  complimented  by  the  provisions
of  SC(R)A.  In  view  of  such  powers
available  under  the  SEBI  Act,  the
impugned  show  cause  notice  has  been

received  by  the  petitioner  by  virtue  of  the
interim  injunction.

The  Hon’ble  High  Court  also  opined
that  “SEBI  having  deemed  fit  has  passed  the
order,  it  has  passed  the  order,  being  expert
on  the  subject.  It  is  for  the  expert  to  decide
as  to  which,  out  of  the  available  courses,
which  course  is  to  be  adopted.  This  Court
will  not  only  be  slow  but  will  not  like  to
interfere  in  the  discretion  exercised  by  an
expert on the subject. ”

ii. W.P.  No.  11557  of  2006  -  Coimbatore
Stock  Exchange  (CSX)  vs.  SEBI  -
Madras High Court

The  petitioners  had  filed  the  above  writ
petition against the order dated April 17, 2006
passed by SEBI giving directions to the effect
that  (i)  Coimbatore  Stock  Exchange  (CSX)  is
restrained from transferring or alienating any
movable  or  immovable  property  of  the
exchange  in  any  manner,  (ii)  the  day-to-day
functioning  of  CSX  would  be  undertaken  by
a three member Committee consisting of Shri
V. Selvaraj, SEBI Nominee Director/ROC, Shri
C.A. Venkatesan and Shri K.R. Raman, Public
Representative  Directors,  and  (iii)  the  said
Committee  is  authorised  to  make  such
expenditures  and  operate  the  bank  accounts
of CSX and as such, the same was upheld by
the  Court  and  the  writ  petition  was
dismissed.

The Hon’ble High Court held that:

a) Whether  a  Writ  Petition  is  Maintainable

against a Show Cause Notice :

The court held that there is no total lack
of jurisdiction in the issuance of the said
show  cause  notice  and  even  the  facts
canvassed  one  way  or  the  other  would
only  relate  to  the  limits  on  the  exercise
of  power  which  will  not  warrant  any
interference  at  the  threshold.  Therefore,
in  the  given  circumstances  and  in  view
of  the  power  exercised  by  SEBI  and  on

117

Annual Report 2006-07

passed  by  a  whole  time  member  on
behalf  of  the  Board  and  therefore,  SEBI
has  got  the  necessary  power  under  the
SEBI  Act  to  pass  interim  order  pending
adjudication  of  the  show  cause  notice
and  the  impugned  order  signed  by  a
whole time member can be sustained.”

c) Whether  voluntary  surrender  of

recognition by CSX is permissible :

The Hon’ble High Court held that in the
absence  of  any  provision  under  the
SC(R)A,  voluntary 
surrender  of
recognition,  as  resolved  by  CSX  in  its
EGM, is contrary to law as it is clear that
CSX  has  resorted  to  this  action  only  in
order  to  wriggle  itself  out  of  the
statutory  obligations  under  SC(R)A  and
SEBI  Act,  for  compliance  of  certain
observations  and  to  answer  the  various
issues  raised  by  SEBI  for  the  proper
management  and  control  of  CSX
involving great extent of public interest.

iii. W.P.  No.  15065  of  2006  -  M/s  Integral
Finvest  (P)  Limited  vs  SEBI  &  Others
– High Court of Delhi

The  petitioner  had  entered  into  a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with
the  fourth  respondent,  in  furtherance  of  the
agreement  to  purchase  the  shareholding
offered  by  respondent  number 
four
(Chairman/Managing  Director  of  Indo  Gulf
Industries  Ltd.)  and  to  take  over  the  control
and management of the third respondent (M/
s  Indo  Gulf  Industries  Ltd.)  Company.
Accordingly,  the  petitioner  issued  a  cheque
for  a  sum  of  Rs.25  lakh  in  this  regard.
However, knowing the intention of the fourth
respondent,  through  certain  news  items
appearing  in  certain  reputed  newspapers,
divested  the  entire  share  holding  of
respondent  number  three  in  favour  of  M/s
Balrampur  Chini  Mills  Ltd.  In  the  above
circumstances,  the  petitioner  preferred

Original  Miscellaneous  Petition  417/2006
before  the  Delhi  High  Court  under  section  9
of  the  Arbitration  and  Conciliation  Act  for
restraining  respondent  number  three  from
selling/entering  into/  implementing  any
agreement  pertaining  to  the  sale  of  equity
shares,  for  executing  any  share  transfer  of
equity  shares  and  registering  transfer  of
shares. The petitioner also got an order from
the  Hon’ble  Delhi  High  Court  vide,  dated
September  08,  2006,  whereby  respondents
three  and  four  were  directed  to  maintain
status quo with respect to the share holdings
of  respondent  number  four  and  his  relatives
or  group  companies  till  September  29,  2006.
However,  on  September  13,  2006,  the
petitioner  came  to  know  of  the  public
announcement  of  respondent  number  three
in  respect  of  which  there  was  an  order  of
status  quo.  Vide  letter  dated  September  14,
2006  petitioner  requested  SEBI  and  other
respondents 
the  public
announcement from its official website within
48  hours  of  receipt  of  notice.  However,
respondent  number  one  and  two  continued
the  publication  of 
the  said  public
announcement.  Aggrieved  by  the  above,  the
petitioner approached the Delhi High Court.

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

 No  statutory  provision  of  SEBI  Act  or
the Rules framed there under or the DIP
Guidelines confers a right of lodging the
complaint  before  SEBI  by  a  person  who
feels  aggrieved  as  a  consequence  of
prospectus  being 
issued.  Also,
provisions  of  SEBI  Act,  or  the  Rules
framed  there  under,  or  the  DIP
Guidelines  do  not  cast  a  duty  on  SEBI
to consider any such complaint objecting
the issuance of prospectus/letter of offer,
which is not a statutory complaint.



their  apprehension 

It  is  not  the  case  of  the  petitioners  that
they applied pursuant to the prospectus
and  are  likely  to  suffer  a  prejudice.  It  is
merely 
that
consequent  to  and  acting  upon  the
contents  of  the  prospectus  of  GIEPL,  a
future  investor  might  be  duped  and
cheated.  The  Court  held  that  allegation
of  suffering  legal  injury  without  a  legal
right  is  ill-conceived.

The  Hon’ble  High  Court  also  held  that
“SEBI  which  is  required  to  discharge  duties
and  perform  functions  within  the  four
corners  of  the  said  (SEBI)  Act,  and  the  said
Rules framed there under and the guidelines
is  not  obliged  to  take  into  consideration  any
and  every  complaint  which  might  be  lodged
with  it,  objecting  to  prospectus  /offer  letter
of  public  issue”.  Upon  receipt  of  complaint
containing  a  prayer  to  investigate,  which  is
not  made  in  exercise  of  any  legal  right,  it
would  entirely  be  the  discretion  of  SEBI  to
consider  the  same  whether  to  initiate
investigation  or  not.

(GIEPL  which  was  respondent  number

In  this  complaint  the  petitioner  had
prayed  before  SEBI  to  restrain  GIEPL
from  accessing  the  securities  market
through  its  prospectus.  The  petitioner
had  alleged  that  the  company  had
suppressed  relevant 
its
prospectus  and  statements  contained
therein  are  false,  which  would  mislead

For  maintaining  the  petition,  the

Courts  withdrew  their  Writ  Petitions.
However,  the  petitioners  before  the  Gujarat
High  Court  (218  Petitioners)  continued
contesting the cases filed by them.

After  hearing  extensive  arguments,  the
Hon’ble Gujarat High Court dismissed all the
218 Writ Petitions by a common order passed
in September 2006 holding that:

a)

Even though the petitioners were earlier
exempted  from  the  requirements  of
Amendment  Regulations  of  2003,  for
certain  reasons,  when  SEBI  as  an  expert
body had taken a decision to remove the
exemption,  it  cannot  be  challenged.  The
decision  to  treat  all  sub-brokers  equally
was  taken  by  SEBI  after  careful
consideration.  Applying  the  principle
laid down by Supreme Court in Peerless
Case,  it  was  held  that  experimentation
of  economic  legislation  should  best  be
left  to  the  executive  unless  found  to  be
unrealistic  or  manifestly  arbitrary.

that 

the  sense 

b) Court cannot declare a Regulation to be
ultra  vires  merely  on  the  ground  that  in
view  of  the  court,  the  impugned
provisions  will  not  help  to  serve  the
object  and  the  purpose  of  the  Act.  So
long  as  the  delegate  acts  within  the
scope  of  the  authority  conferred  on  it,
in 
the  Rules  or
Regulations  made  by  it  have  a  rational
nexus with the object and purpose of the
statute,  the  court  should  not  concern
itself with the wisdom or efficaciousness
of  such  Rules  or  Regulations.  It  is
exclusively  within  the  province  of  the
legislature and its delegate to determine,
as a matter of policy, how the provisions
of  the  Statute  can  best  be  implemented
and  what  measures,  substantive  as  well
as  procedural  would  have  to  be
incorporated in the Rules or Regulations
for  the  efficacious  achievement  of  the
objects and purposes of the Act.

c)

d)

The  petitioners  being  sub-brokers  of
subsidiaries  cannot  be  considered  as  a
separate  class  apart  from  other  sub-
brokers.  Merely,  because  some  special
benefits  were  given  earlier  and  /  or  it
was under contemplation, the petitioners
cannot  be  said  to  be  of  a  class  by
themselves.

Looking to the prevailing situation at the
relevant  time,  if  some  benefits  were
given  and  /  or  all  the  sub-brokers  are
treated  at  par,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the
action  /  decision  of  SEBI  is  wholly
arbitrary and / or illegal and /or contrary
to  statutory  provisions.

e) Model  bye-laws  have  not  still  become
effective  and  any  argument  based
thereon cannot assist the petitioners.

f)

The  court  cannot  direct  exchanges  to
make  a  particular  bye-law  on  lines  on
Model  bye-laws  by  sitting  as  Appellate

Part Four: Regulatory Changes

“……..the  concept  of  a  fit  and  proper
person  has  a  very  wide  amplitude  as  the
name “fit and proper person” itself suggests.
The  Board  can  take  into  account  “any
consideration as it deems fit” for the purpose
of  determining  whether  an  applicant  or  an
intermediary  seeking  registration  is  a  fit  and
proper  person  or  not………It  can  take  into
account the financial integrity of the applicant
and  its  competence.  Absence  of  convictions
or  civil  liabilities  would  be  another  relevant
consideration  which  could  weigh  with  the
Board.  Good  reputation  and  character  of  the
applicant  is  a  very  material  consideration
which  must  necessarily  weigh  in  the  mind
of the Board in this regard. Reputation……..is
the subjective opinion or impression of others
about  a  person  and  that,  according  to  the
Regulations, has to be good. This impression
or  opinion  is  generally  formed  on  the  basis
of  the  association  he  has  with  others  and/or
on  the  basis  of  his  past  conduct. A  person  is
known by the company he keeps. In the very
nature  of  things,  there  cannot  be  any  direct
evidence  in  regard  to  the  reputation  of  a
person whether he is an individual or a body
corporate.  In  the  case  of  a  body  corporate  or
a  firm,  the  reputation  of  its  whole  time
director(s)  or  managing  partner(s)  would
come  into  focus.  …….  It  is  in  the  discharge
of this statutory obligation that the Board has
framed  the  Regulations  with  a  view  to  keep
the  market  place  safe  for  the  investors  to
invest  by  keeping  the  undesirable  elements
out.  The  Regulations  apply  across  to  all  sets
of  Regulations  and  all  intermediaries  of  the
securities  market  including  those  who
associate  themselves  with  the  market  and
they all have to satisfy the criteria of “fit and
proper  person”  before  they  could  be
registered  under  any  of  the  relevant
Regulations  and  this  criteria  they  must
continue  to  satisfy  throughout  the  period  of
validity  of  their  registration  and  throughout
the period they associate with the market. ”

Authority  over  decision  of  an  expert
body.

g) Referring to the decision of the Supreme
Court in Khoday Distilleries, it held that
any concession granted by the State is a
matter  of  policy.  The  absence  of
availability  of  such  a  concession  cannot
make  the  Rules  arbitrary  or  violative  of
Article 14.

h) Referring to the decision of the Supreme
Court  in  Prafulla  Kumar  Das,  it  held
that  mere  hardship  cannot  be  a  ground
for striking down valid legislation.

Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled
to  any  relief,  more  so  in  the  absence  of
any challenge to the SEBI (Stock Brokers

The circular has since been implemented
for all subsidiaries and their sub-brokers.

III. Securities  Appellate  Tribunal

i.

Appeal  No.  21  of  2006-  Jermyn  Capital
LLC vs. SEBI

Jermyn  Capital  LLC,  a  limited  liability
company  incorporated  in  Dubai,  is  a  FII
registered  with  SEBI  as  a  foreign  corporate
sub-account  of  Taib  Bank  EC.  SEBI  had
passed  an  interim  order  dated  January  13,
2006 restraining the appellant from accessing
the  capital  market  pending  investigations
since  prima  facie  it  did  not  satisfy  the  criteria
of  ‘fit  and  proper  person’,  in  view  of  close
links  between  the  appellant  and  its  associate
Jerymyn  Capital  Partners  Plc  through
Dharmesh Doshi and Ketan Parekh who were
facing  various  criminal  proceedings.  The
Hon’ble  SAT  by  an  order  dated  September
06,  2006  dismissed  the  appeal  holding  that
the  appellant  is  not  a  fit  and  proper  person.
While  upholding  the  order  of  SEBI,  the
Hon’ble  SAT  explained  the  scope  of  fit  and
proper person criteria, as under:

ii. Appeal  No.  92  of  2001  -  Karvy  Stock

iii. Appeal  No.  158  of  2004  -  Mangalore

Broking Limited vs. SEBI

Stock Exchange (MgSE) vs. SEBI

SEBI  conducted  investigations  on  the
irregularities in IPOs, which came up during
2003-05.  The  investigations  revealed  opening
of  large  scale  fictitious  benami  accounts  by
certain  financiers  and  key  operators,  in
concert with market intermediaries, to corner
shares  meant  for  retail  investors.  SEBI  vide
ex-parte  order  dated April  27,  2006  directed,
amongst others, Karvy Stock Broking Limited
not to act as a depository participant pending
inquiry  and  passing  of  final  orders,  except
for  acting  on  the  instructions  of  existing
beneficial owners. It was further directed not
to  undertake  any  proprietary  trades  in
securities  till  passing  of  the  final  order.  The
ex-parte  order  was  confirmed  vide  order
dated  May  26,  2006.  The  subject  appeal  was
filed  challenging  the  order  passed  by  SEBI
raising  various  contentions  on  legal  and
factual  issues.

SAT  while  upholding  SEBI’s  order,
examined  as  to  whether  a  separate  enquiry
under  Section  11B  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  was  a
prerequisite  for  passing  order,  under  Section
11B.  Hon’ble  SAT  interpreted,  the  words,
‘investigation’  and  ‘enquiry’  which  are
conducted by SEBI. It held that interim order
can  be  passed  pending  enquiry  and
investigation.  The  word  ‘investigation’  used
in  Section  11(4)  of  SEBI  Act  was  interpreted
as  the  investigation  ordered  under  Section
11C  of  SEBI  Act.  SAT  further  held  that
enquiry  envisaged  under  Section  11(4)  also
includes  the  enquiry  conducted  under
Sections 11, 11B, 11D, and 15I and under SEBI
(Procedure  for  Holding  Inquiry  by  Enquiry
Officer  and  Imposing  Penalty)  Regulations,
2002. SAT further held that interim order can
be  passed  pending  enquiry  or  Investigation.
It  also  held  that  even  suspension  of  an
intermediary  is  envisaged  under  Section
11(1) /11B.

This  appeal  is  against  the  order  passed
by  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India
on August  31,  2004  under  section  4(4)  of  the
Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act,  1956
(SC(R)A)  refusing  to  grant  renewal  of
recognition of the (MgSE).

During  the  hearing,  SAT  directed  that
as time was not really the essence looking to
the  nature  of  suggestions/shortcomings
pointed  out  by  SEBI,  it  should  conduct
another  inspection  and  report  the  matter  to
the  Tribunal  within  a  period  of  three  to  four
months.  SEBI  carried  out  the  inspection  of
MgSE  from  May  31  to  June  03,  2006  and  the
report  was  sent  to  MgSE,  which  was
presented before the Tribunal.

SAT  in  its  final  order  held  that  “a  stock
exchange  to  be  effective  and  useful  to  the
investing  public  must  have  modern  and  up-
to-date  hardware  and  software  systems
installed  in  it.  It  is  almost  impossible  to
operate without the assistance of adequate IT
infrastructure.  Similarly,  the  maintenance  of
Settlement  Guarantee  Fund  was  essential  for
the security of trades being transacted on the
platform  of  the  stock  exchange  and  for  the
safety  of  the  exchange  system  itself.  It  is
impossible  to  think  of  trades  without
connectivity with the depositories when these
days  almost  entire  trade  is  done  in  demat
form and the settlement period is T+2.” It also
held  that  a  stock  exchange  which  has  only
three  active  trading  members  and  total
members  being  reduced  to  54  would  not
make it as a viable unit. SAT further observed
that  the  members  are  dwindling  year  after
year  as  at  the  time  of  pervious  inspection
there  were  69  members  in  the  exchange
which  has  come  down  to  54,  and  there  were
no new admissions of members.

SAT held that the appellant has to satisfy
SEBI  that  it  has  addressed  all  the  concerns

upheld  the  findings  of  the  Board  so  far  as
the violation of Regulation 7 is concerned.

vi. Appeal  No.  207  of  2005  -  National

Securities Depository Ltd. vs. SEBI

SEBI  noticed  that  depositories  and  their
participants were levying transaction charges
on  the  beneficial  owners  (investors)  when
they  transferred  their  demat  securities  from
one  participant  to  another,  even  while  not
collecting  any  account  closure  charges.  SEBI
noted  that  the  implication  of  such  charge  is
that  even  an  investor  dissatisfied  with
services  of  his  DP  will  be  able  to  move  his
BO account to another DP only at a cost. The
Board  then  decided  to  free  the  investors  of
this  cost  and  issued  circular  no.MRD/DOP/
DEP/CIR-22/05  dated  November  09,  2005
whereby  the  two  depositories  and  their
participants  were  directed  not  to  levy  any
charges  when  the  beneficial  owner  transfers
all  the  securities  lying  in  his  account  to
another participant of the same depository or
the other depository.

The  said  circular  was  challenged  by  the
appellant before Securities Appellate Tribunal
(SAT) on various grounds, including:







The appellant is a company formed with
object  of  profit  making  through
commercial  operations.

Even  shifting  of  account  amounts  to  a
transaction,  for  which  expenses  are
incurred  and  therefore  charges  have  to
be levied.

Their  system  does  not  distinguish
between  transfer  on  shifting  to  another
participant  and  normal  transaction  on
account of sale or purchase.

Upholding  the  impugned  circular  and
dismissing the appeal, the SAT observed that
the  situation  prevailing  prior  to  the  issuance
of  circular  was  working  to  the  detriment  to
the interest of investors, despite poor services;
the  beneficial  owner  was  discouraged  from

as  pointed  out  in  the  inspection  reports
before  it  could  be  allowed  the  renewal  of
recognition. SAT, observing that the appellant
is  free  to  apply  afresh  for  the  recognition  of
the  stock  exchange  after  fulfilling  all  the
requirements,  held  that  there  is  no  reason  to
interfere with the impugned order.

iv. Appeal  Nos.  2  to  10  of  2004  -  in  the
Matter  of  Ketan  Parekh  Upheld  the
Order of SEBI

Vide  order  dated  December  12,  2003,
SEBI,  in  exercise  of  powers  conferred  upon
it under sections 11B and 11(4)(b) of SEBI Act
read  with  Regulations  11  and  13  of  SEBI
(Prohibition  of  Fradulent  and  Unfair  Trade
Practices  relating  to  Securities  Markets)
Regulations,  2003  had  prohibited  Ketan  V
Parekh,  Kartik  K  Parekh,  Classic  Credit  Ltd.,
Panther  Fincap  and  Mgmnt.  Services  Ltd.,
Luminant  Investment  Ltd.,  Chitrakut
Computers  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Saimangal  Investrade
LTd.,  Classic  Infin,  and  Panther  Investrade
Ltd.,  (K.P.  entities)  from  buying,  selling  or
dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner,  directly
or  indirectly.  SEBI  had  also  debarred  them
from  associating  with  the  securities  market
for a period of 14 years.

SAT  vide  order  dated  July  14,  2006
dismissed appeal in toto. While dismissing the
appeal SAT observed that the appellants had
rigged the market in a big way and the penalty
imposed on them is quiet reasonable having
regard to the gravity of the charges proved.

v. Appeal  Nos.  68  to  73  in  the  Matter  of
Adjudication  against  the  Entities
Connected/Controlled by Ketan Parekh

Vide  order  dated  April  22,  2003  the
Adjudication  Officer  imposed  a  monetary
penalty  of  Rs. 1.5  lakh  for  the  violation  of
Regulations  7(1)  and  (2)  of  the  Takeover
Regulations.

SAT vide order dated December 08, 2006

Annual Report 2006-07

changing  his  depository  and  participant
because  he  had  to  pay  for  the  change.  SAT
further  observed  that  it  does  not  stand  to
reason  as  to  a  dissatisfied  customer  to  pay
for  exiting.  SAT  further  observed  that  the
circular  will  lead  to  competition  among  the
depositories  and  their  participants  will
compete  with  each  other  to  render  better
services,  so  as  to  retain  their  clientele.  SAT,
therefore,  concluded  that  the  impugned
circular  was  for  the  benefit  of  interest  of
investors and no fault can be found with it.

vii. Appeal  No.  96  of  2006  -  Bank  of

Rajasthan vs. SEBI & Others

An  appeal  was  filed  by  Bank  of
Rajasthan  challenging  the  letter  dated  June
22,  2006  issued  by  SEBI  informing  the  BSE
that  allotment  of  90  lakh  shares  by  the
appellant  against  warrants,  conversion  of
which has not been exercised and which have
consequently  lapsed,  would  amount  to  fresh
issuance  of  shares  and  hence  would  amount
to  preferential  allotment  of  shares  and  that
the  price  in  respect  of  such  shares  would  be
required  to  be  determined  as  per  the  pricing
provisions  contained  in  SEBI  Preferential
Offer  Guidelines.

Issue  before  the  SAT  was  whether  the
allotment  of  90  lakh  shares  by  the Appellant
to its promoters was under sub-section (1) or
sub-section  (1A)  of  the  Section  81  of  the
Companies  Act  because  above-mentioned
guideline  is  applicable  only  to  an  allotment
made under section 81(1A) of the Companies
Act  and  not  for  the  one  made  under  section
81 (1) (d) of the Act.

The  Hon’ble  SAT  vide  order  dated

October 17, 2006 held that:

a)

b)

The offer to subscribe to warrants which
could be converted into equity shares in
future  were  not  shares  per  se  and  that
Section 81 of the Companies Act applies
only to shares and not to warrants.

The  allotment  to  90  lakh  shares  to  the
promoters  was  not  only  a  fresh
allotment  but  was  also  made  under
section  81  (1A)  of  the  Companies  Act.
The  procedure  under  Section  81  (1)  had
not been followed qua these shares and,
therefore,  it  cannot  beheld  that  the
allotment  was  made  under  Section
81(1)(d) of the Companies Act.
