Promotion of official language was a key
area  of  attention  of  the  Board.  Under  the
direction  of  the  Board,  SEBI  has  been
consistently making efforts for the protection,
education and awareness of the investors and
facilitating  the  availability  of  published
information on capital market in the simplest
way to the retail investors in Hindi as well as
in the regional languages.

As  a  step  forward  in  the  direction  of
implementation  of  the  Official  Language
Policy,  the  year  2002-03  and  2003-04  were
fully  dedicated  as  Official  Language
Awareness  Year  and  Official  Language
Implementation  Year,  respectively.  The  year
2004-05 was earmarked as Official Language
Compliance  Year.  During  the  year,  the
employees of the Board were not only made
aware of the various aspects related to official
language compliance, but also provided with
various  types  of  facilities  like  training,
infrastructure  and  software  which  facilitated
the discharge of day-to-day work in Hindi. In
the  series  of  important  publications  brought
out  by  the  Board  in  the  official  language,  a
new  book  titled  “Vidhi  Karya  Margdarshika”
was  launched  in  CD-ROM.  It  would  play  an
important role in discharge of regulatory work
in  Hindi.  The  Board  has  come  out  with  a
house  magazine  “Viniyamika”  in  Hindi.  The
first  issue  of  the  magazine  has  been  well

Knowledge Management
A  collaboration  suite  was  implemented
to  enable  the  organisation  to  build  up  a
knowledge base over a period of time which

the  teams  working  at  different  locations  to
collaborate  and  work  effectively  on  a  single
project.

II. Electronic Workflow

As  a  part  of  less  paper  office  initiative,
the electronic workflow is being implemented,

keep  track  of  all  files  in  an  electronic  form
which can be accessible from anywhere.

Implementation
To enhance the role of technology as an
enabler  of  business,  Human  Resource
Management Systems (HRMS) and financial

put in place.

as  the  main  driver  of  business,  SEBI  is  in

IOSCO’s  Presidents  Committee,
represented  by  all  IOSCO  members,
endorsed  and  adopted  Principles  on
Client  Identification  and  Beneficial
Ownership  for  the  Securities  Industry.
The adoption represents the commitment
of  the  global  community  of  securities
regulators  to  robust  standards  of  client
identification for the securities market.

IOSCO announced a new feature avail-
able  to  its  members  on  its  internet
website  –  an  electronic,  interactive  ver-
sion  of  the  already  endorsed 
IOSCO
Methodology for Assessing Implementa-
tion  of  the  IOSCO  Objectives  and  Prin-
ciples  of  Securities  Regulation
(Assessment  Methodology).  The
electronic  version  was  intended  to
facilitate  IOSCO  members’  self-assess-
ments  and  third-party  assessments  of
securities market regulatory regimes.

IOSCO  in  collaboration  with  the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision and
the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors  examined  the  progress
made  by  the  financial  firms  in  adopting
the  recommendations  contained  in  the
report  on  Financial  Disclosure  in  the
Banking,  Insurance  and  Securities
Sectors: Issues and Analysis.

The  Executive  Committee  of  IOSCO
established  an 
Islamic  Capital  Market
Task Force to undertake a fact-gathering
exercise  to  assess  the  extent  of  the
development  and  potential  regulatory
issues.  The  study  was  an  information
document  that  details  the  landscape  of
the Islamic financial services industry in
general and broadly highlights key issues
concerning the Islamic capital market.

IOSCO also gave updates on Regulation
of  Secondary  Market  Regulation  of

Market Intermediaries, Enforcement and
Exchange  of  Information,  Collective
Investment  Schemes  and  Asset
Management.

The  SRO  Consultative  Committee  of
IOSCO issued a report on The Function
of Compliance Officer – Study on What
the  Regulations  of  the  Members’
Jurisdictions Provide for the Function of
Compliance  Officer,  which  states  that
compliance  officers  are  responsible  for
the oversight of a firm’s compliance with
applicable rules and regulations.

The  Emerging  Markets  Committee  of
IOSCO  conducted  a  survey  on
accounting  review  and  enforcement
mechanisms  in  emerging  markets,  the
results  of  which  were  reviewed  by  the
Committee in Amman.

The  Emerging  Markets  Committee  of
IOSCO had also undertaken a survey on
enforcement  aspects  of  takeover
regulations 
in  emerging  market
jurisdictions. The Committee reviewed a
preliminary  draft  report  on  the  survey
results.

The  Annual  Conference  also  discussed
the  key  current  regulatory  issues  like
New  Challenges  in  the  Regulation  of
CIS,  International  Convergence  and
Public  Oversight  of  Accounting  and
Auditing Standards, Recent Evolution in
Securities  Market  Price  Formation
Mechanism  and  Mergers,  Demutuali-
sation  and  Governance  of  Securities
Exchanges.

III. Recommendation for Central

Counterparties

The central counter party (CCP) reduces
the  risk  faced  by  its  participants  and  brings
in  financial  stability.  It  concentrates  on  risks

Part Five: Organisational Matters

and responsibilities for risk management and
must  have  a  well  designed  and  well
standardised  risk  control  and  also  adequate
financial resources.

A Task Force, jointly established by the
Technical  Committee  of  the  IOSCO  and  the
Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement
Systems  (CPSS)  published  a  report  in
November 2004, which sets out comprehen-
sive standards for risk management of a CCP.

It covers recommendations for legal risk,
participation requirements, measurement and
management  of  credit  exposures,  margin
requirements,  financial  resources,  defaults
procedures,  custody  and  investment  risks,
operational risks, money settlements, physical
deliveries,  risks  in  links  between  CCPs,
efficiency,  governance, 
transparency,
regulation and oversight.

Many  financial  institutions  are  willing  to
act as a central counter party with their strong
financial  resources  and  the  availability  of
skilled  human  resources.  The  above
recommendations  will  help  them  to  assess
their  stand  in  comparison  to  the  standards
recommended.

IV.

International Initiatives

SEBI  continued  to  espouse  the  cause
of  efficacious  development  of  transparent,
efficient  and  investor  friendly  securities
markets  at  various  international  fora.  In  this
regard,  Asia  Pacific  Regional  Committee
(APRC)  in  its  meeting  held  in  Singapore
requested  SEBI  to  lead  a  Committee  of
Chairs  to  promote  the  smooth  adoption  and
implementation  of  IOSCO  Standards  and
Objectives.  SEBI  has  requested  other
jurisdictions to be part of the Committee which
would be working on the project.

SEBI has also been associated with the
APRC initiative on Capacity Building. The aim
of  this  initiative  is  to  identify  the  needs  and
the  expertise  of  APRC  members  to  enable
the pooling of resources to develop capacity
in relation to the regulatory functions of APRC
Members. The following are the members of
Committee of Chairs on Capacity Building:









Securities Commission, Malaysia (Chair),

Securities and Exchange Board of India,

Australian  Securities  and  Investments
Commission, and

The Monetary Authority of Singapore.

As part of the capacity building initiative,
number of jurisdictions has enquired about the
possibility  of  SEBI  providing  necessary
assistance  &  training  for  developing  their
regulatory  framework.  Bahrain  Monetary
Authority,  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  of  Vietnam,  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission,  Sri  Lanka  and
Securities  Exchange  Board  of  Nepal  have
requested SEBI to depute officers to provide
technical assistance in developing regulatory
framework.  SEBI  has  already  deputed  two
officers  each  to  Bahrain  Monetary  Authority
and Capital Markets Authority of Oman.

7. PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE

The  Parliamentary  Committee  on
Subordinate  Legislation,  Rajya  Sabha  under
the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  A.  Vijayaraghavan
held a meeting with the Whole Time Members
and  other  senior  officials  of  the  Board  at

made  by  the  Hon’ble  Committee  for  certain
amendments to SEBI (Procedure for Holding
Enquiry  by  Enquiry  Officer  and  Imposing
Penalty) Regulations, 2002 have since been
accepted and implemented by SEBI.
