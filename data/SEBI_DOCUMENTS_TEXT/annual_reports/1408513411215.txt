SEBI  Annual  Report 

 
The  Annual  Report  of  the  Securities 
and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  for 
2013-14  reviews  significant  developments 
in  securities  markets  in  the  backdrop  of  an 
unprecedented  spell  of  financial  turbulence 
transmitted by the tapering concerns, and the 
subsequent restoration of normalcy in macro-
economic  fundamentals.  Indian  economy 
and  financial  markets  came  under  acute 
stress  by  the  turmoil  in  the  global  financial 
markets generated by the US Federal Reserve 
announcements  on  tapering.  However  with 
a  swift  and  decisive  policy  response,  India 
was able to minimise the fallout on the real 
economy and maintained financial stability.
 
for  2013-14 
articulates  the  policies  and  programmes 
embarked  during  the  financial  year  while 
ensuring  to  fulfill  its  stated  objective  to 
strengthen the Indian regulatory framework 
of  capital  markets.  This  report  has  been 
prepared  as  per  the  format  prescribed  by 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India 
(Annual Report) Rules, 1994. SEBI continued 
to  pursue  its  endeavour  to  achieve  the 
three statutory objectives viz. (a) protection 
of  the  interests  of  investors  in  securities, 
(b)  promotion  of  the  development  of  the 
securities  market  and  (c)  regulation  of  the 
securities market.
 
In 2013-14, SEBI continued to channelise 
its  efforts  to  achieve  these  objectives  by 
reviewing  its  policies,  implementing  fresh 
initiatives,  disciplining  the  market  through  a 
variety  of  appropriate  enforcement  actions, 
facilitating redressal of grievances of investors 
and nurturing a security culture for the orderly 
and expansive growth of capital market. The 
major  policy  issues  are  discussed  in  public 
domain  through  discussion  papers  to  ensure 
transparency,  efficiency,  fairness,  safety  and 
integrity  of  the  capital  market.  The  various 

1

quasi-judicial  orders  passed  by  the  Board 
during the year are also posted on the website.
 
In  line  with  the  stated  objectives,  this 
Report  provides  the  manner  in  which  SEBI 
discharged its responsibilities and exercised 
its powers during the year in furtherance of 
the objectives enshrined in (a) the Securities 
and  Exchange  Board  of  India  Act,  1992,  (b) 
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act, 
1956 (c) the Depositories Act, 1996 and (d) the 
relevant  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act, 
and newly enacted Companies Act, 2013. It 
also covers the global developments relevant 
to the Indian securities market.

1.  REVIEW  OF  THE  GENERAL 
ENVIRONMENT 
INVESTMENT 

ECONOMIC 
AND 
CLIMATE
After  the  recovery  of  global  economic 
 
conditions 
the  current 
financial  year  unfolded  an  unprecedented 
stress  to  Indian  economy  and  markets.  The 
tightening  of  global 
increased 
external pressures and heightened the focus 
on  India’s  macroeconomic  imbalances  viz., 
high inflation, large current account and fiscal 
deficits and structural weaknesses particularly 
supply  bottlenecks  in  infrastructure,  power 
and  mining.  The  impact  of  US  Federal 
Reserve’s May 2013 announcement on Indian 
financial markets was one of the most severe 
amongst  emerging  markets  with  the  rupee 
depreciation weighing on the stock market, 
foreign outflows from the debt market further 
aggravating the forex markets and impacting 
yields  as  also  the  equity  market.  Thus,  the 
global  developments  since  May  2013  have 
brought  to  the  fore  not  just  the  stress  in 
the  financial  markets  and  asset  prices,  but 
also  their  impact  on  other  macroeconomic 
parameters, including growth, public finances 

in  the  advanced  economies  mainly  due  to 
less  favourable  external  environment  and 
country specific concerns like high inflation 
and wide current account deficit producing 
weak 
investor  sentiments  for  emerging 
markets.

I.  Growth

 
The Indian economy, which witnessed 
a  slowdown  after  a  robust  growth  of  over 
8 percent in 2010-11, troughed to a decadal 
low  rate  of  4.5  percent  in  2012-13  and  the 
provisional  estimate  stood  at  a  marginal 
high  of  4.7  percent  in  2013-14.  As  per  the 
provisional  estimates  of  Central  Statistical 
Office (CSO), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
at factor cost at constant (2004-05) prices in 
the year 2013-14 is `57,41,791 crore, as against 
the first revised estimate of GDP for the year 
2012-13 of `54,82,111 crore (Table 1.1).
 
is 
expected to improve on the back of a reviving 
agriculture sector, with a growth rate of 4.7 
percent as compared to 1.4 percent in 2012-
13.  However,  Industry  which  recorded  a 
growth  of  0.9  percent  continues  to  dampen 
further over the previous year. Service sector 
continued  to  maintain  its  momentum  over 
the previous two years with a growth of 6.2 
percent  in  2013-14.  However,  sub-sectors 
trade,  hotels,  transport  and  communication 
recorded a sluggish growth of 3.0 percent in 
2013-14.

and  inflation,  as  also  financial  stability.  In 
the wake of intense exchange rate pressures, 
stabilisation  of  the  economy  by  restoring 
exchange  rate  stability  was  the  foremost 
task. A series of exceptional monetary policy 
actions were taken to tighten interest rates to 
siphon  off  liquidity,  to  restrain  the  current 
account  deficit  (CAD)  and  to  improve  its 
financing.  With  the  resultant 
improved 
stability  in  the  foreign  exchange  market, 
exceptional liquidity and monetary measures 
were normalised.
 
Having built the buffers in the interim, 
Indian  economy  and  markets  withstood 
the  December  2013  tapering  announcement 
better  than  its  emerging  market  peers.  In 
spite of the recent improvements in statistics, 
country faces a challenging macro-economic 
situation  with  growth  slowing  down, 
persistent  inflation  and  lingering  structural 
bottlenecks.
 
The growth concerns remain dominant 
for  Indian  economy  with  GDP  growth 
recording  below  5  percent 
for  seven 
successive  quarters  and  index  of  industrial 
production  (IIP)  growth  stagnating  for  two 
successive years. Even though the agriculture 
output and export performance strengthened, 
industrial  growth  continues  to  stagnate. 
The leading indicators of the services sector 
exhibited a mixed picture. During the year, 
growth picked up in emerging markets, but 
the momentum appeared to be weaker than

II.  Agriculture
 
and 
favourable  progress  of  Rabi  crops  sown 
in  the  current  financial  year  is  expected 
to  boost  growth  prospects  in  agriculture 
sector remarkably by 4.7 percent in 2013-14 
from that of 1.4 percent seen in 2012-13. The 
production of food grains is expected to rise 
by 5.6 percent in 2013-14, unlike the previous 
year when the production grew at 2.8 percent 
(Table  1.2).  However,  unseasonal  rains  and 
the  possible  effects  of  El  Nino  in  various 
parts of the country, makes the sector prone 
to  uncertainties  for  future  harvests.  In  this 
context,  the  ability  of  agriculture  sector  to 

meet increased food demand and mounting 
input prices poses a challenge.
 
Although  share  of  agriculture  in  the 
GDP accounts for approximately 14 percent 
since last three years, but it is still the main 
source of livelihood for majority of the rural 
population.  The  agricultural  growth  had 
accelerated  significantly  during  11th  five 
year  plan  with  an  average  growth  rate  of 
3.7  percent  as  opposed  to  the  achievement 
of 2.4 percent in the 10th five year plan. With 
new  structural  changes  taking  place  within 
the  sector,  the  12th  five  year  plan  (2012-17) 
maintained the growth target for agriculture 
at 4.0 percent.

III.  Industry
The prospects of industrial sector still 
 
remain  uncertain  with  negative  growth 
rate expected at 0.1 percent in 2013-14 from 
0.9  percent  as  observed  in  2012-13  (Table 
1.2).  Subdued 
investment  pattern  and 
low  consumption  demand,  encompassed 
by  dwindling  production  of 
capital 
goods  and  consumer  durables  resulted  in 
downfall  in  industrial  output.  Mining  and 
manufacturing  sector  continued  to  record 
a  downfall  similar  to  the  previous  fiscal 
year, in contrast to electricity sector which 
witnessed a significant growth of 6.1 percent 

in  2013-14  as  opposed  to  4.0  percent  in 
2012-13 (Table 1.3).
 
The  Index  of  Industrial  Production 
contracted  by  0.1  percent  in  2013-14  when 
compared  with  an  expansion  of  1.1  percent 
recorded  in  2012-13,  led  primarily  by  a 
slowdown  in  core  sector  growth,  which 
stood  at  2.6  percent  in  2013-14  as  against 
3.2 percent in 2012-13. This sluggishness, in 
part,  reflects  contraction  in  natural  gas  and 
crude oil production and slow growth in all 
other core industries, except electricity sector 
which continues to outpace the others in the 
year 2013-14.

Part One: Policies and Programmes

 
Mining  sector,  partly  accountable  for 
the overall contraction in industrial output, 
recorded a decline of 0.8 percent in 2013-14 
as  against  a  decline  of  2.3  percent  in  2012-
13.  The  sector  with  14.1  percent  weight 
in  IIP  continues  to  exhibit  weak  activity 
as  compared  to  other  sectors  of  the  IIP  on 
account  of  regulatory  and  environmental 
concerns (Table 1.3).
 
Manufacturing sector, which accounts 
for a significant 75.5 percent weight in IIP, 
witnessed  0.8  percent  contraction  in  the 
output  in  the  current  year  as  compared  to 
1.3 percent growth in 2012-13, highlighting 
the  weak  domestic  growth  impulses.  In 
2013-14,  the  number  of  sub-sectors  of  the 
manufacturing sector displaying contraction 
rose to 10 out of 22, including industries like 
radio,  TV  and  communication  equipment, 
rubber  and  plastics, 
fabricated  metal 
products  and  motor  vehicles.  In  terms  of 
Use-based  classification,  pace  of  growth 
of  intermediate  goods  output  rose  to  3.0 
percent  in  2013-14  from  1.6  percent  in 

recorded 

2012-13.  The  contraction 
in 
production of capital goods, a barometer of 
demand, eased to 3.7 percent 2013-14, from 
6.0  percent  in  the  previous  financial  year. 
In order to capture a better share in GDP, it 
is  indispensable  to  increase  manufacturing 
sector  growth  to  12-14  percent  over  the 
years  amidst  global  competitiveness  and 
sustainable  environment,  as  perceived  in 
the National Manufacturing Policy.
 
The  growth  of  electricity  generation 
improved to a robust 11.5 percent in February 
2014 as compared to previous months of the 
fiscal,  led  primarily  by  a  pickup  in  growth 
of  thermal  as  well  as  hydro  electricity 
generation. On the whole, the sector posted 
an improved growth of 6.1 percent in 2013-14 
as compared to 4.0 percent growth in 2012-13, 
continuing to outpace the other two sectors 
in  the  current  financial  year.  However,  the 
availability of electricity supply still remains 
an  area  of  concern,  particularly  in  rural 
areas  where  the  per  capita  consumption  of 
electricity is mere 8 units per month.

Annual Report 2013-14

IV.  Services
 
Services  sector  has  been  a  major 
contributor to India’s GDP and growth with 
a rising share of 67.3 percent in the GDP in 
2013-14  as  against  66.4  percent  in  2012-13. 
The  sector,  however,  is  expected  to  grow 
at  6.2  percent  in  2013-14,  similar  to  growth 
observed  in  2012-13  but  much  higher  than 
the other two sectors of the economy.
 
The  sector  with  high  growth  potential 
was largely hampered due to a tad increase 
of  3.0  percent  observed  in  ‘Trade,  Hotels, 
Transport and Communication’ sub -sector, 
as compared to 5.1 percent recorded in 2012-
13. Weak consumer confidence has impacted 
the  sale  of  passenger  cars,  commercial 
vehicles  and  three  wheelers.  Nonetheless, 
the  reduction  in  excise  duty  on  passenger 
vehicles and two wheelers, as announced in 
the interim budget for 2014-15, is expected to 
augur well for the sector.
 
‘Financing,  Insurance,  Real  Estate  and 
Business  Services’  sub-sector  has  further 
increased its share in GDP from 19.1 percent 
in 2012-13 to 20.3 percent in the current year. 
The  sub-sector  continues  to  outperform  the 
other  three  sub-sectors  while  recording  a 
growth  rate  of  12.9  percent  in  2013-14  as 
compared to 10.9 percent observed in 2012-
13. Construction sub sector, with 7.4 percent 
weight  in  GDP,  is  expected  to  grow  at  1.6 
percent  in  2013-14  as  against  1.1  percent 
recorded in the previous financial year.
‘Community,  Social  and  Personal 
 
Services’  sub-sector,  which  contributes  13.1 
percent share in GDP, is estimated to grow at 
5.6 percent in the current year, slightly higher 
than the growth rate of 5.3 percent achieved in 
2012-13. India’s services sector has emerged 
as a prominent sector over a decade in terms 
of  its  contribution  to  national  and  states 
incomes, FDI inflows and employment.

V.  Savings and Investments
 
As per the update of Central Statistical 
Office (CSO), India’s Gross Domestic Savings 
as  a  percentage  of  GDP  at  market  prices  is 
reflecting  a  downward  trend  since  2009-10, 
sliding further to 30.1 percent in 2012-13 from 
31.3  percent  in  2011-12.  The  decrease  came 
primarily  on  the  back  of  reduced  Private 
corporate  savings  from  7.3  percent  in  2011-
12  to  7.1  percent  in  2012-13  accompanied 
by  Household  savings  in  physical  assets 
moving from 15.8 percent in 2011-12 to 14.8 
percent in 2012-13, which may be attributed 
to  inflationary  pressures  experienced  by 
the  economy  for  most  of  the  year.  The 
mobilisation  of  financial  savings  impacted 
by  low  deposit  rates  in  the  face  of  high 
inflation saw a modest increase of 7.1 percent 
(as a percentage of GDP at market prices) in 
2012-13  from  7.0  percent  in  2011-12,  while 
Public sector savings as a percentage of GDP 
at market prices stood at 1.2 percent in 2012-
13 as well as in 2011-12. The investment too 
has seen a dwindling trend, declining to 34.8 
percent in 2012-13 from 35.5 percent in 2011-
12 and the peak of 36.5 percent recorded in 
2009-10 and 2010-11.
 
The expenditure side of GDP at market 
prices  indicates  that  the  aggregate  demand 
of  the  Indian  economy  during  the  year 
continued to remain weak even as net exports 
remained strong. Private final consumption 
expenditure, a principal component of GDP 
at  market  prices,  decelerated  from  17.9 
percent in 2011-12 to 12.3 percent in 2012-13 in 
absolute terms on account of low agricultural 
production and insistent high consumer price 
inflation. On the contrary, the growth rate of 
government  final  consumption  expenditure 
increased  marginally  from  15.3  percent  in 
2011-12  to  15.9  percent  in  2012-13  due  to 
fiscal consolidation.

Part One: Policies and Programmes

 
In  absolute  terms,  Gross  Domestic 
Savings at current prices in 2012-13 stood at 
`30,43,474 crore as against `28,24,459 crore in 
2011-12, registering a growth of 7.8 percent. 
The savings of household sector has increased 
by 7.7 percent from `20,54,737 crore in 2011-
12  to  `22,12,414  crore  in  2012-13.  While  the 
savings in physical assets witnessed a modest 
growth of 5.1 percent to  `14,95,283 crore in 
2012-13 from `14,22,541 crore in 2011-12, the 
financial  savings  increased  by  13.4  percent 
from  `6,32,196  crore  in  2011-12  to  `7,17,131 
crore  in  2012-13.  Private  corporate  savings 
observed a rise of 8.3 percent from `6,58,428 
crore  in  2011-12  to  `7,13,141  crore  in  2012-
13  while  Public  sector  savings  recorded  a 
growth of 6.0 percent in absolute terms from 

`1,11,295 crore in 2011-12 to  `1,17,919 crore 
in 2012-13 (Table 1.4).
 
The  slowdown  in  savings  rate  as  a 
percentage  of  GDP  at  market  prices  across 
the  sectors  has  led  to  further  widening  of 
the  saving-investment  gap  in  recent  years 
and  the  same  stood  at  4.7  percent  in  2012-
13, up from the 4.2 percent recorded in the 
previous financial year. Consequently, there 
has  been  heavy  reliance  on  capital  inflows 
which 
from 
`3,76,174 crore in 2011-12 to  `4,77,925 crore 
in  2012-13.  Addressing  structural  policy 
measures  to  lower  inflation  and  facilitating 
implementation of large investment projects, 
while containing the fiscal deficit would cater 
to reduce the savings investment imbalance.

Annual Report 2013-14

VI.  Current Account Deficit
 
The  year  2013-14  for  Indian  economy 
reflected  concerns  with  the  current  account 
deficit and it’s financing in the early months. 
However,  circumstances 
improved  and 
external  risk  mitigated  in  second  half  of 
the year. The narrowing of CAD followed a 
lower trade deficit due to the higher exports 
helped  by  a  depreciating  rupee  as  well  as 
moderation in imports, by curbing the import 
demand  arising  from  gold  and  other  non-
essential  imports  through  tariff  hikes  and 
administrative measures and to boost capital 
flows  through 
liberalisation  and  special 
schemes.
 
India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) 
was USD 32.4 billion in 2013-14 (1.7 percent 
of GDP), much lower than USD 87.8 billion 
(4.7 percent of GDP) recorded in 2012-13 on 
account of narrowing trade deficit and rising 
net invisibles receipts. In Q4 of 2013-14, CAD 
stood at USD 1.2 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) 
compared to USD 4.2 billion (0.9 percent of 
GDP) during Q3 of 2013-14, which is much 
lower than USD 31.9 billion, a historic high 
of 6.5 percent of GDP, during Q3 of 2012-13. 
There has been a significant deceleration in 
valuables with curbs on gold imports and this 
is  expected  to  positively  impact  household 
financial savings and help restrain CAD.
In  Indian  context,  sustaining  CAD 
 
to  a  comfortable  level  is  not  only  desired 
but  indispensable  too  as  it  would  reduce 
economy’s  dependence  on  volatile  foreign 
capital inflows such as portfolio investments 
to fund current account deficit. This leads to 
a balanced situation funded through foreign 
direct investment that is highly stable.
 
In  addition  to  containing  the  current 
account deficit, efforts have also been made 
to make the Indian economy more resilient by 
building buffers. Foreign exchange reserves 

8

have  been  replenished  by  mobilising  USD 
34  billion  by  way  of  non-resident  Indian 
(NRI)  deposits  and  bank  borrowings  in 
the  international  market.  India’s  foreign 
exchange reserves, which stood at USD 303.7 
billion as on March 28, 2014, are comfortable 
in terms of various reserve adequacy criteria. 
While  India  may  still  be  vulnerable  to  debt 
outflows  on  account  of  disorderly  exit 
from  quantitative  easing  by  major  central 
banks,  this  risk  has  been  mitigated  due 
to  the  containment  of  the  current  account 
deficit, reduction in the stock of the volatile 
component of capital flows, and an increase 
in foreign exchange reserves.

VII.  Fiscal Deficit
 
As  the  elevated  fiscal  deficit  posed 
a  major  challenge  to  the  economy,  several 
measures  for  fiscal  consolidation  were 
adopted such as phased reduction of diesel 
subsidies. The fiscal performance in 2012-13 
was  better  as  the  actual  gross  fiscal  deficit 
declined  to  4.9  percent  of  GDP  in  2012-13 
as against the budgeted level of 5.1 percent. 
For  2013-14,  gross  fiscal  deficit  stood  at 
4.5  percent  of  GDP.  It  has  been  budgeted 
at a further reduced level of 4.1 percent for 
2014-15.

After 

tighter 

liquidity 

VIII. Liquidity
 
conditions 
observed  in  2012-13,  the  Q1  of  2013-14 
witnessed  considerably  improved  scenario 
with  liquidity  deficit  staying  within  the 
comfort  zone  together  with  a  decline  in 
deposit  rate  of  SCBs,  following  a  reduction 
in the repo rate. However, to restore stability 
in  the  foreign  exchange  market  grounded 
by  capital  outflows  subsequent 
the 
announcement of tapering of US quantitative 
easing  programme,  exceptional 
liquidity 
measures  were  undertaken  to  tighten  the 

to 

monetary  and  liquidity  conditions.  Hike  in 
Marginal  Standing  Facility  (MSF)  rate  and 
Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) requirement, cap 
on daily Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) 
borrowing  and  weekly  auctions  of  cash 
management bills (CMBs) were some of the 
measures carried to drain out liquidity from 
the economy.
 
Moderation  of  exchange  rate  pressures 
from  September  2013  onwards  and  evolving 
macroeconomic  situations  significantly  eased 
the tight liquidity conditions of Q2 witnessing 
ongoing normalisation in exceptional monetary 
measures.  However, 
liquidity  conditions 
altered during the last quarter of 2013-14 as it 
started with monetary tightening in the first half 
of February 2014 owing to frictional pressures 
primarily  on  account  of  government  cash 
balances and a rise in currency in circulation. 
The situation was eased later due to injection 
of additional liquidity through term repos and 
forex swaps.
injection 
 
through 
the  Open  Market  Operations 
(OMOs) has been to the tune of about `52,000 
crore,  while  injecting  an  average  daily  net 
liquidity of `90,600 crore through LAF, MSF 
and term repos. Further to this, Export Credit 
Refinance  (ECR)  has  inducted  a  liquidity 
of  `29,400  crore  during  the  year.  In  2013-14, 
the  policy  repo  rate  under  the  Liquidity 
Adjustment Facility (LAF) has been increased 
by 25 basis points to stand at 8.0 percent.

IX.  Credit Growth
 
The credit growth decelerated in early 
2013-14  owing  to  slack  in  macroeconomic 
activity  and  deterioration  in  asset  quality. 
However, 
later  during  the  year,  credit 
off-take  accelerated  on  account  of  build-
up  in  credit  to  services  and  personal  loan 
category. Deployment of credit to industries

decelerated to 14.1 percent in 2013-14 led by 
sectors  like  gems  and  jewellery,  petroleum 
and mining even though credit to agriculture, 
food  processing,  construction,  glass  and 
paper recorded a pick up.
 
Credit  flow  rate  to  large  and  medium 
sector industries has been lower as compared 
to  micro  and  small  industries.  Improved 
macroeconomic  outlook  besides  easing  of 
liquidity conditions on account of rolling back 
of  the  policy  rate  corridor,  has  moderated 
the credit growth in line with the indicative 
trajectory.

Inflation
X. 
 
The inflationary pressures experienced 
during the financial year started moderating 
from  December  2013.  Both  WPI  and  CPI 
inflation  showed  signs  of  easing  from  the 
elevated 
levels  recorded  during  April-
November 2013.
 
The y-o-y WPI inflation was 5.9 percent 
in 2013-14 compared to 7.4 percent in 2012-
13.  Commodity-wise  break-up  shows  that 
inflation  on  primary  articles  remained  high 
at  9.9  percent  in  2013-14  compared  to  9.8 
percent  in  2012-13.  This  was  primarily  due 
to ascending food prices in major part of the 
year due to supply-side pressures. The fuel 
and power segment inflation was 10.1 percent 
in 2013-14 compared to 10.3 percent in 2012-
13. But there was significant moderation in the 
inflation of manufactured goods which was 
2.9 percent in 2013-14 as against 5.4 percent 
in  2012-13.  As  the  manufactured  products 
constitute  64.97  percent  in  the  WPI,  their 
impact on the overall moderation in inflation 
level in 2013-14 has been significant.
 
 Retail inflation measured by Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) moderated in the current 
year and stood at 8.9 percent as end March 
2014 compared to 10.4 percent as end March 

Annual Report 2013-14

2013,  driven  by  the  sharp  disinflation 
observed  in  food  prices  primarily  in  last 
quarter  of  the  year.  Food  and  beverages 
group,  which  contributes  47.6  percent 
weight in CPI, may be held accountable for 
the  overall  CPI  inflation  as  this  segment 
witnessed  double  digit  inflation  during 
the  year.  However,  second  half  of  the 
year  saw  moderation  in  CPI  inflation  and 
the  figure  stood  at  8.3  percent  as  on  end 
March  2014.  For  the  Indian  economy  to  be 
on  a  disinflationary  path  guided  by  stable 
monetary policy, it is intended to maintain 
8.0 percent CPI by 2015 and further attaining 
a level of 6.0 percent by 2016.

XI.  Trade Balance
 
Cumulative  value  of  exports  in  India 
for  the  current  year  stood  at  USD  312.3 
billion as against USD 300.4 billion in 2012-
13,  registering  a  growth  of  4.0  percent. 
Meanwhile,  imports  for  the  current  year 
witnessed  a  decline  of  8.9  percent  over  the 
previous  year  with  a  cumulative  value  of 
USD 450.1 billion in 2013-14 as against USD 
490.7 billion in 2012-13. Consequently, India’s 
trade deficit narrowed to USD 137.8 billion, 
much lower than that of USD 190.3 billion in 
2012-13.
 
Import  of  gold  and  silver  in  2012-13 
stood  at  USD  55.79  billion,  which  declined 
to  USD  33.46  billion  in  2013-14  mainly  due 
to depreciation of the rupee and limitations 
imposed  by  the  Government  on  inbound 
shipments  of  the  precious  metal  in  order 
to  minimize  the  current  account  deficit  in 
2013-14.  On  the  contrary,  India’s  exports 
have  shown 
the 
year,  however,  it  could  not  withhold  the 
momentum in November 2013 and eventually 
turned negative in February 2014 on account 
of domestic and global factors. Improvement

as on end March 2013 stood at 54.4 per USD 
and remained stable in the range of 53-55 per

the  monthly  average  exchange  rate  of  the 
rupee started depreciating and stood at 68.36

survived the US Fed tapering announcement

terms of number of demat accounts and demat 
quantity.  The  number  of  demat  accounts  at 
CDSL and NSDL witnessed a growth of 5.4

and  stood  at  `4,75,75,571  crore  in  2013-14. 
Amidst  the  volatile  rupee  during  the  year, 
the  currency  derivative  segment  turnover 
registered  a  decline  of  23.9  percent  to  reach 
`69,80,855  crore  in  2013-14.  The  oldest  Stock

The introduction of cash settled Interest

This  step  towards  integration  of  the  Indian 
Securities Market with the rest of the world 
may be seen as a path breaking initiative as 
it  is  expected  to  pave  the  way  for  various 
innovations at the derivative front in the time 
to come. Interest Rate Derivative segment at 
NSE also picked up the momentum in 2013-

integrated  with 

PROGRAMMES
With a view to keep the Indian securities 
 
market 
the  worldwide 
regulatory  regime,  incessant  developments 
are  essential  while  in  harmony  with  the 
objectives  enshrined  in  the  SEBI  Act,  1992. 
Alike  ever  year,  2013-14  as  well  witnessed 
various  policy  reforms  initiated  by  SEBI 
which are presented in this section.
The developments are categorized under 
 
seven  major  heads  viz.,  Primary  Securities 
Market, 
Securities  Market, 
Mutual  Funds,  Intermediaries  associated 
with Securities Market, Foreign Institutional 
Investors,  Other  policies  and  programmes 
having a bearing on the working of securities 
market and Assessment and Prospects.

Secondary 

Primary Securities Market
The  primary  market  enables 

I. 
the 
 
government  as  well  corporates  in  raising 
the  capital  that  is  required  to  meet  their 
requirements  of  capital  expenditure  and/
or  discharge  of  other  obligations  such  as 
exit  opportunities  for  venture  capitalist/PE 
firms.  A  well  developed  primary  market  is 
fundamental  for  an  economy  to  prosper.  In 
order  to  further  refine  the  primary  market 
design and boost investor confidence, various 
measures  have  been  undertaken  by  SEBI  in 
2013-14. This section throws light on the policy 
measures initiated during the financial year:

A.  Compliance  With  The  Provisions  Of 
Equity  Listing  Agreement  By  Listed 
Companies  -  Monitoring  by  Stock 
Exchanges
 
In order to improve the effectiveness of 
monitoring  mechanism  of  stock  exchanges 
to  ascertain  the  adequacy  and  accuracy  of 
disclosures  made  in  compliance  with  the 

13

Part One: Policies and Programmes

to  effectively  monitor 

Listing Agreement, the stock exchanges have 
been  advised  to  put  in  place  appropriate 
framework 
the 
disclosures.  The  stock  exchanges  have  also 
been advised to put in place an appropriate 
mechanism for handling complaints related 
to  inadequate  and  inaccurate  disclosures 
and  non-compliances.  Stock  exchanges  are 
further required to submit ‘exception reports’ 
to SEBI containing details of companies not 
responding  to  the  clarifications  sought  by 
them  and/or  where  the  response  submitted 
by the company is not satisfactory. Further, 
the stock exchanges have also been advised 
to disclose the details of promoters / directors 
/  key  managerial  personnel  of  defaulting 
companies on their websites.

the 

IPO Grading made voluntary
B. 
received 
 
requests 
Considering 
from  market  participants,  viz. 
Investor 
Associations and Association of Investment 
Bankers of India (AIBI), the recommendation 
of  the  advisory  committee  of  SEBI,  and  to 
align  with  the  principles  laid  down  by  the 
Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  on  reducing 
the reliance on credit rating agencies, the IPO 
grading  mechanism  was  made  “voluntary” 
as  against  the  earlier  provision  of  the  same 
being “mandatory”.

C. 

Introduction  of  General  Information 
Document
 
The  concept  of  General  Information 
Document  (GID)  has  been  implemented. 
GID  shall  contain  information  which  is  of 
generic  nature  (like  issue  and  allotment 
procedure)  and  not  specific  to  the  issuer, 
thereby eliminating the repetition of common 
information  in  abridged  prospectus.  This 
is  expected  to  bring  down  the  size  of  the 
abridged  prospectus  and  ultimately  reduce 
the cost of printing.

With  a  view  to  enhance  transparency, 
 
ensure adequate audit trail and apply lock-in 
for the shares allotted in preferential issues, 
the  following  amendments  were  carried 
out to SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2009:
a. 

Preferential  issue  shall  be  subscribed 
only  through  the  allottee’s  own  bank 
account.  Further,  the  issuing  company 
shall  disclose  the  natural  persons  who 
are  the  ultimate  beneficial  owner  of 
allotted  shares  and/or  who  ultimately 
control  the  allottee,  subject  to  the 
condition that if in the ownership chain 
there  is  any  listed  company,  mutual 
fund,  bank  or  insurance  company,  no 
further disclosure will be necessary.

b.  Allotments  in  preferential  issues  shall 

c. 

only be made in dematerialized form.
Shares allotted in the preferential issue 
shall  not  be  transferred  till  trading

in period shall commence on the date of 
such trading approval.

the  accounting  standards  specified  by  the 
Central  Government  in  section  211(3C)  of 
the  Companies  Act,  1956.  It  was  observed 
that there is no uniform format for auditors’ 
certificate  as  required  under  clause  24(i) 
of  the  equity  listing  agreement.  Auditors’ 
certificate  in  different  formats  was  being 
submitted  by  the  companies  with  the  stock

Box 1.1: Compliance with Minimum Public Shareholding Requirement
 Government of India, vide notifications dated June 4, 2010 and August 9, 2010, amended the Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (“SCRR”). The amended rule 19(2) and newly introduced rule 19(A) of 
SCRR require the listed companies to achieve and maintain minimum public shareholding (“MPS”) of 25 
percent of the total number of issued shares for non-PSUs and 10 percent for PSUs. Further, a time period 
of three years has been provided from the date of notifications to companies to achieve minimum public 
shareholding in the manner specified by SEBI. 
 SEBI has specified the following methods for achieving MPS requirement in terms of rules 19(2)(b) and 19A 
of SCRR: 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 

Issuance of shares to public through prospectus; 
Offer for sale of shares held by promoters to public through prospectus; 
Sale of shares held by promoters through the secondary market i.e. OFS through Stock Exchange;
Institutional Placement Programme 
 Rights Issues to public shareholders, with promoters/promoter group shareholders forgoing their 
rights entitlement.
 Bonus Issues to public shareholders, with promoters/promoter group shareholders forgoing their 
bonus entitlement.
Any other method as may be approved by SEBI, on a case to case basis.

g. 
 In accordance with the decision of SEBI Board in its meeting held on October 06, 2012, SEBI initiated a 
consultative process with the companies which were not meeting the MPS requirement to elicit a concrete 
plan of action as regards ensuring compliance with MPS requirement. 
 As per the shareholding pattern filed by listed companies with the stock exchanges (NSE and BSE), for the 
quarter ended June 2012, there were 216 companies in which public shareholding was less than the MPS 
requirement. Of these 216 companies, there were 200 non-PSUs and 16 PSUs. Out of these 16 PSUs, one 
was a state PSU and the remaining 15 were central PSUs. Amongst the 200 non-PSUs, there were 163 active 
companies  and  37  companies  were  suspended.  For  some  of  the  companies  the  due  date  of  compliance 
extends beyond June 03, 2013. 
 Non-PSUs not meeting the MPS requirement were segregated into various regions viz. Mumbai, Kolkata, 
Ahmedabad,  New  Delhi,  Chennai,  Bangalore  and  Hyderabad,  based  on  the  location  of  their  registered 
office. As part of the consultative process, since November 2012, SEBI engaged with all the active non-
PSUs not meeting the MPS requirement. The need for timely compliance with MPS requirement as well 
as the consequential penal actions that might result in case of non-compliance was impressed upon such 
companies during the consultative process. Letters were also issued to then non-compliant non-PSUs in 
April ‘2013 advising them to take appropriate steps, immediately, to ensure timely compliance.
 For PSUs not meeting MPS requirement, SEBI on several occasions engaged with the Government and the 
PSUs, for considering appropriate steps to comply with the MPS requirement within the time as stipulated 
in SCRR. As part of the consultative process, SEBI also held meetings with the officials of respective PSUs 
to elicit plan of action for compliance. As a result, all the central PSUs achieved compliance with the MPS 
requirement within the stipulated time, however, one state PSU did not. 
 In this context, SEBI vide circular dated August 29, 2012 had prescribed that listed entities desirous of 
achieving MPS requirement through other means may approach SEBI with their proposals. It was also 
mentioned in the above circular that listed entities desirous of seeking any relaxation from the available 
methods  may  approach  SEBI  with  appropriate  details.  Accordingly,  SEBI  on  receipt  of  proposals  from 
companies has, inter-alia, granted following kinds of approval :
a. 

 Allowing secondary market sale: SEBI has permitted companies for secondary market sale on the 
floor of stock exchange for meeting MPS requirement with condition including that any such sale 
will be made in a bonafide manner to unrelated non-promoter entity.

c. 

d. 

 Relaxation  in  the  Institutional  Placement  Programme  (“IPP”)  requirements:  SEBI  has  permitted 
companies (a) to issue equity shares under IPP in excess of the permissible limits, (b) relaxation on 
minimum number of allottees, subject to pricing restrictions as applicable to Qualified Institutions 
Placement  (“QIP”).  Further,  SEBI  also  permitted  few  companies  for  using  limited  reviewed 
consolidated financial statements for the stub-period in the offer document of IPP.
 Relaxation in the OFS requirements: Relaxations from (a) the requirement of two week gap between 
successive OFS offers, (b) the requirement of restriction on divestment through OFS route during the 
twelve weeks cooling off period.
 Offer  of  shares  to  the  employees  of  companies:  Companies  were  allowed  to  offer  shares  to  their 
employees, subject to certain conditions.

 Along  the  aforesaid  lines,  SEBI  has  granted  more  than  70  approvals  on  case-to-case  basis  for  various 
proposals  received  from  around  47  such  companies,  while  keeping  in  mind  throughout,  inter-alia,  the 
need for ensuring transparency in the methods proposed by the entities. This has also led to rejection of 
many proposals. To ensure transparency, the companies were also advised to disclose the contents of the 
approval letter to the stock exchanges in accordance with clause 36 of the Listing Agreement. 

 As a result of the aforesaid measures taken by SEBI, many companies made substantial efforts to achieve 
compliance. In respect of the non-compliant companies, SEBI vide orders dated June 04, 2013, July 05, 2013 
and  October  14,  2013  issued  interim  directions  against  the  promoters  /  promoter  groups  and  directors 
of 107 listed companies including the one state PSU which had not complied with MPS requirement as 
prescribed under SCRR. The directions include the following:
a. 

 Freezing of voting rights and corporate benefits like dividend, rights, bonus shares, split, etc. with 
respect to excess of proportionate promoter / promoter group shareholding in the non-compliant 
companies;
 Prohibiting the promoters / promoter groups and directors of these non-compliant companies from 
buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities of their respective companies; 
 Restraining the shareholders forming part of the promoters / promoter groups and directors in the 
non-compliant companies from holding any new position as a director in any listed company.

 As on March 31, 2014, thirty-seven out of these 107 non-compliant companies have achieved compliance 
with MPS requirement. In case of 8 companies, SEBI has granted extension to either complete delisting 
process or achieve compliance in accordance with BIFR orders. The remaining 62 companies (of which 31 
are suspended) are yet to achieve compliance and the directions in respect of them are in still in force.

I.  Activities of Advisory Committees
a.  Qualified Audit Review Committee
 
SEBI  during  the  financial  year  2012-
13  put  in  place  a  mechanism  to  process 
qualified  annual  audit  reports  filed  by  the 
listed  companies  with  stock  exchanges. 
Under  the  mechanism,  a  Qualified  Audit 
Review  Committee  (QARC)  comprising 
representatives of ICAI and stock exchanges 
has  been  constituted  to  review  the  cases 
received from the stock exchanges and guide 
SEBI  in  processing  the  qualified  annual 

audit reports.
 
Seven  meetings  of  QARC  took  place 
during  the  financial  year  2013-14  and 
around  250  qualified  audit  report  cases 
were  dealt  with  in  these  meetings.  The 
qualifications were examined in light of the 
provisions  contained  in  the  SEBI  circular 
dated  August  13,  2012  in  this  regard. 
Accordingly, upon examination of the said 
qualified audit reports by QARC and based 
on  its  recommendations,  following  action 
has been taken as on March 31, 2014:

If, prima facie, QARC is of the view that an audit 
qualification  is  significant  and  the  explanation 
given  by  the  listed  company  concerned  /  its 
Audit Committee is unsatisfactory, the case may 
be  referred  to  the  Financial  Reporting  Review 
Board of ICAI (ICAI-FRRB) for their opinion on 
whether the qualification is justified or requires 
restatement of the books of accounts of the listed 
company;
If an audit qualification is not quantifiable, QARC 
may  suggest  rectification  of  the  same  within  a 
stipulated period.

Secondary  market  witnessed  volatility 
amidst  global  and  domestic  factors,  but 
stock  indices,  Sensex  and  Nifty  scaled  new

growth  and  high 
inflation.  Secondary 
markets,  which  serve  as  a  barometer  of  the 
financial health of an Indian economy, entail 
continuous 
advancements 
accompanied by review of existing guidelines 
so  as  to  maintain  a  competitive  edge.

Box 1.3: Institutional Trading Platform

The Hon’ble Finance Minister announced the following in his budget speech on February 29, 2013:
“Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), including start-up companies, will be permitted to list on the SME exchange without 
being required to make an initial public offer (IPO), but the participation will be restricted to informed investors. This will be in 
addition to the existing SME platform in which listing can be done through an IPO and with wider investor participation”.
Pursuant  to  the  above,  in  consultation  with  Expert  Committee  constituting  of  representatives  from  various 
stakeholders including, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of MSME, industry associations, stock exchanges, angel 
investors,  association  of  venture  capital  funds,  brokers  and  trading  members,  merchant  bankers,  investor 
associations, law firms and consultancy firms, SEBI introduced Institutional Trading Platform (ITP), enabling

SME platform to facilitate capital raising by SMEs including start-up companies which are in their early stages of 
growth and to provide for easier exit options for informed investors like angel investors, VCFs and PEs etc.
Start-ups and SMEs can list their securities in ITP and the informed investors can find suitable companies to 
invest in. The possible eligibility routes includes a minimum investment of `50 lakh in the equity of the company 
by, either by registered venture capital funds, alternate investment funds, merchant banks, qualified institutional 
buyers or specialized international multilateral agency or domestic agency like SIDBI, NABARD, or a PFI under

the  processes  and 
procedures  with  regard  to  actions  for  non-
compliances  of  certain  listing  conditions 
which have so far been considered as grounds 
for suspension of trading by the recognised 
stock  exchanges,  the  stock  exchanges  have 
been  advised  that  in  case  of  non  compliant 
companies they would resort to several other 
measures such as imposition of fines, freezing 
of shares of the promoter and promoter group, 
transferring the trading in the shares of the 
company  to  separate  category,  etc.,  before 
suspending the shares of the company.
 
In  order  to  maintain  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  approach  in  this  regard,  it 
has  been  decided  to  lay  down,  in  the  bye-
laws of the recognised stock exchanges, the 
following:

governance report, etc.
In case of non-compliance for two 
consecutive  quarters,  moving  the 
shares of non-compliant company

Settled 
Interest Rate Futures (IRF) on 10-year 
Government of India Security
SEBI vide circular no. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-
 
46/2009  dated  August  28,  2009  permitted 
stock exchanges to launch physically settled 
futures  on  10-Year  Government  of  India 
(GoI)  Security.  In  consultation  with  RBI, 
after  taking  into  account  feedback  from 
market  participants  and  stock  exchanges, 
SEBI  decided  to  permit  stock  exchanges  to 
introduce  cash  settled  Interest  Rate  Futures 
on  10-Year  Government  of  India  Security. 
A  detailed  framework  in  this  regard  was 
prescribed  by  SEBI  vide  its  circular  dated 
December 05, 2013. The cash settled 10-year 
IRF is being introduced on a pilot basis and 
the  product  features  would  be  reviewed 
based on the experience gained. (Box 1.4)

Box 1.4: Exchange Traded Cash Settled Interest Rate Futures (IRF) on 10-year

Government of India Security

As Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) have become a fundamental risk management tool for financial markets worldwide, 
after consultation with RBI and taking into account feedback from market participants, SEBI, vide circular no. 
CIR/MRD/DRMNP/35/2013 dated December 5, 2013 permitted stock exchanges to introduce cash settled IRFs on 
10-year GoI security.
Exchanges have been permitted to launch IRF contracts on either one or both of the options - Option A: Coupon 
bearing Government of India security as underlying and Option B: Coupon bearing notional 10-year Government 
of India security with settlement price based on basket of securities as underlying.
For every IRF contract, stock exchanges shall set an initial price band at three percent of the previous closing price. 
However, whenever a trade in any contract is executed at the highest/lowest price of the band, stock exchanges 
may expand the price band for that contract by 0.5 percent in that direction after 30 minutes after taking into 
account market trend. No more than two expansions in the price band shall be allowed within a day.
Further, Clearing Corporations shall determine appropriate risk management framework for the product and 
submit the same to SEBI for approval. The initial margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a 
portfolio of an individual client across various scenarios of price changes which would be so computed so as to 
cover a 99 percent VaR over a one day horizon. Margins shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing 
member on an online, real time basis.
Subsequent to the above, three exchanges have launched IRFs. MCX-SX was the first exchange to launch IRFs 
on January 20, 2014 followed by NSE on January 21, 2014 and BSE on January 28, 2014. Further, SEBI has also 
prescribed the position limits in Exchange Traded IRFs at various member levels, including for FIIs.

Part One: Policies and Programmes

SEBI vide circulars dated April 1, 2013 and July 18, 2012 had already put in place mechanism for monitoring and 
enforcing limits of FIIs in Government Securities and corporate bonds by directing depositories to disseminate 
information regarding the total FII investment values in Government and corporate bonds. Further, in consultation 
with RBI, SEBI vide Circular no: CIR/MRD/DRMNP/2/2014 dated January 20, 2014 directed that this monitoring 
mechanism shall also incorporate monitoring of gross long positions of FIIs in IRF.
As per the monitoring mechanism, as and when the total of cash and IRF of all FIIs reaches 85 percent of the 
permissible limit, NSDL and CDSL shall inform RBI, SEBI and stock exchanges. Once 90 percent of limit is utilized, 
NSDL and CDSL shall inform RBI, SEBI and stock exchanges about the same. Stock exchanges shall notify the 
same to the market and thereafter FIIs shall not further increase their long position in IRF till the time the overall 
long position of FIIs in cash and IRF comes below 85 percent of existing permissible limit.

E. 

Introduction  of  Derivatives  on 
‘India VIX’
 
SEBI  has  permitted  introduction  of 
derivatives on ‘India VIX’ to National Stock 
Exchange (NSE) in January 2014. India VIX 
is  India’s  first  volatility  Index  which  is  a 
key measure of market expectations of near-
term  volatility.  In  India,  VIX  was  launched 
in April, 2008 by NSE based on the Nifty 50 
Index  Option  prices.  NSE  launched  futures 
contracts  on  India  VIX  called  ‘NVIX’  on 
February  26,  2014.  National  Securities 
Clearing  Corporation  Limited  (NSCCL)  has 
put in place the necessary risk management 
measures such as collection of initial margins, 
exposure  margins  and  calendar  spread 
margins. The methodology of calculating the 
VIX index is same as that for Chicago Board 
Options Exchange (CBOE) VIX index.

F.  Amendment  to  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation)  (Stock  Exchanges  and 
Clearing  Corporations)  Regulations, 
2012
Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock 
 
Exchanges  and  Clearing  Corporations) 
Regulations,  2012  was  amended  to  accord 
greater legal certainty to netting, settlement 
finality and rights of Clearing Corporations 
(CCs) over collaterals in the securities markets.

and 

mechanism 
mechanism at the stock exchanges
With  a  view  to  streamline  the  investor 
 
grievance  mechanism  and 
the  arbitration 
mechanism at the stock exchanges, SEBI, vide 
circulars dated July 5, 2013 and September 26, 
2013, has provided for the following measures:-
a.  Widened  Jurisdiction  for  appealing 

before the Courts
 
Stock  exchanges  with  nation-wide 
terminals  have  been  mandated  to  provide 
arbitration and appellate arbitration facilities 
at all centres specified by SEBI from time to 
time. Further, in cases where investors wish 
to proceed to Court u/s 34 of Arbitration and 
Conciliation  Act,  they  have  been  facilitated 
to apply at the Competent Court nearest to 
their address.
b.  Selection of Arbitrators
Stock  exchanges  with  nation-wide 
 
trading  terminals  have  been  advised  to 
maintain  a  ‘common  pool’  of  arbitrators, 
centre-wise. If the client and member fail to 
choose  the  arbitrator(s)  from  the  common 
pool,  the  arbitrator(s)  are  chosen  by  an 
‘Automatic  Process’  wherein  neither  the 
parties to arbitration nor the concerned stock 
exchanges are directly involved.

in  numbers  of 

Increase 
service centres facilitating arbitration
 
In  respect  of  stock  exchanges  with 
nation-wide trading terminals, the number of 
investor service centres facilitating arbitration 
was increased from 8 to 16. Thus, in addition 
to  the  centres  at  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Kolkata, 
Chennai,  Ahmedabad,  Hyderabad,  Kanpur 
and  Indore,  stock  exchanges  were  advised 
to further set up centres at Bangalore, Pune, 
Jaipur,  Ghaziabad,  Lucknow,  Gurgaon, 
Patna  and  Vadodara.  These  centres  are  to 
be set up by the stock exchanges by June 30, 
2014. The above measure is with an objective 
to  reduce  the  travel  expenditure  and  other 
incidental  costs  to  investors  while  availing 
these facilities.
d. 

Facilitation desks at all investor service 
centres
 
With a view to assist investors engaged 
in dispute resolution process, stock exchanges 
were advised to set up facilitation desks at all 
investor service centres as specified by SEBI 

from  time  to  time.  These  facilitation  desks 
are  meant  to  assist  investors  in  obtaining 
documents/details  from  stock  exchanges 
wherever so required for making application 
to IGRC and filing arbitration.

e.  Decrease in fee for appellate arbitration
 
With a view to unburden investors from 
the cost of arbitration mechanism, the fee for 
clients filing appeal with claim/counterclaim 
value of upto `10 lakh was reduced to `10,000 
from `30,000. Further, expenses thus arising 
are  shared  by  the  stock  exchanges  and  the 
Investor Protection Fund of stock exchanges.

Timeline for grievance redressal
f. 
With  a  view  to  ensure  time-bound 
 
redressal  of 
investor  grievances,  stock 
exchanges  were  advised  to  resolve  all 
complaints  at  their  end  within  15  days. 
Further,  the  maximum  permissible  time  for 
the Investor Grievance Redressal Committee 
(IGRC) to amicably resolve all the complaints 
was specified as 15 days.

Box 1.5: Interim Monetary relief from Investor Protection Fund (IPF) for investors
In order to streamline the grievance redressal at the stock exchanges and make it more effective from the angle 
of investor protection, stock exchanges have been advised to give interim monetary relief to investors with claim 
value upto `10 lakh, during the course of proceedings from the IPF. For this purpose, the following stage-wise 
procedure has been specified:-
a. 

Upon conclusion of case at the Investor Grievance Redressal Committee (IGRC), if claim is admissible to 
investor, stock exchanges have to block the claim value from member’s deposit. Stock exchange provides 
seven  days  time  to  member  to  inform  whether  he  intends  to  pursue  the  next  level  of  resolution  i.e. 
arbitration. Stock exchange releases the same after seven days, if member does not opt for arbitration.
If member challenges IGRC decision and claim value is less than `10 lakh, lower of 50 percent of claim 
value or `0.75 lakh to be released to investor from IPF.
If arbitration award is in favour of investor and member opts for appeal, difference of (lower of 50 percent 
of the amount mentioned in award or `1.5 lakh) and (amount released to investor) to be released to investor 
from IPF.
 If appellate award is in favour of investor and member applies to a Court to set aside the same, difference 
of (lower of 75 percent of amount determined in appellate award or `2 lakh) and (amount already released 
to the investor), shall be released to investor from IPF.
Total amount released to investor out of IPF capped at `5 lakh per financial year.
If investor loses at any stage of proceedings and decides not to pursue further, he shall refund monies to 
IPF.

H.  Algorithmic Trading
 
In order to ensure that the requirements 
prescribed  by  SEBI  /  stock  exchanges  with 
regard to algorithmic trading are effectively 
implemented,  stock  brokers  were  directed 
to  subject  their  algorithmic  trading  system 
to a system audit every six months, instead 
of annually, by a system auditor possessing 
certifications 
like  CISA,  DISA,  CISM, 

CISSP.  Stock  exchanges  were  advised  to 
consider  imposing  suitable  penalties  in 
case  of  failure  of  the  stock  broker  to  take 
satisfactory  corrective  action  to  its  system 
within  the  specified  time-period.  Further, 
in  order  to  provide  sufficient  deterrence, 
stock  exchanges  were  directed  to  double 
the  existing  rates  of  disincentives  for  high 
order-to-trade ratio (Box 1.6).

Box 1.6 : International Research Conference on HFT, Algo and Co-location

The rise of High frequency trading (HFT) has raised concerns with regard to its impact on market quality, financial 
stability, information asymmetry and regulatory framework. There is a divide in pool of thoughts over positive 
impact of HFT (increased market liquidity, market depth and decreasing bid-ask spread) and associated risks 
(high message traffic, technology failure, extreme events, rogue algorithms). Because of its relative novelty and 
the uncertainty related to many of the trading strategies being used today, the debate over high frequency trading 
is of contemporary relevance.
Therefore, SEBI organised its First International Research Conference during January 27-28, 2014 in Mumbai. 
The  theme  of  the  Conference  was  “HFT,  Algo  Trading  and  Co-location”.  SEBI  invited  academicians/market 
practitioners/regulators, having experience in the field, from countries such as USA, Spain, Australia, Canada, 
Japan, India etc. Chairman, SEBI Shri U. K. Sinha delivered his keynote speech and set the ball rolling for the 
next one and a half days of the conference. He stated that the primary aim of the conference would be to initiate a 
deeper study and to develop mechanisms to ensure that larger systems are alert and enough safeguards are built 
in to avoid any mishaps.
In the conference, the participants discussed issues related to impact of HFT on Market Quality, Financial Stability, 
Information asymmetry and retail investors, HFT in developing countries, regulatory mechanism and technology 
as an enabler to re-level the field. Research papers were presented by the speakers sharing their studies and 
experiences in the international markets as well as lessons to be learnt by India.

Arguments in favour of HFT:
• 

In United States, a CFTC-SEC report concludes that HFTs did not cause the Flash Crash on May 6, 2010. In 
times of Market stress, HFTs trade the same as under regular market conditions, HFTs “hot potato trading” 
leads to a spike in trading volume and HFTs exacerbate volatility by aggressively unwinding inventory. 
HFTs behaviour does not change in times of stress. In times of stress, aggressive and passive HFTs trade 
almost opposite to each other.
A study of NASDAQ 120 stocks calculated in the month of March from 2005 to 2011 indicates that although 
increased computer automation of trading and increased speed may have improved some of the traditional 
measures of market quality (narrower bid-ask spreads, reduction in volatility), it is not clear whether these 
improvements have improved market quality in a more general sense.
In an ASIC study on Australian markets, HFT does not appear to be a key driver for changes seen in the price 
formation, liquidity and the execution costs and they display negligible change in their contribution to 
depth in the ASX-200.
In Japanese market, HFT contributes to (a) providing liquidity and (b) restraining volatility.
Emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, Malaysia, etc., have all experienced significant 
bumps  in  volume,  largely  due  to  HFT  and  other  forms  of  Algorithmic  Trading  (AT).  Overreaching 
regulatory attempts in developed markets may drive even more traders to move to less regulated markets 
viz. emerging markets.

Annual Report 2013-14

• 

In India, a study based on a sample of NSE data from 2009 to 2013 finds out that stocks having larger market 
capitalization  moved  immediately  towards  high  Algorithmic  Trading.  Among  the  stocks  having  lower 
market capitalization, there is significant variation and Algorithmic Trading is good for market quality but 
depth visible at the touch, goes down.

Arguments against HFT:
• 

• 

There are apprehensions about Algorithmic Trading relating to increase in the cost of infrastructure for 
stock exchanges, increase in the risk to the exchanges and clearing corporations, unfairness to manual/retail 
traders etc.
At present, exchanges need to ensure that they have sufficient infrastructure to process orders and penalize 
high order-to-trade ratios. Such artificial restriction on high Order to Trade Ratio (OTRs) helps exchanges to 
enhance its trade execution speed and reduce its computer technology related costs, as storage requirements 
are minimized, which is a short term solution that may hurt the liquidity and spreads in the long term.

Issues to address while going forward
• 

Rogue Algorithm - Dysfunctional/Rogue algorithms could be a consequence of poor programming, flawed 
modeling or incomplete planning. Regulation needs to mitigate risk emanating from the same.

• 

• 

•  Mini flash crashes - There have been multiple instances, e.g., stock market falling by 80 points due to 
incorrect public information, a company dropping 5 per cent in recovering seconds. Has the frequency of 
such events increased?
Preventing Market Manipulation - Exploring systems that restrict data feeds enough to prevent front-
running, but enables quick and efficient response to value-relevant information.
Financial Innovation- HFT has differential access and profit implications to different type of investors. 
Regulation should ensure that such an innovation should not lead to the detriment and exclusion of longer-
term investors from the markets.
Balancing Act - Currently, we are confronted with abstruse problems between economic rationality view 
and social welfare view. Since these problems are not easy to solve, we should make constant efforts to 
seek appropriate balance between economic rationality and social welfare through the better combination 
of cutting-edge technology and existing market framework.

• 

Key Action Points
• 

Systems-Engineered: Regulate automated markets as complex systems composed of software, hardware, 
and human personnel; promote best practices in systems design and complexity management.
Safeguards-Heavy: Make risk safeguards consistent with the machine-readable communication protocols 
and operational speeds.
Transparency-Rich: Mandate that versions and modifications of the source code that implement each rule 
are made available to the regulators and potentially the public.
Cyber-centric: Change regulatory surveillance and enforcement practices to be more cyber-centric rather 
than human-centric.
Platform- Neutral: Make regulations neutral with respect to computing technologies.

Box 1.7: Principles of Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs)

To promote and sustain an efficient and robust global financial infrastructure, the Committee on Payments and 
Settlement  Systems  (CPSS)  and  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  published 
the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) on April 2012. All CPSS and IOSCO members are 
required to strive to adopt the PFMIs and implement them in their respective jurisdictions. SEBI as a member 
of IOSCO is committed to the adoption and implementation of the new CPSS-IOSCO standards of PFMIs in its 
regulatory functions of oversight, supervision and governance of the key financial market infrastructures under 
its purview.
Accordingly, SEBI vide circular no. CIR/MRD/DRMNP/26/2013 dated September 4, 2013 mandated the systemically 
important Clearing Corporations - Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd., MCX-SX Clearing Corporation Ltd. and 
National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. and Depositories - Central Depository Services Ltd. and National 
Securities Depository Ltd., to comply with the PFMIs prescribed by CPSS and IOSCO.
The foundation of an FMI’s risk management framework includes its authority, structure, rights, and responsibilities. 
The following 24 set of principles provides guidance to help establish a strong foundation for the risk management 
of an FMI.

General Organization
Principle 1: Legal basis
An FMI should have a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each material aspect of its 
activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
Principle 2: Governance
An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety and efficiency 
of the FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant public interest considerations, 
and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.
Principle 3: Framework for the comprehensive management of risks
An FMI should have a sound risk-management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit, liquidity, 
operational, and other risks.

Credit and liquidity risk management
Principle 4: Credit risk
An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those arising 
from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. An FMI should maintain sufficient financial resources to 
cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence. In addition, a CCP that is 
involved in activities with a more-complex risk profile or that is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions 
should maintain additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios.
Principle 5: Collateral
An FMI that requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure should accept collateral with low 
credit, liquidity, and market risks. An FMI should also set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and 
concentration limits.
Principle 6: Margin
A CCP should cover its credit exposures to its participants for all products through an effective margin system 
that is risk-based and regularly reviewed.
Principle 7: Liquidity risk
An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk. An FMI should maintain sufficient liquid 
resources in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of 
payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of potential stress scenarios.

Settlement
Principle 8: Settlement finality
An FMI should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum by the end of the value date. Where 
necessary or preferable, an FMI should provide final settlement intraday or in real time.

27

Annual Report 2013-14

Principle 9: Money settlements
An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank money where practical and available. If central 
bank money is not used, an FMI should minimize and strictly control the credit and liquidity risk arising from 
the use of commercial bank money.
Principle 10: Physical deliveries
An FMI should clearly state its obligations with respect to the delivery of physical instruments or commodities 
and should identify, monitor, and manage the risks associated with such physical deliveries.

Central securities depositories and exchange-of-value settlement systems
Principle 11: Central securities depositories
A CSD should have appropriate rules and procedures to help ensure the integrity of securities issues and minimize 
and manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities. A CSD should maintain securities 
in an immobilized or dematerialized form for their transfer by book entry.
Principle 12: Exchange-of-value settlement systems
If an FMI settles transactions that involve the settlement of two linked obligations (for example, securities or 
foreign  exchange  transactions),  it  should  eliminate  principal  risk  by  conditioning  the  final  settlement  of  one 
obligation upon the final settlement of the other.
Principle 13: Participant-default rules and procedures
An FMI should have effective and clearly defined rules and procedures to manage a participant default. These 
rules and procedures should be designed to ensure that the FMI can take timely action to contain losses and 
liquidity pressures and continue to meet its obligations.
Principle 14: Segregation and portability
A CCP should have rules and procedures that enable the segregation and portability of positions of a participant’s 
customers and the collateral provided to the CCP with respect to those positions.

General business and operational risk management
Principle 15: General business risk
An  FMI  should  identify,  monitor,  and  manage  its  general  business  risk  and  hold  sufficient  liquid  net  assets 
funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that it can continue operations and services as a 
going concern if those losses materialize. Further, liquid net assets should at all times be sufficient to ensure a 
recovery or orderly wind-down of critical operations and services.
Principle 16: Custody and investment risks
An FMI should safeguard its own and its participants’ assets and minimize the risk of loss on and delay in access 
to these assets. An FMI’s investments should be in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks.
Principle 17: Operational risk
An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their 
impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. Systems should be designed to 
ensure a high degree of security and operational reliability and should have adequate, scalable capacity. Business 
continuity management should aim for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment of the FMI’s obligations, 
including in the event of a wide-scale or major disruption.

Access
Principle 18: Access and participation requirements
An FMI should have objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair and 
open access.
Principle 19: Tiered participation arrangements
An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the FMI arising from tiered participation 
arrangements.
Principle 20: FMI links
An FMI that establishes a link with one or more FMIs should identify, monitor, and manage link-related risks.

28

Part One: Policies and Programmes

Efficiency
Principle 21: Efficiency and effectiveness
An  FMI  should  be  efficient  and  effective  in  meeting  the  requirements  of  its  participants  and  the  markets  it 
serves.
Principle 22: Communication procedures and standards
An FMI should use, or at a minimum accommodate, relevant internationally accepted communication procedures 
and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, settlement, and recording.

Transparency
Principle 23: Disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data
An FMI should have clear and comprehensive rules and procedures and should provide sufficient information 
to enable participants to have an accurate understanding of the risks, fees, and other material costs they incur by 
participating in the FMI. All relevant rules and key procedures should be publicly disclosed.
Principle 24: Disclosure of market data by trade repositories
A TR should provide timely and accurate data to relevant authorities and the public in line with their respective 
needs.
Further, on January 3, 2014, SEBI granted Qualified Central Counterparty status to NSCCL, ICCL and MCX-SX 
CL.

Testing of software used in or related 
to trading and risk management
 
Software/system  change  is  a  constant

stock brokers that undertake algorithmic 
trading  were  advised  to  participate  in 
the mock trading sessions, irrespective 
of  the  algorithm  having  undergone 
change or not.
Stock  brokers  are  required  to  give  an 
undertaking  to  the  stock  exchanges

K.  Safeguards to avoid trading disruption 

in case of failure of software vendor
 
In view of the risk caused by the inability 
on  the  part  of  software  vendors  to  provide 
software  or  related  services  in  timely  and 
continuous  manner,  it  was  suggested  that 
stock exchanges may advise the stock brokers 
to consider taking the following measures:
a. 

Explore  the  possibility  of  establishing 
a  ‘software  escrow  arrangement’  with 
their existing software vendors.
In case of large stock brokers, consider 
reducing  dependence  on  a  single 
software  vendor  for  trading  and  risk 
management  systems,  by  engaging 
more than one software vendor

b. 

c.  Consider  inclusion  of  the  following 
in  contracts  with  software 

clauses 
vendors:
i.  Access 

to  documents 

related 
to  design 
and  development 
specifications in the event software 
vendor fails to provide continuous 
and  timely  services  to  the  stock 
broker

ii.  Development  of  expertise  at  the 
end  of  the  stock  broker  through 

30

appropriate training with regard to 
software usage and maintenance.

iii.  Appropriate  penalty  clauses  for 
cases of disruptions to the trading 
system  of  the  stock  broker  on 
account  of  (a)  software  vendor 
failing to provide continuous and 
timely services to the stock broker 
or  (b)  glitches  to  the  software 
provided by the software vendor.

iv.  Obligation  on  the  part  of  the 
software  vendor  to  cooperate  in 
case of audit of software including 
forensic audit, if required.

L.  Review of the Securities Lending and 

Borrowing (SLB) framework
In order to extend the benefits of SLB, the 
 
eligibility criteria of the scrips for introduction 
of SLB contracts was expanded to include such 
scrips that fulfill the following criteria:
a. 

Scrip  classified  as  ‘Group  I  security’, 
and

b.  Market  Wide  Position  Limit  (MWPL) 
of the scrip, shall not be less than `100 
crore, and

c.  Average  monthly  trading  turnover  in 
the scrip in the cash market shall not be 
less than `100 crore in the previous six 
months.

Stock exchanges were advised to review the 
scrips eligible for SLB on a half-yearly basis 
and no SLB transactions in the scrip would 
be permitted from the next trading day in the 
event  of  scrip  failing  to  meet  the  eligibility 
criteria.
Further,  in  order  to  facilitate  efficient  use 
of margin collateral, the category of eligible 
collateral to meet margin obligations for SLB 
transactions was brought at par with the cash 
market.

M. 

circuit 

Index  based  market-wide 
breaker mechanism
 
The  mechanism  of  translating  the  10 
percent,  15  percent  and  20  percent  circuit 
breaker limits to absolute points of variation 
of  market-wide  index  at  the  end  of  each 
quarter was reviewed and modified to a daily 
fixing of limits based on the previous day’s 
closing level of the index. In addition, it was 
advised to resume trading in the cash market 
with a fifteen minutes pre-open call auction 
session after observing the trading halt.

N. 

Individual  scrip  wise  price  bands  on 
non-F&O  eligible  scrip’s  in  Index 
Derivatives
 
In  order  to  protect  against  excessive 
price  movements  in  scrips  on  which  no 
derivatives products are available but which 
are part of index derivatives, stock exchanges 
were  directed  to  implement  appropriate 
individual  scrip  wise  price  bands  up  to  20 
percent on such scrips.

in 

O.  Amendment 

comprehensive 
guidelines on Offer For Sale (OFS) of 
Shares by Promoters through the Stock 
Exchange Mechanism
 
In  order  to  align  OFS  with  secondary 
market trades, it was decided that seller(s) shall 
announce the intention of sale of shares at least 
on the day prior to the offer for sale, instead of 
one clearing day prior to the offer for sale.

P.  Rationalization  of  Periodic  Call 

Auction for Illiquid Scrips
 
Based  on  the  feedback  received  from 
market participants, the periodic call auction 
mechanism for illiquid scrips was rationalized 
by  modifying  the  criteria  for  scrips  eligible 
for periodic call auction mechanism, number 
of  auction  sessions,  order  placement  and 
validity  of  orders  throughout  the  trading 

31

day. This process has rationalised the number 
of scrips that are trading in the periodic call 
auction mechanism in the stock exchanges.

Q. 

Issuance  and  Processing  of  Delivery 
Instruction Slips (DIS)
 
With  an  objective  to  safeguard  the 
interest  of  the  investors,  it  was  decided  to 
strengthen  the  supervisory  and  monitoring 
role of the depositories and their participants 
with  respect  to  issuance  and  processing  of 
Delivery Instruction Slips (DIS) and following 
major actions were taken:
a. 
 Standardization of DIS
 
Format and size of DIS were standardized 
across all DPs to enable system level checks by 
the depositories and to facilitate scanning and 
easy retrievability of records. It was mandated 
that the DIS should bear a pre-printed unique 
serial number, DP ID, and a pre-printed/pre-
stamped  Beneficial  Owner  (BO)  ID.  Usage 
of same DIS for giving both market and off-
market instructions was disallowed.
b.  Monitoring of DIS
 
Entry  of  serial  number  of  DIS  in  the 
depository  system  for  validation  was  made 
mandatory for execution of DIS. This was done 
to ensure no instructions accompanied by a 
used DIS or unissued DIS are processed.
 Scanning of DIS
c. 
 
Scanning of every DIS executed during 
a day was made mandatory so that archived 
scanned images may be used by depositories 
for off site inspection.

R.  Systems Audit for Stock Brokers
 
SEBI, vide circular dated November 6,

Regulations, 2011
 
As per existing KRA Regulations, 2011, 
an option was available to the intermediary to 
access the centralized KRA system in case of a 
client who is already KYC compliant or carry 
out  fresh  KYC  process. As  the  KRA  system 
has  now  stabilised  and  has  been  working 
well, it was felt that there may not be a need 
to provide this option in the Regulations.
 
Accordingly,  KRA  Regulations  were 
amended  vide  notification  dated  March  13, 
2014 and the option of taking fresh KYC has 
been done away with. However, as provided 
in 
intermediary 
can  undertake  enhanced  KYC  measures 
commensurate  with  the  risk  profile  of  its 
clients.

d.  Aadhaar  e-KYC  service  launched  by 
UIDAI  to  be  considered  as  a  valid 
process for KYC verification
 E-KYC service launched by UIDAI has 
  
now  been  accepted  as  a  valid  process  for 
KYC verification, as per SEBI Guidelines. The 
information containing relevant client details 
and photograph made available from UIDAI 
as a result of e-KYC process shall be treated 
as sufficient proof of identity and address of 
the client.

C.  Simplification  and  Reduction  in  cost 

of Demat account opening process
 
SEBI,  vide  circular  dated  December 
4,  2013,  simplified  and  rationalized  the 
demat account opening process. This would 
standardize  the  account  opening  process 
across the depositories, harmonize the demat 
account opening process with that of trading 
account  and  reduce  the  cost.  In  terms  of 
this  circular,  the  existing  Beneficial  Owner-
Depository  Participant  agreement  has  been 
replaced  with  “Rights  and  Obligations 
of  the  Beneficial  Owner  and  Depository 
Participant”  document,  which  shall  be 
binding on the depository participant as well 
as the investor. The investor will be confident 
while signing the document as it is prescribed 
by the regulator. This will also result in the 
reduction in the number of signatures to be 
affixed by the investors while opening demat 
account and also in the cost to the investors 
due to non-payment of stamp duty which was 
earlier payable for entering into agreements.

D.  Guidelines  for  dealing  with  Conflict 
of Interest for investment/ trading by 
Credit Rating Agencies, Access Persons 
and other employees
 
With  a  view  to  adopt  best  industry 
practices  and  systems  by  Credit  Rating 
Agencies  (CRAs)  for  managing  conflict  of 
interest  in  case  of  investment/trading  in 
securities  done  by  CRAs  or  their  Access 
Persons  and  employees,  SEBI  vide  circular 
dated August 28, 2013 issued guidelines for 
dealing with conflict of interest in consultation 
with  the  CRAs.  These  guidelines  prescribe 
that:
a.  CRAs  shall  adopt  adequate  systems, 
procedures  and  policies  to  ensure  that 
they  address  conflict  of  interest  while 
making 
in 

investments 

their  own 

securities.

b.  CRAs,  their  employees  and  Access 
Persons shall not take undue advantage 
of  any  price  sensitive  information  that 
they may have about any company.

c.  Access Persons shall seek prior approval 
for purchase or sale of securities of the 
companies  which  have  been  rated  or 
graded by the CRA or whose securities 
/ instruments /facilities have been rated 
or graded by the CRA

e. 

f. 

d.  Disclosures  shall  be  made  by  all 
employees/  access  persons  of  CRAs 
while joining the CRA, on purchase or 
sale of securities and on annual basis as 
applicable.
The members of the Rating Committee 
shall  upfront  declare  /  disclose  their 
interest,  if  any,  to  the  Chief  Executive 
Officer  or  Compliance  Officer,  as  per 
the policy of the CRA, in the securities 
/instruments/ 
are 
considered  for  rating  /  grading  by  the 
CRA.
Employees  involved  in  the  rating  / 
grading process shall not have ownership 
of the securities of the issuer.
 
The  CRAs  were  advised  to  devise 
their  policies  and  procedures  for  effective 
implementation  of 
these  guidelines  by 
October 01, 2013 and to disclose the policies 
adopted  by  them  in  this  regard  on  their 
websites.

in  securities  markets.  The  Boards  of  such 
entities  have  been  made  responsible  for 
putting in place systems for implementation 
of the requirements specified in the circular, 
providing  necessary  guidance  enabling 
identification, elimination or management of 
conflict of interest situations and reviewing 
the compliance of this circular periodically.

F.  Anti-Money  Laundering/Countering 

Anti-Money 

Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
The 

 
Laundering/
Countering  Financing  of  Terrorism  (AML/
CFT)  framework  prescribed  by  SEBI  for 
market  intermediaries  has  been  updated 
vide  circular  dated  March  12,  2014,  to 
incorporate  the  amendments  made  in  the 
PML  Act  and  Rules.  The  major  changes  to 
the  framework  are  with  regard  to  record 
keeping 
requirements,  appointment  of 
designated  director  to  oversee  compliance 
with AML/CFT obligations, reliance on third 
party  for  carrying  out  client  due  diligence 
and  risk  assessment  to  be  carried  out  by 
intermediaries.

G.  Simplification  of  registration  process 

for Stock Brokers
 
Vide  Notification  dated  September 
27,  2013,  the  SEBI  (Stock  Brokers  and  Sub-
Brokers) Regulations, 1992, were amended to 
replace the existing requirement of obtaining 
multiple  registrations 
in 
different  segments  of  a  stock  exchange  / 
clearing corporation with a single registration 
per  stock  exchange  /  clearing  corporation. 
If  an  entity  is  already  registered  with  SEBI 
in  any  segment  of  a  stock  exchange,  then 
for operating in any other segments of that 

for  operating

corporation as the case may be.

the 

H.  Strengthening 

compliance 
mechanism  of  Stock  Brokers-Internal 
Audit
 
Stock  Brokers  are  required  to  conduct 
internal  audit  of  their  operations  on  a 
half  yearly  basis  to  be  conducted  by  an 
independent  auditor.  The  format  of  audit 
report and sample size is prescribed by the 
stock  exchange.  In  consultation  with  SEBI, 
the  stock  exchanges  have  reviewed  and 
increased the audit sample size to be covered 
under  internal  audit  for  stock  brokers  with 
effect  from  the  half  year  ended  March  31, 
2014.  Further,  the  auditor  shall  verify  the 
compliance  of  SEBI  /  exchange  inspection 
findings/observations  by  the  stock  broker 
during internal audit process. These changes 
are  intended  to  strengthen  the  compliance 
mechanism of stock brokers.

I.  Rationalisation 

of 

continuing 

for 

(CPE), 

professional education (CPE) process
 
The duration of continuing professional 
education 
certification  of 
associated persons in the securities markets, 
has  been  reduced  to  one  day  from  the 
earlier  requirement  of  two  days  without 
compromising on the contents of examination. 
This  will  help  all  the  intermediaries  in 
complying with the requirement of CPE and 
improving their professional standards.

bring  more  transparency  in  the  disclosure 
of  complaint  redressal  status  of  the  stock 
brokers  on  the  website  of  stock  exchange, 
SEBI  in  consultation  with  stock  exchanges 
and market participants modified the format 
by including the following details:
a.  Number  of  active  clients  of  stock 

c. 

b. 

broker
Percentage  of  number  of  complaints 
received  as  against  number  of  active 
clients of stock broker
Percentage  of  complaints  resolved  as 
against complaints received by the stock 
broker
 
The  stock  exchanges  are  also  now 
required to separately disclose total number 
of  complaints  received  against  all  stock 
brokers,  their  active  clients  and  percentage 
and also overall market redressal rate. Stock 
exchanges have implemented the new system 
with effect from January 2014.
 
The  above  modifications  will  result 
in  disclosure  of  complaint  redressal  rate 
of  individual  stock  broker  and  also  overall 
redressal rate at stock exchange level. As the 
information is available in public domain, this 
will  encourage  the  stock  brokers  to  redress 
the  complaints  expeditiously.  Further,  as 
each  stock  exchange  shall  also  disclose  the 
overall  redressal  rate  of  the  exchange,  this 
will help them in monitoring and taking steps 
to  improve  their  performance  by  regular 
follow-up  with  stock  brokers.  All  this  will 
result in expeditious redressal of complaints 
of the investors.

J. 

Transparency in Redressal of Investor 
Complaints
 
SEBI had earlier prescribed the format 
for  disclosing  details  of  complaints  lodged 
by clients/investors against stock brokers on 
the  website  of  stock  exchanges.  In  order  to 

K.  Strengthening the Disciplinary Process 

of Stock Exchanges
 
Stock exchanges are empowered under 
their bye-laws to impose monetary penalties 
on  their  stock  brokers  for  violations/non-
compliances  based  on  findings  of  their 

42

inspections  and  regular  monitoring.  With 
a  view  to  make  the  penalty  structure  more 
stringent  so  as 
to  commensurate  with 
the  seriousness  and/or  repetitive  nature 
of  violations,  the  penalty  structure  was 
strengthened 
in  consultation  with  stock 
exchanges,  which  came  into  effect  from 
April 2013. This will help in improving the 
compliance standards for the stock brokers.

L.  Periodical  settlement  of  running 

accounts
With  a  view 

to 

 
instill  greater 
transparency and discipline in the dealings 
between  the  clients  and  the  stock  brokers, 
SEBI  had  mandated,  in  2009,  that  stock 
brokers  shall  compulsorily  settle  client 
running  accounts  on  monthly/quarterly 
basis  as  desired  by  the  clients  and  send 
them  a  statement  of  account  to  that  effect. 
This  regulatory  directive  has  helped  in 
reduction of investor grievances pertaining 
to unauthorized trading. With an objective 
to address the administrative and practical 
difficulties, SEBI has further streamlined the 
process  of  settling  running  accounts  after 
receiving feedback from stock exchanges and 
stock  brokers.  As  per  the  revised  process, 
for  the  purpose  of  settlement,  the  stock 
broker is allowed to settle across segments 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

and across stock exchanges for a particular 
client.  This  will  benefit  the  client  as  well 
as  the  stock  brokers  as  the  client  account 
across  stock  exchanges  will  be  netted  for 
the purpose of settlement and debit balance 
in one exchange will get offset to the extent 
of the credit available in another exchange. 
In  addition  to  this,  certain  other  changes 
have been made to remove administrative/
operational difficulties of stock brokers.

M.  Limited Liability Partnership to become 

members of the stock exchange
 
Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules, 
1957 (SCRR) were amended vide notification 
dated  October  24,  2013  and  rules  were 
liberalised  by  allowing  Limited  Liability 
Partnerships  (LLPs)  to  become  eligible  for 
seeking membership of a stock exchange.

VI.  Other Policies and Programmes having 
a bearing on the working of Securities 
Market

A.  CORPORATE DEBT MARKET
 
A well developed corporate bond market 
supports economic development and is likely 
to be more beneficial for business having longer 
term cash flows, where investors may be wary 
of  risk  associated  with  equity  market.  The 
current year witnessed `2,76,054 crore raised 
through  1,924  issues  by  the  way  of  private 
placement listed at BSE and NSE while there 
were 35 public debt issues worth `42,383 crore 
in 2013-14, depicting a manifold increase from 
the previous year. Furthermore, a framework 
for Regulations on Research Analyst and Real 
Estate Investment Trust (REIT) was proposed 
in 2013-14. The potential of the market can be 
realised on the back of policy and regulatory 
reforms  accompanied  by  ways  to  penetrate 
retail  investors.  Following  are  the  slew  of 
measures undertaken by SEBI in 2013-14:

a. 

SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Non-
convertible  Redeemable  Preference 
Shares) Regulations, 2013
 
SEBI  notified  the  SEBI  (Issue  and 
Listing  of  Non-Convertible  Redeemable 
Preference  Shares),  Regulations,  2013  on 

46

June  12,  2013.  The  said  regulations  provide 
a  regulatory  framework  for  public  issuance 
of  Non-convertible  Redeemable  Preference 
shares and also for listing of privately placed 
redeemable  preference  shares.  Considering 
the risks involved in the instrument, certain 
requirements  like  minimum  tenure  of  the 
instruments  (three  years),  minimum  rating 
(“AA-” or equivalent) etc. have been specified 
in  case  of  public  issuances.  For  listing  of 
privately placed non-convertible redeemable 
preference shares, minimum application size 
for each investor is fixed at `10 lakh.
 
As per Basel III norms, banks can issue 
non-equity  instruments  such  as  perpetual 
non-cumulative  preference 
shares  and 
innovative perpetual debt instruments, which 
are in compliance with the specified criteria 
for  inclusion  in  Additional  Tier  I  Capital. 
SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Non-Convertible 
Redeemable Preference Shares), Regulations, 
2013  was  also  made  applicable  to  the  non-
equity  instruments  such  as  perpetual  non-
cumulative preference shares and innovative 
perpetual  debt 
issued  by 
banks (as per Basel III norms), which are in 
compliance with the criteria specified by RBI 
for inclusion in Additional Tier I Capital.

b.  Centralized  Database  for  Corporate 

Bonds/ Debentures
Considering 

to  have 
 
the  need 
comprehensive  database  on 
corporate 
bonds  at  a  single  place  and  taking  into 
account  the  recommendations  of  Dr.  R.H. 
Patil  Committee,  SEBI  mandated  both  the 
depositories viz. NSDL and CDSL to jointly 
create,  host,  maintain  and  disseminate  the 
centralized  database  of  corporate  bonds/
debentures,  which  are  available  in  demat 
form. The depositories shall obtain requisite 
information regarding the bonds/debentures 
from  issuers,  stock  exchanges,  credit  rating 

47

Part One: Policies and Programmes

agencies and debenture trustees. The database 
can  be  accessed  by  the  public  or  any  other 
users  without  paying  any  kind  of  fees  or 
charges.  This  has  been  done  in  view  of  the 
fact that the historical data on all corporate 
bonds issued is very crucial for an investor to 
take informed investment decision.

Further,

the 

c. 

Issues pertaining to Primary Issuance 
of Debt Securities
 
SEBI had  mandated that the day count 
convention for calculation of interest payments 
for  listed  corporate  debt  securities  shall  be 
actual. It has been pointed out by the market 
participants  that  the  disclosures  can  further 
be improved, if cash flows concerning interest 
payment  and  redemption  of  debt  securities 
are  given  by  way  of  illustration  in  the  offer 
document. Taking the same into account, SEBI 
issued a circular on October 29, 2013 stating 
that  the  cash  outflows  (interest  payments 
and  redemption  of  maturity)  concerning 
debt securities, are to be explained by way of 
illustrations in the offer document.
of 
 
standardisation  and  in  line  with  the  dated 
government  securities,  it  was  also  stated 
that if the coupon payment date of the debt 
securities, falls on a Sunday or a holiday the 
coupon payment shall be made on the next 
working day. If the maturity date of the debt 
securities, falls on a Sunday or a holiday, the 
redemption  proceeds  shall  be  paid  on  the

Ordinance,  2013,  has,  inter  alia,  amended 
the  SEBI Act,  1992  by  way  of  insertion  of  a 
proviso to sub-section (1) of section 11AA of 
SEBI Act to prescribe that: “… any pooling of 
funds under any scheme or arrangement, which 
is not registered with the Board or is not covered 
under sub-section (3), involving a corpus amount 
of  one  hundred  crore  rupees  or  more  shall  be 
deemed to be a collective investment scheme.”
 
Certain  activities  as  listed  under  sub-
section  (3)  of  section  11AA,  viz.,  Schemes

C. 
Investor Assistance and Education
 
SEBI has been taking various regulatory 
measures  to  expedite  the  redressal  of 
investor grievances. The grievances lodged 
by investors are taken up with the respective 
listed 
are 
continuously monitored. Investor assistance 
provided  by  SEBI  through  various  modes 
viz. e-mails, letters, telephonic calls received 
on toll free helpline etc. are being executed 
in a proficient manner. The SCORES system 
has  been  working  satisfactorily  and  has 
helped  in  making  the  complaint  handling 
and  redressal  mechanism  more  efficient. 
Alike  every  year,  this  year  too  witnessed 
various  investor  awareness  and  education 
programs with wider reach being conducted 
by  SEBI  with  the  help  of  exchanges, 
depositories  and  various  trade  bodies  like 
AMFI  etc,  increasing  the  total  number  of 
such programs in 2013-14.

a.  Advisory Committee for SEBI Investor 
Protection and Education Fund (IPEF)
In  Budget  speech  of  Finance  Minister 
 
while  presenting  the  budget  for  FY  2006-
07,  Finance  Minister  proposed  “To  set  up 
an  Investor  Protection  Fund  under  the  aegis  of 
SEBI,  funded  by  fines  and  penalties  recovered 
by  SEBI.  This  will  bolster  confidence  among 
retail investors who should be the key drivers of 
the  capital  market”.  Also,  SEBI  was  to  issue 
guidelines in this regard.
 
Accordingly,  the  Board  in  its  meeting 
held  on 
the 
establishment of an Investor Protection and 

June  30,  2007,  approved 

50

Education  Fund  with  contribution  from 
SEBI’s  General  Fund  to  be  used  for  taking 
measures for investor education.
 
Further,  the  SEBI  (Investor  Protection 
and Education Fund) Regulations, 2009 came 
into effect, which required for establishment 
of  a  fund  called  “Investor  Protection  and 
Education  Fund”  or  IPEF.  The  Fund  was 
deemed to have been established on July 23, 
2007, by the order made by the Board under 
section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992 with an initial 
corpus  of  `10  crore  from  the  SEBI  General 
Fund.
 
Amounts  to  be  credited  to  the  IPEF 
includes  contribution  by  SEBI;  Grants, 
donation by Central and state governments or 
any other entity approved by SEBI; Investor 
Protection  Fund,  Investor  Services  Fund, 
one  percent  security  deposit  available  with 
the exchange in the event of de-recognition 
of  stock  exchange;  interest  or  other  income 
received  from  investment  made  from  the 
fund etc; and any other amount as SEBI may 
specify in interest of investors.
 
Recent amendment to the SEBI Act 1992 
through  the  Securities  Laws  (Amendment) 
Ordinance, 2013 has provided for crediting the 
disgorged amount pursuant to a direction issued 
under section 11B or section 12A of the Securities 
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 or section 19 of 
the Depositories Act, 1996, as the case may be, to 
the Investor Protection and Education Fund.
 
IPEF 
includes various educational and awareness 
activities,  funding  investor  education  and 
awareness activities of investor associations, 
aiding  recognised  investor  associations  to 
undertake  legal  proceedings  in  interest  of 
investors;  refund  of  securities  deposit  held 
by stock exchanges and transferred to IPEF 
consequent to de-recognition, after fulfilling 
condition for release of deposit etc.

IPEF  Advisory  committee  has  been 
constituted  (as  prescribed  by  SEBI  (IPEF) 
Regulations 2009) for recommending investor 
education and protection activities that may 
be  undertaken  directly  by  the  Board  or 
through  any  other  agency,  for  utilisation  of 
the funds from IPEF for the above purposes.

VII.  Assessment and Prospects
A.  Assessment
 
Indian  economy  suffered  bouts  of 
market  turmoil  in  early  2013-14  on  account 
of  US  Fed  tapering  concerns  but  the  policy 
actions  undertaken  in  the  latter  half  of  the 
year built buffers to withstand the economy 
against  possible  spillovers.  While  these 
defensive buffers facilitated in narrowing the 
statistics,  the  growth  concerns  still  remain 
dominant with GDP growth estimated at 4.9 
percent  for  FY14  while  Index  of  Industrial 
Production (IIP) statistics stagnated for two 
successive  years  followed  by  contraction  of 
0.1  percent  in  2013-14.  While  the  previous 
year witnessed all the three sectors (services, 
agriculture  and 
their 
momentum, the current year bore a testimony 
to  the  revival  in  agriculture  activity.  While 
Services sector registered a sluggish growth, 
the Industry recorded a fall in growth in the 
financial year.
 
Savings  rate  as  a  percentage  of  GDP 
meanwhile  fell  further  from  31.3  percent 
to  30.1  percent  on  the  back  of  decline  in 
Household Savings. While savings in financial 
assets remained constant, savings in physical 
assets  registered  a  marginal  decrease  over 
the previous year. The investment dwindled 
during the year, while the saving-investment 
gap  widened  to  4.7  percent  of  the  GDP  at 
market  prices,  propagating  heavy  reliance 
on  capital  inflows.  Following  a  lower  trade 
deficit,  coupled  with  rise  in  net  invisible 
receipts, India’s full-year CAD is likely to be 

industry) 

losing 

Part One: Policies and Programmes

below 2.5 percent of GDP due to slackening 
of  gold  imports  and  moderate  pick-up  in 
exports. The actual gross fiscal deficit declined 
to 4.5 percent of the GDP riding on the back 
of revenue push and expenditure cuts as also 
due  to  phased  subsidy  reduction  of  diesel 
prices. Liquidity conditions which remained 
tight till first half of the year, eased gradually 
with normalisation of exceptional monetary 
measures. Credit growth decelerated on the 
back of sluggish macroeconomic activity and 
deterioration in asset quality.
 
In  addition  to  the  containment  of 
current  account  deficit  within  a  sustainable 
level, efforts were made to stabilise the rupee 
exchange  rate  which  in  conjunction  with 
improvements  in  global  trade,  contracted 
India’s  trade  deficit  and  also  strengthened 
foreign exchange reserves during the year.
 
The  securities  market,  which  observed 
gains  during  the  early  part  of  the  year,  got 
disrupted  owing 
to  global  headwinds. 
However,  as  normalcy  returned,  the  Indian 
stock  markets  recovered  with  benchmark 
indices, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty registering 
their all-time high. The BSE Sensex knocked a 
new peak to close at 22,386 on March 31, 2014, 
breaching  the  20,000  mark  touched  during 
2012-13. Nifty, too, crossed the 6,000 mark of 
2012-13 and logged to a new lifetime high by 
closing at 6,704 on March 31, 2014. On a point 
to point basis, Sensex observed a growth of 
18.8 percent, while Nifty recorded a growth 
of  18.0  percent  over  the  previous  year.  The 
SX40  index  of  MCX-SX  closed  at  13,298  on 
March 31, 2014. As per World Federation of 
Exchanges (WFE) statistics, NSE retained its 
number one position in the category of largest 
exchange  by  Electronic  Order  Book  (EOB) 
number of trades in 2013 and stood at third 
position among top 5 exchanges by number 
of single stock futures traded in 2013.

Annual Report 2013-14

 
The market capitalisation of benchmark 
indices replicated an upward trend with a rise 
of 16.1 percent at BSE and 16.6 percent at NSE 
over the previous financial year. The turnover 
at BSE declined by 4.9 percent whereas at NSE 
it increased by 3.7 percent over the previous 
year.  The  market  capitalisation  to  GDP  (at 
market  prices)  ratio  of  BSE  stood  at  65.3 
percent and for NSE the ratio was 64.1 percent. 
MCX-SX,  recorded  a  market  captilisation  of 
`72,39,670  crore  in  2013-14  and  its  ratio  to 
GDP  at  64.0  percent.  While  the  turnover  in 
the  equity  derivative  segment  exhibited  an 
increase of 22.9 percent in 2013-14, amidst the 
volatile  rupee  during  the  year,  the  currency 
derivative  segment  turnover  registered  a 
decline of 23.9 percent over the previous year. 
Meanwhile,  markets  witnessed  introduction 
of  new  segments  and  platforms  with  BSE 
going live in the currency derivative segment 
and  introduction  of  trading  in  interest  rate 
futures at NSE and BSE.
 
Exchanges  were  permitted  to  launch 
IRF  contracts  on  either  one  or  both  of  the 
options  -  Coupon  bearing  Government  of 
India security as underlying and/or Coupon 
bearing  notional  10-year  Government  of 
India security with settlement price based on 
basket of securities as underlying. SEBI also 
permitted derivatives on India’s first volatility 
Index, India VIX, which is a key measure of 
market  expectations  of  near-term  volatility, 
which was launched in January 2014 by NSE. 
The  measures  have  been  largely  aimed  at 
expansion and development of our securities 
market.
 
The  financial  year  2013-14  also  saw 
elevated  levels  in  primary  equity  and  debt 
market with a total resource mobilisation to 
the  tune  of  `55,652  crore  as  against  `32,455 
crore  raised  in  the  previous  year.  Public 
Issue  of  debt  reached  more  than  doubled 

52

over the previous year and reached  `42,383 
crore.  Amount  of  resource  mobilisation 
taking  place  through  the  private  placement 
of  corporate  debt  stood  at  `2,76,054  crore. 
Resource  mobilisation  of  equity  through 
Preferential  Allotment 
is  approximately 
similar  to  the  previous  year  and  stood  at 
`46,463 crore while the QIP route registered a 
decline and mobilised `13,663 crore. The new 
platforms for small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) by BSE and NSE, witnessed resource 
mobilisation  of  `317  crore 
through  37 
issues  compared  to  `239  crore  raised  by  24 
issues  in  the  previous  year,  reflecting  high 
entrepreneurial potential of the economy.
 
In its endeavour to give a further impetus 
to  the  primary  market,  SEBI  made  grading 
mechanism voluntary for initial public offers 
(IPOs). In order to facilitate capital raising by 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs), SEBI 
decided  to  permit  listing  without  an  IPO 
and  trading  of  specified  securities  of  SMEs 
including start-up companies on Institutional 
Trading Platform (ITP) in SME Exchanges.
 
FII investments also witnessed a revival 
as confidence returned to the markets. In the 
early  part  of  2013-14,  foreign  institutional 
investors were net sellers in the debt segment 
while they turned net buyers from December 
2013 onwards. The cumulative net investment 
of FIIs in Indian markets amounted to USD 
180,405 million as at the end of March 2014 
compared  to  USD  171,529  million  in  2012-
13, depicting a rise of 5.2 percent. The assets 
under  the  custody  of  custodians  under 
different  asset  classes  stood  at  `46,00,247 
crore  as  end  March  31,  2014.  Mutual  funds 
saw a net inflow of `53,783 crore in 2013-14. 
The persistent efforts of SEBI to promote and 
regulate the Indian securities market on the 
back of vigorous policy reforms were evident 
by growing statistics of the market.

investments.  PSU  divestment 
through ETF route, a first in Indian markets 
has  also  garnered  market  attention  and 
appreciation  visible  in  the  record  amount 
being  mobilised.  The  year  also  witnessed 
the  setting  up  of  a  dedicated  debt  segment 
on  the  stock  exchanges  with  an  objective 
to  develop  debt  markets  and  encourage 
transition  of  trading  in  debt  instruments 
from  OTC  markets  to  stock  exchanges. 
With  a  committed  approach  to  investor 
protection and empowerment, SEBI decided 
to  give  monetary  relief  to  investors  having 
claims  upto  `10  lakh,  during  the  course  of 
proceedings  from  the  Investor  Protection 
Fund of Stock Exchange.
 
The  year  2013-14  saw  SEBI  being 
compliant  of  international  good  practices 
as  specified  by  Financial  Stability  oversight 
body,  constitution  of  Early  Warning  Group 
for  monitoring  early  warning  signals  and 
monitoring  of  financial  conglomerates  as 
published in the IOSCO report of Thematic 
Review of the implementation of Principles 6 
and 7 of the IOSCO. India is the only country 
that has a systemic risk monitoring template, 
developed  by  SEBI  which  covers  the  entire 
market, participants and product spectrum.
 
The  incessant  endeavours  of  SEBI  in 
setting  up  a  credible  regulatory  framework 
were lauded by IMF and World Bank in the 
FSAP report for India. The Report recognised 
that  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime 
for Indian securities market is well developed 
and largely in compliance with international 
standards.

B.  Prospects
 
SEBI  completed  its  25  year  journey 
in  2013.  During  these  eventful  years,  it  has 
successfully  not  only  modernised  Indian 
capital  markets  bringing  in  line  the  best 
international  practices  and  standards  but 
has taken initiatives that were subsequently 
adopted  by  other  countries.  However  the 
challenges  to  regulation  persist  induced  by 
advances of technology driving innovations 
and  complexities  in  market,  products  and 
platforms. SEBI aims to continuously upgrade 
and  improve  its  human  and  technological 
capabilities so that it can fulfill its mandate 
of delivering strong enforcement, protection 
of investors and development of markets.
 
The Indian securities market continues 
to  evolve  with  various  policy  measures 
aimed  to  preserve  and  maintain  a  safe  and 
fair market to protect the interest of investors. 
SEBI  has  been  taking  various  regulatory 
actions especially those pertaining to CIS to 
make  Indian  securities  market  more  secure 
and regulated. Over the years, SEBI has built 
the  reputation  of  a  credible  enforcement 
agency.  The  enforcement  action  taken  by 
SEBI  is  designed  to  be  appropriate  in  a 
holistic  sense.  SEBI  has  used  warnings  and 
letters  of  deficiency  to  address  findings 
from inspection reports, while in other cases 
‘harder’ measures, such as disgorgement and 
payment  of  money  under  adjudication  or 
consent proceedings, have been imposed. In 
order to make the market a safe and fair place 
to investors, SEBI reviewed the extant insider 
trading regulatory regime so as to align with 
the  best  practices  globally.  The  High  level 
committee  on  Insider  trading  has  proposed 
draft  Insider  trading  regulation  which  has

the  crucial  mechanism 
to  ensure  market  integrity  and  investor

surveillance 
mechanism 
is 
effectively  supervising  the  market  activities 
to  ensure  seamless  trading.  The  dynamic 
contours of market, entails capacity building 
for  effective  integrated  surveillance  with 
special  focus  on  enhancing  skill  sets  for 
using  analytical  and  statistical  tools  for 
monitoring  derivative  and  HFT 
trades. 
World-wide,  regulators  are  reviewing  the 
regulatory 
frameworks  on  Algorithmic 
and HFT for its potential impact on market 
stability. Profiling of major clients in various 
segments may help to understand the pattern 
of market participation and their impact with 
special  emphasis  on  algorithmic  trading, 
HFT  etc.  This  will  necessitate  upgradation 
of resources for understanding and effective 
surveillance  specific  to  algorithmic  trading 
and  HFT.  Systemic  approach  is  a  requisite 
to  establish  a  mechanism  for  risk  profiling 
of  companies/  stock  brokers  so  as 
to 
understand  the  associated  risks.  Process 
for  comprehensive  upgradation  of  DWBIS 
infrastructure  to  ensure  data  storage  and 
processing requirement for next five years is 
also initiated.
 
To  enhance  the  existing  supervisory 
mechanisms, a Risk Based Supervision Task 
Force has been set up and assigned the task 
of understanding the objective of supervision 
for each class of SEBI registered intermediary, 
to  identify  and  define  various  risk  metrics, 
both quantitative and qualitative, to explore 
and lay down the methodology for assigning 
rating  of  various  risk  metrics.  The  Task 
Force  will  be  submitting  its  report  in  the

compliance  of  companies  with 
obligations  by  stock  exchanges  should  be 
strengthened.  Also  SEBI  along  with  the 
stock  exchanges  should  review  whether 
current  arrangements  to  analyse  material 
events should be strengthened. Accordingly, 
a Committee was formed for drafting an all 
encompassing Listing Regulations providing 
listing conditions and disclosure requirements 
for various categories of securities. In order 
to  maintain  a  single  document  in  line  with 
the  Listing  Agreement  and  to  address  the 
concerns  of  excessive  delegation  in  the 
garb  of  flexibility  with  respect  to  certain 
areas,  such  as,  disclosure  requirements,  an 
approach paper has been prepared enlisting 
listing  agreement  provisions,  modifying 
existing and proposing new provisions and 
incorporating  the  changes  in  consonance 
with the Companies Act, 2013.
In addition to aligning the regulations, 
 
SEBI  also  strives  to  cover  all  the  market 
participants within the ambit of its regulatory 
purview.  With  a  view  to  regulate  entities

‘Infrastructure 
Investment  Trusts‘(InvITs)  in  the  country. 
InvITs, as an investment vehicle, is aimed to 
provide wider and long-term re-finance for 
existing  infrastructure  projects,  to  free  up 
current developer capital for reinvestment 
into  new  infrastructure  projects  and  to 
refinance/takeout  existing  high  cost  debt

SEBI  has  taken  several  steps  to  re-

cities/towns,  regulation  of  distributors  and 
issues concerning investor protection, develop 
a long-term policy for the sustainable growth 
of  the  industry  and  increase  household

SEBI  has  been  setting  up  local  offices 
across  the  country  with  the  primary  aim  to 
provide investor assistance and education to 
nooks  and  corners  of  the  country.  In  order 
to  help  in  achieving  financial  inclusion  and 
to  enhance  the  investor’s  confidence  and 
awareness,  SEBI  continues  to  evolve  various 
initiatives  like  conducting  workshops,  visit 
to  SEBI  and  introducing  financial  concepts 
in  CBSE  curriculum.  SEBI  initiated  National 
Financial  Literacy Assessment  Test  (NFLAT) 
under  National  Strategy

Various investor centric initiatives such 
as  these  may  require  deployment  of  more

Hence it was felt to undertake a comprehensive

1.  PRIMARY SECURITIES MARKET
In 2013-14, primary markets rebounded 
 
with 
resource 
mobilisation.  The  upbeat  sentiment 
is 
consistent with the encouraging global cues 
and improving macroeconomic factors back 
at  home.  A  host  of  factors  like  economic 
recovery,  containment  of 
twin  deficits, 
adjustment  of  rupee  exchange  rate,  fall  in 
interest  rates  have  all  been  influential  in 
shaping  the  markets.  While  the  first  half  of 
the  financial  year  grappled  with  volatility 
emanating  from  international  headwinds 
and  domestic  uncertainty,  the  second  half 
saw  a  growth  in  external  demand  on  the 
back of currency appreciation. Policy actions 
in  India  have  strengthened  the  buffers  and 
prevented Indian economy from the possible 
spillovers  of  the  US  Fed  tapering  and  the 
Ukraine  crisis.  Investor  confidence  and 
optimism restored during the year mainly on 
account of performance of financial markets 
and facilitative policy actions by SEBI. Listing 
without  an  Initial  Public  Offer  and  trading 
of specified securities of small and medium 
enterprises 
start-up 
companies on Institutional Trading Platform 
(ITP) in SME Exchanges, modifications in the 
formats for disclosures under regulation 29 (1), 
29 (2) and 31 of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition 
of  Shares  and  Takeovers)  Regulations,  2011 
to ensure adequate disclosures are made to 

including 

(SMEs) 

help investors were some measures aimed at 
bolstering the primary market activities.

I.  Resource Mobilisation through Public 

and Rights Issues
 
During 2013-14, 90 companies accessed 
the primary market and raised `55,652 crore 
through public (75) and rights issues (15) as 
against  69  companies  which  raised  `32,455 
crore  in  2012-13  through  public  (53)  and 
rights issues (16) (Table 2.1). Primary market 
activities  in  2013-14  were  on  a  resurgent 
mode  as  compared  to  2012-13.  The  number 
of IPOs in 2013-14 stood at 38 as compared 
to 33 in the year 2012-13. Of the 38 IPOs, 37

amount raised through IPOs in 2013-14 was 
lower at `1,236 crore as compared to `6,528 
crore during 2012-13. During the year, offer 
for  sale  by  existing  shareholders  mobilised 
`3,096  crore  through  four  IPOs  and  FPOs. 
There were two FPOs worth ` 7,457 crore in 
2013-14 as compared to none in 2012-13. The 
share  of  public  issues  in  the  total  resource 
mobilisation increased to 91.8 percent during 
2013-14 from 72.4 percent during 2012-13 and 
the share of rights issues decreased from 27.6 
percent in 2012-13 to 8.2 percent in 2013-14

II.  Resource  Mobilisation  through  QIP 

and IPP

A.  QIP and IPP

Qualified 

institutions’ 

 
placement 
(QIP)  has  been  in  place  in  Indian  securities 
market  in  addition  to  the  public  and  rights 
issues  as  a  means  for  easing  the  process  of 
fund  raising  in  domestic  market.  In  a  QIP, 
a  listed  company  can  issue  equity  shares, 
fully  and  partly  convertible  debentures,  or 

any securities other than warrants which are 
convertible  to  equity  shares  to  a  Qualified 
Institutional Buyer (QIB).
 
IPP route was introduced by SEBI under 
Chapter VIII-A of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 
2009  during  the  financial  year  2011-12,  for 
the  purpose  of  achieving  minimum  public 
shareholding  in  terms  of  Rule  19(2)(b)  and 
19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) 
Rules, 1957. IPP route applies to issuance of 
fresh shares and/or offer for sale of shares in

a listed issue. It has been prescribed that this 
can be implemented by way of fresh issue of 
capital  by  such  companies.  Under  Chapter 
VIII-A  of  the  ICDR  Regulations,  any  offer, 
allocation and allotment of securities under 
the IPP route shall be made only to QIBs. 
 
During 2013-14, 17 issues raised a total of 
`13,663 crore through the QIP and IPP route, 

which was a decline of 14.6 percent from the 
`15,996 crore raised in 2012-13. (Table 2.7)
 
There were ten IPP issues in 2013-14 as 
compared to two in 2012-13. The total amount 
raised through the IPP issues in 2013-14 was 
`4,101 crore as compared to two IPP issues 
which raised `941 crore in 2012-13.

B.  Offer for Sale through Stock Exchange 

Mechanism 
Yet 

 
another  mechanism  made 
available  for  companies  to  comply  with 
MPS  requirement  is  the  offer  for  sale 
through  stock  exchange  mechanism  which 
was  introduced  in  February  2012.  It  is  the 
more  widely  used  mechanism  compared 
to  IPP.  In  2013-14,  71  companies  used  this 
route  through  BSE  and  NSE  to  conform  to 

the public shareholding norms as compared 
to  33  companies  in  2012-13.  However  the 
amount  mobilised  through  offers  for  sale 
reduced from `28,026 crore to `6,993 crore. 
M/s.  Oracle  Financial  Services  Software 
Limited  mobilised  the  highest  amount  of 
`1,227  crore  during  the  year  followed  by 
M/s.  L&T  Finance  Holdings  Limited  (`595 
crore) and M/s. MMTC Limited (`572 crore) 
(Table 2.8).

through 

Preferential Allotment
The  mode  of  preferential  allotment 
 
is  utilised  by  a  listed  company  to  issues 
equity shares / fully convertible debentures/
partly  convertible  debentures  or  any  other 
financial 
instruments  which  would  be 
converted  into  or  exchanged  with  equity

to take the permission of shareholders and 
should  comply  with  various  provisions 
which inter-alia include pricing, disclosures 
in the notice, lock-in, etc, in addition to the 
requirements  specified  in  the  Companies 
Act, 1956.

SECONDARY SECURITIES MARKET

Equity Markets 
I. 
India
A. 
During the year 2013-14, Indian equity 
 
markets surged to a new high resulting from 
an  improved  scenario  of  global  financial 
markets  and  strengthening  of  domestic 
macroeconomic factors. Markets have picked 
up  in  the  second  half  of  2013-14  guided  by 
exchange  rate  adjustments,  decisive  policy 
measures  and  anticipation  of  electoral 
outcomes.  The  onset  of  2014  has  seen  the 
increasing flow of capital, increased activity 
in  secondary  markets,  new  pinnacles  for 
benchmark indices and market capitalisation 
which has carved out an investment inducing 
and investor assuring climate.
 
The  economic  recovery  supported  by 
global growth and improved macroeconomic 

fundamentals  have  cushioned  the  Indian 
markets  of  any  spillover  from  the  events 
around  the  globe.  The  dampening  factors 
still  persist  in  the  form  of  low  industrial 
activity and high inflation numbers but are 
expected to be on an improvement path with 
corrective actions being in place. 
The  financial  year  began  on  a  low 
 
note for equity markets but soon picked up 
and  has  been  rising  since.  The  benchmark 
indices  BSE  Sensex  and  CNX  Nifty  crossed 
the  mark  of  22,386  and  6,704  respectively. 
The  FII  inflows  strengthened  during  the 
last quarter of the year reposing the faith in 
Indian markets while policy actions aimed at 
easing the process of investment for FIIs was 
welcomed.  Hence  with  a  slew  of  measures 
taken  and  favourable  turn  of  concurrent 
global  events,  the  markets  performed  well 
during the financial year.

Annual Report 2013-14

 
During 2013-14, the benchmark indices 
BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty increased by 18.8 
percent  and  18.0  percent  respectively,  over 
March 31, 2013 (Chart 2.3). BSE Sensex closed 
at  22,386  on  March  31,  2014  registering  an 
increase  of  3,550  points  over  18,836  as  on

BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty both reached 
their highest levels on March 31, 2014, when 
the  respective  indices  touched  the  levels  of 
22,386  and  6,704  which  is  also  the  all  time 
maximum level that these indices have ever 
attained.  BSE  Sensex  attained  the  lowest 
point  of  17,906  on  August  21,  2013  during 
the financial year while CNX Nifty touched 
a low of 5,285 on August 28, 2013 during the 
year. BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty recorded a 
highest gain of 3.8 percent on September 10, 

2013.  Both  the  indices  observed  the  highest 
fall of the financial year on August 16, 2013 
when  BSE  Sensex  fell  by  4.0  percent  while 
CNX Nifty fell by 4.1 percent.
In the cash segment, while the turnover 
 
at BSE declined by 4.9 percent, the turnover at 
NSE increased by 3.7 percent during 2013-14 
as compared to a fall of 17.8 percent and 3.7 
percent,  respectively  during  2012-13  (Table 
2.11).  The  derivative  segment  witnessed  a 
surge in turnover to the extent of 22.9 percent 
in 2013-14.
 
The  instrument-wise  composition  of 
the value traded in the secondary market is 
shown in Chart 2.4. In the Indian secondary 
market,  in  terms  of  traded  turnover,  the 
equity  derivative  lead  with  a  dominant 
share  of  80.7  percent  followed  by  currency 
derivatives (11.9 percent), cash segment (5.7 
percent) and corporate bonds (1.7 percent).

NSE scaled new highs in the financial year 
with  an  increase  of  16.1  and  16.6  percent 
respectively. P/E ratios increased during the

increased substantially in 2013-14 compared 
to the previous year.

International Comparison
 
Global markets while being tumultuous 
during  the  first  half  of  the  year,  recovered 
in the second half. While the global activity 
strengthened  and  is  expected  to  strengthen 
further,  the  downside  risks  which  have 
overall  moderated  still  persist  arising  from 
the  ongoing  tapering  of  quantitative  easing 
in  the  US,  weaker  balance  sheets  in  Euro 
area and inflationary pressures in emerging 
economies.  Certain  downside  risks  to  the 
world  economy  as  outlined  by  IMF  have 
been  a  yet-greater  general  slowdown  in 
emerging market economies, risks to activity 
from  lower  than  expected  inflation  rates  in 
advanced economies and rising geopolitical 
tensions. While US is moving from recovery 
to  growth  and  Euro  area  from  recession  to 
recovery, Japan and China are absorbed with 
the  tackling  of  domestic  economic  issues. 
Other  Emerging  Market  and  Developing 
Economies  (EMDEs)  have  been  benefitting 

in 

the  global 

from strong external demand from advanced 
economies and are expected to further grow.
 
The  second  half  of  the  financial  year 
saw  easing  of  tensions  and  remarkable 
improvements 
financial 
conditions. The US Fed QE tapering boosted 
the  global  market  sentiments.  The  turn  of 
events in Ukraine and Syria however didn’t 
affect  the  financial  market  health.  Most 
of  the  emerging  and  developed  markets 
witnessed  rebound  during  2013-14.  Among 
the  emerging  markets  the  annual  return  on 
a  point-to-point  basis  was  the  highest  in 
Argentina (56.1 percent) followed by Egypt 
(53.0 percent) and South Africa (19.3 percent). 
(Chart 2.5)
 
Among  the  developed  equity  markets, 
the  yearly  returns  were  highest  in  US  (29.6 
percent) followed by Japan (22.2 percent) and 
Germany  (20.3  percent).  The  declines  were 
the maximum for Russia (16.2 percent), Chile 
(14.6 percent) and Thailand (11.2 percent).

Widening  the  geographical  reach  of 
capital markets is one of the important aspect 
of  development  of  securities  markets  in 
India (Table 2.16). On-line trading facilities, 
dematerialised securities and electronic IPO 
application system are a few of the features 
that  catalyse  the  penetration  of  equity 
investment  culture  into  the  farthest  corners 
of  a  diverse  nation  like  India.  About  56.9 
percent of the total turnover of BSE and 59.5 
percent  of  the  total  turnover  at  NSE  was 
concentrated in Mumbai and Thane. At NSE, 
Delhi/Ghaziabad contributed 9.0 percent and 

Calcutta /Howrah accounted for 7.4 percent 
of  the  turnover.  On  the  other  hand  at  BSE, 
Calcutta and Ahmedabad accounted for 6.8 
percent and 5.5 percent of the total turnover 
respectively. The top five cities accounted for 
83.9  percent  of  the  turnover  at  NSE  during 
2013-14  compared  to  86.3  percent  in  2012-
13.  At  BSE,  78.2  percent  of  the  turnover  is 
contributed by top five cities during 2013-14. 
At  MCX-SX,  Hyderabad  accounted  for  the 
maximum share in turnover at 41.5 percent 
while  the  top  five  cities  contributed  86.9 
percent of the turnover at MCX-SX.

V.  Stock Market Indicators
 
The ratios such as market capitalisation 
to  GDP  (m-cap  ratio),  traded  value  to  GDP 
(traded value ratio) and price to earnings per 
share (P/E ratio) are monitored to gauge the 
extent of development of stock market. After 
declining for three successive years the market 
capitalisation  ratios  have  improved  during 
2013-14.  The  BSE  market  capitalisation  to 
GDP ratio has increased from 63.2 percent in 
2012-13 to 65.3 percent in 2013-14. Similarly, 

at  NSE  also  the  ratio  has  increased  from 
61.7  percent  in  2012-13  to  64.1  percent  in 
2013-14  (Table  2.19).  The  all-India  cash 
turnover  to  GDP  ratio  however  declined 
further  in  2013-14  to  29.5  percent  from 
32.2  percent  in  2012-13.  In  the  derivative 
segment, there was a substantial increase in 
the turnover-GDP ratio from 382.6 percent in 
2012-13 to 417.7 percent in 2013-14.

The  price  to  book  value  (P/B)  ratio  is 
another important indicator which measures 
the  returns  left  for  the  shareholders  after 
providing  for  liabilities  of  a  company.  The 

P/B ratio at the end of 2013-14 was the highest 
for the CNX IT index at 6.6, followed by CNX 
Nifty at 3.2, BSE Sensex at 2.7, and BSE 100 at 
2.4 (Table 2.21).

Japan  and  CAC  index  of  France  had  the 
highest P/E ratios. In the emerging markets 
category, Hermes index of Egypt, BUX index 
of  Hungary  and  MEXBOL  index  of  Mexico

back  in  2013-14  to  not  only  surpass  the 
previous  year  benchmarks  but  also  reach 
an  all  time  high  in  terms  of  benchmark 
indices  and  market 
in 
secondary markets. A host of domestic and 
global  factors  have  facilitated  this  revival 
that 
includes  various  politico-economic 
indicators as well. While lower trade deficit, 
lower CAD and lower inflation fuelled the 
buoyancy  outlining  the  investor  optimism. 
Mixed cues from overseas markets after US 

capitalisation 

consumer confidence slumped in September 
to a four-month low, further influenced the 
market  sentiment.  Expectations  that  the 
US  government’s  partial  shutdown  and 
US  political  impasse  could  lead  to  the  US 
Federal  Reserve  postponing  tapering  of 
monetary stimulus to the US economy also 
contributed to the volatility.
The annualised volatility of BSE Sensex, 
 
measured  by  standard  deviation  of  log 
returns, increased to 17.5 percent in 2013-14 
from 12.5 percent in 2012-13. Similar trend was 
also  observed  for  CNX  Nifty  which  moved 
to 18.1 percent from 12.9 percent during the 
same  period.  Month-wise  analysis  of  the 
volatility  of  benchmark  and  other  indices 
show that September 2013 has been the most 
volatile  month  in  2013-14  (Table  2.22).  The 
lowest  volatility  in  the  benchmark  indices 
was seen in March 2014. BSE Small cap index 
and CNX Nifty Junior witnessed the highest 
volatility in August 2013. Compared to other 
indices,  volatility  in  CNX  Bank  index  was 
high throughout the year.

VIII.  Activities of Stock Exchanges
 
Over  the  years,  NSE  and  BSE  have 
emerged as the nation-wide stock exchanges 
of  the  country  contributing  more  than  99 
percent  of  the  total  turnover.  During  the 
year  2013-14,  only  Calcutta  Stock  Exchange 
and MCX-SX were the exchanges apart from 
NSE and BSE which recorded some turnover 
(Table 2.26). 
 
During  2013-14,  the  all  India  turnover 
at  the  stock  exchanges  in  terms  of  number 
of  shares  traded  declined  by  10.1  percent 
on  the  top  of  decline  of  6.4  percent  during 
2012-13. While the number of shares traded 
and delivered at both BSE and NSE declined, 
the value of shares delivered increased over 
the  previous  year.  In  the  Calcutta  stock 

83

Annual Report 2013-14

exchange, shares traded and delivered along 
with the value of shares delivered fell during 
the  financial  year.  Of  the  total  quantity  of 
shares traded, NSE had the largest share of 
75.7 percent, followed by BSE (24.2 percent). 

NSE  had  a  share  of  64.7  percent  in  the 
quantity of shares delivered followed by BSE 
(35.3  percent).  In  the  total  value  of  shares 
delivered,  share  of  NSE  was  82.0  percent, 
followed by BSE at 18.0 percent.

Box 2.1: Testing of soĞ ware used in or related to trading and risk management

 
SoĞ ware / system change is a constant feature in the technology driven securities market. Such changes 
are  driven  by  a  combination  of  market  forces,  including  the  growth  of  exchanges,  the  drive  for  competitive 
advantage, new trading instruments and new compliance and regulation requirements. 
 
Requirement  of  frequent  system  changes  have  brought  to  fore  various  risks  associated  with  a  poorly 
developed / tested soĞ ware. Technology mishaps that have recently occurred in various capital markets across the 
globe have underscored the importance of testing of soĞ ware before deployment in production environment.
 
were recently taken by SEBI:
(a) 

With the view to streamline and strengthen the process of testing of soĞ ware, the following policy decisions 

 The process of testing would involve (a) Testing in a simulated test environment provided by the stock 
exchange, (b) Mock testing in close-to-real trading environment (c) User Acceptance Test (UAT) by the 
stock broker and (d) Submission of System Audit Report to the stock exchange.
 Stock exchange would grant approval to soĞ ware aĞ er ensuring that the requirements speciﬁ ed by SEBI / 
stock exchange with regard to soĞ ware are met. A speedy approval process may be prescribed for certain 
cases such as the soĞ ware which has already been tested in mock environment, changes which are due to 
change in stock exchange trading system, etc.
 Stock exchanges were asked to implement suitable mechanisms to ensure that no soĞ ware is used by stock 
broker without requisite approval.
 In order to facilitate suﬃ  cient liquidity for the stock brokers who are testing their systems in the mock 
session, all stock brokers that undertake algorithmic trading were advised to participate in the mock trading 
sessions, irrespective of the algorithm having undergone change or not. 
 Stock brokers are required to give an undertaking to the stock exchanges that every new soĞ ware and any 
change thereupon to the trading and/or risk management functionalities of the soĞ ware will be tested as 
per the framework prescribed by SEBI / stock exchange before deployment of such new / modiﬁ ed soĞ ware 
in securities market. 
 With  the  view  to  inculcate  high  standards  of  technology  risk  management  among  stock  brokers,  stock 
exchanges were advised to apply deterrent penalties in form of ﬁ nes and suspension to the stock broker 
whose system malfunctioned.

IX.  Dematerialisation
 
The  enactment  of  Depositories  Act 
in  August  1996  ushered  in  the  wave  of 
dematerialisation  by  the  establishment  of 
depositories. Dematerialisation has been the 
bedrock of capital market reforms since then as 
it paved the way for successive technological 
advancements  and  simplified  the  trading, 
settlement and record preservation.
At  the  end  of  March  2014,  there  are 
 
130.6  lakh  demat  accounts  at  NSDL  and 
87.8  lakh  demat  accounts  at  CDSL.  As  on 
March  31,  2014,  12,210  companies  have 
signed up for dematerialisation at NSDL and 
8,630  at  CDSL  (Table  2.28).  The  quantity  of 
dematerialised  securities  increased  by  15.9 
percent  to  79,55,034  lakh  in  2013-14  from 
68,64,758 lakh in 2012-13 at NSDL. At CDSL 

too, the quantity of dematerialised securities 
increased by 16.8 percent from 15,17,926 lakh 
in 2012-13 to 17,73,105 lakh in 2013-14. The 
quantity  of  dematerialised  shares  increased 
at the CDSL but both the quantity and value 
of  shares  settled  in  demat  declined.  On  the 
other  hand  at  NSDL,  the  value  of  shares 
settled  in  demat  increased  but  the  quantity 
of  shares  settled  in  demat  decreased.  The 
total value of demat settled shares increased 
by 6.2 percent from `12,72,531 crore in 2012-
13  to  `13,51,886  crore  in  2013-14  at  NSDL. 
However, at CDSL the value of shares settled 
in  demat  decreased  by  2.8  percent  from 
`3,18,559 crore in 2012-13 to  `3,09,767 crore 
in 2013-14. The ratio of dematerialised equity 
shares  to  total  outstanding  shares  of  listed 
companies  was  83.8  percent  at  NSDL  and 
13.8 percent at CDSL at the end of 2013-14.

X.  DERIVATIVES SEGMENT

Financial  derivatives  have  grossed 
a  central  place  in  the  financial  markets 
worldwide.  The  activity 
in  derivatives 
market  has  surpassed  the  growth  in  other 
spheres.  The  emergence  and  growth  of 
Indian derivatives market since its inception 
in  2000  has  been  phenomenal.  Within  the 
given  span  of  time,  Indian  Exchanges  and 
Indian  Derivative  products  feature  in  the 
Global rankings. 

Globally,  derivative  products  on 
volatility indices are widely used by market 
participants  as  tools  for  risk  management 
and to hedge against market volatility. SEBI 
has  permitted  introduction  of  derivatives 
on  ‘India  VIX’  to  National  Stock  Exchange 
(NSE) in January 2014, which is India’s first 
volatility  Index  and  is  a  key  measure  of 
market expectations of near-term volatility. 

A.  Equity Derivatives Segment 

The equity derivatives segment has been 
effervescent with activity during recent years. 
Along  with  NSE  and  BSE,  MCX-SX  which 
started  trading  in  equity  derivatives  in  Feb 
2013 registered significant volumes in 2013-
14. Indian Exchanges stand out in the list of top 
five exchanges on a number of parameters in 
2013 report of World Federation of Exchanges 

(WFE). NSE ranks 3rd in terms of number of 
single stock futures traded in 2013 as against 
the 4th position in 2012. NSE is the topmost 
exchange by number of index options traded 
in  2013  from  2nd  in  2012  while  BSE  ranks 
number five in the same category, retaining 
its  position  since  2012.  The  total  turnover 
in  2013-14  in  the  derivatives  segment  was 
approximately  14  times  of  the  turnover  in 
the cash market. NSE had the majority share 
in the trading volumes at 80.3 percent while 
BSE  contributed  19.4  percent  and  MCX-SX 
had a minor share of 0.3 percent.

The total number of contracts traded in 
the derivative segment of NSE increased by 
13.5  percent  to  128.4  crore  in  2013-14  from 
113.1crore  in  2012-13,  whereas,  at  BSE,  the 
number of contracts traded increased by 15.1 
percent from 26.2 crore in 2012-13 to 30.2 crore 
in 2013-14. The value of the contracts traded 
in the derivative segment of NSE increased 
by 21.2 percent to `3.82 crore in 2013-14 from 
`3.15 crore in 2012-13, whereas the turnover 
at the derivatives segment of BSE increased 
by  28.7  percent  to  `92,19,434  crore  in  2013-
14 from `71,63,519 crore in 2012-13. The open 
interest  in  the  derivative  segment  of  NSE 
increased  by  44.7  percent  to  `1,24,378  crore 
at  the  end  of  2013-14  from  `85,952  crore  at 
the end of 2012-13.

Annual Report 2013-14

In  the  index  derivatives  segment  of 
NSE, derivatives are offered on the following 
indices- Nifty, Nifty Midcap 50, Bank Nifty, 
CNX  Infra,  CNX  IT  and  CNX  PSE.  Index 
derivatives are also allowed in three foreign 
indices viz., Dow Jones index, S&P 500 and 
UK FTSE 100 index. In BSE also futures are 
available on foreign indices, viz., HSI index, 
MICEX index, FTSE/JSE top40 and Bovespa 
index.

On an average, for 2013-14, Nifty futures 
and options accounted for around 90 percent 
of  the  turnover  when  classified  instrument-
wise.  Bank  Nifty  shared  a  distant  second 
position with a share ranging from 6.4 percent 
to 12.1 percent. At BSE, however, the share of 
derivatives on BSE Sensex fluctuated widely 
between 0.02 percent to 100 percent. Turnover 
of  derivatives  on  BSE  100  also  fluctuated 
similarly from 0.0 percent to 99.9 percent.

3.  MUTUAL FUNDS

Over  the  years,  SEBI  has  been  taking 
several steps to re-energise the mutual fund 
industry.  Some  of  the  measures  include 
the  penetration  of  mutual  fund  products, 
improving  the  reach  of  MF  products  in 
smaller  cities  and  towns  beyond  the  top 
15  cities,  alignment  of  interest  of  investors, 
etc. In 2013-14, SEBI has framed a long term 
policy  for  mutual  funds  in  India  which 
inter  alia  includes  enhancing  the  reach  of 
mutual  fund  products,  promoting  financial 
inclusion, tax treatment, obligation of various 
stakeholders,  increasing  transparency  etc. 
SEBI  endeavours  to  constantly  revisit  the 

98

regulations so that the mutual fund industry 
mobilises  a  larger  chunk  of  the  domestic 
savings of Indian household.

The future of the mutual fund industry 
is  dependent  on  increasing  the  financial 
literacy  and  showcasing  the  suitability  of 
mutual funds in an investor’s portfolio. AMCs 
and product distributors must work closely 
to achieve the target of higher penetration of 
mutual funds and household savings. There 
is  a  very  important  role  of  independent 
financial institutions apart from banks in the 
growth and stability of the economy and the 
capital markets.

in 

2013-14.  The 

Mutual  fund  industry  continued  to 
exhibit  positive  growth  in  assets  under 
management 
gross 
mobilisation  of  resources  by  all  mutual 
funds during 2013-14 was at `97,68,100 crore 
compared  to  `72,67,885  crore  during  the 
previous year indicating an increase of 34.4 
percent over the previous year (Table 2.41). 
Correspondingly, redemption also increased 
by  35.1  percent  to  `97,14,318  crore  in  2013-
14  from  `71,91,346  crore  in  2012-13.  The 
net  resources  mobilised  by  all  the  mutual 
funds aggregated to `53,782 crore in 2013-14 
compared  to  net  inflow  of  `76,539  crore  in 
2012-13.

As  of  at  the  end  of  March  2014,  the 
cumulative  net  assets  managed  by  all  the 
mutual  funds  totaled  to  `8,25,240  crore  as 
against  `7,01,443  crore  at  the  end  of  March 
2013, representing a rise 17.6 percent.

Sector-wise Resource Mobilisation
sector  mutual 

funds 
retained  the  dominant  place  in  the  mutual 

The  private 

fund  industry  with  82.4  percent  share  in 
the  gross  resource  mobilisation  and  90.8 
percent in the net resource mobilisation. The 
corresponding  shares  of  UTI  mutual  fund 
and other public sector mutual funds was 8.2 
percent and 9.4 percent in the gross resource 
mobilisation and 0.7 percent and 8.4 percent 
in the net resource mobilisation.

In  absolute  terms,  the  gross  resource 
mobilisation by private sector mutual funds 
rose  by  35.8  percent  to  `80,49,397  crore  in 
2013-14  from  `59,27,947  crore  in  2012-13 
(Table  2.42).  Due  to  the  heavy  redemptions 
in  the  last  three  quarters  of  2013-14,  the 
net  resource  mobilisation  by  private  sector 
mutual  funds  declined  by  25.0  percent  to 
`48,838 crore in 2013-14 compared to `65,102 
crore  in  2012-13.  The  net  resources  raised 
by UTI mutual fund and other public sector 
mutual funds was much lesser at `401 crore 
and `4,542 crore respectively in 2013-14 and 
represented  a  decline  of  91.3  percent  and 
33.3  percent  respectively  over  the  previous 
financial year.

During  2013-14,  while  open-ended 
schemes  witnessed  net  outflows,  the  close 
ended  schemes 
recorded  positive  net 
inflows. 

Scheme-wise  pattern  reveals  that  net 
inflows  were  positive  for  all  the  scheme 
categories  except  growth/equity  oriented 
schemes, balanced, gold ETF and Gilt Funds. 
The  huge  redemption  pressure  in  growth 
schemes had resulted in largest net outflows 
amounting  to  `9,268  crore  during  the  year 
(Table 2.43). Fixed income schemes registered 
the highest net inflows amounting to `63,339 
crore in 2013-14. 

The  highest  percentage  rise  in  the 
net  resource  mobilisation  was  in  Fund  of 
Funds  investing  overseas  schemes  which 
witnessed  a  net  inflow  of  `1,101  crore  in 
2013-14  registering  an  increase  in  AUM  of 
55.3  percent.  Liquid/Money  market  inflows 
have increased manifold to `24,098 crore in 
2013-14 from `3,226 crore in 2012-13. Even as 
gold continues to emerge as a popular asset 
since 2008, Gold ETF schemes experienced an 
outflow of `2,293 crore on top of the decline 
of  61.2  percent  observed  in  previous  year. 
The AUM of Gold ETFs in 2013-14 declined 
to the extent of 25.5 percent in 2013-14 over 
the previous financial year.

Part Two: Review of Working and Operations of SEBI in the Securities Market

Mutual  Funds  have  historically  been 
investing  more  in  debt  than  equity.  During 
2013-14,  the  combined  net  investments  by 
the  mutual  funds  in  debt  and  equity  was 
`5,22,023  crore  compared  to  `4,50,711  crore 
in  2012-13,  accounting  an  increase  of  15.8 
percent  (Table  2.45).  Mutual  Funds  were 
net  sellers  in  equity  segment  to  the  tune  of 
`21,224 crore, whereas, their net investments 
in  the  debt  segment  rose  to  `5,43,247  crore 
during  the  same  period.  Since  2009-10,  on 
an yearly basis there has been offloading of 
investments by mutual funds from the equity 
market. Investments in the debt segment was 
the  highest  in  March  2014  (`99,457  crore) 
followed by September 2013 (`81,970 crore). 
While  the  net  investments  of  mutual  funds 
in the debt segment were positive for all the 
months  during  the  year,  that  in  the  equity 
segment were negative for all months except 
August 2013.

Unit holding pattern

As on March 31, 2014, while individuals 
subscribed  97.4  percent  of  the  total  folios, 
their  share  in  the  total  net  assets  was  45.1 
percent  (Table  2.46).  On  the  other  hand, 
corporate/institutions  had  a  miniscule 
share of 0.9 percent in the total number of 
folios, their share in the total net assets was 
a  sizeable  50.2  percent.  In  comparison  to 
2012-13,  the  share  of  corporate  in  the  total 

folios  had  declined  but  share  in  net  assets 
had increased. NRIs/OCBs with 1.7 percent 
share in folios had 3.8 percent share in total 
net assets.

Similar  to  the  previous  year,  the  net 
FII  investment  was  the  highest  in  the  last 
quarter of the financial year. The highest net 
investment was registered for the month of 
March 2014 (`31,663 crore) followed by May 
2013  (`28,138  crore)  and  December  2013 
(`21,376 crore). All these months were led by 
a dominant share of FII investment in equity 
markets  viz.,  63.4  percent,  78.8  percent  and 
75.3 percent respectively. In the debt segment 
too, net investments were the highest in the 
last  quarter  of  2013-14.  Month  wise  trends 
of the net investments into the debt segment 
show  that  the  investment  was  the  highest 
in  January  2014  (`12,609  core)  followed  by 
March  2014  (`11,586  crore),  and  February

class of investors, FPIs, would encompass all 
FIIs, their sub-accounts and qualified foreign 
investors (QFIs).

The  total  net  investment  of  QFIs  in 
equity  and  corporate  debt,  was  `583  crore 
and  `1,520  crore  respectively  in  2013-14.  In

6.  OTHER  ACTIVITIES  HAVING  A 
BEARING  ON  THE  WORKING 
OF THE SECURITIES MARKET

I.  Corporate Bond Market 

The  corporate  bond  market  in  India 
represents about 3.8 percent of India’s Gross 
Domestic  Product  (GDP).  Equity  markets 
stand  way  ahead  of  the  bond  markets  in 
terms  of  issuances  and  as  a  proportion  of 
GDP. A developed bond market is conducive 
to  cheaper  fund  raising  by  any  entity  as 
compared to syndicated bank finance. 

At present, Indian corporate debt market 
is  dominated  by  privately  placed  securities 
which are subsequently listed at exchanges. 
Private  Placement  is  the  preferred  route 
for  its  obvious  advantages  like  operational 
ease,  minimal  disclosures  and  lower  costs. 
Further,  Indian  corporate  bond  market  is 
characterised  by  dominance  of  government 
owned  companies,  and  quasi  government 
entities. 

The  reporting  platforms  for  corporate 
bonds  have  been  set  up  and  maintained 
by  BSE,  NSE  and  FIMMDA  to  capture 

112

Part Two: Review of Working and Operations of SEBI in the Securities Market

information  related  to  trading  in  corporate 
bonds. While the secondary market trading 
of  corporate  bonds  issued  under  a  public 
issue takes place in the exchanges along with 
equities, trading of privately placed corporate 
bonds  in  the  secondary  market  happens  in 
OTC category. The deals with value of more 
than one lakh rupees are reported over NSE, 
BSE  and  FIMMDA  platforms  within  thirty 
minutes of the closing of the deal .

is 

the 

FIMMDA 

largest  reporting 
platform for the OTC deals in the corporate 
bond  market.  The  share  of  FIMMDA  in 
the  total  reporting  has  increased  from  41.5 
percent  in  2008-09  to  59.3  percent  in  2013-
14  due  to  reporting  by  the  RBI  regulated 
entities  over  the  FIMMDA  platform.  The 

number of trades reported at FIMMDA had 
risen  in  2013-14  to  39,891  and  the  value  of 
trades reported also rose by 33.1 percent to 
`5,92,071  crore  over  the  previous  financial 
year. During 2013-14, there was a substantial 
rise in the total value of the corporate bond 
trades at BSE to the extent of 99.6 percent to 
`1,03,027  crore  from  `51,622  crore  in  2012-
13.  The  number  of  trades  at  BSE  increased 
by 17.9 percent in 2013-14 over the previous 
financial year. At NSE, while the number of 
trades declined by 1.6 percent, the value of 
trades  increased  by  13.9  percent  in  2013-14 
over the previous financial year. At MCX-SX, 
the trading in corporate bond started in July 
2013 and recorded 758 trades with a value of 
`28,139 crore during 2013-14 (Table 2.59).

II.  Trading  and  Settlement  Practices  at 

Stock Exchanges
Stock  exchanges  offer  online, 

 
fully 
automated, anonymous, order driven, screen-
based trading system to the investors through 
their members. In this system, members can 
enter  the  quantities  of  securities  and  the 
prices  at  which  they  would  like  to  transact, 
and the transaction is executed as soon as it 
finds a matching sale for the buy order for a 
counterparty from the order book.
 
The  clearing  and  settlement  process 
involves  three  main  activities  —  clearing, 
settlement,  and 
risk  management.  The 
clearing  process  involves  determining  what 
the counterparties owe and what they are due 
to receive on the settlement date, after which  
the obligations are discharged by settlement.

A.  Cash Segment
 
The core processes involved in clearing 
and  settlement  include  (a)  Determination  of 
Obligation, (b) Pay-in of Funds and Securities, 
and (c) Pay-out of Funds and Securities. The 
clearing  corporation  (CC)  clears  and  settles 
trades  as  per  the  well-deﬁned  settlement 

119

cycles. All the securities are being traded and 
settled under T+2 rolling settlement. In case of 
institutional trades, the CC notiﬁes the relevant 
trade  details  to  clearing  members  (CMs)/
custodians on the trade day (T), which needs 
to be confirmed by T+1 to CC. Subsequently, 
the  CC  determines 
the  obligations  of 
counterparties  and  sends  the  obligations  to 
members. A CM has to pay-in/pay-out funds 
and/or  securities.  The  obligations  are  netted 
for a member across all securities to determine 
his fund and securities obligations and he has 
to either pay or receive funds and securities. 
Members’  pay-in/pay-out  obligations  are 
determined latest by T+1 and are forwarded to 
them on the same day, so that they can settle 
their  obligations  on  T+2.  The  securities  and 
funds are paid-in and paid-out on T+2 day to 
the members and the settlement is complete 
in two days from the trading day. In case of 
shortage of securities, auction takes place on 
T+2 day and then settled on T+3 days.
F&O  Segment
B. 
 
The positions in the futures contracts for 
each member is marked-to-market to the daily 
settlement price of the futures contracts at the 

Annual Report 2013-14

end of each trade day. The profits/ losses are 
computed as the difference between the trade 
price  or  the  previous  day’s  settlement  price, 
as  the  case  may  be,  and  the  current  day’s 
settlement  price.  Further,  on  the  expiry  of 
the futures contracts, CC marks all positions 
of a CM to the final settlement price and the 
resulting profit / loss is settled in cash. The final 
settlement  of  the  futures  contracts  is  similar 
to the daily settlement process except for the 
method  of  computation  of  final  settlement 
price.  The  final  settlement  of  profit  /  loss  is 
computed  as  the  difference  between  trade 
price  or  the  previous  day’s  settlement  price, 
as  the  case  may  be,  and  the  final  settlement 
price of the relevant futures contract. In case 
of  options,  the  premium  settlement  is  cash 
settled and settlement style is premium style. 
The premium payable position and premium 
receivable  positions  are  netted  across  all 
option  contracts  for  each  CM  at  the  client 
level  to  determine  the  net  premium  payable 
or receivable amount, at the end of each day. 
Final exercise settlement is effected for option 
positions at in-the-money strike prices existing 
at the close of trading hours, on the expiration 
day of an option contract.

C.  Risk Management
 
A  sound  risk  management  system  is 
integral  to  an  efficient  settlement  system. 
Membership of exchanges and their clearing 
corporations are granted only after satisfying 
minimum  net-worth 
and 
depositing  base  minimum  capital  with 
exchanges  and  liquid  net-worth  with  CC. 
Further,  members  have  to  deposit  collateral 
with  exchanges/CC  which  can  be  used  for 
margins  for  trading  positions.    As  soon  as 
trade  is  executed,  capital  adequacy  check  is 
carried out by the CC and portion of collateral 
deposited by broker is blocked commensurate 

requirements 

120

to the requisite margins on the positions taken. 
Margins/liquid assets deposited by members 
are  in  the  form  of  cash  and  cash  equivalent 
(cash,  fixed  deposits,  bank  guarantees  etc) 
and other liquid assets (Group I liquid eligible 
securities after appropriate hair-cuts etc) with 
cash  equivalents  required  to  be  at  least  50 
percent of liquid assets.

III.  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 

between Stock Exchanges
Pursuant  to  Section  13  of  Securities 
 
Contracts 
(Regulation)  Act,  1956,  stock 
exchanges  can  enter  into  a  MoU  with  any 
recognised  stock  exchange  outside  its  area 
of  operation  to  enable  the  investors  to  buy 
and sell securities through such trading floor 
under the regulatory framework of that stock 
exchange. Vide the same provisions, Madhya 
Pradesh  Stock  Exchange  operationalised 
trading under such MoU with NSE and BSE. 
Further, Madras Stock Exchange and Calcutta 
Stock Exchange have operationalised trading 
with NSE.

IV.  Steps  taken  by  SEBI  to  ring-fence 

MCX-SX
The recognition of MCX-SX was renewed 
 
vide gazette notification dated September 12, 
2013,  for  the  period  September  16,  2013  to 
September 15, 2014. In view of developments 
in M/s. National Spot Exchange Ltd. (NSEL), 
which  is  regulated  by  Forward  Markets 
Commission 
(FMC)  and  promoted  by 
M/s.  Financial  Technologies  (India)  Ltd. 
(FTIL), while renewing recognition of MCX-
SX for a period of one year in September 2013, 
certain conditions were imposed to ring-fence 
MCX-SX  from  the  NSEL  crisis.  The  said 
conditions were as under:  
a.  A  committee  comprising  of  two  Public 
Interest  Directors  and  three  nominees 

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

 

 

 

 
 

 

b. 

c. 

from  institutional  investors  in  MCX-SX 
shall be constituted within two days of 
renewal  of  recognition  to  oversee  the 
following functions of the exchange: 
•  All  financial  transactions  related 
to 
and 
borrowing  of  funds  and  related 
party  transactions  as  defined  in 
Accounting Standards 18;

investment, 

lending, 

•  Appointment  of  key  management 

personnel;

•  All  facility  /  infrastructure  sharing 

arrangements;

•  All major capital expenditure;
•  and advise the board on all the major 

policy matters. 

The board will consider the advice and 
maintain a record of the proceedings. A 
committee  on  the  same  lines  may  also 
be  constituted  by  MCX-SX  CCL  which 
is  the  subsidiary  of  MCX-SX.  The  said 
committee shall oversee the clearing and 
settlement  function  in  addition  to  the 
functions listed above.
In order to further secure the management 
of the exchange and clearing corporation, 
shareholders  of  MCX-SX  and  MCX-SX 
CCL  in  AGM  /  EGM  would  examine 
conflict  of 
interest  and  compliance 
with  SECC  (Regulations),  2012  by  the 
directors  and  the  key  management 
personnel including managing director, 
and  take  appropriate  action  including 
reconstitution  of  board,  reappointment 
of any key management personnel and 
will report to SEBI within 30 days from 
the date of renewal of recognition.
Thereafter,  MCX-SX  and  MCX-SX  CCL 
held  an  EGM  on  October  9,  2013  to 
discuss  and  decide  on  the  compliance 

121

with  SEBI  directions  issued  vide  letter 
dated September 12, 2013.

d.  Before the commencement of the EGM, 
MD and CEO, a then existing shareholder 
director  were  made  to  resign  from  the 
Board  of  Directors  with 
immediate 
effect.

e.  A comprehensive audit has been initiated

Annual Report 2013-14

VI.  Measures  adopted  for  regulation  of 

Stock Exchanges
 
During  2013-14,  in  order  to  improve 
the  effectiveness  of  monitoring  mechanism 
of stock exchanges to ascertain the adequacy 
and  accuracy  of  disclosures  made 
in 
compliance  with  the  Listing  Agreement, 
the  stock  exchanges  were  advised  to  put  in 
place  appropriate  framework  to  effectively 
monitor  the  disclosure  and  for  handling 
complaints 
inadequate  and 
inaccurate  disclosures  and  non-compliances. 
SEBI also decided to streamline the processes 

related 

to 

and  procedures  with  regard  to  actions  for 
non-compliances of certain listing conditions 
which have so far been considered as grounds 
for  suspension  of  trading  by  the  recognised 
stock exchanges (Box 3.1).
 
With  a  view  to  streamline  the  investor 
grievance  mechanism  and  the  arbitration 
mechanism  at  the  stock  exchanges,  various 
measures  were  adopted  during  2013-14  like 
widened jurisdiction for appealing before the 
courts, increase in number of investor service 
centers  facilitating  arbitration,  facilitation 
desks at all investor service centers etc.

Box 3.1 :  Standard Operating Procedure for stock exchanges for suspension and revocation of 
trading of shares of listed entities for non-compliance  of certain listing conditions

For non-compliance with listing conditions, exchanges have been suspending the trading of the shares of the listed 
companies, which aﬀ ected the interest of non-promoters much more than the promoters, as the exit route used 
to be closed for such investors aĞ er suspension of trading. Therefore, it was decided that the exchange, in case of 
non compliant companies, would resort to several other measures such as imposition of ﬁ nes, freezing of shares of 
the promoter and promoter group, transferring the trading in the shares of the company to separate category, etc., 
before suspending the shares of the company.
Accordingly, to maintain consistency and uniformity of approach by the stock exchanges for taking action against 
the listed entities for non-compliance with certain important listing conditions, SEBI vide circular dated September 
30, 2013 has prescribed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for suspension and revocation of suspension of trading 
in the shares.
The salient features of the circular are as follows:
(cid:2)  Imposition of ﬁ nes (on per day basis) on the company for non-compliance and delay in compliance with 
continuous  listing  conditions  such  as  submission  of  shareholding  paĴ ern,  ﬁ nancial  results,  corporate 
governance report, etc.

(cid:2)  In case of non-compliance for two consecutive quarters, moving the shares of non-compliant company to "Z" 

category, where the trades would be seĴ led on Trade for Trade basis.

(cid:2)  In case non-compliance continues, freezing the shares of the promoter and promoter group. This would be 

carried out before suspension of the trading of shares of the company.

(cid:2)  In order to provide exit window for the non-promoters, aĞ er 15 days of suspension, trading in the shares of 
non-compliant entity will be available on the "Trade for Trade" basis, on the ﬁ rst trading day of every week 
for six months.

 
2.  REGISTRATION 

AND 
REGULATION  OF  WORKING  OF 
INTERMEDIARIES  ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE SECURITIES MARKET 
 
SEBI  has  framed  regulations  under 
the SEBI Act, 1992 and the Depositories Act, 
1996  for  the  registration  and  regulation  of 

all  market  intermediaries.  Under  these  Acts, 
the Government and SEBI issue notifications, 
guidelines  and  circulars  that  the  market 
intermediaries need to comply with. There are 
a large variety and number of intermediaries 
who operate in Indian securities markets under 
the  respective  regulations.  SEBI  ensures  the 

122

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

standard  and  quality  of  service  provided  by 
intermediaries to the clients and investors, fair 
and sound conduct and compliance practices.

/ 

to rationalize the time taken, documentation 
involved and to avoid duplication of efforts, 
SEBI 
(Stock  Brokers  and  Sub  Brokers) 
Regulations, 1992 were amended and notified 
on September 27, 2013.  The primary objective 
of the amendment was to replace the existing 
requirement of obtaining multiple registrations 
for  operating  in  different  segments  of  a  stock 
exchange  with  a  single  registration  per  stock 
exchange (Box 3.2). 

I. 

Streamlining  the  Process  of  Initial 
Permanent Registration of Intermediaries
The  process 

 
the 
registration  of  intermediaries  and  approvals 
by  enhancing  the  levels  of  transparency 
continued during the year 2013-14. With a view 

for 

streamlining 

Box 3.2: Simplification of Registration Requirements for Stock Brokers

In 2011, SEBI dispensed with the requirement of intermediaries to obtain prior approval from SEBI for change in 
status or constitution. The intermediaries now require to take prior approval from SEBI only for change in control 
as against a number of approvals required earlier. Also, if the applicant holds multiple registrations with SEBI, 
it is required to make only one application to SEBI for prior approval in case of change in control. Subsequently, 
permanent  registration  was  introduced  for  merchant  bankers,  registrars  to  an  issue  and  share  transfer  agents, 
depository participants, credit rating agencies and debenture trustees. Vide amendment dated July 5, 2011 to the 
regulations  the  aforesaid  intermediaries  were  granted  initial  registration  for  a  period  of  five  years.  Thereafter, 
they could apply for permanent registration instead of earlier requirement of periodical renewal of certificate of 
registration. 
One registration per Stock Exchange for Stock Brokers
In continuation to the simplification of prior approval and permanent registration requirements, concept of single 
registration per stock exchange has now been introduced for stock brokers. Initially, applicants were required to 
obtain multiple certificates of registration from SEBI while operating in each segment viz. equity, equity derivative, 
currency derivative, debt of a stock exchange/ clearing corporation, and for each category viz. Trading Member, 
Trading Cum Self Clearing Member, Trading Cum Clearing Member and Professional Clearing Member. These 
applications  were  processed  at  stock  exchange/  clearing  corporation  level  and  then  submitted  to  SEBI  for  final 
approval i.e. issuing certification of registration.
With a view to rationalize the time taken, documentation involved and to avoid duplication of efforts, the registration 
requirements for stock broker/ clearing member were simplified by amendment to the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub 
Brokers) Regulations, 1992, notified on September 27, 2013. 
Revised registration procedure
(cid:2) If a new entity intends to register as a stock broker/ clearing member in any segment(s) of a stock exchange/ 
clearing corporation, the entity shall apply to SEBI through the respective stock exchange/ clearing corporation 
in the manner prescribed in the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992 in any one segment. 
The  entity  shall  be  issued  a  certificate  with  a  unique  registration  number  for  each  stock  exchange/clearing 
corporation, as the case may be, irrespective of number of segments.

(cid:2) If an entity is already registered with SEBI in any segment of a stock exchange/ clearing corporation, then for 
operating in any other segment of that stock exchange/ clearing corporation (promoted by that stock exchange), 
the entity need not apply to SEBI. The entity can directly seek approval from the concerned stock exchange or 
clearing corporation as per the procedure prescribed in the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 
1992 for the same.

(cid:2) The stock exchange or clearing corporation shall grant approval for any additional segment to the stock broker, 
self-clearing  member  or  clearing  member,  as  the  case  may  be,  after  exercising  due  diligence  and  on  being 
satisfied about the compliance of all relevant eligibility requirements and shall inform the Board about such 
grant of approval.

123

Annual Report 2013-14

 
The  policy  of  sending  response  to  the 
applicants,  in  a  time-bound  manner  i.e., 
within 30 days was adhered to in case of initial 
as well as permanent registrations. The status 
of  processing  of  each  application  for  initial/
permanent  registration  of 
intermediaries 
clearly  indicating  the  reasons  for  pendency 
and also whether pending with SEBI or with 
the  intermediary,  was  displayed  on  SEBI 
website  on  a  monthly  basis.  With  a  view 
to  ensure  higher  level  of  transparency  and 
accountability within SEBI, it is also mentioned 
on  the  website  that  in  case  any  application 
remains unattended, the applicant should not 
hesitate  to  approach  the  concerned  Division 
Chief or the Executive Director of the Market 
Intermediaries  Regulation  and  Supervision 
Department. 
 
The  practice  of  seeking  details  of 
corrective  measures  taken  by  the  applicants 
where  administrative  and  quasi-judicial 
actions  have  been  initiated  by  SEBI  against 
them  or  their  associate  companies,  before 
granting  registrations  or  other  approvals, 
has greatly improved the compliance culture 
among the intermediaries.  

II.  Measures 

for 

Regulation 

of 

Intermediaries
 
SEBI simplified the transmission process 
followed  by  STAs  and  RTIs  to  make  it  more 
efficient and investor friendly. The KYC norms 
were rationalised for eligible foreign investors 
investing  under  the  Portfolio  Investment 
Scheme (PIS) route to risk based KYC norms 
depending  on  investor  categories.  Aadhar 
e-KYC  service 
launched  by  UIDAI  was 
notified as a valid process for KYC verification. 
Guidelines were issued for dealing with conflict 
of  interest  for  investment  /trading  by  CRAs, 
or  their  access  persons  and  other  employees. 
In  consonance  with  IOSCO  Principle  8,  SEBI 

124

issued guidelines for avoiding or dealing with 
conflict of interest for all intermediaries, stock 
exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories 
and  their  associated  persons  in  securities 
market.  While  the  compliance  mechanism 
of  stock  brokers  was  strengthened  through 
internal audit process, steps were also taken to 
make the penalty structure for violations of SEBI 
(Stock  Broker  and  Sub  Broker)  Regulations, 
1992 more stringent.

III.  Registration of Stock Brokers 
A.  Cash Segment
 
During  2013-14,  217  new  stock  brokers 
were  registered  with  SEBI  in  cash  segment 
compared  to  1,081  in  2012-13.  Further,  there 
were 934 cases of reconciliation/ cancellation/ 
surrender of brokers in 2013-14 compared to 
260 in 2012-13.  The total number of registered 
stock brokers as on March 31, 2014, decreased 
to 9,411 from 10,128 in 2012-13 (Table 3.3).

The  wide  disparity  reflected  in  the  new 
registrations  between  2012-13  and  2013-14  can 
be  attributed  partly  to  the  higher  number  of 
registrations  granted  in  2012-13  to  the  stock 
brokers for trading on the new stock exchange, 
MCX-SX. In 2012-13, 529 registration certificates 
were issued to the stock brokers for trading in 
MCX-SX. Another reason for the decline is the 

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

new  policy  adopted  in  the  year  2013-14  of 
granting single registration per stock exchange 
instead of multiple registrations. Applications 
of brokers and sub-brokers in the process of 
registration are given in Table 3.4.

(1,316)  and  BSE  (1,316),  Calcutta  Stock 
Exchange  (CSE)  (853)  and  Inter-Connected 
Stock  Exchange  (ISE)  (835).  The  number  of 
corporate brokers was highest in NSE (1,167) 
followed  by  BSE  (1,120),  MCX-SX  (493)  and 
OTCEI  (471).  In  the  major  stock  exchanges, 
corporate  brokers  dominated  the  trading 
segment.  Corporate  brokers  constituted  93.2 
percent  of  the  total  stock  brokers  at  MCX-
SX  whereas  at  NSE,  BSE  and  OTCEI,  their 
share was 88.7 percent, 85.1 percent and 76.5 
percent respectively. Highest number of stock 
brokers  in  ‘proprietorship’  category  was  at 
CSE (603), followed by ISE (507). Stock brokers 
in ‘partnership’ category were the highest in 
NSE (79), followed by CSE (43) (Table 3.5). 

Note:  These  applications  are  pending  at  different  stages 
viz.  stock  exchanges/stock  brokers  for  want  of  documents/
clarifications or under process in SEBI.

IV.  Registration of Sub-brokers 
 

The  number  of  registered  sub-brokers 

Table 3.9:  Registered Sub-brokers

has declined by 26.1 percent (from 70,178 as on 
March 31, 2013 to 51,885 as on March 31, 2014).  
However, the number of Authorised Persons 
(APs)  as  approved  by  the  stock  exchanges 
in  accordance  with  SEBI  Guidelines  has 
increased substantially by 29.9 percent during 
the year (from 1,25,273 as on March 31, 2013 to 
1,62,679 as on March 31, 2014).  Stock brokers 
were  allowed  to  provide  market  access  to 
clients  through  APs,  in  addition  to  sub-

OF 
ORGANISATIONS
 
SEBI  (Self  Regulatory  Organisations), 
2004  was  notified  on  February  19,  2004 
with  the  objective  to  promote  organisation 
of  intermediaries  representing  a  particular 
segment  of  the  securities  market  as  a  self 
regulated  entity  /  organisation.    To  enable 
the  setting  up  of  an  SRO  for  distributors, 
the  SEBI  (Self  Regulatory  Organisations) 
(Amendment)  Regulations, 
2013  were 
notified on January 7, 2013 which stated that 
distributors shall be deemed as intermediaries. 
A  public  notice  was  issued  on  March  21, 
2013  inviting  applications  from  any  group 
or  association  of 
intermediaries  which 
are  desirous  of  being  recognized  as  a  Self 
Regulatory  Organisation  in  terms  of  SEBI 
(Self Regulatory Organisations) Regulations, 
2004 for distributors of mutual fund products, 
by making an application as prescribed in the 
said Regulations.  
 
During  2013-14,    SEBI  decided  to  have 
a single SRO for distributors of mutual fund 
products and a two stage procedure for grant 
of  recognition  as  SRO  for  distributors  of 
mutual fund product i.e. grant of in-principle 
approval  and  grant  of  recognition.  SEBI 
received  three  applications  for  recognition 
as SRO and in the matter regarding selection 
of SRO, a case has been filed and the same is 
pending before Securities Appelate Tribunal.

by  detecting  market  frauds  on  a  proactive 
basis,  investigating  abusive,  manipulative 
or  illegal  trading  practices  in  the  securities 
markets and taking punitive steps to punish 
the  manipulators.  Market  surveillance  helps 
in ensuring integrity of markets by enabling a 
safe and sound environment where buyers and 
sellers are willing to participate confidently.

price rise by placing orders for one share 
for each buy order in several instances.

C.  Transferring  shares  in  off  market  and 
then reversing the trade and buying the 
same  back  in  the  market,  resulting  in 
artificial volumes.
Increasing the price of the scrips in the 
last  few  minutes  of  trading  hours 
affecting  the  closing  price  of  the  scrip 
on  the  day.  Subsequently,  significant 
quantity of call options is exercised after 
closing of the market, resulting in profits.
creating 
false  or  misleading  appearance  of 
trading in the securities market, entering 
into    transactions  in  securities  without 
the intention of performing it or without 
intention  of  change  of  ownership  of 
security  and  manipulating  the  price  of 
scrip.

K.  Order in respect of Mrs. Vibha Sharma, 
Mr.  Jitendra  Kumar  Sharma  in  the 
matter of Central Bank of India
 
One Mrs. Vibha Sharma was observed to 
be front running the orders of Central Bank of 
India. Investigations revealed that Mr.  Jitendra 
Sharma,  husband  of  Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma, 
was  an  employee  of  Central  Bank  of  India 
working  as  an  equity  dealer.  Investigations 
also revealed that Mrs. Vibha Sharma bought 
shares  in  the  morning  at  around  the  last 
traded price (LTP) and placed sell orders at a 
price which was much higher (around three 
percent or more above LTP) but just below the 
buy order price of the trades of Central Bank 
of India. Thus there was 100 percent matching 
of  her  sell  orders  with  the  buy  orders  of 
Central  Bank  of  India  on  14  trading  days. 
Accordingly,  Adjudication  proceedings  was 
initiated  against  (1)  Mr.  Jitendra  Sharma  for 
passing  on  confidential  information  related 
to  trading  by  Central  Bank  of  India  to  his 
wife and (2) Mrs. Vibha Sharma for obtaining 
confidential information related to trading by 
Central Bank of India in connivance with her 
husband and for front running the trades of 
Central Bank of India using her own trading 
account.
Adjudicating Officer imposed a penalty 
 
of  `25  lakh,  jointly  and  severally,  on  Mr. 
Jitendra  Sharma  and  Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma. 
Pursuant  to  the  appeal  filed  by  Mr.  Jitendra 
Sharma  and  Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma  before 
Hon’ble  Securities Appellate  Tribunal  (SAT), 
SAT  upheld  the  SEBI  order.  Further,  on  the 
question of law, SAT observed that the act of 
front running is always considered injurious 

145

Examination,  prima 

facie, 

be it an intermediary or any other person for 
that reasons. Therefore, it would like to give 
a liberal interpretation to the concept of front 
running  and  would  hold  that  any  person, 
who  is  connected  with  the  capital  market, 
and  indulges  in  front  running  is  guilty  of  a 
fraudulent market practice as such liable to be 
punished as per law by SEBI. The definition 
of front running, therefore, cannot be put in a 
straight-jacket formula.

misleading  clarification  was  also  given 
by the promoter of ZSL, to the media.

incorrect  and 

false 
information in the quarterly shareholding 
pattern  for  the  four  quarters  in  the

overstating the holding of the promoters 
and understating the quantum of shares 
pledged by the promoters.

had also made misrepresentations by making 
unrealistic  claims,  false  statements  such  as 
having  office  in  various  countries,  FII  based 
calls,  jackpot  calls,  etc.,  and  they  also  made 
representation in reckless and careless manner 
in their messages and website suggesting facts 
which are not true. By their acts and omissions 
they  have  prima-facie  solicited,  enticed  and 
induced investors to deal in securities on the 
basis of their investment advices, stock trade

AP)  and  M/s.  Pan  Asia  Advisors  Ltd. 
(now  known  as  M/s.  Global  Finance 
and Capital Ltd.)
 
SEBI had passed an ad interim ex-parte 
order dated September 21, 2011, in the matter 
of  market  manipulation  using  GDR  issues 
against  several  entities  including  Mr.  Arun 
Panchariya (hereinafter referred to as AP) and 
M/s.  Pan Asia Advisors  Ltd  (now  known  as

investigation  regarding  the  role  of  M/s.  Pan 
Asia and Mr. Arun Panchariya in the matter of 
market manipulation using GDR issues. It was 
inter-alia observed that Mr. Arun Panchariya 
had  entered  into  a  fraudulent  arrangement 
with the promoters of certain issuer companies 
viz. M/s. Asahi Infrastructure & Projects Ltd.,

Corporation  Ltd,  M/s.  K  Sera  Sera  Ltd.,  M/s. 
CAT  Technologies  Ltd.  and  M/s.  Maars

The  cross  referenced  agreements  signed  by 
entities  of  AP  and  by  the  issuer  company 
with  European  American  Investment  Bank 
AG, Austria led to GDR proceeds received by 
company being pledged against loans raised 
by entity of AP. The names of foreign investors 

disclosed  to  exchanges  in  India  were  found 
to  be  fictitious.  Therefore  together,  AP  and 
Indian  companies  have  created  a  scheme 
to mislead the investors about the inflow of 
foreign  investment  through  GDRs  and  that 
the  companies  were  found  as  favourable 
investments by foreign investors. Thereafter, 
these  GDRs  were  converted  through  sub-
accounts  controlled  by  AP  and  the  shares 
so  converted  were  dumped  in  the  Indian 
securities  markets  to  the  detriment  of  the 
Indian investors.

empanelled for conducting financial education 
workshops. The study material developed for 
the above target groups is presently available 
in  10  vernacular  languages.  During  2013-14,

Insider Trading Cases during 2013-14

II 
A.  Order  in  respect  of  M/s  Reliance 
Petroinvestments Ltd. in the matter of 
M/s. Indian Petrochemicals Corporation 
Ltd. 
in 
SEBI  conducted  an 
the  trading  of  the  scrip  of  M/s.  Indian 
Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd. (IPCL/ 
Company)  during 
the  period  from 
February 22, 2007 to March 08, 2007.
As  per  the  investigation  report,  the 
M/s.  Reliance  Petroinvestments  Ltd. 
(RPIL/Noticee)  was  deemed 
to  be 
connected  person  of  IPCL  in  terms  of 
Regulation 2(h) of SEBI PIT Regulation, 
1992. Therefore, the first element of the 
definition  of  “insider”  i.e.  “deemed  to 
have been connected with the company” 
as  per  regulation  2(e)  was  established. 
It  was  observed  that  declaration  of 
interim  dividend  and  amalgamation 
by  the  company  were  price  sensitive 
information  as  per  regulation  2(ha)  of 
SEBI PIT Regulation, 1992. 

 

 

 

 

from 

further  observed 

It  was 
the 
disclosures  made  by  IPCL  itself  to  the 
stock exchanges under Regulation 8 (3) 
of  SAST  Regulations  as  on  March  31, 
2006  that  RPIL  is  a  “promoter  having 
control  over  the  company”  with  the 
total shareholding of approx. 46percent 
Further,  RIL  has  been  shown  as  a 
“person(s) acting in concert” with RPIL. 
The  above  facts  established  that  RPIL 
was  having  control  over  IPCL.  It  was 
therefore,  concluded  that  by  virtue  of 
RPIL  having  control  over  IPCL,  it  was 
reasonably  expected  to  have  access 
to  UPSI  of  IPCL.  Noticee  being  the 
promoter  having  control  over 
the 
company  holding  approx.  46  percent 
shares of IPCL was inherently expected 
to have access to UPSI. 
It was further observed that during the 
period June 9, 2006 to February 26, 2007 
RPIL had not dealt in the shares of IPCL 
but  all  of  a  sudden  started  buying  the 
shares  of  IPCL  from  February  27,  2007 
i.e  just  before  the  major  announcement 
of  declaration  of  the  interim  dividend 
and  amalgamation  of  IPCL  with  RIL. 
Therefore, the charge of insider trading 
against  the  Noticee  as  per  regulation 
3  of  SEBI  PIT  Regulation,  1992  stood 
established. 
A penalty of `11 crore  was imposed on 
M/s.  Reliance  Petroinvestments  Ltd.  in 
terms  of  the  provisions  of  Section  15G 
of  the  SEBI  Act,  1992  for  the  violation 
of  Regulation  3  of  SEBI  PIT  Regulation, 
1992.

matter of M/s Shelter Infra projects Ltd.

(SPA), 

SIPL had entered into a Share Purchase 
Agreement 
to  be  executed 
between  SIPL  and 
the  proposed 
acquirers,  M/s  Ramayana  Promoters 
Pvt. Ltd. on July 31, 2009 for the sale of 
the  issued  and  subscribed  equity  share 
capital  of  the  company  held  by  the 
erstwhile  promoters,  as  also  change  in 
management of the company. 
Mr. Shanti Ranjan Paul,  the Director of 
the M/s. Shelter Infra projects Ltd (SIPL) 
had  passed  on  the  unpublished  price 
sensitive  information  (UPSI)  to  others 
(his close relatives) just before the period 
of  open  offer.  The  Adjudicating  officer 
vide order dated March 7, 2014 imposed 
a  penalty  of  rupees  one  crore  on  Shri 
Shanti Ranjan Paul and rupees two crore 
on  others  under  SEBI  PIT  Regulation, 
1992.
Mr.  Sisir  Kumar  Saha,  the  Whole  Time 
Director  of  SIPL  was  privy  to  the 
unpublished price sensitive information 
(UPSI) and traded in the shares of SIPL. 
Further,  he  had  also  communicated  or 
counselled,  directly  or  indirectly,  the 
UPSI to Mr. Soura Sekhar Saha , son of Mr. 
Sisir Kumar Saha who also traded in the 
shares of SIPL. The Adjudicating officer 
vide order dated March 7, 2014 held that 
“ there is no dispute to the fact that Mr. 
Sisir Kumar Saha is a “connected person” 
as defined under Regulation 2(c)(i) of the 
SEBI PIT Regulation, 1992 and therefore 
an insider. Since Mr. Soura Sekhar Saha 
is  the  son  of  Mr.  Sisir  Kumar  Saha,  he 
is  deemed  to  be  a  connected  person  as 
per Regulation 2(h)(viii) of the SEBI PIT 
Regulation,  1992.”  Adjudicating  officer 
took  into  consideration  that  Mr.  Soura 
Sekhar  Saha  has  not  sold  any  of  the 
shares  he  has  brought  in  the  scrip  and 
therefore the profit cannot be quantified 
i.e. profit not realised,  whereas Mr. Sisir 

 

 

159

Kumar Saha made a profit of ` 840 only. 
Therefore after considering all the facts 
and circumstance of the case Adjudicating 
officer  imposed a consolidated penalty 
of `50 lakh on Mr. Sisir Kumar Saha and 
Mr. Soura Sekhar Saha for dealing in the 
scrip based upon UPSI.
Mr. Chirantan Mukherji was Chairman 
&  promoter  of  SIPL  and  Ms.  Chandra 
Mukherji  was  wife  of  Shir  Chirantan 
Mukherji. On the basis of investigation it 
was alleged that Mr. Chirantan Mukherji 
being the Chairman & promoter of SIPL 
was  privy  to  the  unpublished  price 
sensitive information (UPSI) and traded 
in the shares of SIPL. Further, he had also 
communicated  or  counselled,  directly 
or  indirectly,  the  UPSI  to  Mr.  Chandra 
Mukherji who also traded in the shares 
of  SIPL.  The  Adjudicating  officer  vide 
order  dated  March  7,  2014  held  that 
“there  is  no  dispute  to  the  fact  that 
Mr.Chirantan Mukherji is a “connected 
person”  as  defined  under  Regulation 
2(c)(i) of the SEBI PIT Regulation, 1992 
and therefore an insider. Further, since 
Ms.  Chandra  Mukherji  is  the  wife  of 
Mr. Chirantan Mukherji, she is deemed 
to  be  a  connected  person  as  per 
Regulation  2(h)(viii)  of  the  SEBI  PIT 
Regulation,  1992.” Adjudicating  officer 
took into consideration that Ms. Chandra 
Mukherji has not sold any of the shares 
he has brought in the scrip and therefore 
the profit cannot be quantified i.e. profit 
not realised. 
Therefore,  after  considering  all 
the 
facts  and  circumstance  of  the  case 
Adjudicating officer  imposed a penalty 
of  rupees  one  crore  on  Ms.  Chandra 
Mukherji  for dealing in the scrip based 
upon  UPSI.  However  no  penalty  was 
imposed on Mr. Chirantan Mukherji as 
he expired on March 03, 2013.

of disclosures made to the company and 
to  the  stock  exchanges  under  SEBI  PIT

and Ethics, instead of a copy of the Code 
of  Internal  Procedure  &  Conduct  and 
Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices in 
accordance with the SEBI PIT Regulation, 
1992.

in  which  the  Noticees  have  conducted 
themselves,  irrespective  of  whether  the 
Model Code as specified under the SEBI 
PIT Regulation, 1992 is considered to be 
in place or not, provided ample scope for 
misuse of price sensitive information. 
Pursuant  to  Adjudication  proceedings,

III  Steps initiated to curb Insider Trading 

practices

A.  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading) 

Regulations, 1992 are in place.

B.  Actions are taken in terms of provisions 
of  SEBI  Act,  1992  which  also  includes 
Adjudication  proceedings  for  levy  of 

164

monetary  penalty.  This  also  acts  as  a 
deterrent.
 
The  total  penalty  imposed  by  SEBI  in 
adjudication  proceedings  for  the  violations 
of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading) 
Regulations,  1992    was    `20.4  crore  in  2013-
14  compared  to  `1.84  crore 
in  2012-13 
representing a rise of 1010.9 percent. The said 
penalty includes penalty for disclosure related 
violations. Further the total penalty imposed 
for  2013-14    includes  `0.45  crore  imposed 
under  SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) 
Regulations,  1992  &  SEBI 
  (Substantial 
Acquisition  of  Shares  and  Takeovers) 
Regulations,  1997  as  common  orders  were 
passed in certain matters during 2013-14.

8.  SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION OF 

SHARES AND TAKEOVERS

 
The existence of an efficient and smooth-
functioning  market  for  takeovers  plays  an 
important  role  in  the  economic  development 
of a country. Existence of an efficient and well-
administered  set  of  Takeover  Regulations 
ensures  that  the  takeover  markets  operate  in 
a fair, equitable and transparent manner. The 
SEBI  Act,  1992  expressly  mandated  SEBI  to 
regulate substantial acquisition of shares and 
takeovers  by  suitable  measures.  Accordingly, 
SEBI provided a legal framework by notifying 
the Takeover Regulations in 1997. The new SEBI 
(SAST) Regulations were notified in 2011. 

I.  Open Offer

As on March 31, 2014, total 92 draft letters 
 
were held with SEBI for Open Offers, of which 
71 draft letters of offer have been filed during 
2013-14 (one under old Takeover Regulations). 
Of  the  92  draft  letters,  observations  were

The number of inspections has increased 
to 350 during 2013-14 from 300 in 2012-13. The 
inspection process of intermediaries has been 
further  streamlined  with  a  view  to  improve 
the  quality  such  as  selection  of  themes  for 
inspections,  questionnaire  for 
inspections 
and follow up action. It was ensured that the 
inspections are concluded expeditiously.
 
Based on the findings of inspections after 
considering the comments of intermediaries, 
they  were  specifically  advised  about  the 
areas  where  improvement  was  required  by 
them.  They  were  also  required  to  report  to 
SEBI about the corrective steps taken by them 
and  also  place  the  same  before  their  board/
partners/proprietor, as the case may be. These 
steps taken by SEBI have improved the level 
of  compliance  among  the  intermediaries. 
Administrative  and  quasi-judicial  actions 
were  initiated  based  on  the  deficiencies  and 
seriousness  of  the  violations  committed  by 
the intermediaries.

The  stock  exchanges  carried  out  risk 
based inspections as per new policy adopted by 
them in consultation with SEBI. Additionally, 
stock brokers/clearing members are required 
to carry out complete internal audit on a half 

169

yearly basis by independent auditors.  Stock 
exchanges  levy  penalties  for  delay  in  filing 
the  internal  audit  reports  by  stock  brokers. 
The system of internal audits of stock brokers 
by outside professionals, inspections by stock 
exchanges  and  by  SEBI  has  improved  the 
compliance level of stock brokers.  

Inspection of Other Intermediaries
B. 
 
Risk based and special focus inspections 
of  intermediaries  are  undertaken  by  SEBI  to 
ascertain the extent of compliance on specific 
issues. SEBI has been carrying out inspection 
of  the  merchant  bankers,  randomly  on  the 
basis  of  public/rights  issue,  open  offer  and 
buy-back  etc.,  to  check  the  due  diligence 
exercised  in  respect  of  pre-issue  and  post-
issue activities, and the registrars to an issue 
to check the allotment process followed and 
the redressal of investor complaints handled 
by them. 
 
SEBI conducted inspections of debenture 
trustees based on the number of public issues 
handled  by  them  to  confirm  the  compliance 
with the applicable regulatory and statutory 
requirements with focus on their systems and 
controls with respect to monitoring of payment 
of interest/ redemption amount, processing of 
investor grievances and action taken in case of 
defaults by issuer companies.

by SEBI of these intermediaries has increased 
during the year, from 99 in 2012-13 to 133 in 
2013-14 (Table 3.26). There was special focus 
on  follow-up  actions  after  the  inspections

III.  Prevention of Money Laundering
 
Money laundering is globally recognized 
as  one  of  the  largest  threats  posed  to  the 
financial  system  of  a  country.  The  fight 
against  terrorist  financing  is  another  such 
emerging  threat  with  grave  consequences 
for both the political and economic standing 
of  a  jurisdiction.  Rapid  developments  and 
greater  integration  of  the  financial  markets 
together  with  improvements  in  technology 
and  communication  channels  continue  to 
pose  serious  challenges  to  the  authorities 
and  institutions  dealing  with  Anti-Money 
Laundering  and  Combating  Financing  of 
Terrorism (AML/ CFT).
 
The  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering 
Act, 2002 (PMLA) and the rules framed there-
under,  which  have  been  brought  into  force 
with  effect  from  July  1,  2005,  have  been  a 
significant step taken by India towards joining 
the  global  war  against  money  laundering 
and  financing  of  terrorism.  PMLA  has  been 
amended  in  December  2012  so  that  the 
legislative  and  administrative  framework 
of  the  country  becomes  more  effective  and 

170

capable of handling new evolving threats in 
the area of money laundering and financing 
of  terror.  Further,  the  Prevention  of  Money 
Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 
2005  were  also  amended  in  August  2013  to 
reflect these new changes.
 
During  2013-14,  SEBI  has  continued  its 
focused  efforts  to  strengthen  the  regulatory 
framework and minimize the risk emanating 
from money laundering and terrorist financing 
in the securities markets. The following steps 
have been taken in this regard:
A.  Updation of the AML/ CFT framework 
of SEBI (in line with amendments made 
to the PML Act 2002 and Rules)
 
The  AML/  CFT  framework  prescribed 
by  SEBI  for  market  intermediaries  has  been 
updated to incorporate the amendments made 
in  the  PML  Act,  2002  and  Rules.  The  major 
changes  to  the  framework  are  with  respect 
to  duration  of  record  keeping  requirements, 
which  has  been  reduced  from  10  to  five 
years,  appointment  of  Designated  Director 
to  oversee  compliance  with  AML/  CFT 
obligations  and  the  intermediaries  to  carry 
out risk assessment. Further, intermediaries 
are  now  allowed  to  rely  on  regulated  and 
supervised third parties for carrying out client 
due  diligence.  The  circular  in  this  regard 
was issued on March 12, 2014. Details of the 
circular have been given in this report. 
B. 

Inspections  on  AML/  CFT  related 
issues
 
SEBI has included the AML/ CFT risks as 
part of its inspection of intermediaries, such 
as,  stock  brokers,  depository  participants 
and  mutual  funds.  SEBI  has  also  carried 
inspections  of 
out  specific  theme  based 
intermediaries 
compliance 
with  KYC  norms  (which  includes  client  due 

focusing  on 

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

diligence) and AML/ CFT guidelines. During 
2013-14,  with  respect  to  stock  brokers,  SEBI 
has carried out 62 special purpose inspections 
to  check  their  compliance  with  the  AML/ 
CFT  and  KYC  norms.  In  case  of  depository 
participants, 53 inspections were carried out 
to verify compliance with AML/ CFT and KYC 
norms.  With  regard  to  portfolio  managers, 
SEBI  officials  visit  the  entity  during  which 
compliance with KYC norms is verified before 
granting registration/ renewal of registration. 
With respect to mutual funds, 21 inspections 
were  carried  out  wherein  compliance  with 
AML/  CFT  and  KYC  related  norms  was 
reviewed.
 

In  addition  to  the  special  purpose 

inspections  conducted  by  SEBI,  compliance 
with AML/ CFT norms is also verified by the 
stock exchange and depositories during their 
inspections  of  stock  brokers  and  depository 
participants and also at the time of half yearly 
internal audits by independent professionals. 
Depository  participants  are  also  required 
to  undergo  concurrent  audits  with  respect 
to  their  operations,  which  includes  account 
opening/  KYC/  AML  norms.  Appropriate 
sanctions  are  applied  where  AML/  CFT 
violations/ discrepancies are observed. 
 
The  table  3.27  provides  data  on  the 
number  of  members  /  participants  against 
whom action for AML / CFT related deficiencies 
has  been 
the  exchanges  and 
taken  by 
depositories in 2013-14:

Stock exchanges and depositories have 
also conducted trainings/ seminars for their 
members  to  sensitize  them  towards  the 
significance  of  AML/  CFT  framework  and 
the  need  to  ensure  continuous  compliance 
with it.

C.  Risk  Assessment  for  the  Securities 

Sector to identify ML/TF risks

 

The  Ministry  of  Finance,  Government 

171

terrorist 

of India, has set up different working groups 
to carry out risk assessments of every financial 
sector in India to identify the various money 
laundering  and 
financing  risks 
faced  and  to  suggest  measures  to  mitigate 
these  risks.  A  group 
the  securities 
sector  has  also  been  set  up  comprising  of 
representatives  from  SEBI,  stock  exchanges, 
depositories, associations of intermediaries and 
Financial Intelligence Unit-India.

D. 

International  co-operation  on  AML/ 
CFT related issues

 
In  order  to  protect  the  international 
financial  system  from  money  laundering 
and  financing  of  terrorism  (ML/  FT)  risks 
and 
to  encourage  greater  compliance 
with  the  AML/  CFT  standards,  the  FATF 
identifies  jurisdictions  that  have  strategic 
deficiencies and works with them to address 
those  deficiencies  that  pose  a  risk  to  the 
international financial system. The names of 
these  jurisdictions  are  made  public  as  part 
of a FATF Public Statement. As required by 
the  FATF  Recommendations,  the  Ministry 
of  Finance,  Government  of  India  circulates 
the FATF Public Statements to all regulators 
with an advice to disseminate the same to all 
financial institutions under their supervision 
for  applying  enhanced  due  diligence 
measures  when  dealing  with  clients  from 
these high-risk jurisdictions. In the year 2013-
14,  SEBI  circulated  three  such  FATF  Public 
Statements dated June 21, 2013, October 18, 
2013  and  February  14,  2014  to  registered 
intermediaries for their compliance.
 
The Eurasian Group (EAG) had instituted 
a typology research project on topic “Money 
Laundering  through  the  Securities  Market”, 
the leadership of which was assigned to SEBI. 
SEBI submitted the final report of the project, 
based  on  information  received  from  various 
member  jurisdictions.  Earlier,  SEBI  had  also 
made  two  presentations  on  the  preliminary 
findings  in  the  meetings  of  the  Group  held 
in  Moscow  and  New  Delhi.  The  report  was 
published on the EAG website in September 
2013.
 
the  Australian 
Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre 
(AUSTRAC)  had  organized  a  three  day 
AML  regional  workshop  in  Colombo,  Sri 
Lanka,  to  assist  the  regulators  of  the  capital

markets  in  South  Asia  to  assess  the  threats 
and vulnerabilities of the securities markets in 
South Asia to money laundering. SEBI made 
a presentation on the AML/ CFT framework 
and steps taken in Indian securities markets.  

POWERS  AND 

10.  DELEGATED 
FUNCTIONS
 
Section  29A  of  the  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation)  Act,  1956  permits  the  Central 
Government to delegate powers exercisable by 
it under any provision of the SC (R) Act, 1956

any one or more of categories specified therein. 
The  said  notification,  inter  alia,  permitted

securities.

The  contracts  permitted  under 

 
the 
said  notification  are  mandated  to  be  in 
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999. Further, it 
was declared that the said notification would

V.  New Research Initiatives
Statistical  Analytics  Group  has  been 
 
set  up 
the 
investigation  and  surveillance  functions  of 
SEBI.  The  works  initiated  within  the  group 
are as follows: 
• 

In 

financial  markets, 

Stock  price  modelling  using 
the 
concepts  of  Geometric  Brownian 
Motion: 
the 
dynamics of stock prices are reflected by 
uncertain movements of their value over 
time  which is attributed to the Efficient 
Market  hypothesis  (EMH)  .  Based  on 
market restrictions and laws, Geometric 
Brownian  Motion  is  a  mathematical 
approach for stock price modelling.  The 
objective of this initiative is to model the  
return  data  of  stock  prices  of  different 
scrips  and  check  whether  they  really 
follow  Geometric  Brownian  Motion  as 
desired or not.

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

•  Disgorgement  calculation  for  insider 
trading:  In  order  to  overcome  the 
limitations  of  event  study  analysis,  a 
probabilistic  methodology  was  used  to 
calculate  disgorgement  amount.  The 
method mainly consists of computation of 
the potential probabilistic disgorgement 
by analyzing all the future price scenarios, 
assigning  them  a  suitable  probability 
measure on the basis of the strategy of the 
insider and on the current stock price. The 
stochastic  differential  equation  adopted 
in this model is the geometric Brownian 
motion  applied  by  Black  &  Scholes  to 
their option-pricing model. 

•  Developing algorithm to detect Insider 
Trading:  The  aim  of  this  initiative  to 
generate  alert  for  entities  that  may  be 
associated  with  Insider  trading  based 
on the day-wise trading data. Based on 
the model parameters, notional volume 
and  notional  percentage  profit,  cluster 
analysis  mechanism  is  used  to  classify 
all  the  clients/  investors  traded  in  a 
scrip into some mutually exclusive and 
exhaustive groups ,such that within each 
group the investors are homogeneous in 
nature and between the groups they are 
heterogeneous. By forming two groups, 
namely  normal  and  anomalous,  the 
anomalous  investors  are  filtered  based 
on their trading pattern surrounding the 
announcement date in order to generate 
final suspect list.

13.  OTHER FUNCTIONS
Surveillance 
I. 
 
An  effective  surveillance  mechanism 
is  one  of  the  prime  requirements  for  well 
functioning 
securities  market.  Effective 
surveillance aims to facilitate orderly markets 
by safeguarding the integrity of market and can 
achieve  investor  confidence,  protection  and 
market  development.  The  stock  exchanges, 

as a primary regulator, are entrusted to act as 
first level source of detection of market frauds, 
suspicious activity and any aberration in the 
market movement are then reported to SEBI 
for further examination.

 
At  SEBI,  the  Integrated  Surveillance 
Department  (ISD)  monitors  market  activity 
through  its  market  alert  systems  and  is  in 
charge  of  overall  market  surveillance.  The 
various  processes  and  systems  implemented 
as mentioned below help in detecting FUTP.

A. 

Integrated Market Surveillance System 
(IMSS)
 
Integrated  Market  Surveillance  System 
(IMSS) keeps track of market aberrations and 
generates  alerts  on  a  daily  basis.    The  alerts 
are  analyzed  periodically  so  as  to  identify 
any  manipulative  trading  in  the  market. 
During  the  year,  SEBI  redesigned  the  IMSS 
system  software  to  handle  more  than  two 
billion  messages  in  a  day  by  implementing 
market  splitting  and  streaming  mechanism. 
To  further  enhance  the  system  capability 
and performance of alert generation process, 
implementation of alerting on multiple market 
stream are underway.

B.  Data  Warehousing 

and  Business 

Intelligence System (DWBIS)
 
DWBIS  comprises  of  data  warehouse, 
data  mining  and  business  intelligence  tools. 
Presently, DWBIS consists of three phases:
a. 

Phase-I: A single source of market data 
and  enables  users  to  generate  multi-
dimensional  reports  dynamically  (fully 
operational).
Phase-II:  Several  pattern  recognition 
modules  and  predictive  modeling 
scenarios (fully operational).
Phase-III:  It  consists  of  various  reports 
to help research initiatives (released for 
User Acceptance Test (UAT)).

Annual Report 2013-14

 
During  the  year,  DWBIS  has  been 
rolled  out  to  other  departments  of  SEBI 
like  Recovery  Cell  and  OIAE.  Process  for 
comprehensive  upgrade  of  the  system 
to  handle  data  up  to  2018  has  also  been 
initiated.

C.  Significant market movements
During  2013-14,  Sensex  and  Nifty 
 
touched  their  respective  life-time  highs  at 
22386.3 and 6704.2 on March 31, 2014. Major 
market movements in terms of percentage 
change are given in Table 3.29.

D.  Surveillance Measures
 
As  an  ongoing  mechanism,  SEBI 
conducts  meetings  at  regular  intervals  with 
stock exchanges/depositories to keep track of 
surveillance activities and market movements. 
In consultation with the stock exchanges, the 
following  surveillance  measures  have  been 
taken:
a. 

of others by indulging in manipulation 
or any other illegal activities which pose 
risk  to  the  integrity  of  the  market  and 
distorts  the  equilibrium  of  the  market. 
Accordingly, a surveillance obligation for 
brokers for detection of suspicious and/
or  manipulative  transactions  has  been 
framed. In order to facilitate this at trading 
member  level,  SEBI  has  mandated  all 
exchanges  to  disseminate  transactional 
market alerts to trading members as part 
of  surveillance  obligation  for  trading 
members.

Trading  members  along  with 
their 
employees/ branch offices/ sub-brokers/ 
authorized  persons  are  the  first  touch 
point in the securities market for investors. 
As  the  trading  members  interact  with 
their clients on a day-to-day basis, they 
are  expected  to  have  reasonably  fair 
understanding about their client(s) and 
its trading activity. Thus, at a first level, 
it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  trading 
member  to  ensure  that  neither  he  nor 
his  client(s)  are  misusing  the  trading 
system for their own benefit at the cost 

b. 

In  accordance  with  the  requirements 
of  SEBI  (PIT)  Regulations,  1992  and 
Listing  agreement, 
companies  are 
required to make disclosures in respect 
of  price  sensitive  information  to  stock 
exchanges. In this regard, it was decided 
that  companies  shall  also  disclose  to 
the  exchanges  the  applicable  trading

window  period  along  with  any  price 
sensitive information. 

Table 3.30:   Surveillance  Actions  during 
 

  2013-14

 

c.  Often 

trading  members  appear  as 
shareholders of a listed company while 
the  actual  holding  is  on  behalf  of  their 
clients.  This  practice  leads  to  masking 
the  identity  of  the  actual  shareholders 
of  a  company.  Accordingly,  in  order 
to  increase  transparency  and  provide 
correct picture of the actual shareholding 
of  a  listed  company,  the  exchanges 
are  advised  to  collect  and  disseminate 
shareholding  by  trading  member  in 
listed companies along with breakup of 
shareholding (held in their name or on 
behalf  of  the  clients),  in  the  format  as 
prescribed by SEBI, on a quarterly basis, 
if such holding is one percent or more of 
the share capital of a listed company.  
SEBI  has  mandated  all  exchanges  to 
disseminate  on  their  website,  volume 
and member level concentration details 
for  scrips  /  indices  on  which  Liquidity 
Enhancement 
are 
present.

E.  Surveillance Actions

 
During  2013-14,  NSE,  BSE  and  MCX-
SX  initiated  preliminary  examination  and 
investigation in 56 cases, 644 cases and 33 cases 
respectively. In addition, as surveillance action, 
during 2013-14, NSE shifted 586 scrips to trade 
to  trade  (T  to  T)  segment,  BSE  shifted  1,509 
scrips to trade to trade (T to T) segment and 
MCX-SX  shifted  236  scrips  to  trade  to  trade 
(T  to  T)  segment.  In  this  segment,  scrips  are 
traded and settled through mandatory delivery 
and no netting off positions are allowed. This 
leads to reduction in the amount of speculation 
as only those who can deliver the securities can 
enter  into  sale  transactions  and  thereby  day 
trading is reduced (Table 3.30).

With a view to dampen the amplitude of 
 
prices, scrips shifted to T to T segment attract 
applicable circuit filters. NSE reduced circuit 
filter in 1,093 instances, BSE in 2,002 instances 
and MCX-SX in 603 instances. NSE, BSE and 
MCX-SX verified 116, 122 and one rumours, 
respectively  (Table  3.18A).  Further,  as  a  soft 
enforcement  measure,  NSE  and  BSE  issued 
observation  letter  to  458  and  708  entities, 
respectively  and  caution  letter  to  one  and 
three entities, respectively.

Investigation
II. 
Timely completion of investigation cases 
 
and  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive 
action in case of violations of securities laws is 
important for protection of investors’ interest 
and  ensuring  fair,  transparent  and  orderly 
functioning of the market. It is also vital for 
improving the confidence in the integrity of the 
securities market. SEBI is therefore constantly 
striving to upgrade its investigative skills by 
making  use  of  Information  Technology  (IT) 
and other latest investigative tools. Importance 
of effective and credible use of investigation 

Annual Report 2013-14

Keeping 

violations, 

non-compliance 

has  also  been  underscored  by  IOSCO  in  its 
“Principles for the Enforcement of Securities 
Regulation”.
 
the  above  objectives  and 
principles  of  securities  regulations  in  view, 
SEBI initiates investigation to examine alleged 
or suspected violations of laws and regulations 
relating  to  securities  market.  The  possible 
violations  may  include  price  manipulation, 
creation  of  artificial  market,  insider  trading, 
capital  issue  related  irregularities,  takeover 
related 
of 
disclosure  requirements  and  any  other 
misconduct in the securities markets.
Initiation of Investigation
A. 
 
There are various sources of information 
for  initiation  of  investigation.  SEBI  initiates 
investigation  based  on  reference  received 
from  sources  such  as  stock  exchanges, 
SEBI’s  integrated  surveillance  department, 
other  government  departments,  information 
submitted  by  market  participants  and 
complainants. 
cases, 
investigation  may  also  be  initiated  suo-moto, 
where there are reasonable grounds to believe 
those  investors’  interest  are  being  adversely 
affected  or  there  are  suspected  violations  of 
the provisions of the securities laws.

appropriate 

In 

B.  Process of Investigation
 
The steps involved during investigation 
process  include  an  analysis  of  market  data 
(order and trade log, transaction statements, 
etc.) and static data (KYC documents obtained 
from  brokers,  depository  participants,  etc., 
bank records, financial results, events around 
major  corporate  developments,  etc.)  The 
purpose  of  such  investigation  is  to  gather 
evidence  and  to  identify  persons/  entities 
behind  irregularities  and  violations  so  that 
appropriate  and  suitable  regulatory  action 

can  be  taken,  wherever  required.  Outcome 
of  investigation  in  the  form  of  enforcement 
action is a clear signal to the market players to 
comply with the legal provisions and expected 
standards of conduct in the market.
C.  Trends in Investigation Cases
 
During  2013-14,  108  new  cases  were 
taken  up  for  investigation  and  120  cases 
were  completed  compared  to  155  new  cases 
taken up and 119 cases completed in 2012-13 
(Table  3.31). Apart  from  enforcement  action, 
an important attendant benefit resulting from 
such investigations is contribution to the policy 
changes with a view to further strengthening 
the regulatory and enforcement environment.

prohibitive  directions  under  Sec.  11  of 
SEBI Act, 1992 compared to 168 prohibitive 
directions  during  2012-13.  These  directions

deterrence  and  also  act  as  an  effective  tool 
to  deal  with  emergent  situations  requiring 

a  timely  and  faster  response.  In  addition, 
adjudication  orders  were  passed  where 
penalties  were  levied  against  619  entities,

G.  Regulatory Action Initiated
 
During  2013-14,  proceedings  under 
Section  11  of  SEBI  Act,  1992  were  initiated 
against  402  entities,  proceedings  under 
Intermediaries  Regulations  were 
initiated 
against  nine  entities  and  adjudication 
proceedings were initiated against 697 entities. 
In addition, Show Cause Notices were issued 
to  142  entities  for  the  proceedings  under 
Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992.
H.  Follow up of Investigations
 
After  completion  of  investigation,  the 
Investigation  Department  is  also  actively 
involved  in  post-investigation  enforcement 
actions  and  quasi-judicial  proceedings. 
Such  actions  include  issuing  show  cause 
notices  to  the  entities,  examining  their 
replies,  organising  and  participating  in  the 
hearings of the entities before the Whole Time 
Members (WTM) of SEBI, co-ordination with 
Enforcement Department (EFD), issuing press 
releases  after  orders  are  passed,  attending 
briefings  of  advocates  and  replying  to  their 
queries,  co-ordination  with  Enforcement 
Department 
the  proceedings  before 
Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and before 
Courts,  filing  of  complaints  with  Courts  in 
co-ordination  with  Prosecution  Department, 
follow-up  for  collection  of  penalty  amount 
for  orders  passed  by  Adjudicating  Officers, 
initiating  prosecution  for  non-payment  of 
penalties,  processing  of  consent  proposals 
filed by the entities, etc. Timely and qualitative 
completion of such actions is also important 
for  ensuring  the  effectiveness  of  regulatory 
measures taken by SEBI. 
 
On  March  28,2014,  SEBI  has  initiated   
the  process  of    revamping  of  the  follow-
up  proceedings  pursuant  to  completion  of 
investigation.  This  re-engineering  has  been 
initiated subsequent to the recommendations 
of the Consultant engaged by SEBI to revisit 
concerns, 
structural  and  organizational 

in 

the 

from 

re-prioritize  areas  of  focus  and  enhance 
organizational efficiency. The consultant had 
identified  significant  areas  for  improvement 
in the follow up processes of investigation and 
recommended  handing  over  of  enforcement 
proceedings 
Investigation 
Department  to  the  Enforcement  Department 
(EFD)  upon  completion  of 
investigation. 
This  would  ensure  uniformity  in  approach 
and  improve  the  efficiency  of  enforcement 
proceedings across the organization. 
Accordingly, an Enforcement Task Force 
 
(ETF) was constituted, primarily to formalize 
the process / framework for handing over of 
enforcement matters to EFD upon completion 
of investigation/ inspection/ examination. The 
implementation of the ETF recommendations 
has commenced and will continue in phases 
and is to be completed by 2014-15.

III.  Enforcement of Regulations

 
Effective enforcement lies at the heart of 
ensuring integrity, transparency and fairness in 
the market. It not only leads to better compliance 
culture,  but  also  underscores  the  point  that 
market  misconduct  and  abuse  will  not  go 
unpunished. A  credible  enforcement  strategy 
underpins the importance of consistent, timely 
and  transparent  regulatory  outcomes,  which 
are  proportionate,  dissuasive  and  effective. 
Under  SEBI  Act,  1992,  Securities  Contracts 
(Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) and Depositories 
Act, 1996, SEBI, broadly, pursues two streams 
of  enforcement  actions  i.e.  Administrative  / 
Civil or Criminal. Administrative/Civil actions 
include  issuing  directions  such  as  remedial 
orders,  cease  and  desist  orders,  suspension 
or  cancellation  of  certificate  of  registration 
and  imposition  of  monetry  penalty  under 
the 
statutes.  Proceedings  of 
criminal nature involve initiating prosecution 
proceedings  against  violators  by 
filing 
complaint before a criminal court.

b.  Enquiry Proceedings

 
SEBI may suspend or cancel the certificate 
of  registration  of  an  intermediary  through 
Enquiry Regulations on the recommendation 
of  the  enquiry  officer/designated  authority 
appointed for that purpose. It may also issue 
warning to an intermediary if it considers that 
the violations committed by the intermediary 

does  not  warrant  suspension  or  cancellation 
or registration.
 
During 2013-14, 13 cases were disposed 
by SEBI after the due completion of enquiry 
proceedings.  Further,  12  fresh  cases  were 
initiated where enquiry proceedings are being 
followed. The cumulative pending cases as on

into account the submission of the sub-broker,

Jani  and 

Mr.  Tushar 

 
twelve  other 
respondents invested substantial amounts in 
M/s  HSBC  Guilt  Funds-  Short  Term  Plan  in 
October 2008. Subsequently, M/s HSBC made 
certain  changes  in  the  scheme  by  virtue  of 
which  the  NAV/price  of  the  respondents’ 
investments fell substantially. 
 
SEBI had examined the issue on receipt 
of complaints from certain unit holders. It had 
been  contended  by  certain  unit  holders  that 
the  following  fundamental  attributes  of  the 
scheme were changed in January 2009 without 
following the procedure laid out in the SEBI 
(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.

which affected the interest of unit holders, M/s 
HSBC  was  required  to  abide  by  Regulation 
18(15A)  of 
(Mutual  Funds) 
Regulations, 1996 which stipulates that:

that  since 

the  SEBI 

the 

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

• 

• 

a  written  communication  about  the 
proposed  change  is  sent  to  each  unit 
holder and advertisement regarding the 
same is issued and 
unit holders are provided with an option 
to  exit  the  scheme  at  the  prevailing 
NAV. 
However,  the  said  requirements  were 

 
not complied with by M/s HSBC.
 
Vide  Order  dated  April  23,  2010,  the 
Whole  Time  Member  of  SEBI  held  that  M/s 
HSBC  was  technically  correct  in  stating  that 
the  changes  made  by  them  did  not  amount 
to changing the fundamental attributes of the 
investment  and  therefore  there  was  no  legal 
compulsion  to  adhere  to  the  procedure  and 
manner prescribed under Regulation 18(15A) 
of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 
but opined that the Fund  and its Trustees had 
violated  Regulation  18  (19)  (22)  and  15(16) 
of  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations, 
1996,  the    AMC  had  violated  Regulations 
25(1) and 25(16) of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulations, 1996 and the CEO had violated 
Regulation 25(6A) of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulations,  1996,  all  of  which  lay  down 
the  code  of  conduct  to  be  followed  by  them 
respectively. For the said violations, a warning 
was issued to these entities.
 
Challenging  this  order  of  the  WTM, 
Appeal No. 111 of 2010 (by respondents, Mr. 
Subramanian  R.  Venkat  and  Ms.  Anuradha 
Venkatasubramanian)  was  filed  before  the 
Hon’ble SAT. Vide order dated May 3, 2011, 
the SAT allowed the appeal holding that the 
changes brought about in the scheme altered 
the  fundamental  attributes  thereof  affecting 
the interest of the unit holders. However, the 
SAT observed that while NAV of the scheme 
had substantially increased, all the unit holders 
would not like to exit at the then prevailing 
NAV  which  was  much  less.  In  view  of  the 
same, SAT did not give a direction to HSBC to 

 

197

comply with the procedure laid down under 
Regulation  18(15A)  of  the  SEBI  (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations, 1996 with respect to all 
the investors, but held that an exit route should 
be provided to the two appellant investors in 
accordance  with  Regulation  18(15A)  of  the 
SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.
 
Following this order by the Hon’ble SAT, 
similarly  placed  entities,  also  preferred  an 
appeal against the said order of the Whole Time 
Member and the Hon’ble SAT vide its order 
dated July 5, 2012 opined that the issue under 
consideration  was  squarely  covered  by  the 
order of the Tribunal in Appeal No.11 of 2010 
and thus directed M/s HSBC to comply with 
the procedure laid down Regulation 18(15A) 
of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 
and  provide  the  appellant  investors  with  an 
exit route. 
 
The orders of the SAT dated May 3, 2011 
and July 5, 2012 were under challenge before 
the Supreme Court of India by M/s HSBC. SEBI 
was impleaded in the same as respondent.
 
Vide  order  dated  January  15,  2014  the 
Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  held  that  it  found 
no  merit  in  the  appeals  and  dismissed  the 
same.  This  order  of  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 
Court implies that the orders of the Hon’ble 
SAT dated May 3, 2011 and July 5, 2012 will 
now  be  in  force.  However,  the  Hon’ble  SAT 
has  specifically  stated  that  their  order  will 
be applicable to only those unit holders who 
have  agitated  their  case  before  the  judicial 
forum. Therefore, the appellants would now 
be required to provide an exit route to all the 
thirteen  respondents,  at  the  then  prevailing 
NAV in accordance with Regulation 18(15A) 
of  the  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds)  Regulations, 
1996.
ii.  Mr.  N.  Narayanan 

(Appellant) 
SEBI 

vs  Adjudicating  Officer, 
(Respondent) 
SEBI  conducted  investigation  in  the 

Annual Report 2013-14

quarterly  financial  results  and  the  annual 
financial results of the company for the year 
2007-08.  It  was  observed  that  the  company’s 
quarterly  reports  to  the  stock  exchanges 
contained  inflated  figures  of  the  company’s 
revenue  profits, 
security  deposits  and 
receivables.  It  was  observed  that  there  was 
price rise in scrip consequent to the publication 
of  the  inflated  results  and  promoters  of  the 
company pledged their shares to raise higher 
quantum  of  funds.  It  was  alleged  that  the 
company along with its directors committed 
irregularities  in  its  books  of  accounts  and 
showed  inflated  profits  and  revenues  in  the 
financial  statements  and  lured  the  general 
public to invest in the shares of the company 
based  on  such  false  financial  statements. 
Hence, it was alleged that Mr. N. Narayanan 
and Mr. V Natarajan violated Section 12A of 
SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 
4(1), 4(2)(a), 4(2) (e), 4(2)(f), 4(2)(k) and 4(2)(r) 
of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair 
Trade Practices) Regulation, 2003.
 
An Adjudicating Officer was appointed 
to 
into  and  adjudge  the  above 
inquire 
mentioned  violations.  After 
conducting 
inquiry Adjudicating Officer found that Mr. N. 
Narayanan and Mr. V Natarajan have violated 
the provisions as alleged above and imposed 
a monetary penalty of ` 50 lakh.
 
Further vide order dated April 18, 2011, 
WTM, SEBI found that Mr. N. Narayanan and 
Mr. V Natarajan have violated the provision 
as  alleged  above  and  restrained  them  from 
buying, selling or dealing in securities in any 
manner whatsoever or accessing the securities 
market, directly or indirectly and from being 
a director of any listed company for a period 
of two years and three years respectively from 
the date of this order.
 
Both the orders were challenged before 
the  Hon’ble  SAT.  Vide  order  dated  October 
5,  2012,  the  Hon’ble  SAT  upheld  both  the 

198

orders.  Aggrieved  by  the  said  order  of  the 
Hon’ble  SAT,  Mr.  N.  Narayanan  and  Mr.  V 
Natarajan filed an appeal before the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court. The appeal was dismissed by 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 
April 26, 2013 inter alia holding as under:
 
“We  notice  in  this  case  that  the  Directors 
of the company had clearly violated provisions of 
Section  12A  of  SEBI  Act  read  with  Regulations 
3  and  4  of  2003  Regulations.  Companies  whose 
securities are traded on a public market, disclosure 
of information about the company is crucial for the 
accurate pricing of the companies’ securities and 
also for the efficient operation of the market.
The Directors of the company or the person 
 
in  charge  directly  or  indirectly  use  or  employ, 
in  connection  with  the  issue,  purchase  or  sale 
of  any  securities  listed  in  stock  exchange,  any 
manipulative  or  deceptive  device  or  contrivance 
in contravention of SEBI Act or the Regulations 
made thereunder have necessarily to be dealt with 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act and 
the  Regulations  which  is  absolutely  necessary 
for the investor’s protection and to avoid market 
abuse.
 
Responsibility  is  cast  on  the  Directors  to 
prepare the annual records and reports and those 
accounts should reflect ‘a true and fair view’. The 
over-riding obligation of the Directors is to approve 
the  accounts  only  if  they  are  satisfied  that  they 
give true and fair view of the profits or loss for the 
relevant period and the correct financial position of 
the company.
 
Above being the factual and legal position, we 
are of the view that the SEBI has rightly restrained 
the appellant for a period of two years from the date 
of that order from buying, selling or dealing with 
any  securities,  in  any  manner,  or  accessing  the 
securities market, directly or indirectly and from 
being Director of any listed company and that the 
adjudicating officer has rightly imposed a penalty 
of  `50  lakh    under  Section  15HA  of  SEBI  Act, 
1992.”

iii.  SIRECL and  SHICL vs SEBI
 
M/s Sahara India Real Estate Corporation 
Ltd.,  (SIRECL)  and  M/s  Sahara  Housing 
Investment  Corporation  Ltd.,  (SHICL)  had 
raised amounts aggregating to `19,400.9 crore 
and `6,380.5 crore respectively from various 
subscribers through Red Herring Prospectus 
(RHP) dated March 03, 2008 and October 16, 
2009.  SEBI  vide  Order  dated  June  23,  2011 
held  that  SIRECL  and  SHICL  had  violated 
various  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act, 
the  requirements  of  SEBI  (DIP)  Guidelines, 
1992 and the provisions of the SEBI (ICDR) 
Regulations, 2009 and inter alia directed both 
the companies and their promoter, directors 
to  forthwith  refund  the  money  collected 
by them through the RHPs with 15 percent 
interest from the date of receipt of money till 
the date of payment.
 
their  promoter/
directors appealed to the Hon’ble Securities 
Appellate  Tribunal  (SAT),  which  dismissed 
their appeals and upheld the order of SEBI. 
The Saharas approached the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court impugning the orders of SAT.
 
The  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  vide  its 
Order  dated  August  31,  2012,  upheld  the 
order of SEBI and directed inter alia Saharas 
to  refund  the  amounts  raised,  along  with 
interest at the rate of 15 percent per annum 
to  SEBI  within  three  months;  to  furnish  all 
documents  in  their  custody,  particularly 
the  application  forms  submitted  by  the 
subscribers,  the  approval  and  allotment  of 
bonds and all other documents to SEBI within 
a period of 10 days, so as to enable SEBI to 
ascertain the genuineness of the subscribers 
as  well  as  the  amounts  deposited.    The 
Court also appointed Justice (Retd.) Mr. B N 
Agarwal to oversee the implementation of its 
order.

Enforcement  Cell)  to  specifically  handle

of  documents  submitted  in  terms  of  the 
directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, and 
also handle the matters connected therewith.
 
The  directions  of  the  Supreme  Court 
were not complied with by the Saharas, and 
instead  the  Saharas  approached  the  SAT 
for  modification  of  the  order  dated  August 
31,  2012  in  view  of  alleged  repayments  to 
investors  being  carried  out  by  it.  The  SAT 
refused to modify the directions contained in 
the order of the Supreme Court dated August 
31, 2012. The Saharas then filed an appeal in 
the Supreme Court against the order of SAT. 
The Full Bench headed by the Chief Justice of 
India rejected the claim of alleged repayments 
to  investors,  vide  order  dated  December  5, 
2012, and granted 15 days time to the Saharas 
to  furnish  documents  pertaining  to  refunds 
made and ordered them to refund an amount 
of  `5,120 crore immediately and the balance 
amount in two installments not later than the 
1st week of February 2013. 
 
Pursuant to the said Order of the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court, Saharas refunded an amount 
of `5,120 crore on December 5, 2012 to SEBI. 
Saharas also sent 127 trucks stated to contain 
about 3 crore application forms and 2.2 crore 
redemption  vouchers  /  statutory  forms  to 
SEBI in December 2012, which were found to 
be incomplete and hopelessly mixed up.  
 
The  Saharas  did  not  pay  the  amounts 
as required in terms of Supreme Court order 
dated  August  31,  2012  as  modified  by  the 
Supreme Court order dated December 5, 2012.  
Consequently,  SEBI  passed  Orders  dated 
February  13,  2013  attaching  the  moveable 
and  immoveable  properties  including  bank 
accounts, of SHICL and SIRECL, their promoter 
and  directors,  and  also 
filed  contempt 
petitions before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 
The  Saharas  moved  applications  indicating 
that  the  monies  had  been  repaid  directly  to 
the investors and that therefore they cannot be 
asked  to  pay  twice.  These  applications  were 

199

Annual Report 2013-14

rejected on February 25, 2013 by a Full Bench 
headed by the Chief Justice of India. 
 
Pursuant  to  an  application  filed  by 
SEBI,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court,  vide  its 
Order dated May 8, 2013, permitted SEBI to 
make  refunds  to  those  investors  who  have 
filed  or  would  be  filing  their  complaints 
with SEBI, except investors holding multiple 
accounts, after ascertaining their genuineness.  
Accordingly,  SEBI  issued  a  Press  Release  on 
May 28, 2013 stating initiation of the process 
of refunds to those genuine investors and have 
devised a methodology to process claims and 
make refunds to genuine investors.
 
The  Saharas  challenged  SEBI  orders 
dated February 13, 2013 before SAT indicating 
that  the  assets  had  been  sold  for  alleged 
repayments  and  details  of  bank  accounts 
would be furnished as and when directed to 
do  so.  These  SAT  appeals  stand  transferred 
to the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order 
dated July 17, 2013.   
 
In  the  contempt  petitions,  pending 
before  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Saharas  once 
again  claimed  repayment  to  the  investors 
approximately  `  30,000  crore  and  refused 
to  comply  with  the  orders  of  the  Supreme 
Court. 
 
The Supreme Court directed the Saharas 
to  submit  title  deeds  of  properties  worth 
`20,000  crore  to  SEBI.  SEBI  examined  the 
deeds  furnished  by  the  Saharas  and  found 
that  while  the  properties  were  overvalued 
and incomplete title was submitted in respect 
of  the  properties,  in  some  cases  title  was 
defective for various reasons viz. land in No-
Development Zone, under litigation, etc. Vide 
order  dated  November  28,  2013  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  was  pleased  to  hold  that 
its  direction  to  submit  title  deeds  had  been 
violated and directed that the Sahara Group 
of  companies  shall  not  part  with  moveable/
immoveable assets and the promoter/directors

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  heard  the  defense 
of repayment alleged to have been made by 
the Saharas, (earlier rejected by the Full bench 
headed  by  the  CJI)  and  vide  order  dated 
January 9, 2014 directed the Saharas to furnish 
documentary evidence of the source of money 
alleged to have been used for repayment. The 
Saharas  submitted  a  second  set  of  property 
documents  as  security  and  also  submitted 
various  documents  in  furtherance  of  the 
direction contained in the order dated January 
9, 2014. SEBI examined the details and pointed 
out several contradictions, defects in the reply 
of the Saharas, in particular, that Saharas had 
been constantly changing their stands and had 
now claimed that the entire alleged repayment 
to investors had been carried out in cash and 
that no bank account details were furnished 
in support of the same. SEBI also pointed out 
various defects in the second set of title deeds 
submitted by the Saharas.
 
In view of the same, the Division bench 
of the Supreme Court directed the promoter/
directors to be personally present before it on 
February 26, 2014. The promoter i.e. Subrata 
Roy  failed  to  appear  on  the  said  date  and 
the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  issued  a  bench 
warrant  for  his  arrest  and  production  on 
March 4, 2014.  When produced by the Police 
authorities, before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, 
on March 4, 2014, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
ordered judicial detention of Mr. Subrata Roy 
and  two  other  male  directors  and  granted 
liberty  to  the  Saharas,  to  submit  a  proposal 
in respect of the monies due under the order 
dated August 31, 2012.  Mr. Subrata Roy filed 
Writ Petition No. 57/2014 against the aforesaid 
order of detention.

of  the  said  3,612  applications,  SEBI  has 
made  refunds  in  respect  of  445  applications 
involving  equal  number  of  deposit  accounts 
for  an  aggregate  amount  of  `1,25,21,241 
including interest of   `43,83,241.  Out of the 
remaining  3,167  applications,  in  respect  of 
424  applications 
involving  1,683  deposit 
accounts,  certain  deficiencies  were  observed 
in  the  applications/supporting  documents 
submitted  by  the  applicants  which  were 
brought  to  the  notices  of  the  applicants  for 
their  clarification/rectification,  and  replies 
are  awaited  from  them.  SEBI  is  unable  to 
process  1,260  applications  involving  7,159 
deposit accounts as these represent multiple 
investment  category  which  issue  is  pending 
before  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court,  and  92 
cases involving 92 deposit accounts which are 
not  meeting  the  extant  refund  methodology 
adopted by SEBI. 1,776 applications involving 
4,395 deposit accounts could not be processed 
as  these  applications  fall  under  “mismatch 
category” i.e., either the investment details as 
furnished by the applicant are not matching 
with  those  submitted  by  Saharas,  or  the 
investments are already claimed to have been 
refunded by Saharas or the investment details 
are not found in the information submitted by 
Saharas.

vi.  Mr.  Parambir  Singh  vs  SEBI  (Crl 
Misc  No.  831/2007)  Date  of  Decision- 
November 13, 2013
 
Criminal  Complaint  was  filed  by  SEBI 
under  Section  200  Cr.P.C  r/w  Section  24  (1) 
and 27 of SEBI Act, 1992 for violation of CIS 
Regulations,  1999  against  M/s  Himanchal 
Harvest Farms Ltd and its directors. The trial 
court took cognizance and issued summons to 
the accused person, including the Petitioner, 
which  was  challenged  by  the  Petitioner  on 
the  ground  of  delay  in  filing  the  complaint. 
SEBI  opposed  the  petition  contending  that 
the  offences  for  which  petitioner  has  been 
prosecuted  are  continuing  offence,  and 
despite  directions 
issued  by  respondent 
on  December  7,  2000,  petitioner  has  failed 
to  refund  the  money  collected  under  the 
investment schemes. The Hon’ble High Court 
being satisfied with the submission advanced 
on  behalf  of  SEBI,  was  pleased  to  dismiss 
the  petition  vide  order  dated  November  13, 
2013  by  holding  that  the  contravention  of 
provisions  as  alleged  in  the  complaint  gives 
rise to continuing offences, hence, complaint 
can’t be quashed as being time barred. 
vii.  M/s  Janraksha  Green  Forests  Ltd.  and 
Others vs SEBI (Crl Misc No. 1356/2012),

Prosecution  was  launched  against  the 
captioned  company  and  its  directors  for  the 
violation of SEBI Act, 1992 r/w CIS Regulations, 
1999.  Trial  court  considered  the  case  as  a 
warrant  trial  case  and  listed  the  same  for 
recording  of  pre-charge  evidence.  However, 
the Petitioners challenged the impugned order 
before Delhi High Court on the ground that a 
summons trial case cannot be converted into 
warrant trial case. The grievance of petitioners 
was that once the directions of SEBI were not 
followed by the Petitioner within prescribed 
time, then cause of action to file the complaint 

203

Annual Report 2013-14

in question against petitioners (accused) arose 
on  July  15,  2002.  But  instant  complaint  was 
filed  after  waiting  for  one  year  and  in  the 
meanwhile, Section 24 (1) of SEBI Act, 1992 was 
amended. The effect of amendment was that 
mode of the trial for the offences in question 
were changed to warrant trial instead. 
The  Hon’ble  High  Court  dismissed  the 
 
Petition and held that since the complaint in 
question  had  been  filed  under  the  amended 
section 24 of SEBI Act, 1992, the procedure to 
be adopted would be of warrant trial.

SECURITIES APPELLATE TRIBUNAL 

i.  Mrs.  Madhuri  Pitti  vs  SEBI  (Appeal 

No. 2 of 2013)

Mrs.  Madhuri  Pitti  (Appellant  No.1), 
 
M/s.  Pitti  Electrical  Equipment  Pvt.  Ltd., 
(Appellant No 2) is the “acquirers” of M/s Pitti 
Laminations  Ltd.,  (Target  Company).  They 
were  acting  jointly  with,  Mr. Akshay  S.  Pitti 
(Appellant No. 3) and Mr. Sharad Pitti, (not a 
party in appeal). A preferential allotment was 
authorised on August 11, 2011 in the Annual 
General  Meeting  of  the  shareholders  of  the 
target  company  resulting  in  the  increase  of 
shareholding of the promoter group from 41.7 
percent to 59.2 percent requiring the acquirers 
(along with persons acting in concert) to make 
an  open  offer  under  Regulation  11(1)  of  the 
SEBI  (SAST),  1997  Regulations. Accordingly, 
a  public  announcement  was  made  by 
the  appellants  on  September  9,  2011  and 
simultaneously a Draft Letter of offer was filed 
before the respondent i.e. SEBI on September 
19, 2011.
 
It came to light that on two occasions in 
the past i.e. April 26, 2006 and April 11, 2007,  
Mr.  Akshay  Pitti  had  individually  acquired 
shares consequent to conversion of warrants 
which triggered Regulation 10 of the Takeover 

204

Regulations,  1997.  Since  Regulation  10  had 
been  attracted  on  both  the  occasions,  SEBI 
sent the letter dated December 17, 2012 under 
regulation 18(2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 
interalia,  advising,  to  revise  the  offer  price 
taking  into  consideration  of  acquisition  of 
more  than  15  percent  of  the  shares  by  Mr. 
Akshay Pitti.  
 
Aggrieved by the   letter dated December 
17,  2012,  an  appeal  was  filed  before  SAT. 
The  issue  before  the  Hon’ble  Tribunal  was 
whether  the  individual  acquisition  of  shares 
by Mr. Akshay Pitti of 4.97 percent and 1.27 
percent  of  shares  in  the  target  company  on 
April 26, 2006 and April 11, 2007 consequent 
to conversion of warrants resulting in increase 
in  his  individual  shareholding  breaching 
the  15  percent  limit  should  be  considered 
as triggering of regulation 10 of SEBI (SAST 
Regulations),  1997  resulting  into  consequent 
obligations for the same. SAT has vide order 
dated October 31, 2013,  disposed of the appeal 
by permitting the appellants to continue with 
the  offer  excluding  SEBI’s  directions  on  the 
ground  that  SEBI  (SAST  Regulations),  1997 
intended  to  bring  out  a  clear  distinction 
between  individual  acquiring  of  shares  on 
the one hand and shares acquired by persons 
acting  in  concert  on  the  other.  It  observed 
that  the  individual  acquisition  breaching 
the  threshold  of  15  percent  should  not  be 
considered  as  triggering  of  regulation  10. 
Instead,  only  the  collective  shareholding  of 
all PACs together may be considered for the 
purpose  of  breaching  the  threshold  limit.  It 
further  observed  that  liability  to  make  open 
offer for breach of threshold limit by individual 
acquisition is stipulated only in SEBI (SAST) 
Regulations,  2011.  The  appeal  filed  by  SEBI 
under section 15Z of SEBI Act, 1992 is pending 
before the Supreme Court.

ii.  M/s.  Clearwater  Capital  Partners 
(Cyprus) Ltd. vs SEBI (Appeal No. 21 of 
2013) 
 
The  appellant/acquirer  had  subscribed 
to  the  Foreign  Currency  Convertible  Bonds 
(FCCBs) for a consideration of USD 18 million 
offered  by  the  target  company,  M/s  Kamat 
Hotels  India  Ltd.  as  per  the  shareholder’s 
resolution  dated  September  23,  2006.    Upon 
conversion of the FCCBs, the appellant holding 
along with PAC increased to 32.23 percent post 
equity  share  capital  of  the  target  company. 
Since it has triggered regulation 3(1) of SEBI 
(SAST  Regulations),  2011,  the  appellant 
made a public announcement dated January 
11, 2012. The letter of offer dated January 25, 
2012 with the offer price calculated as  ` 135 
per share were filed by the merchant banker 
with SEBI.
 
However,  on  August  13,  2010,  the 
target  company  had  entered  into  an  inter-se 
agreement  with  the  appellant,  and  specified 
promoters  of  the  target  company.    Various 
clauses  in  the  inter-se  agreement  conferred 
on the appellant certain affirmative rights and 
veto rights on the policy decisions of the target 
company.  Hence, the appellant had acquired 
control over the policy decision of the target 
company triggering regulation 12 of the SEBI 
(SAST Regulations), 1997. However, no public 
announcement  was  made  by  the  appellant 
for  the  acquisition  of  control  over  the  target 
company by virtue of the inter-se agreement.
 
In  view  of  the  acquisition  of  control 
and  the  resultant  triggering  of  regulation 
12  of  the  SEBI  (Takeover  Regulations),  1997, 
SEBI offered its comments on the draft letter 
of offer vide letter dated November 30, 2012, 
requiring to incorporate the fact of triggering 
of regulation 12 of the Takeover Regulations 
and to make consequential changes. Aggrieved 
by  the  finding  of  SEBI  that  regulation  12  of 

205

the  appellant  challenged 

the  Takeover  Regulations,  1997  has  been 
triggered, 
the 
impugned  letter  dated  November  30,  2012, 
before SAT. Before the appeal is finally disposed 
of,  the  appellant  completed  the  open  offer 
without following the directions/observations 
of the SEBI contained in impugned letter.
 
SAT  has  vide  order  dated  February  12, 
2014  observed  that  there  is  no  decision  of 
SEBI on the objections raised by the appellant 
regarding  the  directions  in  the  impugned 
letter.  It  also  observed  that  the  impugned 
communication does not set out consequences 
for non-compliance of above directions. In the 
above  scenario,  the  Hon’ble  SAT  permitted 
SEBI to issue any show cause notice for non-
compliance of the directions mentioned in the 
impugned letter, if it chooses to do so.
iii.  M/s.  Gillette  India  Ltd.  vs  SEBI  and 
Others (Appeal No. 65 of 2013)  – Order 
dated July 3, 2013
 
The captioned appeal was filed by M/s 
Gillette India Ltd., (Appellant), against order 
dated April 26, 2013 passed by SEBI, rejecting 
the method proposed by the appellant to attain 
the  minimum  public  shareholding  (MPS) 
requirement of 25 percent in accordance with 
the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules, 
1957. 
 
jointly  promoted  by 
the  M/s  Poddar  Group  and  M/s  Procter  and 
Gamble Group (P&G Group) who were parties 
to  a  Shareholders’  Agreement  dated  July 
10,  1996  (SHA),  made  an  application  dated 
October 10, 2012 to SEBI under circular dated 
August 29, 2012 proposing a method to attain 
the  mandatory  requirement  of  minimum 
public  shareholding  of  25  percent  in  all 
listed companies, as the public shareholding 
of  the  appellant  was  11.2  percent,  which  is 
significantly below the prescribed 25 percent 
limit. 

The  appellant, 

Annual Report 2013-14

 
The  respective  shareholdings  of  the 
M/s Poddar Group and the M/s P&G Group 
were  12.9  percent  and  75.9  percent.  The 
manner in which to achieve the required public 
shareholding as presented by the appellant in 
the application, in brief, is that the M/s Poddar 
Group would first transfer four percent of its 
shares  to  the  M/s  P&G  Group,  which  being 
an inter-se transfer of shares held by the M/s. 
Poddar Group for around 16 years would be 
exempt from the obligation of making an open 
offer as per Regulation 10(1)(a)(ii) of the SEBI 
(SAST) Regulations, 2011.  As a result of this 
transfer, the holding of the M/s Poddar Group 
would  go  down  to  8.9  percent.  This  would 
be  followed  by  termination  of  the  SHA  and 
amendments  to  the  Articles  of  Association 
of the company, as a result of which the M/s 
Poddar  Group  would  be  classified  as  an 
ordinary  public  shareholder  and  would  lose 
all  its  rights  and  control  over  the  appellant 
as  promoter.    Once  the  M/s  Poddar  Group 
joins  the  ranks  of  a  public  shareholder,  the 
appellant  will  cause  the  M/s  P  &  G  Group, 
who  shall  then  be  holding  79.9  percent  of 
the  issued  share  capital,  to  sell  or  otherwise 
dilute 4.9 percent of their shareholding in the 
appellant company in the manner prescribed 
by  the  SEBI  for  achieving  minimum  public 
shareholding. 
 
SEBI  in  its  letter  dated  April  26,  2013 
inter  alia  stated  that  it  is  not  an  acceptable 
means for achieving the MPS requirement in 
terms of rule 19 A of the Securities Contracts 
(Regulation)  Rules,  1957.  This  letter  of  the 
SEBI was challenged by the appellant in the 
captioned appeal. 
SAT  vide  its  order  dated  July  7,  2013, 
 
upheld the order passed by SEBI by recording 
inter  alia 
the  underlying 
philosophy  behind  the  requirement  of  a 
minimum  public  holding  of  25  percent  is 
prevention  of  concentration  of  shares  in  the 

the  fact 

that 

hands  of  a  few  market  players  by  ensuring 
a sound and healthy public float to stave off 
any  manipulation  or  perpetration  of  other 
unethical  activities  in  the  securities  market. 
SAT also noted that no hardship or problems 
have  been  brought  forth  during  the  course 
of  proceedings  before  this  Tribunal  which 
seem insurmountable to such an extent as to 
lead  the  Appellant  to  come  up  with  such  a 
dubious manner of achieving the 25 percent 
requirement  regarding  public  shareholding 
while ignoring all other perfectly executable 
methods  suggested  by  SEBI 
in  various 
circulars over the past few years.
iv.  M/s.  Bombay  Rayons  Fashions  Ltd.  & 
Others vs SEBI ( Appeal No. 203/ 2013)  
order dated June 28,2013 
 
The appeal was preferred by two entities 
M/s  Bombay  Rayons  Fashions  Ltd.  and  M/s 
B.R.  Machine  Tools  Private  Ltd.  which  were 
the  promoter’s  group  companies.  The  fact 
leading  to  the  dispute  is  that  M/s  Bombay 
Rayons Fashions Ltd. made preferential issue 
of 10 million of optionally convertible warrants 
to M/s B.R. Machine Tools Private Ltd. and to 
M/s  Reynold  Shirting  Ltd.  on  September  13, 
2009.  Pursuant  to  the  above  said  allotment 
of 20 million warrants, 12.5 million warrants 
were  converted  into  equity  shares  within 
the  creeping  acquisition  limit  as  prescribed 
by  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations,  1997.  Thus,  7.5 
million warrants remained to be converted into 
equity shares and the prescribed limitation of 
18  months  for  conversion  of  such  warrants 
was to expire on April 3, 2012.   
 
In the meanwhile, certain developments 
took place which led to the reconstitution of 
the  promoters’  group  and  consequently,  the 
promoter  group’s  holding  in  M/s  Bombay 
Rayons  Fashions  Ltd.  stood  at  93.15  percent 
of the total capital.  In this situation, M/s B.R. 
Machine  Tools  Private  Ltd.  did  not  convert 
the balance 7.5 million outstanding warrants 

206

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

on account of proviso to sub-regulation (2) of 
Regulation 3 of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 
2011.  According  to  the  appellants,  M/s  B.R. 
Machine  Tools  Private  Ltd.  was,  therefore, 
restrained  from  exercising  its  conversion 
option  in  respect  of  7.5  million  outstanding 
warrants  and  this  peculiar  situation  which 
had arisen entirely due to coming into force 
of SAST Regulations, 2011 w.e.f. October 23, 
2011. As such the appellants approached SEBI 
under Regulation 109 (C) of the SEBI (ICDR) 
Regulations, 2009 for grant of relaxation from 
the strict enforcement of Regulation 75 and 77 
of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009.  SEBI vide 
its  reasoned  order  dated  August  10,  2012, 
rejected  the  request  of  the  appellants.  This 
letter of the respondent was challenged in the 
captioned appeal. 
 
Hon’ble  SAT  noted  that  the  promoter 
group in  M/s Bombay Rayons Fashions Ltd. 
increased  their  shareholding  in  a  systematic 
manner  from  31.54  percent  to  93.2  percent  
during  December  2009  to  December  2011. 
The  process  of  conversion  of  warrants  into 
equity shares went on till September 30, 2011 
when  M/s  B.R.  Machine  Tools  Private  Ltd. 
converted  at  least  2.5  million  warrants  into 
shares.  The  new  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations, 
2011  had  already  been  published  in  the 
official  Gazette  on  September  23,  2011  and 
as  such  the  M/s  B.R.  Machine  Tools  Private 
Ltd. was fully aware of the implication of the 
said  Regulations  which  were  to  come  into 
force on October 23, 2011 i.e. after 30 days of 
their being Gazetted. M/s B.R. Machine Tools 
Private  Ltd.  should  have  atleast  approached 
SEBI for any relaxation or exemption from the 
applicability  of  Regulation  3(2)  of  the  SAST 
Regulation, 2011 immediately after the same 
were Gazetted on September 23, 2011 or after 
October 23, 2011 when they were brought into 
force.  But no such application was preferred 
by  M/s  B.R.  Machine  Tools  Private  Ltd.  at 

that time. Hon’ble SAT was of the view that  
that  M/s  B.R.  Machine  Tools  Private  Ltd. 
has  totally  failed  to  satisfy  the  respondent 
regarding  any  factor  beyond  the  control  of 
the issuer which would have prevented him 
from converting the warrants in question into 
shares. SEBI, therefore, rightly did not exercise 
its jurisdiction to permit any relaxation in the 
matter. The appeal was dismissed.
v.  M/s.  Uditi  Mercantile  Pvt.  Ltd.  vs 
SEBI  (Appeal.  No.  16/2012  &  Misc. 
Application  No.  7/2012);  M/s  Pams 
Investment  Trading  Co.  Pvt.  Ltd.  vs 
SEBI in the scrip of Reliance Industries 
Limited  (Appeal.  No.  22/2012  &  Misc. 
Application No. 10/2012) 
 
Thirty  four    entities  acting  in  concert 
with the promoter group of RIL, are alleged 
to have triggered the SAST Regulations upon 
acquisition  of  shares  on  January  7,  2000  on 
exercise  of  `12  crore  convertible  warrants 
issued  to  them  by  RIL  in  January  1994.  The 
warrants  appeared  to  have  been  issued  at 
a  price  lower  than  the  market  price,  and 
without a supporting resolution of the general 
body of shareholders (the existing resolution 
was  exhausted  by  RIL  in  issuing  warrants 
to  another  entity)  as  brought  out  in  the 
Investigation  Report.  Despite  triggering  the 
SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997, the promoters 
and PACs failed to make the required public 
announcement  in  terms  of  Regulation  11 
of  SEBI 
(SAST)  Regulations,  1997.  The 
Adjudicating  Officer  (AO)  was  appointed 
vide order dated December 15, 2010 and the 
SCNs were issued to the said entities. 
 
The aforesaid appeals were filed by two 
entities representing the allottee group against 
the  appointment  of  AO  vide  order  dated  
December 15, 2010 and the issuance of SCNs 
by the AO, dated  February 24, 2011 and  March 
18, 2011, alleging violation of Regulation 11 of 

207

Annual Report 2013-14

Takeover  Regulations,  1997.  The  appellants 
have  challenged  the  jurisdiction  of  SEBI  on 
the  ground  of  inordinate  delay  in  issue  of 
SCN,  the  maintainability  of  SEBI’s  actions 
on the ground of inapplicability of Takeover 
Regulations, 1997 and difficulty in gathering 
evidence.
 
filed  an  “Affidavit  opposing 
SEBI 
admission”  of  the  appellants’  appeal  on  the 
ground  that  the  order  appointing  the AO  is 
not  an  appealable  order.  SAT  dismissed  the 
appeal  filed  for  challenging  the  issuance  of 
notice to show cause by the adjudicating officer 
for violations relating to failure to make open 
offer  under  the  Takeover  Regulations  and 
directed that the AO may consider the issues 
as raised by the appellants in accordance with 
law.
vi.  M/s.  N  R  Mercantile  Private  Ltd.  vs 
SEBI (Appeal No.138 of 2013) and M/s. 
Imtihaan  Commercial  Private  Ltd.  vs 
SEBI  (Appeal  No.  141  of  2013)  in  the 
matter  of  M/s.  Ramswarup  Industries 
Ltd. 
 
The captioned appeals were filed against 
the  separate  orders  dated  May  31,  2013 
(impugned orders) passed by the Adjudicating 
Officer (AO) vide which penalty of `40,00,000 
and    `13,50,000  were  imposed  on  M/s  N  R 
Mercantile  Private  Ltd.  and  M/s  Imtihaan 
Commercial  Private  Ltd.,  respectively,  for 
the violation of sections 12A(d) and 12A(e) of 
the SEBI Act, 1992 and regulation 3(i) of the 
SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. It was observed 
in  the  impugned  orders  that  the  appellants 
were  insiders  and  had  traded  in  the  shares 
of  M/s  Ramswarup  Industries  Ltd.  while  in 
possession  of  Unpublished  Price  Sensitive 
Information (UPSI). 
 
The  Hon’ble  SAT  upheld  the  orders 
passed by the AO and held that pursuant to 
the amendment to regulation 3(i) of the SEBI 

(PIT) Regulations, 1992, trading in securities 
“when  in  possession  of”  any  unpublished 
price 
constitutes 
violation of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. 
vii.  Mrs.  Komal  Nahata  vs  SEBI  (Appeal 

information 

sensitive 

No. 5 of 2014)
 
The  captioned  appeal  was  filed  against 
the order dated September 30, 2013 (impugned 
order)  vide  which  a  penalty  of  `1  lakh  was 
imposed on the appellant. SEBI found that the 
appellant  failed  to  make  disclosures  under 
regulations  7(1)  and  7(2)  of  the  SEBI  (SAST) 
Regulations, 1997 and under regulation 13(3) 
read  with  regulation  13(5)  of  the  SEBI  (PIT) 
Regulations,  1992  in  respect  of  transfer  of 
3,75,000  shares  of  M/s  Arvind  International 
Ltd.  (AIL)  to  the  appellant’s  demat  account, 
which constituted 5.4 percent shareholding of 
AIL. 
 
The  Hon’ble  SAT,  while  upholding  the 
impugned  order,  held  that  penalty  for  non-
compliance  of  SEBI  (SAST)  Regulations, 
1997  and  SEBI  (PIT)  Regulations,  1992    is 
not  dependent  upon  the  investors  actually 
suffering on account of such non-disclosure. 

viii.  Mr.  Navin  Kumar  Tayal  vs  SEBI    and 
other connected appeals - in the matter 
of Bank of Rajasthan

The  captioned  appeal/s  were 

 
filed 
challenging  the  SEBI  order  dated  February 
14,  2013  wherein  a  cumulative  penalty  of 
`29.9  crore  was  imposed  on  the  118  entities 
(Represented  in  the  14  appeals)  for  the 
violations of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992, 
the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 and the 
SEBI (SAST) Regulations,1997.
 
Hon’ble  SAT  had  observed  that  some 
of  the  appellants  have  neither  filed  reply  to 
show cause notices issued to them, not availed 
opportunity  of  personal  hearing  offered  to 
them  in  the  adjudication  proceedings  and, 

208

Part Three: Functions of SEBI in Respect of MaĴ ers Speciﬁ ed in Section 11 of SEBI Act, 1992   

therefore,  appellants  are  presumed  to  have 
admitted  charges  leveled  against  them  in 
the  show  cause  notices.  Further,  Hon’ble 
SAT  also  held  that  the  Adjudicating  Officer 
was justified in holding that the transactions 
in  question  were  carried  out  by  promoter 
group in connivance with connected entities 
with  a  view  to  mislead  investors  that  the 
promoter group has divested shares of Bank 
of Rajasthan when in fact there was no such 
divesting  because  both  Promoter  group  and 
the  connected  entities  were  controlled  by 
Tayal family. 
 
Hon’ble SAT partly modified the amount 
of  penalty  imposed  by  the  Adjudicating 
Officer and upheld the penalty to the tune of 
`15.4 crore.
ix.  Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma  and  Mr  Jitendra 
Kumar Sharma vs  SEBI (Appeal No. 27 
of 2013) 
The  appeal  was 

the 
 
adjudication  order  dated  December  19,  2012 
vide which a penalty of `25 lakh was jointly 
and  severally  imposed  on  the  appellants  for 
violation of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) & (d) and 
4(1) of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. It 
was found out that the appellants were related 
as  husband  and  wife  and  that  the  appellant 
no.  1  (Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma,  who  was  a  day 
trader)  was  front  running/  trading  on  basis 
of  the  information  (by  whatsoever  means  it 
was communicated) received from Appellant 
No. 2 (Mr. Jitendra Kumar Sharma, who was a 
dealer in securities for Central Bank of India). 
Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma  made  handsome  profits 
by manipulating sale price of one scrip only 
on  each  and  every  of  the  14  days,  out  of  40 
days of investigation period, and was suitably 
supported,  in  this  activity  by  Mr.  Jitendra 
Kumar Sharma. 
 
It was argued by the appellants that front 
running  charge  against  Mrs.  Vibha  Sharma 

filed  against 

cannot  be  applicable  in  view  of  the  earlier 
judgement of the Hon’ble SAT in Mr. Dipak 
Patel Vs. Adjudicating Officer.  
 
The  Hon’ble  SAT,  while  upholding  the 
order  of  the Adjudicating  Officer,  inter  alia, 
have  given  a  liberal  interpretation  to  the 
concept  of  front  running  and  held  that  any 
person,  who  is  connected  with  the  capital 
market,  and  indulges  in  front  running  is 
guilty of a fraudulent market practice as such 
liable to be punished as per law by SEBI. The 
definition of front running, therefore, cannot 
be put in a straight-jacket formula. 

x.  Appeal No. 126 of 2013 by M/s Pan Asia 

from 

Advisors & Anr. vs. SEBI
 
The  appeal  was  filed  against  the  order 
dated  June  20,  2013  of  SEBI  wherein  M/s 
Pan Asia Advisors and Mr. Arun Panchariya 
(the  appellants)  who  were  involved  in  the 
conversion  of  Global  Depository  Receipts 
(GDR)  into  equity  shares  to  sell  in  Indian 
markets,  were  barred 
rendering 
services in connection with instruments that 
are  defined  as  securities  in  section  2(h)  of 
Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956 in 
the Indian market and also  prohibited them 
from accessing the capital market directly or 
indirectly, for a period of 10 years, from the 
date of the order. The said order dated June 
20, 2013 was under challenge in the appeal.
 
In the appeal, the appellants have raised 
a preliminary objection as to the jurisdiction 
of SEBI to take action in the matter of issuance 
of  GDRs  outside  India  and  subsequent 
transaction  of  sale/purchase  of  underlying 
shares  released  on  redemption  of  GDRs  in 
the  securities  market  in  India.  The  Hon’ble 
SAT,  after  hearing  the  parties,  disposed  of 
the  matter,  vide  order  dated  September    30, 
2013 wherein the Presiding Officer held that 
SEBI has jurisdiction in the matter while the 
other two Members of the Hon’ble SAT have 

209

Annual Report 2013-14

held that SEBI does not have jurisdiction and 
accordingly,  the  appeal  was  allowed.  The 
two  Members  of  the  Hon’ble  SAT,  inter  alia 
observed in the said order that the SEBI Act, 
1992;  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulations) 
Act, 1956; the Depositories Act, 1996 and the 
Companies Act, 1956 give no power to SEBI 
to  exercise  any  jurisdiction  in  respect  of  the 
issuance,  trading  or  conversion  of  GDRs 
abroad and SEBI may have a role only when 
GDRs  are  converted  into  shares  and  traded 
on Indian Stock Exchanges, and that too when 
any loss or prejudice is caused to the Indian 
investors or to the Indian capital market.
However,  the  Presiding  Officer  the 
 
Hon’ble SAT disagreed with the above decision 
of  the  Members  and  dismissed  the  appeal, 
inter alia, on the reasons that the transactions 
relating 
to  sale/purchase  of  underlying 
shares in the securities market in India (after 
conversion  of  GDRs  created/sold/traded 
outside  India)  are  fraudulent  transactions 
and  that  fraudulent  intention  existed  right 
from  the  date  of  issuance  of  shares  through 
GDR  mechanism,  then,  SEBI  would  be 
justified in  invoking jurisdiction under SEBI 
Act, 1992 and debar persons connected with 
such transactions from rendering services in 
connection with instruments that are defined 
as securities (as in section 2(h) of SCRA, 1956) 
in the Indian market for such period as it deems 
fit  and  further  prohibit  persons  involved  in 
such  fraudulent  transactions  from  accessing 
the  capital  market  directly  or  indirectly  for 
such  period  as  it  deems  fit.  The  Presiding 
Officer has observed that the appellants were 
architects  of  a  fraudulent  scheme  and  were 
involved at every stage with their connivance 
of  connected  entities  from  raising  ordinary 
shares  through  GDR  mechanism  up  to  the 
stage of sale/purchase of underlying shares in 

210

the Indian securities market and accordingly 
they are liable for action under SEBI Act, 1992 
and regulations made thereunder.

 
SEBI  filed  appeal  before  the  Hon’ble 
Supreme  Court  challenging  the  majority 
decision  of  the  Hon’ble  SAT  and  vide  order 
dated December 13, 2013, the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court stayed the operation of the order dated 
September 30, 2013 of the Hon’ble SAT. 

d.  CONSUMER COURTS 

 
Mr.  Manoj  Aggarwal  vs  M/s  J.M. 
Financial  Mutual  Fund  &  another  (First 
Appeal No. 590/2013) before State Consumer 
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi 
Order dated July 15, 2013
The appeal in the matter was preferred 
 
against  the  order  of  District  Consumer 
Disputes Redressal Forum, Delhi wherein the 
complaint was dismissed on the ground that 
complainant is not a consumer as per section 
2(1)(d)  of  Consumer  Protection  Act,  1986 
(Act) and directed him to approach SEBI for 
relief.  The  complainant  had  invested  in  the 
respondent fund and he alleged manipulation 
by Respondent, as the money he invested got 
reduced due to arbitrary merger of his scheme 
by  the  Respondent  with  another  scheme 
without justification or his consent. The issue 
before  the  Commission  was  whether  stock 
market trader or investor in mutual fund is a 
consumer or not under the Act. Answering the 
same in negative, the Commission dismissed 
the appeal on the ground that the Act is not 
for entertaining or compensating speculative 
transactions and losses and trading in shares 
are carried out with the help of intermediaries 
and  provision  for  adjudication  of  disputes 
in  this  regard  is  present  in  SEBI  Rules  and 
Guidelines.

h.  SCR (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and 
Clearing  Corporations)(Amendment) 
Regulations,  2013  w.e.f.  September  2, 
2013
 
The Amendment Regulations enshrines 
finality of settled transactions. It also provides 
for  right  of  Clearing  Corporations  over 
collateral and assets of the clearing members 
in  order  to  recover  dues  arising  from 
discharge  of  their  clearing  and  settlement 
functions. 
(Prohibition  of  Fraudulent 
i. 
SEBI 
and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  relating 
to  Securities  Market)  (Amendment) 
Regulations,  2013  w.e.f.  September  6, 
2013
 
In order to make illegal mobilization of 
funds  without  obtaining  a  certificate  under 
the  SEBI  (Collective  Investment  Schemes) 
Regulations,  1999,  a  fraudulent  and  unfair 
trade practice under regulation 4 of the SEBI 
(PFUTP) Regulations, 2003, a new clause was 
inserted in regulation 4(2) as clause (t). This 
provision  enables  imposition  of  deterrent 
monetary  penalties  for  illegal  mobilization 
of funds by floating schemes in the nature of 
unregistered  collective  investment  schemes 
within the existing scheme of adjudication.
 
There was a perception that an activity 
specifically prohibited under Regulation 4(2) 
of  the  SEBI  (PFUTP  Regulations),  2003  was 
restricted to a certain class of persons despite 
regulation  3  being  couched  in  wide  terms 
to  cover  any  person  irrespective  of  who  the 
perpetrator  of  fraud  or  unfair/manipulative 
practice  is.  Therefore,  an  explanation  to 
regulation  4(2)  was  inserted  to  clarify  that 
an  activity  falling  foul  of  regulation  3  is 
prohibited notwithstanding that it may not be 
included in categories of activity enumerated 
in  Regulation  4(2)(a)  to  (s),  or  is  mentioned 
in  Regulation  4(2)(a)  to  (s),  but  is  restricted 
therein to a certain class of persons.

Amendment 

k.  SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) 
(Second  Amendment)  Regulations, 
2013 w.e.f. September 27, 2013
The 

 
Regulations
implements  one  registration  per  stock 
exchange  for  all  segments  and  categories 
of  stock  brokers.  Registration  of  clearing 
members has also been introduced. Further, 
where  an  entity  is  already  registered    as  a 
stock broker, he would not require a separate 
registration as a clearing member and vice-
versa, if such entity is a member of a stock 
exchange  promoted  clearing  corporation  of 
which  he  desires  to  seek  membership  and 
registration  or  vice  versa.  Consequently,  the 
fee, deposit and networth requirements have 
also been modified. Since the amendments do 
away with segment-wise registration, multiple 
nomenclature used such as trading member, 
proprietary  trading  member,  etc.,  are  now 
referred to commonly as “stock broker”.

The  three  day APRC  meeting  held  in  New  Delhi  aimed  at  further  enhancing  mutual  cooperation,  exchange  of 
information and highlighting common issues of concern amongst the securities market regulators of the Asia-Paciﬁ c 
region, one of the fastest growing regions of the world.
The event began with an Enforcement Directors’ (ED) Meeting on April 29, 2013, that provided a platform for the 
regulators to share the insights on the recent enforcement trends, innovative investigative techniques and the need for 
enhanced cooperation amongst the regulators to strengthen the enforcement network in the region. The ED meeting 
was organized into two themes: Insider Trading Regulatory Framework” and “Recent enforcement trends & innovative 
tools and techniques”. The regulators shared their insights and shared information on the use of new techniques and 
technology to deal with investigation and enforcement. The ED meeting also stressed the need to further enhance the 
information sharing mechanism in the region.

the potential strong growth of securities markets in the future and the importance of securities regulators engaging 
with  one  another  both  at  the  global  and  at  the  regional  level.  The  meeting  was  preceded  by  a  Roundtable  on 
‘“Regulatory inconsistencies in Asia/Paciﬁ c Region-Scope and Extent? What needs to be done from policy perspective?” The 
Roundtable highlighted the importance of having consistency in their regulatory policies and their implementation 
with a view to reduce the possible regulatory arbitrage across the jurisdictions in the region.
Towards the end of the Meeting, the APRC chairman, Mr. Sinha summarized the initiatives taken by the APRC 
Secretariat to increase cooperation amongst regulators of the region. Such initiatives include Industry roundtable to 
deliberate issues of common interests, quarterly issuance of APRC Digest, Creation of central Enforcement Database,

posted into the database by 8 jurisdictions.

B.  Association  With  G-20 

/  Financial 

Stability Board
 
The  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  is 
an international body established to address 
financial  system  vulnerabilities  and  to  drive 
the  development  and 
implementation  of 
strong  regulatory,  supervisory  and  other 
policies  in  the  interest  of  financial  stability. 
One  of  the  main  mandates  of  the  FSB  is  to 
implement  G-20  Policy  announcements  on 
financial regulation. 

SEBI  is  a  member  of  the  Plenary  and 
 
Regional Committee Group- RCG (Asia) of the 
FSB.  During 2013-14, FSB Plenary met three 
times. The FSB met in Basel on June 24, 2013, 
Moscow on November 8, 2013 and London on 
March 31, 2014. At its various meetings, the FSB 
discussed  vulnerabilities  affecting  the  global 
financial system and reviewed work plans for 
completing  the  core  financial  reforms  such

priorities  and  work  plan.  SEBI  participated 
in  the  FSB  meetings  and  FSB  RCG  for  Asia 
meeting  held 
in  2013-14.  Further,  SEBI 
provides comments to the Ministry of Finance 
on various FSB issues since the MoF is also a 
member to the FSB from India. 
Since  the  onset  of  the  global  financial 
 
crisis, the G-20 has established core elements 
of a new global financial regulatory framework 
that  will  make  the  financial  system  more 
resilient  and  better  able  to  serve  the  needs 
of  the  real  economy.  National  authorities

C. 
Joint Forum 
 
The Joint Forum is a co-operative cross-
sector group which was established in 1996 by 
its three parent bodies, the Basel Committee 
on  Banking  Supervision  (BCBS),  the  IOSCO 
and the International Association of Insurance 
Supervisors (IAIS), to deal with issues common 
to  the  banking,  securities  and  insurance 
sectors,  including  the  regulation  of  financial 
conglomerates. SEBI is a member of the Joint 
Forum since February 2012. The Joint Forum 
has  recently  been  working  on  areas  relating 
to  longevity  risk  transfer  markets,  mortgage 
insurance and point of sale disclosure in the 
insurance, banking and securities sector.
D.  Engagement 

European 

with 

Authorities
The  European  Parliament  and 

the 
 
Council  adopted 
the  European  Market 
Infrastructure Regulations (EMIR) on July 4, 
2012.  These  Regulations  came  into  force  on 
August 16, 2012. Article 25(1) of the European 
Market  Infrastructure  Regulations  (EMIR) 
states that “a CCP established in third country 
may provide services to clearing members or 
trading venues established in the Union only 

228

where  the  CCP  is  recognized  by  European 
Securities  Markets  Agency  (ESMA)”.  For 
recognition  of  a  non-EU  CCP,  the  EC  has 
to  be  satisfied  that  the  country’s  legal  and 
supervisory framework (including regulations 
and  laws)  are  equivalent  to  EMIR.  Also  the 
jurisdiction in which CCP is established needs 
to  have  equivalent  systems  for  anti-money 
laundering  and  combating  the  financing  of 
terrorism.  The  last  date  for  submission  of 
applications by CCPs for obtaining recognition 
was  September  15,  2013.  CCPs  from  India 
have already submitted their applications for 
obtaining the said recognition. SEBI is also in 
touch  with  the  European  authorities,  in  this 
regard.
 
The issue of extra territorial reach of EMIR 
was  actively  debated  at  the  APRC  Meeting 
last year under the Chairmanship of Shri U.K. 
Sinha. Pursuant to these discussions, the issue 
has  been  collectively  taken  up  by  SEBI  and 
other APRC  jurisdictions  with  the  European 
Commission and the ESMA Authorities. 
E.  Bilateral Engagements 
 
Along  with  its  engagements  at  the 
multilateral  levels,  SEBI  has  also  entered 
into  bilateral  MoUs  with  a  cross-section  of 
jurisdictions. Such bilateral agreements, while 
further  strengthening  and  consolidating  the 
existing  communication  channels,  pave  the 
way  for  enhanced  mutual  co-operation  in 
respect  of  a  variety  of  matters  pertaining  to 
supervision,  investigation,  enforcement  and 
technical assistance in the securities markets.
a.  MoU  with  Comisión  Nacional  de 

Valores, (CNV) Argentina
SEBI signed a bilateral Memorandum of 
 
Understanding  with  the  Comisión  Nacional

to  various  International  Treaties  and 
Dialogues
 
The  ever  increasing  globalization  and 
interconnectedness of financial markets calls 
for  newer  and  dynamic  levels  of  regulatory 
co-operation  at  varying  stages.  Towards  this 
objective,  SEBI  along  with  the  Government 
of  India  (GoI)  and  other  regulatory  bodies, 
was seen to make its own set of contributions. 
During the year, SEBI continued to contribute 
towards  an  effective  and  useful  engagement 
with the GoI as regards various international 
treaties,  under  consideration  by  the  GoI  for 
areas related to the securities markets. 
In  this  direction,  SEBI  provided  its 
 
inputs to the Ministry of Finance on various 
issues,  agenda  items  and  topics  relating 
to  the  securities  markets,  for  a  number  of 
bilateral dialogues thorough the year. A few 
such  treaties  and  dialogues  include  the  4th

The  SEBI-OECD  Conference  on  Corporate  Governance  began  with  discussions  on  global  institutional  investor
