Section 4: Other Communications to Depositories having 

Policy Implications 

4.1. Pledge of Shares through depository system49 

 Section 12 of the Depositories Act and Regulation 58 of the SEBI (Depositories 
and Participants) Regulations, 1996 along with the relevant Bye Laws of the 
Depositories  clearly  enumerate  the  manner  of  creating  pledge.  It  is  felt  that 
there is a need to communicate to the BOs that any procedure followed other 
than as specified under the aforesaid provisions of law shall not be treated as 
pledge. 
 
In  order  to  clarify  the  same,  the  depositories  are  advised  to  issue  a 
communiqué to the DPs advising them to inform BOs about the procedure for 
pledging of shares held in demat form as enumerated in the relevant sections 
of the Depositories Act and SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 
1996. Depositories may also advise DPs that an off-market transfer of shares 
leads to change in ownership and cannot be treated as pledge. Further, this 
issue may also be taken up in the investor awareness programs wherein the 
manner  of  creation  of  pledge  can  be  effectively  communicated  to  the  BOs 
directly. 
 

4.2. SMS alerts for demat accounts operated by Power of Attorney50 

 
Subscription to SMS Alert facility for depository accounts operated through 
Power  of  Attorney  (POA)  would  be  mandatory  except  in  case  of  accounts 
held by non-individuals, foreign nationals, and NRIs. 
 

4.3. Opening of demat account in case of HUF51 

 
It is noted that as per law, in case of HUF, shares can be held in the name of 
Existing  Karta  on  behalf  of  HUF.  Therefore,  HUF  demat  accounts  can  be 
opened in the name of Existing Karta but not in the name of Deceased Karta 
and HUF entity. 
 

4.4. Exemption  from  sending  quarterly  statements  of  transactions  by 
depository participants (DPs) to clients in respect of demat accounts with 
no transactions and no security balances52

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 

 
SEBI  has  provided  exemption  to  Depository  Participants  from  sending 
quarterly transaction statements to the clients in respect of demat accounts 
with  no  transactions  and  no  security  balances  subject  to  the  following 
conditions: 
 

•  Client is informed in advance that it will not be receiving Transaction 
Statements  for  such  accounts  till  there  are  any  transactions  or 
security holdings in the demat account.  

•  KYC and PAN requirement in respect of all such depository accounts 

are complied.  

•  No Annual Maintenance Charges are levied for such an account.  
•  Information which is required to be disseminated by Participants by 
way of a  note in the  Transaction Statements will  be  required to be 
communicated to such Clients separately.  

•  The Internal Auditor of the Participant shall comment in its internal 

audit report on compliance of the aforesaid requirements.  

 

4.5. Withdrawal by issuers from the depository53 

 
As  regards  voluntary  withdrawal  by  issuers  from  the  depository,  it  is 
informed  that  listed  companies  may  not  be  allowed  to  withdraw  from  the 
depository system unless they delist their securities from the stock exchanges.  
 
As  regards  companies  under  liquidation  are  concerned,  it  is  informed  that 
deactivation  of  the  ISIN  may  be  only  done  in  cases  where  companies  have 
been  liquidated.  In  other  cases  where  companies  are  being  liquidated, 
deactivation of ISIN resulting in total freezing may not be desirable as it will 
disallow investors to hold shares in dematerialized form 
 

4.6. Discontinuation   of  sending   transaction   statements   by   depository 

participants to clients54 
SEBI allowed discontinuation of sending transaction statements by depository 
participants to clients subject to the following conditions: 

•  Transaction 

statements  were 

returned  undelivered  on 

three 

consecutive occasions. 

•  The  depository  participant  (DP)  maintains  proof  that  the  transaction 

statements were returned undelivered.

•  The transaction statements were returned undelivered for the reasons 
which  clearly  establish  that  the  client  no  longer  resides  at  the  given 
address  (i.e.  party  shifted,  etc.)  and  not  for  other  reasons  (i.e. 
residence/office closed, address incorrect, address incomplete, etc.). 

•  The  DP  informs  such  clients  through  alternative  means  (such  as 
outbound  call,  SMS  or  email)  that  their  transaction  statements  are 
returned undelivered and they need to communicate the proper (new) 
address. 

•  The  DP  ensures  that  on  receipt  of  request  for  address  modification 
from  the  client  as  per  the  stipulated  procedure,  the  dispatch  of 
transaction statements is immediately started. Further, the DP ensures 
that transaction statements that were not delivered and dispatched due 
to  discontinuation  are  also  dispatched  immediately  without  any 
additional cost to the clients. 
 

4.7. Further issue of shares under Section 86 of Companies Act and Companies 

(Issue of Share capital with Differential Voting Rights) Rules, 200155 

 
In  all  cases  of  shares  issued  by  companies  under  Section  86(a)  (ii)  of 
Companies  Act  and  Companies  (Issue  of  Share  Capital  with  Differential 
Voting  Rights)  Rules,  2001,  separate  ISIN  may  be  allotted  to  differentiate 
such shares from ordinary shares.

(cid:131) 

 

Please   refer   to   SEBI   Circular   No.   SEBI/MRD/DEP/Cir- 3/06   
dated February 21, 200638   whereby   depositories   were   advised   to   
instruct      Depository  Participants  (DPs)  to  update  the  MICR  code  and 
bank details of the client in database of depositories. 

It  has  been  informed  by  RBI  that  they  have  been  receiving  complaints 
from  managers  to  the  issues  that  the  funds    routed    through    the  
electronic  mode  are  getting   returned by destination banks because of 
incorrect  or  old  account  numbers  provided    by  beneficiary  account 
holders. 

(cid:131)  RBI has stated that Investors will have to ensure through their DPs that 
bank  account  particulars  are  updated  in  master  record  periodically,  to 
ensure  that  their  refunds,    dividend    payments  etc.    reach  the  correct 
account,  without  loss  of  time.  RBI  has  also  suggested  incorporation  of

Indian Financial System  Code (IFSC)  of  customer's bank  branches apart 
from  9  digit  MICR  code;  since  IFSC  of  bank's  branches  is  used  for 
remittance through National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).  

It is advised that necessary action be taken in this matter to ensure that 
correct  account  particulars  of  investors  are  available  in  the  database  of 
depositories. 

4.9.  Establishment  of  connectivity  by  Clearing  House  /  Clearing  Corporation 

(CH/CC) with the Depository – Clarification57 
 
•  On examination of the provisions of Regulations 19(a) and 31 of the SEBI 
(Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996,  it  is  advised  that 
registration  of  a  CC/CH  of  a  stock  exchange  as  a  DP  with  SEBI  is  not 
mandatory  and  a  pre-requisite  for  it  to  obtain  connectivity  with  the 
depositories.  However,  if  the  CC/CH  of  a  stock  exchange  desires  to 
function as any other "Depository Participant", i.e. to open BO accounts for 
investors  or  clearing  member  account,  registration  as  DP  with  SEBI  is 
mandatory. 
In  view  of  the  above,  Depositories  are  advised  to  provide  continuous 
electronic  means  of  communication  /  connectivity  to  the  CH/CC  of  the 
Exchanges without insisting for a mandatory registration as DP with SEBI 
with  a  condition  that  such  entities  would  not  be  permitted  to  open  BO 
accounts for investors or clearing member account.

4.10. 

Computing  and  monitoring  of  the  Aggregate  Value  of  Portfolio  of 
Securities (AVPS) of the BOs held in dematerialised form by Stock Broker 
DPs 

 
For  the  purpose  of  computing  the  AVPS  of  the  beneficial  owners  held  in 
dematerialised  form  under  Regulation  19(a)(viii)  of  SEBI  (Depositories  and 
Participant)  Regulations,  1996,  the  securities  held  by  bank  and  financial 
institutions  as  well  as  promoters  holdings  of  a  company  held 
in 
dematerialised form, may be excluded58. 
In view of the potential risk to the system and also to maintain the integrity of 
the market, the depositories are advised to develop an appropriate systemic 
alert  in  the  depository  system,  so  as  to  enable  the  system  to  generate  and 
convey automatic alerts to those SBDPs that reach a pre-determined level of 
exposure. These alerts would serve as forewarnings to the SBDPs to the fact 
that they are approaching their respective maximum exposure limits. [Note:

For this purpose, the depositories may monitor the value of securities with its 
SBDPs on an "end of the day" basis.]59 
 

4.11. Deadline time for accepting non pay-in related instructions60  

 

4.13.1.  The  depositories  are  advised  that  any  overrun  of  the  time 
specified for 'spot delivery contract' in the SCRA would result in the 
contract becoming illegal under section 16 of the SCRA (unless it is 
put through the stock exchange). The DP-BO agreement cannot add 
anything  to  or  subtract  anything  from  this  position.  However,  it 
should  be  the  responsibility  of  the  DP  to  ensure  that  the  client's 
contract  is  not  rendered  illegal  on  account  of  delayed  execution  of 
the delivery instruction. 

4.13.2. Keeping  the  hardships  to  change  all  the  existing  DP-BO 
agreements to enforce the above into consideration, it is advised that 
suitable  bye  laws  can  be  made  under  section    26(2)(e)  and  (d)    of 
Depositories Act,   1996 for imposing   such   obligation   on   the   
DPs.     Therefore,    it is   advised   to  amend/insert bye  laws which 
should expressly provide that the DPs shall execute the non pay-in 
related  instructions  on  the  same  day  or  on  the  next  day  of  the 
instruction. 
  suitable 
instructions may be issued to DPs to adhere to such time limit. 

  Further,  pending  such  amendment, 

4.13.3.  to  The  above  clause  may  be  suitably  incorporated  in  the  DP-BO 

 

 

agreement while opening new accounts. 

4.12. Clarification  on  our  circular  no.  SMDRP/Policy/Cir-28/99  dated 

 

August 23, 199961. 

 
Please refer to para 4 of the captioned circular which is reproduced below :- 
 
"In  cases  where  a  DP  has  already  sent  information  about  dematerialisation 
electronically to a Registrar but physical shares have not been received, the registrar 
will accept the demat request and carry out dematerialization on the indemnity given 
by the DP and proof of dispatch of document given by DP." para2.3.4 
 
It is clarified that the above provision shall be applicable to all the securities 
like scrips, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other marketable securities 
eligible  to  be  held  in  dematerialised  form  in  a  depository  as  defined  in 
Regulation 28 of the SEBl (Depository and Participants) Regulations, 1996.

4.13. Voting rights in respect of securities held in pool account62 

 
It was informed that the corporate benefits availed by the clearing member, 
clearing  corporation  and  intermediaries  shall  be  held  in  trust  on  behalf  of 
beneficiary  owners.  Therefore, the clearing member, clearing  corporation  as 
well  as  the  intermediaries  cannot  have  voting  rights  in  respect  of  securities 
held in the pool account. 
 

4.14. Operation of minor’s demat account63  

 
Under  [The]  Hindu  Minority  and  Guardianship  Act,  1956,  permission  of 
Court is required in the case of transfer by a natural guardian of immovable 
property of a minor.  However, shares are not immovable properly.   Section 
2(7)  of  Sale  of  Goods  Act.  1930  includes  shares  within  the  definition  of 
"goods''.   Neither the Indian Contract Act nor the Sale of Goods Act provide 
for  transfer  by  sale  or  otherwise  by  guardian  /natural  guardian  of 
goods/movable property in the name of minor to the effect that permission of 
court is required in the matter of such transfer.   In the case of accounts  of 
minor in banks also, the guardian is entitled to open, operate and even close 
the  account also.     The DP  account can,  therefore, be operated by a  natural 
guardian  without  any  order  from  the  court  though  the  same  is  neither 
expressly permitted nor prohibited. 
 

4.15. Guidelines  for  dematerialisation  of  shares  sent  for  transfer  by  (A) 

Investors and (B) Custodians.64 
 
The operational guidelines for dematerialisation of shares sent for transfer by 
(A) Investors and (B) Custodians are  as under. The guidelines are framed in 
order to reduce the to and fro movement of shares between companies and 
investors/custodians. The implementation of the guidelines is subject to the 
condition  that  the  company  shall  get  a  certificate  from  a  Chartered 
Accountant or a Company Secretary holding a Certificate of Practice that the 
company  has  followed  the  procedure  mentioned  in  the  schemes  and  to  the 
effect that: 
• 

the  company  has  followed  the  necessary  procedures  for  effecting  the 
original transfer. 
the  Register  of  Members  of  the  company  was  accordingly  amended  and 
the shares were transferred in favour of the transferee.
