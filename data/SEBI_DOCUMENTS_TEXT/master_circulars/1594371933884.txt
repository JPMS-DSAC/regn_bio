1.3.Spot Price Polling 5 

1.3.1. 

 
The stock exchanges have been using a ‘Spot Price Polling Mechanism’ to 
arrive at the prevailing spot prices. Transparent discovery of spot prices is a 
critical factor in smooth running of futures market as the same are used as 
reference prices for settlement of contracts traded on the exchange platform. 
To arrive at the prevailing spot prices, the stock exchanges are polling the 
spot  prices  from  various  spot  price  polling  participants.  Some  stock 
exchanges  undertake 
themselves  whereas  some  have 
outsourced this work to an external agency.

2.2.2. 

2.2.3. 

The commodities which are to be recommended by SEBI for notification by

i.  Commodity Fundamentals 

 
a)  Size of the market / Volume of the market: The total supply value 
of the commodity in each year is taken as a measure of the physical 
market  size  of  that  commodity  in  that  year.  A  higher  physical 
market  size  could  create  higher  futures  trading  volume  by 
attracting more hedgers and speculators into the futures market. 

b)  Homogeneity/Standardization:  The  commodity  should  be  either 
Homogeneous or should be conducive to standardization. This is 
required so that participants  trading the commodity on  exchange 
platform should be able to unambiguously understand exactly what 
they are trading as on exchange only standardized contracts can be 
traded. 

c)  Durable / Storable: The commodity should be durable and storable 
for  better  price  discovery.  Durability  i.e.  higher  shelf  life  makes 
commodity  conducive  for  storage,  which  creates  opportunity  for 
cash  and  carry  and  hence  would  attract  arbitragers  thus  make  it 
more suitable for derivatives trading. 

 

ii.  Trade Factors 

 
a)  Global:  Global  market  in  a  commodity  could  be  a  positive 
indicator as internationally linked commodity prices are influenced 
by various global factors and thus create multiple reference points 
for price discovery which may make it conducive for derivatives 
trading. 

b)  Value chain: The term ‘’value chain’’ describes the full range of 
value  adding  activities  required  to  bring  a  product  or  service 
through the different phases of production, including procurement 
of  raw  materials  and  other  inputs”,  connected  along  a  chain  of 
producing, transforming and bringing goods and services to end-
consumers  through  a  sequenced  set  of  activities  and  a  strategic 
network among a number of business organizations”. Larger is the 
value chain larger would be the number of participants interested 
in derivatives trading of such commodity.  

c)  Geographical coverage: The commodity should ideally have a vast 
distribution across the country. The coverage can be in the form of 
production  of  commodity  or  the  distribution  of  the  commodity 
across the country. Higher coverage would attract higher number 
of participants to the derivatives.

iii.  Ease-of- doing-business 

 
a)  Price Control: Price controls are government mandated minimum 
or  maximum  prices  that  can  be  charged  for  specified  goods. 
Government sometimes implements price controls when prices on 
essential items, such as food grain or oil are rising rapidly. Such 
goods which are prone to price control may be less conducive for 
derivatives markets 

b)  Applicability  of  other  laws:  The  Food  control  Regulation  Act, 
Essential commodities Act, APMC Act etc., may have an impact 
on  the  commodities  to  be  introduced  for  derivatives  trading. 
Commodities  which  have  excessive  restrictions  may  be  less 
conducive for derivatives markets. 

 

iv.  Risk management 

 

a)  Correlation with International Market: Commodities which have a 
strong correlation with the global market have higher need for price 
risk management. Such commodities are conducive for derivatives 
trading. 

b)  Seasonality:  The  Indian  commodity  sphere  is  characterized  by 
seasonality. The prices fluctuate with the supply season and the off 
season.  The  derivatives  market  is  necessary  to  even  out  this 
fluctuation  and  facilitate  better  price  discovery.  Thus  the 
commodities with higher seasonality are conducive for derivatives 
trading. 

c)  Price Volatility: Commodities with  high volatility  of prices have 
high  need  for  hedging.  Such  commodities  are  conducive  for 
Derivatives trading. 

 

v. 

In  order  to  bring  in  uniformity  among  the  commodity  derivatives 
exchanges,  the  indicative  template  (as  enclosed  at  Annexure  on 
template on criteria for eligibility of commodity derivative products) 
shall be adopted by the exchanges. In this regard the exchanges shall 
decide upon the specific numerical weight ages as approved by their 
oversight committee for 'Product Design'. 

vi. 

 
The  exchanges  shall  also  analyze  all  the  proposed  commodities/ 
commodity  derivatives  contracts  on 
the  afore-said  parameters 
comprised in the template and submit the same to SEBI while applying

2.2.4. 

2.2.5. 

for  the  approvals  along  with  necessary  supporting  documentary 
evidence. 

Applicability of the template on the commodities presently being traded 
 
i.  As regards the commodities which are  presently being traded on the 
exchange  platforms,  the  exchanges  shall  apply  the  afore-said 
parameters comprised in the template on each of the commodities. 
The results of such exercise is to be submitted to SEBI within a period 
of 3 months. 
 

ii. 

Criteria  for  retention  and  reintroduction  of  derivative  contracts  on 
commodities 
 
i. 

For any  commodity to  continue to  be eligible for Futures trading on 
Exchange, it should have annual turnover of more than Rs.500 Crore 
across  all  stock  exchanges  in  at  least  one  of  the  last  three  financial 
years.  For  validating  this  criteria,  gestation  period  of  three  years  is 
provided for commodities from the launch date/re-launch date, as may 
be applicable. 
 

ii.  Once, a commodity becomes ineligible for derivatives trading due to 
not satisfying the retention criteria, the exchanges shall not reconsider 
such  commodity  for  re-launching  contract  for  a  minimum  period  of 
one year.  

 

iii. 

Further,  a  commodity  which  is  discontinued/suspended  by  the 
exchange  from  derivatives  trading  on  its  platform,  shall  not  be  re-
considered by the concerned exchange for re-launching of derivatives 
contract on such commodity at least for a minimum period of one year.

day’s closing price of the contract, however for the first trading day (launch 
day)  of  each  contract,  the  stock  exchange  shall  determine  base  price  as 
under: 

i.  Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the first half an hour, 

subject to minimum of ten trades

3.4.General guidelines for Position Limits31 
 

3.4.1. 

The following norms shall be applicable to the agricultural as well as non- 
agricultural commodity derivatives at commodity level: 

i.  Numerical value of overall client level open position limits shall be 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

applicable for each commodity as explained subsequently. 
The  stock  exchanges,  however,  in  their  own  judgment,  may 
prescribe  limits  lower  than  what  is  prescribed  by  SEBI  by  giving 
advance notice to the market under intimation to SEBI. 
For the purpose of position limits, norms applicable on client level 
positions  shall  also  be  applicable  to  the  proprietary  positions  of 
trading members and while calculating member’s open positions, his 
proprietary  positions  shall  be  treated  and  computed  like  a  client’s 
positions. 
For  the  purpose  of  calculating  overall  position  of  a  member,  the 
overall position of its all clients (as determined in Clause ‘i (under 
3.5.1)  or  (under  3.6.1))  shall  be  added  without  netting  off  among 
themselves  as  also  against  proprietary  positions  of  the  member. 
Thus,  all  long  clients  and  all  short  clients  shall  be  added  up 
separately and higher of the two shall be reckoned as Member’s open 
position in a commodity derivative. 

 

3.4.2. 

Clubbing of Open Positions 32 

i.  While calculating open positions for the purpose of position limits, 
Exchanges  shall  take  suitable  measures  for  clubbing  of  open 
positions  of  clients/members  who  may  be  acting  in  concert  to 
circumvent the norms of position limits. The broad guidelines on this 
are provided in Annexure on Clubbing of open positions . 

ii.  All stock exchanges shall jointly formulate uniform guidelines and 

disclose the same to the market.

at commodity level: 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

For the purpose of calculating positions of a client, all long and short 
positions  of  the  client  across  all  contracts  shall  be  added  up 
separately and higher of the two shall be considered as his overall 
open position. 
For  determination  of  numerical  value  of  overall  client  level  open 
position  limits,  framework  is  prescribed  below  for  agricultural 
commodities (3.5.2).35 
The overall member level position limits across all contracts shall be 
10 times the numerical value of client level position limit or 15% of 
the market-wide open interest, whichever is higher. 
 

iv.  Near Month Position Limits: In case of near month contracts: 

a.  Client level position limits shall be equivalent to the one fourth

c.  For calculating near month open position of a client, higher of 
long and short positions of the client in near month contracts to 
be considered. Thus, netting out  near month contract  with  off-
setting positions in far months contracts shall not be permitted 
for  the  purpose  of  computation  of  near  month  position  of  any 
client.36  

d.  For  calculating  near  month  open  position  of  a  member,  the 
position of the clients as determined in iv (c) above will be added 
without netting off among themselves as also against proprietary 
position of the member (which will also be treated like a client 
position). All longs and shorts will be added up separately and 
higher of the two will be reckoned.37 

 

v.  Exchange-wide  Position  Limit  for  Agricultural  Commodities:

average of production data and import data of past five years on a 
rolling basis and keeping in  view various extraneous factors that 
affect the trading in derivatives, the agricultural commodities shall 
be classified into three categories viz., sensitive, broad and narrow 
as below:-

a.  Sensitive  commodity:  An  agricultural  commodity  shall  be 

classified as a sensitive commodity if it: 
 

is prone to frequent Government / External interventions. 
These  interventions  may  be  in  the  nature  of  stock  limits, 
import/export  restrictions  or  any  other  trade  related 
barriers; or 

  has  observed  frequent  instances  of  price  manipulation  in 

past five years of derivatives trading 

 

b.  Broad  Commodity:  An  agricultural  commodity  shall  be 
classified  as  ‘Broad  Commodity’  if  it  is  not  ‘Sensitive 
Commodity’ and satisfies following criteria; 

  Average deliverable supply for past five year is at least 10 
lakh Metric Ton (MT) in  quantitative term  and is at  least 
INR 5,000 Crore in monetary term. 

 

c.  Narrow Commodity: An agricultural commodity which is not 
falling in either of the above two categories, viz ‘Sensitive’ or 
‘Broad’  commodity, 
‘Narrow 
Commodity’ 

shall  be  classified  as 

 

 

 

ii.  Deliverable  Supply:  The  deliverable  supply  for  an  agricultural 

commodity would be “Production + Imports” 

iii.  Client  Level  Numeric  Position  Limits:  Numerical  Value  of 
overall client level open position limits for each commodity shall 
be  calculated  from  'deliverable  supply'  available  in  a  particular 
year, as per its category as given below: 

Category of Commodity 

Position limits  

Broad  

Narrow  

Sensitive  

1% of the deliverable supply  

0.5% of the deliverable supply  

0.25% of the deliverable supply  

The numbers arrived based upon above formula should be rounded off 
downward to appropriate number of zeroes. 

 

iv.  Yearly  Categorization  of  commodities  and  computation  of 
position  limits:  All  exchanges  shall  jointly  classify  agricultural 

 

 Page 47 of 310 

 
 

 
 
 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और तितिमय बोर्ड 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 

 

commodities into the afore-stated three categories on annual basis 
as per the principles indicated above. 

a.  Whenever  an  agricultural  commodity  of  'narrow'  category  is 
required to be re-categorized to 'broad' in subsequent years, such 
re-categorization  may  be  possible  only  if  both,  average 
deliverable supply of such commodity for the past five years and 
monetary  value  thereof  as  mentioned  above  for  ‘broad 
commodity’ exceeds by more than 5%. 

b.  For determination of 'deliverable supply' of various agricultural 
commodities for each year, the national commodity derivatives 
exchanges shall take into account the latest production figures of 
such commodities as annually declared by relevant government 
sources  or  from  the  latest  ‘third  advance  estimates’  of 
agricultural  commodities  published  by 
the  Ministry  of 
agriculture  or  any  other  yearly  estimates/assessments  of 
production  and  imports  made  by  any  governmental  agencies 
such as Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Textiles, Ministry 
of  Commerce,  different  statutory  boards/associations  etc., 
concerned with different agricultural commodities. The national 
commodity  derivatives  exchanges  shall  indicate  the  sources 
from which the production and import / export data have been 
obtained for the purpose of determination of 'deliverable supply’ 
of different agricultural commodities. 

c.  Every year, for each agricultural commodity that is being traded 
in  the  derivatives  market,  all  national  commodity  derivatives 
exchanges shall jointly  complete the  exercise of  determination 
of  ‘deliverable  supply,  categorization/re-categorization  of 
commodities  and  computation  of  numerical  value  of  position 
limits.  Numerical  values  of  position  limits  for  any  agricultural 
commodity shall be revised only if the computation results in a 
revision in the value by at least 5% compared to previous year's 
limits.  Exchanges  shall,  after  prior  intimation  to  SEBI,  notify 
such  details  to  the  market  through  their  respective  websites 
sufficiently  in  advance  and  latest  by  31st  of  July  (unless 
extended  by  SEBI  under  exceptional  circumstances)  of  every 
year and revised limits shall become applicable for all running 
contracts with effect from 1st of September of every year

v. 

 

vi.  An EFE shall  apply  for  the hedge limits  corresponding to its own 
physical  exposure to the commodity and cannot apply for a hedge 
limit  in  respect  of  any  stock  it  holds  on  behalf  of  another  entity

anyone else including any subsidiary/associate company.

The  margins  for  any  commodity  prescribed  by  the  Exchanges/CC 
for the other market participants shall also be applicable to EFE. As 
the hedge positions are expected to be larger than the normal client 
level limits, the Exchanges/CC shall, based on their assessment of 
the  risks,  levy  additional  margins  including  concentration  margin 
wherever  necessary,  as  may  be  prudent.  Accordingly  the  ASB 
concerned  shall  ensure  that  appropriate  margins  are  collected 
upfront from the EFE as risk mitigation. 

iii.  Where,  in  the  assessment  of  the  ASB,  the  risk  profile  of  EFE 
warrants  margins  in  addition  to  the  margin  stipulated  by  the 
Exchanges/CC, the ASB shall collect such additional margins. The 
margins  collected  by  the  ASB  at  no  time  shall  be  less  than  those 
stipulated by the Exchanges/CC. 

4.2.9.  Monitoring of limits and physical exposure

auditor.

5.2.2.  Margining model and quantum of initial margins: CC shall adopt initial 
margin  models  and  parameters  that  are  risk-based  and  generate  margin 
requirements 
to 
participants/clients in the interval between the last margin collection and the

should  

to  cover  potential 

sufficient 

future  exposure 

 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

use a conservative estimate of the time horizons for close out of 
the positions (including in stressed market conditions), 
have  an  appropriate  method  for  measuring  credit  exposure  that 
accounts for relevant risk factors and portfolio effects, and 
to  the  extent  practicable  and  prudent,  limit  the  need  for 
destabilizing, pro-cyclical changes. 
 

Initial margin  requirement  shall be adequate to  cover at  least  99% VaR 
(Value at Risk). Margin Period of Risk (MPOR) shall be at least equal to 
three  days  or  MPOR  of  corresponding  futures  contracts,  whichever  is 
higher. In case of portfolio based margining, this requirement applies to 
each  portfolio’s  distribution  of  future  exposure. Accordingly,  CCs  shall 
fix prudent price scan range, volatility scan range and/or plausible changes 
in any other parameters impacting options price.  

 
CCs  shall  impose  appropriate  short  option  minimum  margin,  calendar 
spread  charge,  extreme  loss  margin,  concentration  margins,  additional 
margins,  pre-expiry  margin,  delivery  period  margin  etc.  for  option

5.2.3.  Margining at client level: CCs shall impose initial margins at the level of 
portfolio  of  individual  client  comprising  of  his  positions  in  futures  and 
options contracts on each commodity. 

 

5.2.4. 

Real time computation: Though the margining models may update various 
scenarios of parameter changes (underlying price, volatility etc.) at discrete 
time points each day (at least every two hours), the latest available scenarios 
shall be applied to client portfolios on a real time basis.

5.2.5.  Mark to market: CCs shall mark to market the options positions by adding 
the current market value of options (positive for long options and negative 
for short options) to  the  margin requirement. Thus, mark to market  gains 
and losses would not be settled in cash for options positions.

i. 

ii. 

For  handling  increase  in  margins  on  expiry  when  options  devolve 
into futures position, specifically for long option positions which are 
probable to be exercised, exchanges shall start sensitizing the option 
holders  of  the  impending  increase  in  margins  (along  with  the 
estimated increase)  at least few days in advance,  and/or, based on 
their  risk  perception,  may  also  consider  gradually  collecting 
increased margins during the last few days so as to have adequate 
margins to cover the risk of futures position that will be created on 
devolvement of options into futures. 
 
Penalty is levied on members for short-collection/non-collection of 
the initial margins. Penalty for such short-collection/non-collection 
due  to  increase  in  initial  margins  resulting  from  devolvement  of 
options into futures may not be levied by Exchanges for the first day.

However, the above turnover requirements shall not be applicable for 
sectoral indices subject to exchanges ensuring that constituent futures 
have adequate liquidity. 
 
 
 
 

7.1.4. 

Re-balancing  

i. 

The  index  constituents  and  their  weightages  shall  be  at  least 
annually  selected  and  rebalanced.  Exchanges  shall  decide  and 
announce/disclose the constituents and weightages of the index at 
least  three  months  before  the  actual  re-balancing  of  the  index. 
Exchanges  shall  ensure  that  constituents  meet  the  eligibility 
criteria  as  mentioned  above  while  deciding  the  constituents  and 
weightages for rebalancing. 

 
ii.  However,  in  case  of  an  extraordinary  event  such  as  ban  / 
suspension  of  trading  of  an  index  constituent,  following  action 
shall be taken by exchange- 
a)  Reselection  of  commodities  (excluding  banned  /  suspended 

commodities) 

b)  Recalculation of weightage  

 

iii. 
 

Exchanges  shall  ensure  that  constituents  meet  the  eligibility 
criteria as mentioned above. 
The index changes shall be implemented only after market hours. 

7.1.5.  Weights of constituents 

 

i. 

 

Index  constituents  will  be  assigned  weightages  based  on  their 
production value and liquidity value with appropriate weightages 
pre-decided by exchange for production value and liquidity value 
(provided that weightage of either shall not be less than 25%). The 
liquidity value will be total traded value of the index constituent 
on the exchange platform in the preceding twelve months prior to 
the construction / announcement of re-balancing of the index. The 
production value will be average of the value of deliverable supply 
of underlying commodity for past five financial years prior to the 
construction / announcement of re-balancing of the index.

In order to ensure that no single commodity dominates a composite 
index,  maximum  weightage  for  any  index  constituent  in  a 
composite index shall be capped at 30% and minimum weightage 
shall be at least 1%. However, these weightage caps shall not be 
applicable for sectoral indices subject to exchanges ensuring that 
any single constituent does not get heavily weighted in an index. 

 

 

iii. 

In case of an index having multiple commodity groups, exchanges 
may  put  in  place  maximum  and  minimum  weightages  for  a 
commodity group. 

7.1.6. 

Computation and roll over 

The  index  value  shall  ordinarily  be  computed  using  the  nearest 
expiry  futures  prices  of  the  index  constituents  so  that  prices  of 
liquid contracts are used for index construction.  

Exchange shall put in place a transparent methodology (including 
the dates of roll over, the various constituents which will be rolled 
over  from  nearest  to  next  expiry,  weights  of  nearest  and  next 
expiry  contracts  during  each  of  the  roll  over  day  for  such 
constituents etc.) for gradual roll over of the index constituents to 
next  expiry  taking  into  account  the  liquidity  in  the  underlying 
nearest /next expiry contracts.

ii. 

 

7.1.7. 

7.1.8. 

Real  time  dissemination:  The  index  value  shall  be  updated  on  real  time 
continuous basis and shall be displayed on the Exchange website. 

 

Dissemination  of  methodology:  Exchange  shall  ensure  a  transparent 
methodology  of  index  construction,  calculation,  dates  and  details  of  roll 
over, dates and other details of periodic rebalancing, report on compliance 
with IOSCO principles etc., and disseminate the same on its website. 

 

7.2.Product Design for Futures on Commodity Indices 
 

7.2.1. 

Trading Hours: The trading hours will be in line with the trading hours for 
constituent  futures  of  underlying  index.  In  case  trading  hours  vary  for 
constituents, trading hours for index derivatives shall be kept such that it is 
available  for  trading  whenever  any  of  the  constituent  futures  contract  is 
available  for  trading.  However,  on  the  day  of  its  expiry,  Index  futures 
contract shall expire at 5:00 pm.

7.2.10.  Application:  Before  launching  any  futures  contract  on  an  index,  a 
Recognised  Stock  Exchange  with  commodity  derivative  segment  shall 
submit  its  proposal  with  contract  specifications  and  risk  management 
framework to SEBI, for approval. 

 

7.3.Risk Management  
 

7.3.1. 

Exchanges  shall  adopt  risk  management  framework  compliant  with  the 
CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, including the 
following. 

 

 

7.3.2.  Margining model and quantum of initial margins: Exchanges shall adopt 
initial  margin  models  and  parameters  that  are  risk-based  and  generate 
margin  requirements  sufficient  to  cover  potential  future  exposure  to 
participants/clients in the interval between the last margin collection and the 
close  out  of  positions  following  a  participant/client  default.  The  model 
should:  
i. 

use a conservative estimate of the time horizons for close out  of the 
positions (including in stressed market conditions), 
have  an  appropriate  method  for  measuring  credit  exposure  that 
accounts for relevant risk factors and portfolio effects, and 
to the extent practicable and prudent, limit the need for destabilising, 
pro-cyclical changes.  

ii. 

iii. 

 

 

Initial  margin  requirement  shall  be  adequate  to  cover  at  least  99%  VaR 
(Value  at  Risk) and Margin  Period  of Risk  (MPOR) shall be  at  least  two 
days. In case of portfolio-based margining, this requirement applies to each 
portfolio’s distribution of future exposure.  
 
Accordingly, exchanges shall fix prudent price scan range, and/or plausible 
changes in any other parameters impacting futures price. 
  

7.3.3.  Margining  at  client  level:  Exchanges  shall  impose  initial  margins  at  the 

7.3.4. 

level of portfolio of individual client. 
 
Real time computation: Though the margining models may update various 
scenarios of parameter changes (underlying price, volatility etc.) at discrete 
time points each day (at least every two hours), the latest available scenarios 
shall be applied to client portfolios on a real time basis.

The  recognised  stock  exchanges  with  commodity  derivative  segment 
willing  to  start  trading  in  futures  on  commodity  indices  shall  take  prior 
approval  of  SEBI  for  launching  such  contracts.  Exchanges  will  have  to 
submit at-least past 3 years data of the index constructed along with data on 
monthly volatility, roll over yield for the month and monthly return while 
seeking approval from SEBI. On approval, exchanges shall also publish the 
above data on their website before launch of the products. 

 

Exchanges shall make necessary disclosures such as open interest of top 10 
largest  participants/group  of  participants  in  index  futures  (both  long  and 
short)  and  the  details  of  their  combined  open  interest  in  underlying 
constituents etc., as per section 1.15. 
 
The Exchanges shall augment their monitoring and surveillance capacity.

a.  Minimum value for Initial Margin and minimum MPOR60:  
 
CPSS-IOSCO  Principles  for  Financial  Market  Infrastructure  (PFMI) 
inter  alia  prescribes  under  Key  Considerations  for  Principle  6  on 
margin  that  margining  model  should  to  the  extent  practicable  and 
prudent, limit the need for destabilising, pro-cyclical changes. In light 
of  the  above  and  given  the  wide  variation  of  liquidity  and  volatility 
among different commodity derivatives, accordingly, norms regarding 
Minimum  IM  and  minimum  MPOR  for  commodity  derivatives 
segment stands are as per the framework mentioned below: - 

  Clearing  Corporations  (CCs)  shall  categorise  their  commodities 
into three categories of volatility based upon the realized volatility 
for last three years as given below: -

  Realized volatility shall be calculated from series of daily log 
normal  return  of  main  near  month  future  contracts  of  the 
respective  commodity.  The  series  of  daily  log  normal  return 
shall be rolled over to next month contract on start of staggered 
delivery period if it is applicable.  If staggered delivery is not 
applicable,  then  rollover  shall  be  done  on  the  day  after  the 
expiry of near month contract.

of volatility for two consecutive reviews. However, movement 
from a lower to higher volatility category shall be done based 
upon a single review.  

  The  categorization  shall  be  done  on  1st  March  and  1st 
September of each year on rolling basis and changes if any shall 
be made applicable from 1st April and 1st October respectively 
of each year. 
 

 

In  case  derivatives  are  launched  on  any  new  underlying 
commodity  for  the  first  time  for  which  no  reference  futures 
prices are available, it shall be initially categorized based upon 
prices available in  the spot  markets  subject to  a  minimum  of 
Medium  Category  of  volatility.  Re-categorization  of  such 
commodity from higher to lower category of volatility can only 
be done after two consecutive reviews.

i. 

ii. 

 

In case of Agri commodities, it has been observed that during 
lean period (i.e. the period before the arrival of new crop) there 
is often uncertainty about the arrivals of new crop. This may 
lead  to  higher  volatility  in  prices  of  commodities  during  this 
period. Therefore, CCs shall levy additional lean period margin 
of 2% on contracts expiring during lean period.  
 
Lead exchanges shall determine the lean period in consultation 
with their relevant Product Advisory Committee and disclose 
the same on their websites. 

c.  Margin Computation at client portfolio level: Margins shall be 
computed  at  the  level  of  portfolio  of  each  individual  client 
comprising  his  positions  in  futures  contracts  across  different 
maturities.  For  Trading/Clearing  Member 
level  margins 
computation, margins would be grossed across various clients. The 
proprietary positions of the Trading Member would also be treated 
as that of a client for margin computation.  

 
d.  Spread margin benefit: – 

i. 

Spread  benefit  in  initial  margin  shall  be  permitted  in  the 
following cases:  

 

a)  Different expiry date contracts of the same underlying  
b)  Two  contracts  variants  having  the  same  underlying 

commodity 

c)  Futures  contracts  in  a  commodity  complex  provided  the 

conditions in para ii below are met61. 

ii. 

Exchanges may provide spread benefit in initial margin across 
futures  contracts  in  a  commodity  complex  provided  the 
following conditions are met: 

 
a)  Minimum  coefficient  of  correlation  (r)  between  futures 

prices of the two commodities is 0.90. 

b)  Back  testing  for  adequacy  of  spread  margin  to  cover 
MTM has been carried out for a minimum period of one 
year  (back  testing  for  at  least  250  days  wherein  daily

settlement  price  of  futures  used  for  back  testing  have 
been determined from traded futures prices). 

c)  Initial margin after spread benefit has been able to cover 

MTM on at least 99% of the days as per back testing. 
 

iv. 

iii.  Maximum  benefit  in  initial  margin  on  spread  positions 
indicated in para [i – (a) and (b)] is restricted to 75%. Maximum 
benefit in initial margin on spread positions indicated in para [i 
– (c)] is restricted to 50%. 
 
In  case  of  spread  positions,  additional  margins  and  special 
margins  62  shall  not  be  levied.  No  benefit  in  ELM  would  be 
provided for spread positions i.e. ELM shall be charged on both 
individual  legs.  Exchanges  are  free  to  charge  margins  higher 
than  the  minimum  specified  depending  upon  their  risk 
perception. 
 

v.  Margin benefit on spread positions shall be entirely withdrawn 
latest  by  the  start  of  tender  period  or  start  of  expiry  day, 
whichever is earlier. 63 
 
To  be  eligible  for  initial  margin  benefit,  each  individual 
contract  in  the  spread  shall  be  from  amongst  the  first  three 
expiring contracts. 
 

vi.  While  providing  spread  benefit  across  futures  contracts  in  a 
commodity  complex,  exchanges  shall  continuously  monitor 
dynamics of the commodities and their correlation and if there 
are  changes  such  that  spread  margin  benefit  is  no  longer 
appropriate to be given, shall take appropriate further course of 
action.64

e.  Real  Time  Computation:  The  margins  should  be  computed  on 
real time basis. The computation of portfolio initial margin would 
have two components. The first is the computation of initial margin 
for  each  individual  contract.  At  the  second  stage,  these  contract 
initial margins would be applied to the actual portfolio positions to 
compute the portfolio initial margin. The exchanges are permitted 
to update EWMA volatility estimates for contracts at discrete time 
points each day (with a gap of not more than 2 hours between any 
two consecutive updates and at the end of the trading session) and 
the latest available scaled up WMA volatility estimates would be 
applied to member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 

II.  Extreme Loss Margin (ELM): ELM of 1% on gross open positions 
shall  be  levied  and  shall  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  assets  of  the 
clearing member on an online, real time basis.  

III.  Additional Margins: Exchanges may levy Additional Margins based 

on their evaluation in specific situations as may be necessary. 

Pre-expiry  Margin:  Exchanges  shall  levy  pre-expiry  margin  which 
shall  be  increased  gradually  every  day  beginning  from  the  pre-
determined number of days before the expiry of the contract and latest 
by the start of the staggered delivery period. Exchanges shall determine 
the  quantum  of  pre-expiry  margin  as  appropriate  based  on  the  risk 
characteristics of the particular commodity. 

IV. 

 

V.  Delivery Period Margin65: Appropriate delivery period margin shall 
be  levied  by  Exchanges  on  the  long  and  short  positions  marked  for 
delivery  till  the  pay-in  is  completed  by  the  member.  Once  delivery 
period margin is levied, all other applicable margins may be released.  

 

 

 

However, delivery period margins shall be higher of: 

 

A.  3% + 5 day 99% VaR of spot price volatility  

Or  

B.  20%

Or 

C.  Applicable delivery period margins as on September 01, 2016 

Exchanges may impose higher margins if deemed fit. 

VI.  Mark to Market (MTM) Settlement: All open positions of a futures 
contract  would  be  settled  daily,  only  in  cash,  based  on  the  Daily 
Settlement Price (DSP). DSP shall be reckoned and disseminated by 
the Exchange at the end of every trading day. The mark to market gains 
and losses shall be settled in cash before the start  of trading on T+1 
day. If mark to market obligations are not collected before start of the 
next day’s trading, the exchange shall collect correspondingly higher 
initial margin (scaling up by a factor of square root of two) to cover 
the potential losses over the time elapsed in the collection of margins. 

 
VII. 

 

It  is  reiterated  that  risk  management  is  primarily  a  responsibility  of 
CCs and the framework prescribed by SEBI is minimum framework. 
CCs are allowed to be more conservative as per their own perception 
of risk.66 

VIII.  CCs shall also disclose detailed break up of various applicable margins 

on contracts cleared by them along with volatility on their websites. 

 

8.1.4. 

Options on commodity futures67 : Exchanges shall adopt risk management 
framework  compliant  with  the  CPMI-IOSCO  Principles  for  Financial 
Market Infrastructures, including the following: 

I.  Margining  model  and  quantum  of  initial  margins:  Exchanges  shall 
adopt initial margin models and parameters that are risk-based and generate 
margin  requirements  sufficient  to  cover  potential  future  exposure  to 
participants/clients in the interval between the last margin  collection and 
the close out of positions following a participant/client default. The model 
should: 

 

A.  use a conservative estimate of the time horizons for close  out  of the 

positions (including in stressed market conditions),

B.  have  an  appropriate  method  for  measuring  credit  exposure  that 

accounts for relevant risk factors and portfolio effects, and 

C.  to the extent practicable and prudent, limit the need for destabilizing, 

pro-cyclical changes. 

Initial margin requirement shall be adequate to cover 99% VaR (Value 
at Risk) and Margin Period of Risk (MPOR) shall be at least two days. 
In  case of  portfolio-based margining, this requirement applies to  each 
portfolio’s distribution of future exposure. 
  
Accordingly,  exchanges  shall  fix  prudent  price  scan  range,  volatility 
scan range and/or plausible changes in any other parameters impacting 
options price. Exchange shall impose appropriate short option minimum 
margin,  calendar  spread  charge  and  extreme  loss  margin  for  option 
contracts. 
 

II.  Margining at client level: Exchanges shall impose initial margins at the 
level of portfolio of individual client comprising of his positions in futures 
and options contracts on each commodity. 

III.  Real  time  computation:  Though  the  margining  models  may  update 
various scenarios of parameter changes (underlying price, volatility etc.) at 
discrete time points each day (at least every two hours), the latest available 
scenarios shall be applied to client portfolios on a real time basis. 

IV.  Mark to market: Exchanges shall mark to market the options positions by 
deducting/adding  the  current  market  value  of  options  (positive  for  long 
options  and  negative  for  short  options)  times  the  number  of  long/short 
options  in  the  portfolio  from/to  the  margin  requirement.  Thus,  mark  to 
market gains and losses would not be settled in cash for options positions. 

V.  Risks pertaining to options that devolve into futures on expiry: 

 

A.  For handling increase in margins on expiry when options devolve into 
futures  position,  specifically  for  long  option  positions  which  are 
probable to be exercised, exchanges shall start sensitizing the option 
holders of the impending increase in margins (along with the estimated 
increase)  at  least  few  days  in  advance,  and/or,  based  on  their  risk 
perception, may also consider gradually collecting increased margins 
during the last few days so as to have adequate margins to cover the

risk of futures position that will be created on devolvement of options 
into futures. 

 

 

 
 

 

B.  As per the provisions given in section 8.3 below, penalty is levied on 
members  for  short-collection/non-collection  of  the  initial  margins. 
Penalty  for  such  short-collection/non-collection  due  to  increase  in 
initial margins resulting from devolvement of options into futures may 
not be levied by Exchanges for the first day.

Concentration  Margins68 
impose  adequate 
concentration margins (only on concentrated positions) to cover the risk of 
longer  period  required  for  liquidation  of  concentrated  positions  in  any 
commodity. The threshold value for imposing concentration margin may be 
determined 
interest, 
concentration and estimated time to liquidation based on prevailing liquidity 
and  possible  reduction  in  liquidity  in  times  of  market  stress  etc.  The 
quantum of concentration margins imposed may vary based on the level of 
concentration.

8.1.6. 

Additional  Ad-hoc  Margins:  Exchanges  have  the  right  to  impose 
additional risk containment measures over and above the risk containment 
system  mandated  by  SEBI.  However,  the  Exchanges  should  keep  the 
following three factors in mind while taking such action:  

i.  Additional risk management measures (like ad-hoc margins) would 
normally be required only to deal with circumstances that cannot be 
anticipated  or  were  not  anticipated  while  designing  the  risk 
management system. If ad-hoc margins are imposed with any degree 
of regularity, exchanges should examine whether the circumstances 
that give rise to such margins can be reasonably anticipated and can 
therefore  be  incorporated  into  the  risk  management  system 
mandated  by  SEBI.  Exchanges  are  encouraged  to  analyse  these 
situations and bring the matter to the attention of SEBI for further 
action.  

ii.  Any  additional  margins  that  the  exchanges  may  impose  shall  be 
based  on  objective  criteria  and  shall  not  discriminate  between 
members on the basis of subjective criteria.

Transparency  is  an  important  regulatory  goal  and  therefore  every 
effort  must  be  made  to  make  the  risk  management  systems  fully 
transparent by disclosing their details to the public.  

 
 

 

 

iii. 

 

8.1.7.  Margin  Provisions  for  Intra-day  crystallized  losses  69  :  In  order  to 
mitigate  the  risk  arising  out  of  accumulation  of  crystallized  obligations 
incurred  on  account  of  intra-day  squaring  off  of  positions,  the  stock 
exchanges shall adopt the following: 

i. 

ii. 

The intra-day crystallized losses shall be monitored and blocked by 
Clearing Corporations from the free collateral on a real-time basis 
only for those transactions which are subject to upfront margining. 
For this purpose, crystallised losses can be offset against crystallised 
profits at a client level, if any. 
If  crystallised  losses  exceed  the  free  collateral  available  with  the 
Clearing Corporation, risk reduction mode shall be followed. 

iii.  Crystallised  losses  shall  be  calculated  based  on  weighted  average 

prices of trades executed. 

iv.  Adjustment  of  intraday  crystallised  losses  shall  not  be  done  from 

exposure free liquid networth of the clearing member. 

 

8.1.8.  Margin  Collection  and  Enforcement:  All  applicable  margins  shall  be 
deducted by Exchanges from the Liquid Assets of the clearing members on 
an online, real time basis. Margins applicable on client positions have to be 
compulsorily collected from the clients and reported to the Exchange by the 
members. 

 

8.1.9.  Minimum  Liquid  net-worth70  :  Members  of  Clearing  Corporations  in 
commodity  derivatives  segment  shall  maintain  a  minimum  Liquid  Net-
worth of at least INR 50 Lakhs at all points of time.  

 
 

8.1.10.  Base Minimum Capital (BMC)71 

i. 

Exchanges  shall  have  BMC  requirements  for  their  members 
(Trading members) as given below:  
a.  Members without Algo trading – INR 10 Lacs  
b.  Members doing Algo trading – INR 50 Lacs

25% of the above deposit shall be in the form of cash and balance 
75% can be in the form of Fixed Deposit/Bank Guarantee.  

These funds would be kept in a separate account by the Exchange 
and  would  be  used  only  towards  the  settlement  of  claims  of  the 
client, payment of arbitration fee by the member if any, and dues 
payable  by  the  member  on  account  of  pending  arbitration 
cases/arbitration awards and would not be used by the exchange for 
meeting any of its other dues.  
 

vi.  BMC would be refunded to the members at the time of surrender of 
membership  provided  that  there  is  no  unsettled  claim  against 
member and no arbitration cases are pending against the member.  

 
 

 

8.1.11.  Risk  Reduction  Mode:  Exchanges  shall  ensure 

the 

trading 
members/clearing  members  are  mandatorily  put  in  risk-reduction  mode 
when 90% of the member’s Liquid Assets available for adjustment against 
margins/deposits  gets  utilized  for  margins/deposits.  Such  risk  reduction 
mode shall include the following:  

that 

i.  All  unexecuted  orders  shall  be  cancelled  once  trading  member

level.  

ii.  Only orders with Immediate or Cancel attribute shall be permitted in 

this mode.  

iii.  All new orders shall be checked for sufficiency of margins and such 
potential margins shall be blocked while accepting the orders in the 
system. 
The  trading  member  shall  be  moved  back  to  the  normal  risk 
management mode as and when the collateral utilization level of the 
trading member as well as his clearing member is lower than 90%.

8.2.Regaining matched book 
 

8.2.1. 

In the event of a member/client failing to honor pay-in/margin obligations, 
exchanges  may  employ  the  below  given  alternative  tools  to  liquidate  the 
positions  and  regain  a  matched  book  based  on  the  conditions  of  market 
liquidity, volatility, size of position to be liquidated etc. Any tool lower in 
the  list  prescribed  hereunder  may  be  resorted  to  only  in  extremely  rare 
occasions when the exchange reasonably expects that it may not be able to 
restore  a  matched  book  by  choosing  the  alternatives  above  it  and  also 
records the reasons for the same in writing:  

 

i.  Alternative  1:  Liquidation  in  normal  market  in  orderly  manner 

(with relaxed price limits, if required);  

ii.  Alternative 2: Auction of the positions within a specified price band 
iii.  Alternative 3: Voluntary tear-up at last mark-to-market price along 
with  compensation equal to  10% of last mark-to-market  price and 
penalty equal to 1% of last mark-to-market price (to be credited to 
SGF);  

iv.  Alternative  4:  Partial  tear-up  (pro-rata  against  members/clients 
having opposite positions) at  last mark-to-market  price along with

compensation equal to 8% of last mark-to-market price and penalty 
equal to 1% of last mark-to-market price (to be credited to SGF).74  

 

 

 
 

 

8.2.2. 

To  enable  timely  and  error  free  execution,  CCs  shall  have  an  automated 
system to implement all such tools. CCs shall put in place such system, and 
also conduct testing of the same. 
 

8.3.Mechanism  for  regular  monitoring  of  and  penalty  for  short-  collection/  non-

collection of margins from clients75 

 

8.3.1. 

The penalty structure and framework for short-collection/non-collection of 
margins by members from their clients shall be as under:  
 

i. 

ii. 

  

The  ‘margins’  for  this  purpose  shall  mean  initial  margin,  extreme 
loss  margin  (ELM),  mark  to  market  margin,  special  /  additional 
margin,  delivery  margin  or  any  other  margin  as  prescribed  by  the 
Exchange to be collected by member from their clients.  

The  members  are  required  to  collect  upfront  initial  margins  and 
extreme loss margins  76 from their clients. The members will have 
time  till  ‘T+2’  working  days  to  collect  margins  (except  initial 
margins  and extreme loss margins) from their clients. (The clients 
must  ensure  that  the  initial  margins  and  extreme  loss  margins  are 
paid in advance of trade and other margins are paid as soon as margin 
calls are made by Exchanges/Members. The period of T+2 days has 
been allowed to members to collect margin from clients taking into 
account  the  practical  difficulties  often  faced  by  them  only  for  the 
purpose of levy of penalty and it should not be construed that clients 
have been allowed 2 days to pay margin due from them.)

applicable from T day.  

The Exchanges should put in place a suitable mechanism to enable 
the members to report the collection of all margins from their clients 
at  the  end  of  each  trading  day  and  to  report  short  collection/non-
collection of all margins on the T+5 day.  

The  Stock  Exchanges  and  Clearing  Corporations,  in  consultation 
with one another, shall devise a standard framework for imposition 
of fine on the Trading Member/ Clearing Member for incorrect/false 
reporting and non-reporting of margin collected from the client.77 
 
The penalty shall be collected by the Exchanges not later than five 
days of the last working day of the trading month.

ix.  With  respect  to  repeated  defaulters,  who  default  3  times  or  more 
during  a  month,  the  penalty  would  be  5%  of  the  shortfall  in  such 
instances. (Every short/non-collection of margin is to be considered 
as one instance of default. In case margin shortage is reported for a 
client  3  times  or  more  during  a  month,  i.e.,  either  in  consecutive 
instances or in 3 different instances, the penalty would be 5% of the 
shortfall from 4th instance of shortfall. E.g. shortage is reported for 
a client on 1st and 2nd day of month consecutively; thereafter again 
on 10th day shortage is reported. So the number of instances are 3 
and in case shortage is reported on any day later in the month, the 
penalty  shall  be  5%  of  the  shortfall  amount  for  all  such  instances 
beyond 3rd instance.)

10.1.  Staggered Delivery 86  
 

10.1.1.  Staggered delivery period is the period, beginning few working days prior 
to  expiry  of  any  contract  and  ending  with  expiry,  during  which 
sellers/buyers  having  open  position  may  submit  an  intention  to  give/take 
delivery. 
 

 

10.1.2.  All  compulsory  delivery  commodity  futures  contracts  (agriculture 
commodities as well as non-agriculture commodities) shall have a staggered

working days. 
 

10.1.4.  Exchanges  shall  have  the  flexibility  to  set  higher  duration  of  staggered 
delivery period for any commodity futures contract, as deemed  fit, taking 
into  account  various  factors  such  as  historical  open  interest,  volume  near 
expiry etc. In this regard, for the benefit of the market participants, all the 
exchanges shall jointly prepare and publish a detailed framework outlining 
various  circumstances  and  factors  which  would  generally  require  longer 
duration of staggered delivery period in any commodity.

from the next working day.  

ii.  Seller/buyer shall have an option of marking an intention of giving/taking delivery on any day 

from start of the tender period up to expiry of the contract.  

iii.  Exchange shall allocate delivery to buyers having open long position as per random

to receive delivery irrespective of the size or value of the position. However, preference may 
be given to buyers who have marked an intention of taking delivery.  

iv.  If the tender date is T, then pay-in and pay-out shall happen latest by T+2th working day.  
v.  Open position on expiry of the contract would result in compulsory delivery and would be 
settled at Final Settlement Price (FSP) of the respective contracts and pay-in and pay-out 
shall happen latest by the 2nd working day after expiry.”

a.  Seller/buyer having open position shall have an option, of submitting 
an intention of giving/taking delivery, on any day during the staggered 
delivery period.  

b.  On  each  day  (except  for  the  expiry  day),  Exchange  shall  allocate 
intentions received to give delivery during the day, to buyers having 
open  long  position  as  per  random  allocation  methodology  to  ensure 
that all buyers have an equal opportunity of being selected to receive 
delivery  irrespective  of  the  size  or  value  of  the  position.  However, 
preference may be given to buyers who have marked an intention of 
taking  delivery,  which  may  be  based  on  aspects  such  as  location, 
quality etc...  

c.  Pay-in and pay-out for the allocated deliveries shall happen within 2 

working days after allocation.  

d.  All  open  positions  after  expiry  of  the  contract  shall  result  in 
compulsory delivery and be settled at Final Settlement Price (FSP) of 
the respective contract and pay-in and pay-out shall happen latest by 
the 2nd working day after expiry. 

 
10.2.  Early Delivery System 87 
 

10.2.1. 

In  all  futures  contracts  for  which  early  delivery  system  is  mandated,  the 
framework shall be as given below:  

i.  An early delivery period may be provided during E-14 to E-1 days 
(where  E  stands  for  expiry  day)  of  the  contract  during  which 
buyers/sellers  can  give  intention  to  take/give  delivery.  If  the 
intentions of the buyers/sellers match, then the respective positions 
will be closed out by physical deliveries. The process of pay in and 
pay-out will be completed on T + 2 basis, where 'T' stands for the 
day on which matching has been done.  

 

ii. 

If  there  is  no  intention  matching  for  delivery  between  sellers  and 
buyers,  then  such  delivery  intention  will  get  automatically 
extinguished  at  the  close  of  E-1  day.  The  intentions  can  be

unmatched. 

In  respect  of  delivery  defaults  after  the  matching  of  delivery 
intentions, penalty provisions as applicable in  the case of delivery 
defaults in compulsory delivery contracts will be applied.  

 
iv.  On  the  expiry  of  the  contract,  all  outstanding  positions  would  be 
settled by delivery and all the penalty provisions for delivery default 
applicable in the compulsory delivery contracts shall apply. 

 

10.3.  Early Pay-in Facility 88 

 

10.3.1.  Exchanges  shall  provide  early  pay-in  facility  to  market  participants 
permitting  market  participants  to  deposit  certified  goods  to  the  Exchange 
accredited warehouse against relevant futures contracts sold. For such short 
positions  against  which  early  pay-in  has  been  made,  based  on  risk 
perception,  exchanges  may  exempt  imposition  of  all  types  of  margins. 
However, Exchanges shall continue to collect mark to market margins from 
such market participants against such positions.  
 
In case of compulsory delivery and seller’s option contracts, delivery to the 
extent of open position at the expiry of the contract shall be mandatory after 
claiming early pay-in facility on the position. The exchanges should provide 
for  extremely  strict  penalties  including  disciplinary  actions  against  such 
members who fail to do so. 

10.3.2. 

 

10.4.  Penalty on Delivery Default 89

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

If the client and member (broker, trading member or clearing member) 
fail to choose the Arbitrator(s) from the Common Pool, the Arbitrator(s) 
will be chosen by an 'Automatic Process' wherein neither the parties to 
arbitration (i.e. client or member) nor the concerned Exchanges will be 
directly involved.  

The 'Automatic Process' will entail a randomized, computer generated 
selection of Arbitrator, from the list of Arbitrators in the 'Common Pool'. 
The selection process  shall be in  chronological  order of  the receipt of 
arbitration reference i.e. only after selecting an arbitrator for the former 
arbitration reference received, selection for the latter shall be taken up. 
 
The  'Automatic  Process'  will  send  a  system  generated,  real  time  alert 
(sms, email etc.) to all entities involved in the particular case. Further, 
the  communication  for  the  appointment  of  the  Arbitrator  will  be  sent 
immediately and in any case not later than the next working day from 
the day of picking of the Arbitrator. This communication will be sent by 
the  exchange  on  which  the  dispute  had  taken  place,  to  all  concerned 
entities including clients, arbitrators, members, exchanges etc. 

The  selection  of  Arbitrators  by  exchanges  as  done  currently,  shall 
henceforth  be  replaced  by  the  'Automatic  Process'.  In  case  of  any 
probable conflict of interest in an arbitration reference being assigned to 
any Arbitrator the Arbitrator will have to upfront decline the arbitration 
reference. After the said arbitrator declines, the 'automatic process' will 
pick the name of another Arbitrator. This will continue till the time there 
is no conflict of interest, by the selected arbitrator. The exchanges should 
ensure  that  the  process  of  appointment  of  arbitrator(s)  is  completed 
within 30 days. However, the timeline can be extended and exchanges 
shall put on record the reasons of such extension. 
 
In case of conflict of interest by the arbitrator, the information for the 
same  may  reach  the  exchange  on  which  the  dispute  has  taken  place 
within 15 days of receipt of communication from the SE above. The said 
information may be sent by any method which ensures proof of delivery. 

VIII. 

Fees of arbitrator shall be dealt in line with existing provisions, by the 
exchange on which the dispute had taken place.

CHAPTER 15. 

TRADING SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY 

 
 

 

15.1.  Algorithmic Trading 140 
 

15.1.1.  Any  order  that  is  generated  using  automated  execution  logic  shall  be 

known as algorithmic trading. 
 

15.1.2.  The  stock  exchanges  shall  have  arrangements,  procedures  and  system 
capability to manage the load on their systems in such a manner so as to 
achieve  consistent  response  time  to  all  members.  The  capacity  of  the 
trading system of the Exchange should be at least four times the peak order 
load  encountered  and  the  Exchange  system  should  be  upgraded  on  a 
regular basis. The exchange shall continuously study the performance of 
its  systems  and,  if  necessary,  undertake  system  upgrade,  including 
periodic upgrade of its surveillance system, in order to keep pace with the 
speed  of  trade  and  volume  of  data  that  may  arise  through  algorithmic 
trading. 
 

15.1.3.  While approving the algorithmic trading, the Exchanges shall ensure that: 

 

I. 

 
II. 

 

III. 

 

IV. 

 
V. 

 

VI. 

There  is  clear  classification  of  algorithmic  orders  in  terms  of 
CTCL terminal code/ATS User ID approved by the Exchange for 
algorithmic trading. 

The orders of clients are routed through member server only and 
client orders are not placed directly to the Exchange System. 

The  Exchanges  shall  not  approve  algorithms  that  may  not  be 
conducive to efficient price discovery or fair play. 

The Exchange shall subject the systems of the members to initial 
conformance tests and ensure that the checks mentioned in these 
guidelines are in place. 

Immediate  or  Cancel  (IOC)  orders  shall  not  be  allowed  to  be 
placed using algorithmic trading. 

The algorithms which will ‘take liquidity’ away from the market 
shall  not  be  approved.  While  approving  algorithmic  strategies,

Exchanges  shall  record  the  reason  as  to  why  such  strategy  is 
allowed  and  how  it  will  induct  more  liquidity  in  the  contract 
system. Exchanges shall also make half yearly review of effect of 
the  approved  strategies  on  liquidity  and  would  discontinue  / 
disapprove any strategy which fails to induct liquidity. 

 
 

 

 

 

15.1.4.  As mini and micro contracts are targeted towards small participants, while 
allowing algorithmic trading in mini and micro contracts Exchange should 
exercise  caution  and  permit  algorithmic  trading  only  after  taking  into 
account liquidity in the contract and ascertaining that it will not put small 
participants in disadvantage. 
 

15.1.5.  Algorithmic trading shall not be permitted from Exchange hosted CTCL 

terminals. 
 
In  order  to  ensure  orderly  trading  in  the  market  and  fair  usage  of  the 
trading  platform  by  all  the  members,  Exchanges  shall  put  in  place  the 
following  economic  disincentives  for  daily  algorithmic  order–to–trade 
ratio: 

15.1.6. 

 

Member-wise Daily Order-to-Trade Ratio  
(X) 

Charges  (Per 
order) 

Up to 50 

50 to less than 250 (on incremental basis) 

250 to less than 500 (on incremental basis) 

500 or more than 500 (on incremental basis) 

NIL

I. 

II. 

III. 

In case the ratio is 500 or more than 500 during a trading day, the 
concerned member shall not be permitted to place any order for the 
first 15 minutes on the next trading day (in the continuous trading 
session) as a cooling off action . However, the trading member shall 
be permitted to enter transaction in risk reducing mode during such 
a cooling off period. 
For  the  purpose  of  calculation  of  daily  Order-to-trade  ratio,  all 
algorithmic  orders,  i.e.  order  entry,  order  modifications  and  order 
cancellation shall be considered. 
The algorithmic orders entered and /or modified within 1 % of the 
last  traded  price  (LTP)  of  the  respective  contract  shall  not  be

have placed 10,000 orders or more in a day. 
The exchange shall put in place monitoring systems to identify and 
initiate measures to impede any possible instances of order flooding 
by algorithmic trading. 
 

15.1.7.  The exchanges shall place a limit (X) on the numbers of orders per second 
from a particular CTCL ID/ATS User-ID not  exceeding hundred orders 
per second. Compliance with the limit “X” so set by a particular CTCL 
ID/ATS User-ID shall be measured over a rolling period of five seconds 
(i.e., 5X orders for 0th–5thsecond, 5X orders for 1st-6th second, 5X orders 
for 2nd to 7th second and so on) 141. 
 
For  number  of  orders  exceeding  the  limit  (X)  set  by  the  exchange,  the 
exchange  shall  prescribe  economic  disincentives  and  shall  inform  the 
same to SEBI. 
 

15.1.8.  The  exchanges  shall  ensure  that  all  algorithmic  orders  are  necessarily 
routed  through  members  servers  located  in  India  and  through  specified 
CTCL  ID/ATS  User–ID  approved  by  exchange  for  algorithmic  trading. 
The  exchanges  shall  also  ensure  that  these  have  no  interlink  with  any 
system or ID located/ linked outside India. 
 

15.1.9.  The exchange shall have appropriate multi-layer risk control mechanism 
to  address  the  risk  emanating  from  algorithmic  orders  and  trades.  The 
minimum order –level risk controls shall include the following. 
 

I.  Market orders shall not be allowed to be placed using algorithmic 

trading, only limit orders shall be allowed.

to substitution, the norm read as under: 

“The Exchanges shall place a limit on numbers of orders per second from a particular CTCL 
ID/ATS User–ID not exceeding twenty orders per second. The limit of twenty orders per second 
from a particular CTCL ID/ATS User–ID shall be measured over a rolling period of five seconds 
(i.e. hundred orders for 0th-5th second, hundred orders for 1st–6th second, hundred orders for 2nd 
to 7th second & so on). 
For number of orders exceeding twenty per second, the Exchanges shall prescribe economic 
disincentives and inform the same to the SEBI.”

Configuration of DRS/NS with Primary Data Centre (PDC), DR drills / 
Testing, BCP DR Policy as mentioned below:  

 

I. 

The exchanges should have in place Business Continuity Plan (BCP) 
and  Disaster  Recovery  Site  (DRS)  so  as  to  maintain  data  and 
transaction integrity. 
 

II.  Apart  from  DRS,  exchanges  should  also  have  a  Near  Site  (NS)  to 

ensure zero data loss. 
 
The DRS should be set up sufficiently away, i.e. in a different seismic 
zone, from Primary Data Centre (PDC) to ensure that both DRS and 
PDC are not affected by the same disasters. 
 
The manpower deployed at DRS / NS should have similar expertise as 
available  at  PDC  in  terms  of  knowledge  /  awareness  of  various 
technological  and  procedural  systems  and  processes  relating  to  all 
operations  such  that  DRS  /  NS  can  function  at  short  notice, 
independently. 

III. 

IV. 

 

V.  Configuration of DRS / NS with PDC  

a)  Hardware, system software, application environment, network and 
security devices and associated application environments of DRS 
/  NS  and  PDC  should  have  one  to  one  correspondence  between 
them. 

b)  Exchanges  Depositories  should  have  Recovery  Time  Objective 
(RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) not more than 4 hours 
and 30 minutes, respectively.

c)  Solution  architecture  of  PDC  and  DRS  /  NS  should  ensure  high 
availability,  fault  tolerance,  no  single  point  of  failure,  zero  data 
loss, and data and transaction integrity. 

d)  Any  updates  made  at  the  PDC  should  be  reflected  at  DRS  /  NS 
immediately  (before  end  of  day)  with  head  room  flexibility 
without compromising any of the performance metrics. 

e)  Replication  architecture,  bandwidth  and  load  consideration 
between the DRS / NS and PDC should be within stipulated RTO 
and  ensure  high  availability,  right  sizing,  and  no  single  point  of 
failure. 

f)  Replication between PDC and NS should be synchronous to ensure 
zero data loss. Whereas the one between PDC and DR and between 
NS and DR may be asynchronous. 

g)  Adequate  resources  (with  appropriate  training  and  experience) 
should be available at all times to handle operations on a regular 
basis as well as during disasters. 

 

VI.  DR Drills / Testing

least 1 full trading day.  

d)  Before DR drills, the timing diagrams clearly identifying resources 

at both ends (DRS as well as PDC) should be in place. 

e)  The results and observations of these drills should be documented 
and  placed  before  the  Governing  Board  of  Stock  Exchange  / 
Depositories. Subsequently, the same along with the comments of 
the Governing Board should be forwarded to SEBI within a month 
of the DR drill. 

f)  The  system  auditor  while  covering  the  BCP  –  DR  as  a  part  of

Clubbing of Open Positions 
 
A.  Guidelines for Clubbing of Open Positions: 
 

1)  When a person is a partner in one or more partnership firms and /or is a director in 
one or more companies and/or is a manager(karta) of a Hindu Undivided Family 
(HUF), the total open position of  

a.  the person as an individual operator,  
b.  the firm or firms in which he is a partner;  
c.  the Company or companies in which he is a director; and  
d.  the HUF of which he is a manager(karta)  

taken together shall not exceed the prescribed limit. 
 

2)  Where two or more persons are partners in a partnership firm or firms and where 
two or more persons are director in a company or companies and where two or more 
persons are Kartas of HUFs, the total open position held by  

a.  all the partners of partnership firm or firms;  
b.  the concerned partnership firm or firms;  
c.  all the directors of the company or companies; 
d.  the concerned company or companies;  
e.  all the Kartas of the HUFs; and  
f. 

the concerned HUFs 

taken together shall not exceed the limit as mentioned above. 
 

3)  Where a person or persons operating as individuals and /or being partners in one or 
more  partnership  firms  and/or  being  directors  in  one  or  more  companies  and/or 
being kartas of HUFs are also trustees in one or more trusts, the total open position 
of  

a.  the person as individual operator, 
b.  the firm or firms in which they are partners; 
c.  the company or companies in which they are directors; 
d.  the HUFs in which they are Kartas; and  
e.  the trust or trusts in which they are trustees,  

 

taken together shall not exceed the limit as mentioned above. 
 
Provided  that,  if  at  any  time  more  deliveries  than  one  are  running  in  the  same 
commodity,  the  above  limit  shall  apply  to  the  combined  open  position  of  the 
member  or  the  non-member,  as  the  case  may  be,  in  all  such  deliveries  running 
concurrently.

4)  Open position of a member shall be the total of the open position acquired by him 
by trading through or with other member and by appropriating the business of his 
clients (collectively for all clients). 
 

5)  The open position of a non-member shall be the total of the open position acquired 

by him trading through or with one or more members. 

B.  Exemptions from Clubbing 

1)  In the agriculture marketing set up of the rural India, co-operative societies play a 
crucial  role.  Primary  Agriculture  Marketing  Societies  registered  under  the  state 
cooperative  Acts,  thus,  are  active  in  different  agricultural  commodities.  These 
societies are also member of Federations at the State and National level. Due to this 
Federal structure there may be some instances when these societies have common 
Directors.  Also,  the  persons  from  State  Governments/RCS  may  be  nominated  as 
Directors in these societies. In view of this, the position of different societies if they 
are members of a Federation will not be clubbed with the open interest position of 
the  Federation  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  open  interest  position  of  the 
Federal or vice versa. Similarly, if Govt/RCS nominated directors sits on the Boards 
of different societies, this will not amount to common interest for the purpose of 
clubbing of positions.  
 

2)  As a practice of good corporate governance, the companies now have independent 
directors  on  their  Board  with  no  financial  interest  in  the  company.  Similarly, 
companies also have Govt/Financial Institutions nominated Directors without any 
financial interest in the company. In such cases, when the Directors don’t have any 
financial  interest  in  the  company.  The  Commission  has  taken  a  view  that  the 
position of such companies/corporates may not be clubbed just because they have 
common directors. 

C.  The  above  stated  guidelines  are  indicative  only.  The  Exchanges  are  directed  to  take 
suitable measures for clubbing of open positions on the basis of the criteria laid down 
above and also include other criteria such as PAN, patterns such as ‘acting in concert’ 
through  common  ownership  and  control  structures  and  any  other  relevant  criteria  to 
club open positions that may be observed during the course of regular monitoring and 
surveillance that may appear to compromise market integrity.

Position Limit Violation 
 

The following penal provisions are made to discourage/ prevent open interest violations 
at Commodity level / near month contract level- 
 
1)  Monetary  penalty  on  the  concerned  member  for  violations  in  the  open  interest 
(either on own account or on account of clients) are linked to the quantum/ value of 
violation committed and to be charged from the concerned member for each such 
violation as under: 
 

a.  Where the violation is more than 2% of the prescribed limit(s) –  

Limit exceeded x Closing price x number of days such violation continued 
x 2% (0.02) or Rs. 10,000/- whichever is higher. 
 

b.  Where the violation is up to 2% of the prescribed limit(s) –  

Limit exceeded x Closing price x number of days such violation continued 
x 2% (0.02) or Rs. 10,000/- whichever is lower. 
 

c.  The member has to ensure reduction in position and to bring it within the 
prescribed limit(s) by the next trading day after the day of violation. In case 
such violation continues, the Exchange would square-off the excess position 
without any further notice to the member by putting the orders on behalf of 
the  member  in  that  client  code  and  will  not  be  responsible  for  the 
consequences of such action 

 

2)  In case, the instance at 1 (a) above is observed for more than 3 times in a  month 
across the market, the Exchange would suspend the concerned member for a period 
of one week. For instances at 1 (b) above, the Exchange may devise its norms to 
deal with habitual defaulters. 
 

3)  Further, in case repeated violations of such nature are observed by SEBI, SEBI may 

consider action against the concerned Exchange. 
 

The monetary penalty as stated above, will be credited to the Investor Protection Fund of 
the Exchange.

Liquidity Categorization and Computation of VaR 
 

(i) 

Liquidity Categorization of Securities 
 

The securities shall be classified into three groups based on their liquidity: 

Group 

Trading Frequency 
(over the previous six 
months – see Note A) 

Impact Cost (over the 
previous six months – see 
Note A 

Liquid Securities (Group I)  At least 80% of the days 

Less than or equal to 1% 

Less   Liquid  Securities 
(Group II ) 

Illiquid Securities (Group 
III) 

 
Notes: 

At least 80% of the days 

More than 1% 

Less than 80% of the days 

N/A 

A.  For securities that have been listed for less than six months, the trading frequency 
and the impact cost shall be computed using the entire trading history of the scrip. 

 

(ii) 

Computation of VaR Margin 

 
The VaR Margin is a margin intended to cover the largest loss that can be encountered on 
99% of the days (99% Value at Risk). For liquid stocks, the margin covers one-day losses 
while for illiquid stocks, it covers three-day losses so as to allow the clearing corporation 
to  liquidate the position over three days. This  leads to  a scaling factor of  square root of 
three for illiquid stocks. 
 
For liquid stocks, the VaR margins are based only on the volatility of the stock while for 
other stocks, the volatility of the market index is also used in the computation. Computation 
of the VaR margin requires the following definitions: 

  Scrip  sigma  means  the  volatility  of  the  security  computed  as  at  the  end  of  the 
previous  trading  day.  The  computation  uses  the  exponentially  weighted  moving 
average method applied to daily returns in the same manner as in the derivatives 
market. 

  Scrip VaR means the higher of 7.5% or 3.5 scrip sigmas. 
  Index sigma means the  daily volatility of the market  index (S&P CNX  Nifty or 
BSE Sensex) computed as at the end of the previous trading day. The computation 
uses the exponentially weighted moving average method applied to daily returns in 
the same manner as in the derivatives market. 

 
 
 

 

 Page 216 of 310 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और तितिमय बोर्ड 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 

 

 
 

  Index VaR means the higher of 5% or 3 index sigmas. The higher of the Sensex 

VaR or Nifty VaR would be used for this purpose. 
 

The VaR Margins are specified as follows for different groups of stocks:

Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF)  
 
Objective of Core SGF  
1)   Clearing Corporation (CC) shall have a fund called Core SGF for each segment of each 
Recognised  Stock  Exchange  (SE)  to  guarantee  the  settlement  of  trades  executed  in 
respective segment of the SE. In the event of a clearing member (member) failing to 
honour settlement commitments, the Core SGF shall be used to fulfill the obligations 
of  that  member  and  complete  the  settlement  without  affecting  the  normal  settlement 
process.  
 

Corpus of Core SGF  
2)  The corpus of the fund should be adequate to meet out all the contingencies arising on 
account of failure of any member(s). The risk or liability to the fund depends on various 
factors such as trade volume, delivery percentage, maximum settlement liability of the 
members, the history of defaults, capital adequacy of the members, the degree of safety 
measures employed by the CC/SE etc. A fixed formula, therefore, cannot be prescribed 
to estimate the risk or liability of the fund. However, in order to assess the fair quantum 
of the corpus of Core SGF, CC should consider the following factors:  

  Risk management system in force  
  Current and projected volume/turnover to be cleared and settled by the CC on 

guaranteed basis  

  Track record of defaults of members (number of defaults, amount in default)  

 
3)  However, Minimum Required Corpus of Core SGF (MRC) for each segment of each 

stock exchange shall be subject to the following:  

 

 
 
 

i) 
ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

The MRC shall be fixed for a month.  
By  15th  of  every  month,  CC  shall  review  and  determine  the  MRC  for  next 
month based on the results of daily stress tests of the preceding month. (For 
example,  by  15th  February,  CC  shall  determine  MRC  for  March  based  on 
results of various stress tests conducted in January). CC shall also review and 
determine  by  15th  of  every  month,  the  adequacy  of  contributions  made  by 
various contributors and any further contributions to the Core SGF required to 
be made by various contributors (as per clause 4) for the next month.  
For  every  day  of  the  preceding  month  (i.e.,  January  as  per  example  in  (ii) 
above), uncovered loss numbers shall be estimated by the various stress tests 
for  credit  risk  conducted  by  the  CC  for  the  segment  (as  per  clause  14)  and 
highest of such numbers shall be taken as worst case loss number for the day.  
Average of all the daily worst case loss numbers determined in (iii) above shall 
be calculated.  

 

 Page 218 of 310

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 

 

 
 

v) 

The MRC for next  month (i.e., March as per  example in  (ii) above) shall be 
higher of the average arrived in at step iv above and the segment MRC as per 
previous review (i.e., review done on 15th January for the month of February).  
vi)  Minimum threshold value of MRC for commodity derivatives segment of any 

stock exchange shall be INR 10 Crores. 
 
 

Contribution to Core SGF  
4)  At  any  point  of  time,  the  contributions  of  various  contributors  to  Core  SGF  of  any 

segment shall be as follows:  

a)  Clearing  Corporation  contribution:  CC  contribution  to  Core  SGF  shall  be  at 
least 50% of the MRC. CC shall make this contribution from its own funds. 
CC contribution to core SGFs shall be considered as part of its net worth. 

b)  Stock Exchange contribution: Stock Exchange contribution to Core SGF shall 
be at least 25% of the MRC (can be adjusted against transfer of profit by Stock 
Exchange as per Regulation 33 of SECC Regulations, which may be reviewed 
in view of these guidelines).  

c)  Clearing Member primary contribution: If the CC wishes, it can seek risk based 
contribution  from  Clearing  Members  (CMs)  of  the  segment  (including 
custodial  clearing  members)  to  the  Core  SGF  subject  to  the  following 
conditions:  

 

 

 

that  total  contribution  from  CMs  shall  not  be  more  than  25%  of  the 
MRC,  

that no exposure shall be available on Core SGF contribution  of any 
CM  (exposure-free  collateral  of  CM  available  with  CC  can  be 
considered towards Core SGF contribution of CM), and  

that required contributions of individual CMs shall be pro-rata based 
on the risk they bring to the system.  

 CC shall have the flexibility to collect CM primary contribution either upfront or staggered 
over a period of time. In case of staggered contribution, the remaining balance shall be 
met  by  CC  to  ensure  adequacy  of  total  Core  SGF  corpus  at  all  times.  Such  CC 
contribution shall be available to CC for withdrawal as and when further contributions 
from CMs are received.  

  
 The above prescribed limits of contribution by CC, SE and CMs may be reviewed by SEBI 

from time to time considering the prevailing market conditions.

made  to  SEBI  detailing  the  outcome  of  the  review  by  the  CC  Governing  Board, 
including steps taken to enhance the Core SGF.  
 

Default waterfall  
13) The default waterfall of CC for any segment shall generally follow the following order 

–  

i.  Monies  of  defaulting  member  (including  defaulting  member's  primary 
contribution to Core SGF(s) and excess monies of defaulter in other segments).  
Insurance, if any.  

ii. 
iii.  CC resources (equal to 5% of the segment MRC).  
iv.  Core SGF of the segment in the following order:  

a.  Penalties 
b.  CC contribution to the extent of at least 25% of the segment MRC 
c.  Remaining Core SGF: CC contribution, Stock Exchange contribution and 
non-defaulting members’ primary contribution to  Core SGF on pro-rata 
basis.  

v. 

Proportion  of  remaining  CC  resources  (excluding  CC  contribution  to  core 
SGFs of other segments and INR 100 Crore) equal to ratio of segment MRC to 
sum of MRCs of all segments.*  

vi.  CC/SE contribution to Core SGFs of other segments (after meeting obligations 
of those segments) and remaining CC resources to that extent as approved by 
SEBI.  

vii.  Capped additional contribution by non-defaulting members of the segment.** 
viii.  Any remaining loss to be covered by way of pro-rata haircut to payouts.***  

  
*  INR  100  Crore  to  be  excluded  only  when  remaining  CC  resources  (excluding  CC 

contribution to core SGFs of other segments) are more than INR 100 Crore.  

**CC shall limit the liability of non-defaulting members towards additional contribution to 
a  multiple  of  their  required  primary  contribution  to  Core  SGF  and  the  framework 
regarding the same should  be disclosed.  In case  of shortfall in  recovery  of assessed 
amounts from non-defaulting members, further loss can be allocated to layer 'VI' with 
approval of SEBI.  

***In case loss allocation is effected through haircut to payouts, any subsequent usage of 
funds shall be with prior SEBI approval. Further, any exit by CC post using this layer 
shall be as per the terms decided by SEBI in public interest. 

 
Stress testing and back testing 
 
14) CC  shall  effectively  measure,  monitor,  and  manage  its  credit  exposures  to  its 

participants and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes.

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 

 
 
15)  Stress test for credit risk: CC shall carry out daily stress testing for credit risk using 
at least the standardized stress testing methodology prescribed in para 22 below. Apart 
from the prescribed stress scenarios , CCs shall also develop own scenarios for a variety 
of ‘extreme but plausible market conditions’ (in terms of both defaulters’ positions and 
possible price changes in  liquidation  periods, including the risk that liquidating such 
positions could have an impact on the market) and carry out stress testing using self-
developed  scenarios.  Such  scenarios  should  include  relevant  peak  historic  price 
volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and yield curves, 
multiple defaults over various time horizons and a spectrum of forward looking stress 
scenarios in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions.  

  
16)  Liquidity stress test and adequacy of liquidity arrangements: CC shall ensure that 
it  maintains  sufficient  liquid  resources  to  manage  liquidity  risks  from  members, 
settlement banks and those generated by its investment policy. CC shall daily test the 
adequacy of its liquidity arrangements in order to ensure that its liquid resources are 
adequate  to  meet  simultaneous  default  of  at  least  two  clearing  members  and  their 
associates that would generate the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the CC in 
extreme but plausible market conditions and compare such obligation with the resources 
mentioned hereunder:  

 

a.  Cash  
b.  Committed lines of credit available to CC  

  
17)  Reverse  stress  test:  CC  shall  periodically  carry  out  reverse  stress  tests  designed  to 
identify under which market conditions and under what scenarios the combination of 
its  margins,  Core  SGF  and  other  financial  resources  prove  insufficient  to  meet  its 
obligations (e.g. simultaneous default of top N members or N% movement in price of 
top 2 scrips by turnover or 20% movement in price of top N scrips by turnover etc.)  

 

18)  Back  testing  for  adequacy  of  margins:  CC shall  daily  conduct  back  testing  of  the 
margins collected vis-à-vis the actual price changes for the contracts being cleared and 
settled in every segment to assess appropriateness of its margining models.  

 

19)  Adequacy of financial resources: CC shall ensure that it maintains sufficient financial 
resources to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not 
be  limited  to,  the  default  of  the  two  participants  and  their  associates  that  would 
potentially  cause  the  largest  aggregate  credit  exposure  to  the  CC  in  extreme  but 
plausible  market  conditions.  Thus,  CC  shall  continuously  monitor  the  adequacy  of 
financial  resources  (as  available  in  its  default  waterfall)  against  the  uncovered  loss

estimated by the various stress tests conducted by the CC and take steps to beef up the 
same in case of shortfall.  

 

20)  On at least a monthly basis, CC shall perform a comprehensive and thorough analysis 
of stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions used to 
ensure  they  are  appropriate  for  determining  the  CCP’s  required  level  of  default 
protection  in  light  of  current  and  evolving  market  conditions.  CC  shall  perform  this 
analysis of stress testing more frequently when the products cleared or markets served 
display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions 
held  by  a  CC’s  participants  increases  significantly.  A  full  validation  of  CC’s  risk-
management model shall be performed at least annually.  

 

21)  The results of tests carried out as per clauses 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 above and review 
conducted as per clause 19 shall be monitored by the Risk Management Committee of 
the CC and the same should be communicated for discussion and review by the Board 
of the CC.  

 

22)  Clearing corporations and Stock Exchanges are directed to make the following details 

available on its website:  

 

Policy on composition and contributions to be made to the Core SGF; 
Investment policy for Core SGF;

Part A. Scenarios 
 
Historical Scenarios 
 

Peak Historical Return  

1 
Price movement in respect of each underlying over the MPOR period  during the last 15 
years to be considered: 
Scenario 1A: Maximum percentage rise over MPOR period

Peak historical price volatility 

 
 
Scenario 1B: Maximum percentage fall over MPOR period 
  
2 
Historical  price  volatility  (EWMA  volatility)  in  respect  of  each  commodity  during  the 
previous 15 years is to be considered. Percentage price movement equal to 3.5 times the 
peak historical volatility adjusted for applicable MPOR period of the commodity shall be 
considered  (subject  to  a  maximum  of  110%  of  the  price  movement  considered  for  the 
commodity under the peak historical return scenario): 
Scenario 2A: Percentage price rise  
Scenario 2B: Percentage price fall 
 

2  Augmented historical 
 

Stressed MPOR 

Exchange  shall  identify  top  10  days  during  the  previous  15  years  based  on  average  of 
absolute percentage price change across all commodities witnessed over the MPOR period. 
For each of the day, exchange shall identify percentage price change in each commodity 
(in case of unavailability of prices in any of the commodity on any of the identified days, 
price change equal to applicable initial margin in the commodity to be considered). All the 
price movements to be scaled up by 10%.  
 
Thus, one scenario corresponding to each of the 10 identified days shall be generated. 
 
Hypothetical scenarios 
 
4 
 
It shall be assumed that liquidation of open positions would require 5 days and percentage 
price movement equal to 3.5 times current volatility adjusted for 5 day period (i.e., scaling 
up by square root of 5) shall be considered. 
Scenario 4A: Percentage rise over 5 day period  
Scenario 4B: Percentage fall over 5 day period 
5 
 
Price movement in respect of each underlying to the extent of 1.5 times the normal price 
scan range (PSR) over the MPOR period and change in implied volatility equal to 1.5 times 
the normal volatility scan range shall be considered.  
Scenario 5A: Underlying price increasing by 1.5 PSR adjusted for MPOR period, volatility 
increasing by 1.5 VSR.  
Scenario 5B: Underlying price decreasing by 1.5 PSR adjusted for MPOR period, volatility 
increasing by 1.5 VSR.

By stressing positions in all commodities simultaneously 
By first identifying top 10 commodities based on OI and stressing 1 commodity 

 
 
 
Exchanges shall carry out stress tests using each of the scenarios given in Part A as 
follows –  
 
a. 
b. 
at a time (ignoring positions in other commodities and the corresponding margins) 
 
 
Part B. Methodology 
 
The percentage price movements identified in each of the above scenarios shall be applied 
to the commodity price on the day for which the stress test is being done. All open positions 
shall  be  assumed  to  be  squared  up  at  the  theoretical  price  corresponding  to  the  revised 
prices/volatility of the underlying in each of the scenarios. For each clearing member, the 
credit exposure to Clearing Corporation shall be calculated as follows: 
 
a)  The time of stress test shall be end of day 
b)  It  shall  be  assumed  that  clearing  member  will  default  in  paying  the  settlement 
obligations  and  all  outstanding  positions  will  be  squared  off  at  the  theoretical  price 
corresponding to the revised price/volatility of the underlying in the scenario. 

c)  Loss shall be calculated at client portfolio level.  
d)  For  each  client,  residual  loss  shall  be  equal  to  –>  (loss  due  to  close-out  of  client 

positions– margin supporting that specific client’s positions)  

e)  All  residual  losses  (residual  profits  to  be  ignored)  for  all  clients  shall  be  grossed  to 

compute total residual losses due to client positions.  

f)  Loss due to close-out of proprietary positions shall be considered. 
g)  Loss at (e) and loss at (f) and the net pay-in/pay-out requirement of the clearing member 
shall  be  assessed  against  required  margins  (excluding  margin  supporting  client 
positions  and  excess  collateral,  if  any)  and  other  mandatory  deposits  of  defaulting 
member  to  calculate  credit  exposure  of  Clearing  Corporation  to  the  member.  Equity 
scrips as collateral, if any, shall be valued with minimum 20% haircut.  
 

Part C. Coverage 
  
To begin with, for each of the scenarios in Part A, Clearing Corporations shall calculate –  
A.  Credit exposure due to simultaneous default of at least 2 clearing members (and 

their associates) causing highest credit exposure. 

B.  25% of the credit exposure due to simultaneous default of all clearing members.  
However, within a year from the deadline of implementation of the circular, for each of the 
scenarios in Part A, Clearing Corporations shall calculate –

for Protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure’ and subsequent revisions, 
if any, from time to time.  
 

5)  MII  should  also  incorporate  best  practices  from  standards  such  as  ISO  27001,  ISO 

27002, COBIT 5, etc., or their subsequent revisions, if any, from time to time. 

 

6)  MII  should  designate  a  senior  official  as  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  (CISO) 
whose function would be to assess, identify and reduce cyber security risks, respond to 
incidents, establish appropriate standards and controls, and direct the establishment and 
implementation  of  processes  and  procedures  as  per  the  cyber  security  and  resilience 
policy approved by the Board of the MII. 

 
7)  The Oversight Standing Committee on Technology of the stock exchanges and of the 
clearing  corporations  should  on  a  quarterly  basis  review  the  implementation  of  the 
cyber security and resilience policy approved by their Boards, and such review should 
include  review  of  their  current  IT  and  cyber  security  and  resilience  capabilities,  set

operations, services and data management. To this end, MII should maintain up-to-date 
inventory of its hardware and systems, software and information Security. 

 

Protection  
 
Access Controls  
 
14) No  person  by  virtue  of  rank  or  position  should  have  any  intrinsic  right  to  access 

confidential data, applications, system resources or facilities.  

  
15) Any access to MII’s systems, applications, networks, databases, etc., should be for a 
defined  purpose  and  for  a  defined  period.  MII  should  grant  access  to  IT  systems, 
applications, databases and networks on a need-to-use basis and based on the principle 
of least privilege .Such access should be for the period when the access is required and 
should be authorized using strong authentication mechanisms.  

 
16) MII  should  implement  strong  password  controls  for  users’  access  to  systems, 
applications,  networks  and  databases.  Password  controls  should  include  a  change  of 
password  upon  first  log  -on,  minimum  password  length  and  history,  password 
complexity  as  well  as  maximum  validity  period.  The  user  credential  data  should  be 
stored using strong and latest hashing algorithms.

21) Two-factor authentication at  log-in  should  be implemented for all users that connect 

using online / internet facility.  

 

22) MII  should  formulate  an  Internet  access  policy  to  monitor  and  regulate  the  use  of 
internet  and  internet  based  services  such  as  social  media  sites,  cloud-based  internet 
storage sites, etc.  

 

23) Proper  ‘end  of  life’  mechanism  should  be  adopted  to  deactivate  access  privileges  of 
users who are leaving the organization or who access privileges have been withdrawn.  

 

Physical security 
 
24) Physical access to the critical systems should be restricted to minimum. Physical access 
of outsourced staff / visitors should be properly supervised by ensuring at the minimum 
that outsourced staff / visitors are accompanied at all times by authorized employees.  

 
25) Physical access to the critical systems should be revoked immediately if the same is no 

longer required. 

 

26) MII  should  ensure  that  the  perimeter  of  the  critical  equipments  room  are  physically 
secured and monitored by employing physical, human and procedural controls such as 
the use of security guards, CCTVs, card access systems, mantraps, bollards, etc. where 
appropriate.  
 

Network Security Management  

  

27) MII should establish baseline standards to facilitate consistent application of security 
configurations to operating systems, databases, network devices and enterprise mobile 
devices within the IT environment. The MII should conduct regular enforcement checks 
to ensure that the baseline standards are applied uniformly.  
 

28) MII  should  install  network  security  devices,  such  as  firewalls  as  well  as  intrusion 
detection  and  prevention  systems,  to  protect  its  IT  infrastructure  from  security 
exposures originating from internal and external sources. 

 

29) Anti-virus  software  should  be  installed  on  servers  and  other  computer  systems. 
Updation  of  Anti-virus  definition  files  and  automatic  anti-virus  scanning  should  be 
done on a regular basis.

30) Data-in motion and Data-at-rest should be in encrypted form by using strong encryption 

methods such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), RSA, SHA-2, etc. 
  

31) MII  should  implement  measures  to  prevent  unauthorized  access  or  copying  or 
transmission of data / information held in contractual or fiduciary capacity. It should be 
ensured that confidentiality of information is not compromised during the process of 
exchanging and transferring information with external parties. 
 

32) The information security policy should also cover use of devices such as mobile phone, 
faxes, photocopiers, scanners, etc. that can be used for capturing and transmission of 
data.  

 

33) MII should allow only authorized data storage devices through appropriate validation 

processes.  

 
Hardening of Hardware and Software 
 
34) Only a hardened and vetted hardware / software should be deployed by the MII. During 
the hardening process, MII should inter-alia ensure that default passwords are replaced 
with  strong  passwords  and  all  unnecessary  services  are  removed  or  disabled  in 
equipments / software.  
 

35) All open ports which are not in use or can potentially be used for exploitation of data 
should  be  blocked.  Other  open  ports  should  be  monitored  and  appropriate  measures 
should be taken to secure the ports. 

 
Application Security and Testing 
 
36) MII should ensure that regression testing is undertaken before new or modified system 
is implemented. The scope of tests should cover business logic, security controls and 
system performance under various stress-load scenarios and recovery conditions.  

 
Patch Management 
 
37) MII  should  establish  and  ensure  that  the  patch  management  procedures  include  the 
identification, categorization and prioritization of security patches. An implementation 
timeframe  for  each  category  of  security  patches  should  be  established  to  implement 
security patches in a timely manner.

39) MII should frame suitable policy for disposals of the storage media and systems. The 
data / information on such devices and systems should be removed by using methods 
viz. wiping / cleaning / overwrite, degauss and physical destruction, as applicable.  

 
Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)  
 
40) MII should regularly conduct vulnerability assessment to detect security vulnerabilities 
in the IT environment. MII should also carry out periodic penetration tests, at least once 
in a year, in order to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the security posture of the system 
through simulations of actual attacks on its systems and networks.  
 

41) Remedial actions should be immediately taken to address gaps that are identified 

during vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.  

42) In addition, MII should perform vulnerability scanning and conduct penetration testing 
prior to the commissioning of a new system which offers internet accessibility and open 
network interfaces. 
 

Monitoring and Detection 

 

 
43) MII should establish appropriate security monitoring systems and processes to facilitate 
continuous  monitoring  of  security  events  and  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  or 
malicious  activities,  unauthorized  changes,  unauthorized  access  and  unauthorized 
copying or transmission of data / information held in contractual or fiduciary capacity, 
by internal and external parties. The security logs of systems, applications and network 
devices should also be monitored for anomalies.  
 

44) Further, to ensure high resilience, high availability and timely detection of attacks on 
systems and networks, MII should implement suitable mechanism to monitor capacity 
utilization of its critical systems and networks. 
  

45) Suitable  alerts  should  be  generated  in  the  event  of  detection  of  unauthorized  or 

abnormal system activities, transmission errors or unusual online transactions.

Response and Recovery 
 
46) Alerts  generated  from  monitoring  and  detection  systems  should  be  suitably 
investigated, including impact and forensic analysis of such alerts, in order to determine 
activities that are to be performed to prevent expansion of such incident of cyber-attack 
or breach, mitigate its effect and eradicate the incident.  
 

47) The response and recovery plan of the MII should aim at timely restoration of systems 
affected by incidents of cyber-attacks or breaches. The recovery plan should be in line 
with  the  Recovery  Time  Objective  (RTO)  and  Recovery  Point  Objective  (RPO) 
specified by SEBI.  

 

48) The  response  plan  should  define  responsibilities  and  actions  to  be  performed  by  its 
employees  and  support  /  outsourced  staff  in  the  event  of  cyber-attacks  or  breach  of 
cyber security mechanism.  

 

49) Any incident of loss or destruction of data or systems should be thoroughly analyzed 
and  lessons  learned  from  such  incidents  should  be  incorporated  to  strengthen  the 
security mechanism and improve recovery planning and processes.  

 

50) MII should also conduct suitable periodic drills to test the adequacy and effectiveness 

of response and recovery plan. 

 
Sharing of information  
 
51) Quarterly reports containing information on cyber-attacks and threats experienced by 
MII  and  measures  taken  to  mitigate  vulnerabilities,  threats  and  attacks  including 
information on bugs / vulnerabilities / threats that may be useful for other MIIs, should 
be submitted to SEBI.  
 

52) Such details as are felt useful for sharing with other MIIs in masked and anonymous 

manner shall be shared using mechanism to be specified by SEBI from time to time.  

 

Training  
 
53) MII should conduct periodic training programs to enhance awareness level among the 
employees  and  outsourced  staff,  vendors,  etc.  on  IT  /  Cyber  security  policy  and 
standards. Special focus should be given to build awareness levels and skills of staff 
from non-technical disciplines.
