relatives of Associate Directors of the AMC(s) and Trustee.

Funds,  the  AMC  and  the  Trustees  and  the  Sponsor(s).  Also, 
persons having a material pecuniary relationship with the above 
mentioned  entities  that  may,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Trustees, 
affect their independence. 

6.3.2.3 Nominees of the companies who are stakeholders in the Sponsor 
company  or  AMC(s)  (even  if  they  are  not  deemed  sponsors  by 
virtue of holding less than 40% of net worth of AMC(s)).  

6.3.3 Cooling off Period 
 

6.3.3.1  An  “Associate”105  as  defined  above  cannot  be  appointed  as 
Independent  Director  even  after  he  ceases  to  be  an  “Associate” 
unless  a  cooling  off  period  of  three  years  has  elapsed  from  the 
date  of  his  disassociation.  For  example,  an  employee  of  the 
Sponsor(s)  or  their  associate  companies  or  AMC(s)  or  Trustees 
resigns on December 1, 2001 then he cannot be appointed as an 
Independent  Director  till  December  1,  2004.  During  this 
intervening  period,  he  can  be  appointed  only  as  Associate 
Director. However, if he is taken as an Associate Director, say on 
December  2,  2001, 
then  he  cannot  be  considered  as 
“Independent” from December 2, 2004. There must be a cooling 
off period of 3 years from the date he ceases to be an Associate 
Director. 

6.3.4  Mutual  Funds  are  required  to  have  a  minimum  of  50  per  cent.  and 
two-third  independent  directors  on  the  Board  of  the  AMC(s)  and

the Board along with the steps proposed to ensure compliance. 

6.3.5 AMC(s) or Trustees shall appoint Independent Directors in place of the 
resigning  director(s)  within  a  period  of  3  months  from  the  date  of 
resignation. Where Mutual Funds are unable to meet this time limit, 
they  shall  report  to  the  Board  explaining  the  reasons  for  non 
compliance.  Mutual  Funds  may  maintain  a  panel  of  eligible  persons 
who  can  be  appointed  as  Independent  Directors107  as  and  when 
required. They may also consider appointing more than the required 
minimum number of Independent Directors to enhance the standards 
of corporate governance and also to meet the regulatory requirements 
in case of resignation of an independent director.  

6.3.6  On  appointment  of  new  directors  of  the  AMC  or  Trustee,  their  bio-
data108  shall  be  filed  with  the  Board  for  information  or  approval

pre  clearance  regarding  the  purchase  or  sale  of  a  security, 
including the date of the request, the name of the access person, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  transaction  and  whether  the  request 
was approved or denied and waivers given, if any, and its reasons.  

e.   No employee shall purchase any security (including derivatives) on 
a “Carry Forward” basis or indulge in “Short Sale” of any security 
(including  derivatives)  i.e.  employees  who  effect  any  purchase 
transaction(s) shall ensure that they take delivery of the securities 
purchased, before selling them. 

f. 

 Any  transaction  of  Front  Running  by  any  employee  directly  or 
indirectly is strictly prohibited. For this purpose, “Front Running” 
means  any  transaction  of  purchase  and/or  sale  of  a  security 
carried by any employee whether for self or for any other person, 
knowing fully well that the AMC also intends to purchase and/or 
sell the same security for its Mutual Fund operations. To ascertain 
that  the  employee  had  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  Mutual  Fund's 
intended  transactions,  the  Compliance  Officer  may  take  a 
declaration  in  this  regard  from  the  employee.  Such  declaration 
may be included in the application form itself.  

g.  Any  transaction  of  self  dealing  by  any  employee  either  directly  or 
indirectly,  whether  alone  or  in  concert  with  another  person  is 
prohibited.  For  this  purpose,  “Self  Dealing’  means  trading  in  the 
securities  based  on  price  sensitive  information  to  which  the 
employee  has  access  by  virtue  of  his  office.  Declaration  to  this 
effect may be taken from the employee while clearing the proposals 
for investment.

9.1Definitions156 

9.1.1Non Traded Securities157  

9.1.1.1When a security (other than Government Securities) is not traded 
on  any  Stock  Exchange  for  a  period  of  thirty  days  prior  to  the

            9.1.2.1 Thinly traded equity/ equity related securities:158 

a. When trading in an equity and/or equity related security (such as 
convertible debentures, equity warrants etc.) in a month is both 
less  than  Rs.  5  lacs  and  the  total  volume  is  less  than  50,000 
shares, the security shall be considered as thinly traded security 
and valued accordingly.  

b. In order to determine whether a security is thinly traded or not, 
the  volumes  traded  in  all  recognized  Stock  Exchanges  in  India 
may be taken into account.  

c. For example, if the volume of trade is 1, 00,000 and value is Rs. 
4,00,000,  the  shares  do  not  qualify  as  thinly  traded.  Also  if  the 
volume traded is 40,000, but the value of trades is Rs. 6, 00,000, 
the shares do not qualify as thinly traded.

and  publishes  or  provides  the  required  information  along  with 
the daily quotations, the same can be used by the Mutual Funds. 

e. If the shares are not listed on the Stock Exchanges which provide 
such  information,  then  Mutual  Funds  shall  make  their  own 
analysis  in  line  with  the  above  criteria  to  check  whether  such 
securities  are  thinly  traded  or  not  and  then  value  them 
accordingly. 

 

 
9.1.3Thinly traded Debt Securities159  
     9.1.3.1  A  debt  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  shall  be

Stock  Exchange  on  a  particular  valuation  day,  the  value  at  which  it 
was traded on the selected Stock Exchange, as the case may be, on 
the earliest previous day may be used provided such date is not more 
than thirty days prior to valuation date. 

 

9.2.1.2 When a debt security (other than Government Securities) is not traded 
on any Stock Exchange on any particular valuation day, the value at

which  it  was  traded  on  the  principal  Stock  Exchange  or  any  other 
Stock  Exchange,  as  the  case  may  be,  on  the  earliest  previous  day 
may be used provided such date is not more than fifteen days prior 
to  valuation  date.  When  a  debt  security  (other  than  Government 
Securities)  is  purchased  by  way  of  private  placement,  the  value  at 
which  it  was  bought  may  be  used  for  a  period  of  fifteen  days 
beginning from the date of purchase. 

 

9.2.2   Non-Traded /and/or Thinly Traded Securities:161  
       9.2.2.1    AMCs  shall  value  non  traded  and/or  thinly  traded  securities  “in 

good faith” based on the Valuation norms prescribed below: 

  
   9.2.3 Non-traded/ and/or thinly traded equity securities: 

9.2.3.1  Based  on  the  latest  available  Balance  Sheet,  Net  Worth  shall  be 

calculated as follows: 

a.  Net  Worth  per  share  = 

(excluding 
Revaluation  Reserves)  –  Miscellaneous expenditure  and Debit 
Balance in Profit and Loss Account] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

[Share  Capital+  Reserves 

b.  Average Capitalization rate (P/E ratio) for the industry based upon 
either  BSE  or  NSE  data  (which  shall  be  followed  consistently  and 
changes,  if  any,  noted  with  proper  justification  thereof)  shall  be 
taken  and  discounted  by  75  per  cent  i.e.  only  25  per  cent.  Of  the 
industry  average  P/E  shall  be  taken  as  Capitalization  rate  (P/E 
ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the  latest  audited  annual 
accounts shall be considered for this purpose.  

c.  The  value  as  per  the  Net  Worth  value  per  share  and  the  capital 
earning  value  calculated  as  above  shall  be  averaged  and  further 
discounted  by  10  per  cent.  for  illiquidity  so  as  to  arrive  at  the  fair 
value per share.

d.   In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken 

as zero for arriving at capitalised earning. 

e.  In  case  where  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not 
available within nine months from the close of the year, unless the 
accounting year is changed, the shares of such companies shall be 
valued at zero.  

f.  In case an individual security accounts for more than 5 per cent. of 
the  total  assets  of  the  scheme,  an  independent  valuer  shall  be 
appointed  for  the  valuation  of  the  said  security.  To  determine  if  a 
security accounts for more than 5 per cent. of the total assets of the 
scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  by  the  procedure  above  and  the 
proportion  which  it  bears  to  the  total  net  assets  of  the  scheme  to 
which it belongs will be compared on the date of valuation162.  

g.  In case trading in an equity security is suspended up to thirty days, 
then  the  last  traded  price  shall  be  considered  for  valuation  of  that 
security.  If  an  equity  security  is  suspended  for  more  than  thirty 
days, then the AMC(s) or Trustees shall decide the valuation norms 
to be followed and such norms shall be documented and recorded.

1.  As  the  Money  Market  securities164  are  valued  on  the  basis  of 
amortization (cost + accrued interest till the beginning of the day 
+  the  difference  between  the  redemption  value  and  the  cost 
spread  uniformly  over  the  remaining  maturity  period  of  the 
instruments) a similar process should be adopted for non-traded 
debt  securities  with  residual  maturity  of  up  to  182  days,  in  the 
absence of any other standard benchmarks in the market.  

2.  Debt  securities  purchased  with  residual  maturity  of  up  to  182 
days are to be valued at cost (including accrued interest till the 
beginning  of  the  day)  plus  the  difference  between  the 
redemption  value  (inclusive  of  interest)  and  cost  spread 
uniformly over the remaining maturity period of the instrument. 
In case of a debt security with maturity greater than 182 days 
at  the  time  of  purchase,  the  last  valuation  price  plus  accrued 
interest should be used instead of purchase cost. All other non 
traded Non Government debt instruments shall be valued using 
the method suggested below in (b) hereof.  

 

b.  Non  Traded/  Thinly  Traded  Debt  Securities  of  over  182  Days  to

 73                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

i. All Non Government investment grade debt securities, 
classified  as  not  traded,  shall  be  valued  on  yield  to 
maturity basis as described below. 

ii. All Non Government non investment grade performing 
debt securities would be valued at a discount of 25% 
to the face value  

   iii.  All  Non  Government  non  investment  grade  non 
performing debt securities would be valued based on 
the provisioning norms.  

 

        2.   The approach in valuation of non traded debt securities is based on the 
concept of using spreads over the benchmark rate to arrive at the yields 
for pricing the non traded security.  

 

3. The Yields for pricing the non traded debt security would be arrived at 

using the process as defined below.  

                   Step 1: A Risk Free Benchmark Yield is built using the government 
securities  as  the  base.  Government  securities  are  used  as  the 
benchmarks  as  they  are  traded  regularly;  free  of  credit  risk;  and 
traded across different maturity spectrums every week.  

                  Step  2:  A  Matrix  of  spreads  (based  on  the  credit  risk)  are  built  for 
marking  up  the  benchmark  yields.  The  matrix  is  built  based  on 
traded  corporate  paper  on  the  wholesale  debt  segment  of  an 
appropriate stock exchange and the primary market issuances. The 
matrix is restricted only to investment grade corporate paper.  

                  Step 3: The yields as calculated above are Marked-up/Marked-down 

for ill-liquidity risk  

                  Step 4: The Yields so arrived are used to price the portfolio

      9.3.1 Construction of Risk Free Benchmark166 
         9.3.1.1 Using Government of India dated securities; the Benchmark shall 

be constructed as below: 

a.  Government  of  India  dated  securities  will  be  grouped  into 
various duration buckets such as.5-1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, 
4-5 years, 5-6 years and 6 years and the volume weighted yield 
would be computed for each bucket. These duration buckets may 
be  changed  to  reflect  the  market  value  more  closely  by  any 
agency  suggested  by  AMFI  giving  benchmark  yield/  matrix  of 
spreads over benchmark yield.  

b.  The benchmark as calculated above will be set at least weekly, 
and  in  the  event  of  any  significant  movement  in  prices  of 
Government  Securities  on  account  of  any  event  impacting 
interest rated on any day such as a change in the Reserve Bank 
of India (RBI)  policies, the benchmark will be reset to relefect any 
change in the market conditions.  

 

 
   9.3.2 Building a Matrix of Spreads for Marking-up the Benchmark Yield167  
9.3.2.1 Mark up for credit risk over the risk free benchmark YTM as calculated 
in  9.3.1  above,  will  be  determined  using  the  trades  of  corporate 
debentures/bonds  of  different  ratings.  All  trades  on  appropriate  stock 
exchange during the fortnight prior to the benchmark date will be used 
in  building  the  corporate  YTM  and  spread  matrices.  Initially  these 
matrices  will  be  built  only  for  corporate  securities  of  investment  grade. 
The matrices are dynamic and the spreads will be computed every week. 
The matrix will be built for all duration buckets for which the benchmark

GOI matrix is built to effectively link the corporate matrix with the GOI 
securities matrix. Accordingly:  

a.  All traded paper (with minimum traded value of Rs. 1 crore) will be 
classified by their ratings and grouped into 7 duration buckets; for 
rated securities, the most conservative publicly available rating will 
be used;  

b.  For  each  rating  category,  average  volume  weighted  yield  will  be 
obtained  both  from  trades  on  the  appropriate  stock  exchange  and 
from the primary market issuances  

c.  Where  there  are  no  secondary  trades  on  the  appropriate  stock 
exchange  in  a  particular  rating  category  and  no  primary  market 
issuances during the fortnight under consideration, then trades on 
appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  30  day  period  prior  to  the 
benchmark date will be considered for computing the average YTM 
for such rating category;  

d.  If the matrix cannot be populated using any or all of the above steps, 
then  credit  spreads  from  trades  on  appropriate  stock  exchange  of 
the  relevant  rating  category  over  the  AAA  trades  will  be  used  to 
populate the matrix;  

e.  In each rating category, all outliers will be removed for smoothening 

the YTM matrix;  

f.  Spreads  will  be  obtained  by  deducting  the  YTM  in  each  duration 

category from the respective YTM of the GOI securities;  

g.  In  the  event  of  lack  of  trades  in  the  secondary  market  and  the 
primary  market  the  gaps  in  the  matrix  would  be  filled  by 
extrapolation. If the spreads cannot be extrapolated for the reason of 
practicality,  the  gaps  in  the  matrix  will  be  filled  by  carrying  the 
spreads from the last matrix. 

h.  Accordingly,  all  Mutual  Funds  shall  provide  transaction  details  of 
various types of debt securities like NCDs, Mibor linked floaters and 
CPs on daily basis in the prescribed format enclosed at Annexure 3 to 

 76                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

the agency recommended by AMFI. Submission of data would help in 
daily  matrix  generation,  would  improve  uniformity  and  accuracy  of 
valuation in the Mutual Funds industry168.  

    9.3.3 Mark-up/Mark-down Yield     
        9.3.3.1  The  Yields  calculated  would  be  marked-up/marked-down  to 
account  for  the  illiquidity  risk,  promoter  background,  finance 
company  risk  and  the  issuer  class  risk.  As  the  level  of  illiquidity 
risk would be higher for non rated securities the marking process 
for  rated  and  non  rated  securities  would  be  differentiated  as 
follows:

                        1. To value an un-rated security, the fund manager shall assign 
an internal credit rating, which will be used for valuation. Since 
un-rated  instruments  tend  to  be  more  illiquid  than  rated 
securities,  the  yields  would  be  marked  up  by  adding 
discretionary discount as under:

9.4.1.1 Securities with call option  
1. The securities with call option shall be valued at the lower of the value 
as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and  valuing  the 
security  to  call  option.  In  case  there  are  multiple  call  options,  the 
lowest value obtained by valuing to the various call dates and valuing 
to the maturity date is to be taken as the value of the instrument.  

 

        9.4.1.2. Securities with Put option  

             1. The securities with put option shall be valued at the higher of the 
value  as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and 
valuing  the  security  to  put  option.  In  case  there  are  multiple  put 
options,  the  highest  value  obtained  by  valuing  to  the  various  put 
dates and valuing to the maturity date is to be taken as the value of 
the instruments.  

 

9.4.1.3 Securities with both Put and Call option on the same day  
    1. The securities with both Put and Call option on the same day would 
be  deemed  to  mature  on  the  Put/Call  day  and  would  be  valued 
accordingly.  

 
9.5 Valuation of Government Securities 

           9.5.1.  Government  securities  will  be  valued  at  prices  for  government

illiquid securities held above 15 per cent. of the total assets shall be 
assigned zero value. 

  

9.6.2   All Mutual Funds shall disclose as on March 31 and September 30 the 
scheme wise total illiquid securities in value and percentage of the net 
assets  while  disclosing  Half  Yearly  Portfolios  to  the  unit  holders.  In 
the  list  of  investments,  an  asterisk  mark  shall  be  given  against  all 
such investments which are recognised as illiquid securities.

years  bring  down  the  ratio  of  illiquid  securities  within  the  prescribed  limit  of  15 
per cent. in the following time frame:  
a.  All the illiquid securities above 20 per cent. of total assets of the scheme shall 

be assigned zero value on September 30, 2001.  

b.  All the illiquid securities above 15 per cent. of total assets of the scheme shall 

be assigned zero value on September 30, 2002. 

2.  In  respect  of  closed  ended  funds,  for  the  purposes  of  valuation  of  illiquid 
securities,  the  limits  of  15  per  cent.  and  20  per  cent.  applicable  to  open  ended 
funds should be increased to 20 per cent. and 25 per cent. respectively.  

3.  Where  a  scheme  has  illiquid  securities  as  at  September  30,  2001  not  exceeding 
15%  in  the  case  of  an  open-ended  fund  and  20%  in  the  case  of  closed  fund,  the 
concessions  of  giving  time  period  for  reducing  the  illiquid  security  to  the 
prescribed  limits  would  not  be  applicable  and  at  all  time  the  excess  over  15%  or 
20% shall be assigned nil value

9.7.1.1  An  ‘asset’  shall  be  classified  as  NPA  if  the  interest  and/or  principal 
amount  have  not  been  received  or  remained  outstanding  for  one  quarter  from 
the day such income and/or installment was due.  
 
9.7.2 Effective date for classification and provisioning of NPAs  
9.7.2.1 The definition of NPA may be applied after a quarter past due date of the 
interest. For e.g. if the due date for interest is 30.06.2000, it will be classified as 
NPA from 01.10.2000.  
 
9.7.3 Treatment of income accrued on the NPA and further accruals 
9.7.3.1  After  the  expiry  of  the  1st  quarter  from  the  date  the  income  has  fallen 
due, there will be no further interest accrual on the asset i.e. if the due 
date  for  interest  falls  on  30.06.2000  and  if  the  interest  is  not  received, 
accrual will continue till 30.09.2000 after which there will be no further 
accrual  of  income.  In  short,  taking  the  above  example,  from  the 
beginning of the 2nd quarter there will be no further accrual on income.  

 
9.7.3.2  On  classification  of  the  asset  as  NPA  from  a  quarter  past  due  date  of 
interest, all interest accrued and recognized in the books of accounts of 
the  Mutual  Fund  till  the  date  shall  be  provided  for.  For  e.g.  if  interest 
income  falls  due  on  30.06.2000,  accrual  of  interest  will  continue  till 
30.09.2000 even if the income as on 30.06.2000 has not been received. 
Further,  no  accrual  will  take  place  from  01.10.2000  onwards.  Full 
provision  will  be  made  for  interest  accrued  and  outstanding  as  on 
30.06.2000.  

 
9.7.4 Provision for NPAs – Debt Securities 
9.7.4.1 Both secured and unsecured investments, once they are recognized   as 
NPAs,  call  for  provisioning  in  the  same  manner  and  where  these  are 
related  to  close  ended  schemes,  the  phasing  would  be  such  that  to 

 81                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

ensure  full  provisioning  prior  to  the  closure  of  the  scheme  or  the 
scheduled phasing which ever is earlier.  

 

9.7.4.2 The value of the asset shall be provided in the following manner or earlier 
at  the  discretion  of  the  Mutual  Fund.  Mutual  Funds  will  not  have 
discretion to extend the period of provisioning. The provisioning against 
the principal amount or installments shall be made at the following rates 
irrespective of whether the principal is due for repayment or not. 

10  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  shall  be  provided  for  after  6 
months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  3  months  form  the  date  of 
classification of the asset as NPA.  
20  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  should  be  provided  for  after  9 
months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  6  months  from  the  date  of 
classification of the asset as NPA.  
Another  20  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  shall  be  provided  for 
after 12 months past due date of interest i.e. 9 months from the date of 
classification of the asset as NPA.  
Another  25  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  shall  be  provided  for 
after 15 months past due date of interest i.e. 12 months from the date of 
classification of the asset as NPA.  
The balance 25 percent of the book value of the asset shall be provided for 
after 18 months past due date of the interest i.e. 15 months from the date 
of classification of the assets as NPA.

9.7.4.3 Book value for the purpose of provisioning for NPAs shall be taken as a 

value determined as per the prescribed valuation method.  

 

9.7.4.4. This can be explained by an illustration:  
a. 

Let us consider that interest income is due on a half yearly basis and the 
due date falls on 30.06.2000 and the interest is not received till 1st quarter 
after  due  date  i.e.  30.09.2000.  The  provisioning  will  be  done  in  the 
following phased manner:   

 82                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds

6 months past due date of 
interest i.e. 3 months from the 
date of classification of asset 
as NPA (01.10.2000) 
  
  
  
  

Thus,  one  and  half  years  past  the  due  date  of  income  or  one  year  and 
three months from the date of classification of the ‘asset’ as an NPA, the 
‘asset’ will be fully provided for. If any installment is fallen due, during the 
period of interest default, the amount of provision shall be the installment 
amount or above provision amount, whichever is higher.  

 
9.7.5 Reclassification of assets 
9.7.5.1 Upon reclassification of assets as ‘performing assets’:  
a. 

In case a company has fully cleared all the arrears of interest, the interest 
provisions can be written back in full.  
The  asset  will  be  reclassified  as  performing  on  clearance  of  all  interest 
arrears and if the debt is regularly serviced over the next two quarters.  
In  case  the  company  has  fully  cleared  all  the  arrears  of  interest,  the 
interest  not  credited  on  accrual  basis  shall  be  credited  at  the  time  of 
receipt.  
The  provision  made  for  the  principal  amount  can  be  written  back  in  the 
following manner  
1.  100% of the asset provided for in the books will be written back at the 
end of the 2nd quarter where the provision of principal was made due to 
the interest defaults only.  

2.  50% of the asset provided for in the books will be written back at the 
end of the 2nd quarter and 25% after every subsequent quarter where 
both installments and interest payment were in default earlier.

i.  Explanation: The words “2nd quarter” wherever appear, shall mean 2nd 

calendar quarter.176 

An  asset  is  reclassified  as  'standard  asset'  only  when  both,  the  overdue 
interest and overdue installments are paid in full and there is satisfactory 
performance for a subsequent period of 6 months.

9.7.6 Receipt of past dues: 
9.7.6.1  When  the  Mutual  Fund  has  received  income/  principal  amount  after 
their classifications as NPAs:  
a. 

For  the  next  2  quarters,  income  shall  be  recognized  on  cash  basis  and 
thereafter on accrual basis. The asset will be continued to be classified as 
NPA for these two quarters.  
During this period of two quarters although the asset is classified as NPA 
no provision needs to be made for the principal if the same is not due and 
outstanding. 
If  part  payment  is  received  towards  principal,  the  asset  continues  to  be 
classified  as  NPA  and  provisions  are  continued  as  per  the  norms  set  at 
9.7.4 above Any excess provision will be written back.

9.7.7 Classification of Deep Discount Bonds as NPAs 
9.7.7.1  Investments  in  Deep  Discount  Bonds  can  be  classified  as  NPAs,  if  any 
two of the following conditions are satisfied:  
a. 

If the rating of the Bond comes down to Grade ‘BB’  (or its equivalent) or 
below  
If  the  company  is  defaulting  in  their  commitments  in  respect  of  other 
assets, if available.  
Full Net worth erosion.

a. 

9.7.8.1  In  case  a  company  defaults  in  payment  of  either  interest  or  principal 
amount  and  the  Mutual  Fund  has  accepted  a  rescheduling  of  the 
schedule of payments, then the following practice shall be adhered to:  
In  case  it  is  a  first  reschedulement  and  only  payment  of  interest  is  in 
default,  the  classification  of  the  asset  as  NPA  shall  be  continued  and 
existing  provisions  shall  not  be  written  back.  This  practice  shall  be

amount, the asset shall continue as NPA for a period of 4 quarters, even 
though  the  asset  is  continued  to  be  serviced  during  these  4  quarters 
regularly. Thereafter, the asset can be classified as ‘performing asset’ and 
all the interest provided till such date shall be written back.  
If  the  reschedulement  is  done  for  a  second/  third  time  or  thereafter,  the 
characteristics  of  NPA  should  be  continued  for  eight  quarters  of  regular 
servicing  of  the  debt.  The  provision  shall  be  written  back  only  after  the

9.8 Investment in Unlisted Equity Shares178 
9.8.1  To  ensure  uniformity  in  calculation  of  NAV  the  following  guidelines  are 

issued: 

 

9.8.1.1 Methodology for Valuation - unlisted equity shares of a company shall be 
valued "in good faith" as below:  
a. 

Based  on  the  latest  available  audited  balance  sheet,  Net  Worth  shall  be 
calculated as the lower of item (1) and (2) below:  

1.  Net  Worth  per  share  =  [Share  Capital  +  Free  Reserves  (excluding 
revaluation reserves) - Miscellaneous expenditure not written off or 
deferred  revenue  expenditure,  intangible  assets  and  accumulated 
losses] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

2. After taking into account the outstanding warrants and options, Net 
Worth  per  share  shall  again  be  calculated  and  shall  be  =  [Share 
Capital  +  consideration  on  exercise  of  Option  and/or  Warrants 
received/receivable  by  the  Company  +  Free  Reserves  (excluding

Revaluation Reserves) - Miscellaneous expenditure not written off or 
deferred  revenue  expenditure,  intangible  assets  and  accumulated 
losses]  /  Number  of  Paid  up  Shares  plus  Number  of  Shares  that 
would  be  obtained  on  conversion  and/or  exercise  of  Outstanding 
Warrants and Options. 

3.  The  lower  of  (1)  and  (2)  above  shall  be  used  for  calculation  of  Net 

Worth per share and for further calculation in (c) below. 

Average capitalisation rate (P/E ratio) for the industry based upon either 
BSE or NSE data (which shall be followed consistently and changes, if any, 
noted  with  proper  justification  thereof)  shall  be  taken  and  discounted  by 
75  per  cent.  i.e.  only  25  per  cent  of  the  industry  average  P/E  shall  be 
taken  as  capitalisation  rate  (P/E  ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the 
latest audited annual accounts will be considered for this purpose.  

The  value  as  per  the  Net  Worth  value  per  share  and  the  capital  earning 
value calculated as above shall be averaged and further discounted by 15 
per cent for illiquidity so as to arrive at the fair value per share. 

 
b. 

 
c. 

 

9.8.1.2  The  above  valuation  methodology  shall  be  subject  to  the  following 

conditions:  

a. 
b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

All calculations shall be based on audited accounts.  
If  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not  available  within  nine 
months from the close of the year, unless the accounting year is changed, 
the shares of such companies shall be valued at zero.  
If the Net Worth of the company is negative, the share would be marked 
down to zero.  
In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken as zero 
for arriving at capitalised earning.  
In  case  an  individual  security  accounts  for  more  than  5  per  cent  of  the 
total  assets  of  the  scheme,  an  independent  valuer  shall  be  appointed  for 

 87                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

the valuation of the said security. To determine if a security accounts for 
more than 5 per cent of the total assets of the scheme, it shall be valued in 
accordance  with  the  procedure  as  mentioned  above  on  the  date  of 
valuation.  

 
9.8.2  At  the  discretion  of  the  AMCs  and  with  the  approval  of  the  Trustees, 
unlisted  equity  shares  may  be  valued  at  a  price  lower  than  the  value  derived 
using the aforesaid methodology.

of  returns  shall  assume  that  all  payouts  during  the  period 
have been reinvested in the scheme at the then prevailing NAV

In  case  of  Money  Market  schemes  or  cash  and  liquid  plans,

performance  can  be  advertised  by  simple  annualisation  of 
yields if a performance figure is available for at least 7 days256,

in the main body of the advertisement, immediately after the 
returns or yields and in the same font that past performance

(e.g.  rise  or  fall  in  interest  rates  etc.),  the  same  shall  be 
clarified in the advertisement.

of  most  recent  practicable  date  depending  upon  the  type  of

(if applicable).262

factors before investing in Mutual Fund schemes to arrive at a well 
informed  investment  decision.  Considering  that  investors  get  very
