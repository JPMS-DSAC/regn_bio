a. An  employee  including  access  person  is  permitted  to  apply  to  a 

public  issue  of  shares  and/or  debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or 

warrants of any company, as long as the application is made in the 

normal  course  of  the  public  issue.  Such  an  application  may  be 

made  without  seeking  the  clearance  from  the  Compliance  Officer. 

Employees of AMC(s) and Trustees are prohibited from applying in

employee  already  has  an  investment,  provided  that  such  a 

preferential  offer  is  made  to  all  shareholders  and/or  debenture 

holders of such companies. Details of such applications made shall 

be intimated to the Compliance Officer.  

c. The  employees  of  the  AMC(s)  and/or  Trustees  including  access 

person  may  apply  for  any  rights  offer  of  any  company  in  which 

they  are  already  shareholders.  Applications  for  additional  rights 

(over  and  above  the  normal  rights  entitlement)  shares  may  be 

made by the employees including access person without getting the 

clearance  from  the  Compliance  Officer.  An  employee  including 

access person may also sell and/or renounce his rights entitlement 

without  getting  the  clearance  from  the  Compliance  Officer. 

However,  if  an  access  person  wishes  to  purchase  the  “Rights 

renunciations” he shall get the clearance of the Compliance Officer 

for the same. Such purchases shall be done only at market prices. 

Details  of  any  applications  made  in  any  rights  issue,  whether  in

a. An  access  person  who  wishes  to  make  a  secondary  market 

transaction shall submit a written application to that effect to the 

Compliance Officer. Such an application shall specify the name of 

the company whose securities the employee wishes to buy and/or 

sell, type of security, and the number of shares and/or debentures 

and/or bonds and/or warrants and/or derivatives that the access 

person wishes to buy/sell.  

b. The  Compliance  Officer  shall  clear  these  requests  if  the  following 

conditions are met:  

 50                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

1. If the shares and/or debentures and/or bonds and/or warrants 

of the company or derivatives specified by the access person are 

not held by any scheme of the Mutual Fund of which the AMC is 

the investment manager; 

2. If  such  shares  and/or  debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or 

warrants  of  the  company  or  derivatives  specified  by  the 

employee are held by any  scheme  of the Mutual Fund  of which 

the AMC is the investment manager, there should be a “cooling 

off”  period  of  15  calendar  days.  The  Compliance  Officer  shall 

ensure  that  the  last  transaction  in  that  particular  security  was 

done by the Mutual Fund at least 15 calendar days prior to the 

date  of  the  written  application  by  the  access  person.  In  other 

words,  an  application  for  a  purchase  /sale  transaction  on  a 

personal basis would be cleared only if the Mutual Fund has not 

transacted  in  that  particular  security  for  at  least  15  calendar 

 

days. 

 

c.  The Compliance Officer shall keep a track of the transactions of the 

employees  and  transactions  of  the  Mutual  Fund  to  ensure  that 

there  is  no  conflict  of  interest  between  them  i.e.  the  Compliance 

Officer  should  track  whether  the  Mutual  Fund  has  transacted  in 

the  same  securities  either  before  or  after 

the  employee’s 

transaction(s).  

d.  The  Compliance  Officer  shall  maintain  a  record  of  all  requests  for 

pre clearance regarding the purchase or sale of a security, including

of the proposed transaction and whether the request was approved 

or denied and waivers given, if any, and its reasons.

e.  No  employee shall  purchase  any  security  (including  derivatives)  on 

a  “Carry  Forward”  basis  or  indulge  in  “Short  Sale”  of  any  security 

(including  derivatives)  i.e.  employees  who  effect  any  purchase 

transaction(s)  shall  ensure  that  they  take  delivery  of  the  securities 

purchased, before selling them. 

f.   Any  transaction  of  Front  Running  by  any  employee  directly  or 

indirectly  is  strictly  prohibited.  For  this  purpose,  “Front  Running” 

means any transaction of purchase and/or sale of a security carried 

by any employee whether for self or for any other person, knowing 

fully  well  that  the  AMC  also  intends  to  purchase  and/or  sell  the 

same security for its Mutual Fund operations. To ascertain that the 

employee  had  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  Mutual  Fund's  intended 

transactions, the Compliance Officer may take a declaration in this 

regard from the employee. Such declaration may be included in the 

application form itself.  

g. Any  transaction  of  self  dealing  by  any  employee  either  directly  or 

indirectly,  whether  alone  or  in  concert  with  another  person  is 

prohibited.  For  this  purpose,  “Self  Dealing’  means  trading  in  the 

securities  based  on  price  sensitive  information  to  which  the 

employee has access by virtue of his office. Declaration to this effect 

may  be  taken  from  the  employee  while  clearing  the  proposals  for 

investment.

VALUATION 

9.1  Definitions181 

9.1.1  Non Traded Securities182  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.1.1.1 When a security (other than Government Securities) is not traded 

on  any  Stock  Exchange  for  a  period  of  thirty  days  prior  to  the 

valuation date, the scrip shall be treated as a non traded security. 

9.1.2  Thinly Traded Securities 

9.1.2.1 Thinly traded equity/ equity related securities:183 

a. When trading in an equity and/or equity related security (such as 

convertible  debentures,  equity  warrants  etc.)  in  a  month  is  both 

less than `5 lacs and the total volume is less than 50,000 shares, 

the  security  shall  be  considered  as  thinly  traded  security  and 

valued accordingly.  

b. In order to determine whether a security is thinly traded or not, the 

volumes traded in all recognized Stock Exchanges in India may be 

taken into account.  

c. For  example,  if  the  volume  of  trade  is  1,00,000  and  value  is 

`4,00,000,  the  shares  do  not  qualify  as  thinly  traded.  Also  if  the 

volume traded is 40,000, but the value of trades is `6, 00,000, the 

shares do not qualify as thinly traded.

d. Where  a  Stock  Exchange  identifies  the  thinly  traded  securities  by 

applying  the  above  parameters  for  the  preceding  calendar  month 

and publishes or provides the required information along with the 

daily quotations, the same can be used by the Mutual Funds. 

e. 

If  the  shares  are  not  listed  on  the  Stock  Exchanges  which  provide 

such  information,  then  Mutual  Funds  shall  make  their  own 

analysis  in  line  with  the  above  criteria  to  check  whether  such 

securities  are  thinly  traded  or  not  and  then  value  them 

accordingly. 

9.1.3  Thinly traded Debt Securities184  

9.1.3.1 A  debt  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  shall  be 

considered  as  a  thinly  traded  security  if,  on  the  valuation  date, 

there  are  no  individual  trades  in  that  security  in  marketable  lots 

(currently  applicable)  on  the  principal  Stock  Exchange  or  any 

other Stock Exchange.

Stock Exchange on a particular valuation day, the value at which 

it was traded on the selected Stock Exchange, as the case may be, 

on  the  earliest  previous  day  may  be  used  provided  such  date  is 

not more than thirty days prior to valuation date. 

9.2.1.2 When  a  debt  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  is  not 

traded  on  any  Stock  Exchange  on  any  particular  valuation  day,

the value at which it was traded on the principal Stock Exchange 

or any other Stock Exchange, as the case may be, on the earliest 

previous  day  may  be  used  provided  such  date  is  not  more  than 

fifteen  days  prior  to  valuation  date.  When  a  debt  security  (other 

than  Government  Securities)  is  purchased  by  way  of  private 

placement,  the  value  at  which  it  was  bought  may  be  used  for  a 

period of fifteen days beginning from the date of purchase. 

9.2.2  Non-Traded /and/or Thinly Traded Securities:186  

9.2.2.1 AMCs  shall  value  non  traded  and/or  thinly  traded  securities  “in 

good faith” based on the Valuation norms prescribed below:  

9.2.3  Non-traded/ and/or thinly traded equity securities: 

9.2.3.1 Based  on  the  latest  available  Balance  Sheet,  Net  Worth  shall  be 

calculated as follows: 

a. Net  Worth  per  share  =  [Share  Capital+  Reserves  (excluding 

Revaluation  Reserves)  –  Miscellaneous expenditure  and Debit 

Balance in Profit and Loss Account] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

b. Average Capitalization rate (P/E ratio) for the industry based upon 

either  BSE  or  NSE  data  (which  shall  be  followed  consistently  and 

changes,  if  any,  noted  with  proper  justification  thereof)  shall  be 

taken and discounted by 75 per  cent i.e. only 25 per  cent.  Of the 

industry  average  P/E  shall  be  taken  as  Capitalization  rate  (P/E 

ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the  latest  audited  annual 

accounts shall be considered for this purpose.  

c. The  value  as  per  the  Net  Worth  value  per  share  and  the  capital 

earning  value  calculated  as  above  shall  be  averaged  and  further

discounted by 10 per cent. for illiquidity so as to arrive at the fair 

value per share.  

d.  In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken 

as zero for arriving at capitalised earning. 

e. In  case  where  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not 

available within nine months from the close of the year, unless the 

accounting year is changed, the shares of such companies shall be 

valued at zero.  

f.  In case an individual security accounts for more than 5 per cent. of 

the  total  assets  of  the  scheme,  an  independent  valuer  shall  be 

appointed  for  the  valuation  of  the  said  security.  To  determine if  a 

security  accounts  for  more  than  5  per  cent.  of  the  total  assets  of 

the  scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  by  the  procedure  above  and  the 

proportion  which  it  bears  to  the  total  net  assets  of  the  scheme  to 

which it belongs will be compared on the date of valuation187.  

g. In  case  trading  in  an  equity  security  is  suspended  up  to  thirty 

days, then the last traded price shall be considered for valuation of 

that  security.  If  an  equity  security  is  suspended  for  more  than 

thirty days, then the AMC(s) or Trustees shall decide the valuation 

norms  to  be  followed  and  such  norms  shall  be  documented  and 

recorded.

a. Valuation188  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 

maturity of upto 60189 days: 

1. All  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including  floating  rate 

securities,  with  residual  maturity  of  upto  60  days  shall  be 

valued at the weighted average price at which they are traded on 

the  particular  valuation  day.  When  such  securities  are  not 

traded  on  a  particular  valuation  day  they  shall  be  valued  on 

amortization  basis.  It is  further  clarified  that  in  case  of  floating 

rate securities with  floor and  caps  on  coupon rate and residual 

maturity  of  upto  60  days  then  those  shall  be  valued  on 

amortization basis taking the coupon rate as floor. 

b. Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 

maturity of over 60190 days: 

1. All  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including  floating  rate 

securities, with residual maturity of over 60 days shall be valued 

at  weighted  average  price  at  which  they  are  traded  on  the 

particular valuation day. When such securities are not traded on 

a  particular  valuation  day  they  shall  be  valued  at  benchmark 

yield/  matrix of  spread over risk free benchmark  yield obtained 

from agency(ies) entrusted for the said purpose by AMFI. 

2. The approach in valuation of non traded debt securities is based 

on  the  concept  of  using  spreads  over  the  benchmark  rate  to 

arrive at the yields for pricing the non traded security.  

3. The  Yields  for  pricing  the  non  traded  debt  security  would  be 

arrived at using the process as defined below.

Step  1:  A  Risk  Free  Benchmark  Yield  is  built  using  the 

government  securities  as  the  base.  Government  securities  are 

used  as  the  benchmarks  as  they  are  traded  regularly;  free  of 

credit  risk;  and  traded  across  different  maturity  spectrums  every 

week.  

Step 2: A Matrix of spreads (based on the credit risk) are built for 

marking  up  the  benchmark  yields.  The  matrix  is  built  based  on 

traded  corporate  paper  on  the  wholesale  debt  segment  of  an 

appropriate  stock  exchange  and  the  primary  market  issuances. 

The matrix is restricted only to investment grade corporate paper.  

Step  3:  The  yields  as  calculated  above  are  Marked-up/Marked-

down for ill-liquidity risk  

Step 4: The Yields so arrived are used to price the portfolio. 

 
9.3  Methodology:  

9.3.1  Construction of Risk Free Benchmark191 

9.3.1.1 Using Government of India dated securities; the Benchmark shall 

be constructed as below: 

 

a. Government  of India  dated  securities will  be  grouped  into  various 

duration buckets such as 0.164-0.25 yrs192, 0.25- 0.5 yrs193, 0.5-1 

year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, 5-6 years and 6 years and the 

volume  weighted  yield  would  be  computed for  each  bucket.  These 

duration buckets may be changed to reflect the market value more 

closely by any agency suggested by AMFI giving benchmark yield/ 

matrix of spreads over benchmark yield.

b. The benchmark as calculated above will be set at least weekly, and 

in  the  event  of any  significant  movement  in  prices  of  Government 

Securities on account of any event impacting interest rated on any 

day such as a change in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  policies, 

the  benchmark  will  be  reset  to  reflect  any  change  in  the  market 

conditions.  

9.3.2  Building a Matrix of Spreads for Marking-up the Benchmark Yield194  

9.3.2.1 Mark  up  for  credit  risk  over  the  risk  free  benchmark  YTM  as 

calculated  in  9.3.1  above,  will  be  determined  using  the  trades  of 

corporate  debentures/bonds  of  different  ratings.  All  trades  on 

appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  fortnight  prior  to  the 

benchmark  date  will  be  used  in  building  the  corporate  YTM  and 

spread  matrices.  Initially  these  matrices  will  be  built  only  for 

corporate  securities  of  investment  grade.  The  matrices  are 

dynamic and the spreads will be computed every week. The matrix 

will be built for all duration buckets for which the benchmark GOI 

matrix is built to effectively link the corporate matrix with the GOI 

securities matrix. Accordingly:  

a. All  traded  paper  (with  minimum  traded  value  of  `1  crore)  will  be 

classified by their ratings and grouped into 7 duration buckets; for 

rated securities, the most conservative publicly available rating will 

be used;  

b. For  each  rating  category,  average  volume  weighted  yield  will  be 

obtained both from trades  on the appropriate stock exchange and 

from the primary market issuances  

c. Where  there  are  no  secondary  trades  on  the  appropriate  stock 

exchange  in  a  particular  rating  category  and  no  primary  market 

                                                  
194 SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 dated September 18, 2000. 
 

 86                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

issuances during the fortnight under consideration, then trades on 

appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  30  day  period  prior  to  the 

benchmark date will be considered for computing the average YTM 

for such rating category;  

d. If  the  matrix  cannot  be  populated  using  any  or  all  of  the  above 

steps,  then  credit  spreads  from  trades  on  appropriate  stock 

exchange of the relevant rating category over the AAA trades will be 

used to populate the matrix;  

e. In  each  rating  category,  all  outliers  will  be  removed 

for 

smoothening the YTM matrix;  

f.  Spreads  will  be  obtained  by  deducting  the  YTM  in  each  duration 

category from the respective YTM of the GOI securities;  

g. In  the  event  of  lack  of  trades  in  the  secondary  market  and  the 

primary  market  the  gaps  in  the  matrix  would  be  filled  by 

extrapolation. If the spreads cannot be extrapolated for the reason 

of practicality, the gaps in the matrix will be filled by carrying the 

spreads from the last matrix. 

h. Accordingly,  all  Mutual  Funds  shall  provide  transaction  details  of 

various  types  of  debt  securities  like  NCDs,  Mibor  linked  floaters 

and  CPs  on  daily  basis  in  the  prescribed  format  enclosed  at 

Annexure  3  to  the  agency  recommended  by  AMFI.  Submission  of 

data  would  help  in  daily  matrix  generation,  would  improve 

uniformity  and  accuracy  of  valuation  in  the  Mutual  Funds 

industry195.  

9.3.3  Mark-up/Mark-down Yield 

 

9.3.3.1 The  Yields  calculated  would  be  marked-up/marked-down  to 

account  for  the  illiquidity  risk,  promoter  background,  finance 

company  risk  and  the  issuer  class  risk.  As  the  level  of  illiquidity 

risk would be higher for non rated securities the marking process

This structure will be reviewed periodically.  

b. Adjustments for Internally Rated Securities197  

1.  To value an un-rated security, the fund manager shall assign 

an  internal  credit  rating,  which  will  be  used  for  valuation. 

Since un-rated instruments tend to be more illiquid than rated 

securities,  the  yields  would  be  marked  up  by  adding 

discretionary discount as under:

a. The  securities  with  call  option  shall  be  valued  at  the  lower  of  the 

value  as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and 

valuing  the  security  to  call  option.  In  case  there  are  multiple  call

of the instrument.  

9.4.1.2 Securities with Put option  

a. The securities with put option shall be valued at the higher of the 

value  as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and 

valuing  the  security  to  put  option.  In  case  there  are  multiple  put 

options,  the  highest  value  obtained  by  valuing  to  the  various  put 

dates and valuing to the maturity date is to be taken as the value

9.6.1  Aggregate  value  of  “illiquid  securities”  under  a  scheme,  which  are 

defined  as  non-traded,  thinly  traded  and  unlisted  equity  shares, 

shall  not  exceed  15  per  cent  of  the  total  assets  of  the  scheme  and 

any  illiquid  securities  held  above  15  per  cent.  of  the  total  assets 

shall be assigned zero value. 

9.6.2  All Mutual Funds shall disclose as  on  March 31 and September 30

1.  Provided  that  in  case  any  scheme  has  illiquid securities  in  excess  of  15%  of  total 
assets as on September 30, 2000 then such a scheme shall within a period of two 
years  bring  down  the  ratio  of  illiquid  securities  within  the  prescribed  limit  of  15 
per cent. in the following time frame:  
a.  All the illiquid securities above 20 per cent. of total assets of the scheme shall 

be assigned zero value on September 30, 2001.  

b.  All the illiquid securities above 15 per cent. of total assets of the scheme shall 

be assigned zero value on September 30, 2002.

securities,  the  limits  of  15  per  cent.  and  20  per  cent.  applicable  to  open  ended 
funds should be increased to 20 per cent. and 25 per cent. respectively.  

3.  Where  a  scheme  has  illiquid  securities  as  at  September  30,  2001  not  exceeding 
15%  in  the  case  of  an  open-ended  fund  and  20%  in  the  case  of  closed  fund,  the 
concessions  of  giving  time  period  for  reducing  the  illiquid  security  to  the 
prescribed  limits  would  not  be  applicable  and  at  all  time  the  excess  over  15%  or 
20% shall be assigned nil value

9.7  Guidelines  for  Identification  and  Provisioning  for  Non 

Performing Assets (Debt Securities)202 

9.7.1  Definition of a Non Performing Asset (NPA)  

9.7.1.1  An  ‘asset’  shall  be  classified  as  NPA  if  the  interest  and/or 

principal amount have not been received or remained outstanding 

for one quarter from the day such income and/or installment was 

due.  

9.7.2  Effective date for classification and provisioning of NPAs  

9.7.2.1 The definition of NPA may be applied after a quarter past due date 

of the interest. For e.g. if the due date for interest is 30.06.2000, it 

will be classified as NPA from 01.10.2000.  

9.7.3  Treatment of income accrued on the NPA and further accruals 

 

9.7.3.1 After  the  expiry  of  the  1st  quarter  from  the  date  the  income  has 

fallen  due,  there  will  be  no  further  interest  accrual  on  the  asset 

i.e.  if  the  due  date  for  interest  falls  on  30.06.2000  and  if  the 

interest is not received, accrual will continue till 30.09.2000 after 

which there will be no further accrual of income. In short, taking 

                                                  
202 SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 dated September 18, 2000. 
 

 91                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 

 

 

the above example, from the beginning of the 2nd quarter there will 

be no further accrual on income.  

9.7.3.2 On classification of the asset as NPA from a quarter past due date 

of  interest,  all  interest  accrued  and  recognized  in  the  books  of 

accounts  of  the  Mutual  Fund  till  the  date  shall  be  provided  for. 

For  e.g.  if  interest  income  falls  due  on  30.06.2000,  accrual  of 

interest  will  continue  till  30.09.2000  even  if  the  income  as  on 

30.06.2000  has  not  been  received.  Further,  no  accrual  will  take 

place  from  01.10.2000  onwards.  Full  provision  will  be  made  for 

interest accrued and outstanding as on 30.06.2000.  

9.7.4  Provision for NPAs – Debt Securities 

9.7.4.1 Both  secured  and  unsecured 

investments,  once  they  are 

recognized      as  NPAs,  call  for  provisioning  in  the  same  manner 

and where these are related to close ended schemes, the phasing 

would be such that to ensure full provisioning prior to the closure 

of the scheme or the scheduled phasing which ever is earlier.  

9.7.4.2 The value of the asset shall be provided in the following manner or 

earlier  at  the  discretion  of  the  Mutual  Fund.  Mutual  Funds  will 

not  have  discretion  to  extend  the  period  of  provisioning.  The 

provisioning against the principal amount or installments shall be 

made at the following rates irrespective of whether the principal is 

due for repayment or not. 

a. 10 percent of the book value of the asset shall be provided for after 

6 months past due  date of interest i.e. 3 months form the date of 

classification of the asset as NPA.  

b. 20  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  should  be  provided  for 

after  9  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  6  months  from  the 

date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

 92                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

c. Another  20  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  shall  be 

provided for after 12 months past due date of interest i.e. 9 months 

from the date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

d. Another  25  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  shall  be 

provided  for  after  15  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  12 

months from the date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

e. The  balance  25  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  shall  be 

provided  for  after  18  months  past  due  date  of  the  interest  i.e.  15 

months from the date of classification of the assets as NPA.  

9.7.4.3 Book value for the purpose of provisioning for NPAs shall be taken 

as a value determined as per the prescribed valuation method.  

9.7.4.4 This can be explained by an illustration:  

a. Let  us  consider  that  interest  income  is  due  on  a  half  yearly  basis 

and  the  due  date  falls  on  30.06.2000  and  the  interest  is  not 

received  till  1st  quarter  after  due  date  i.e.  30.09.2000.  The 

provisioning will be done in the following phased manner:   

10% provision  01.01.2001 

20% provision  01.04.2001 
20% provision  01.07.2001 
25% provision  01.10.2001 
25% provision  01.01.2002 

6 months past due date of 
interest i.e. 3 months from the 
date of classification of asset 
as NPA (01.10.2000) 
  
  
  
  

b. Thus, one and half years past the due date of income or one year 

and three months from the date of classification of the ‘asset’ as an 

NPA, the ‘asset’ will be fully provided for. If any installment is fallen 

due, during the period of interest default, the amount of provision 

shall  be  the  installment  amount  or  above  provision  amount, 

whichever is higher.

9.7.5  Reclassification of assets 

9.7.5.1 Upon reclassification of assets as ‘performing assets’:  

a. In case a company has fully cleared all the arrears of interest, the 

interest provisions can be written back in full.  

b. The  asset  will  be  reclassified  as  performing  on  clearance  of  all 

interest  arrears and  if  the  debt is  regularly  serviced  over  the  next 

two quarters.  

c. In  case  the  company  has  fully  cleared  all  the  arrears  of  interest, 

the  interest  not  credited  on  accrual  basis  shall  be  credited  at  the 

time of receipt.  

d. The  provision  made  for  the  principal  amount  can  be  written  back 

in the following manner  
1. 100% of the asset provided for in the books will be written back 

at the end of the 2nd quarter where the provision of principal was 

made due to the interest defaults only.  

2. 50% of the asset provided for in the books will be written back at 

the  end  of  the  2nd  quarter  and  25%  after  every  subsequent 

quarter  where  both  installments  and  interest  payment  were  in 

default earlier.  

3. Explanation:  The  words  “2nd  quarter”  wherever  appear,  shall 

 

mean 2nd calendar quarter.203 

e. An  asset  is  reclassified  as  'standard  asset'  only  when  both,  the 

overdue  interest  and  overdue  installments  are  paid  in  full  and 

there  is  satisfactory  performance  for  a  subsequent  period  of  6 

months.

9.7.6  Receipt of past dues: 

9.7.6.1 When  the  Mutual  Fund  has  received  income/  principal  amount 

after their classifications as NPAs:  

a. For the next 2 quarters, income shall be recognized on cash basis 

and thereafter on accrual basis. The asset will be continued to be 

classified as NPA for these two quarters.  

b. During this period of two quarters although the asset is  classified 

as NPA no provision needs to be made for the principal if the same 

is not due and outstanding. 

c. If  part  payment  is  received  towards  principal,  the  asset  continues 

to  be  classified  as  NPA  and  provisions  are  continued  as  per  the 

norms set at 9.7.4 above any excess provision will be written back. 

9.7.7  Classification of Deep Discount Bonds as NPAs 

9.7.7.1 Investments in Deep Discount Bonds can be classified as NPAs, if 

any two of the following conditions are satisfied:  

a. If  the  rating  of  the  Bond  comes  down  to  Grade  ‘BB’  (or  its 

equivalent) or below  

b. If  the  company  is  defaulting  in  their  commitments  in  respect  of 

other assets, if available.  

c. Full Net worth erosion.  

9.7.7.2 Provision should be made as per the norms set at 9.7.4 above as 

soon as the asset is classified as NPA.  

9.7.7.3 Full provision can be made if the rating comes down to Grade ‘D’ 

(or its equivalent). 

9.7.8  Reschedulement of an asset 

9.7.8.1 In  case  a  company  defaults  in  payment  of  either  interest  or 

principal  amount  and  the  Mutual  Fund  has  accepted  a 

 95                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

rescheduling  of  the  schedule  of  payments,  then  the  following 

practice shall be adhered to:  

a. In case it is a first reschedulement and only payment of interest is 

in default, the classification of the asset as NPA shall be continued 

and  existing  provisions  shall  not  be  written  back.  This  practice 

shall be continued for two quarters of regular servicing of the debt. 

Thereafter, this be classified as ‘performing asset’ and the interest 

provided can be written back. 

b. If  the  reschedulement  is  done  due  to  default  in  interest  and 

principal amount, the asset shall continue as NPA for a period of 4

Investment in Unlisted Equity Shares205 

9.8.1  To  ensure  uniformity  in  calculation  of  NAV  the  following  guidelines 

are issued: 

9.8.1.1 Methodology for  Valuation  -  unlisted  equity  shares  of  a  company 

shall be valued "in good faith" as below:  

a. Based  on  the  latest  available  audited  balance  sheet,  Net  Worth 

shall be calculated as the lower of item (1) and (2) below:  

1. Net Worth per share = [Share Capital + Free Reserves (excluding 

revaluation reserves) - Miscellaneous expenditure not written off 

or  deferred  revenue  expenditure, 

intangible  assets  and 

accumulated losses] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

2. After taking into account the outstanding warrants and options, 

Net  Worth  per  share  shall  again  be  calculated  and  shall  be  = 

[Share  Capital  +  consideration  on  exercise  of  Option  and/or 

Warrants  received/receivable  by  the  Company  +  Free  Reserves 

(excluding  Revaluation  Reserves)  -  Miscellaneous  expenditure 

not written off or deferred revenue expenditure, intangible assets 

and  accumulated  losses]  /  Number  of  Paid  up  Shares  plus 

Number of Shares that would be obtained on conversion and/or 

exercise of Outstanding Warrants and Options.

3. The lower of (1) and (2) above shall be used for calculation of Net 

Worth per share and for further calculation in (c) below. 

b. Average capitalisation rate (P/E ratio) for the industry based upon 

either  BSE  or  NSE  data  (which  shall  be  followed  consistently  and 

changes,  if  any,  noted  with  proper  justification  thereof)  shall  be 

taken  and  discounted  by  75  per  cent.  i.e.  only  25  per  cent  of  the 

industry  average  P/E  shall  be  taken  as  capitalisation  rate  (P/E 

ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the  latest  audited  annual 

accounts will be considered for this purpose.  

c. The  value  as  per  the  Net  Worth  value  per  share  and  the  capital 

earning  value  calculated  as  above  shall  be  averaged  and  further 

discounted  by  15  per  cent  for  illiquidity  so  as  to  arrive at  the fair 

value per share. 

9.8.1.2 The above valuation methodology shall be subject to the following 

conditions:  

a. All calculations shall be based on audited accounts.  

b. If  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not  available  within 

nine months from the close of the year, unless the accounting year 

is changed, the shares of such companies shall be valued at zero.  

c. If  the  Net  Worth  of  the  company  is  negative,  the  share  would  be 

marked down to zero.  

d. In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken 

as zero for arriving at capitalised earning.  

e. 

In case an individual security accounts for more than 5 per cent of 

the  total  assets  of  the  scheme,  an  independent  valuer  shall  be 

appointed  for  the  valuation  of  the  said  security.  To  determine if  a 

security accounts for more than 5 per cent of the total assets of the 

 98                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  as 

mentioned above on the date of valuation.  

9.8.2  At the discretion of the AMCs and with the approval of the Trustees, 

unlisted equity shares may be valued at a price lower than the value 

derived using the aforesaid methodology.  

9.8.3  Due Diligence  

9.8.3.1 Mutual  Funds  shall  not  make  Investment  in  unlisted  equity 

shares  at  a  price  higher  than  the  price  obtained  by  using  the

issue.

following guidelines should be followed:  

 
11.2  These  guidelines are applicable to all  Mutual Fund schemes/plans which

11.2.1  Unlisted Scheme(s)/ Plan(s) 

11.2.1.1  The  Trustees  shall  decide  the  quantum  of  dividend  and  the 

record  date  in  their  meeting241.  Dividend  so  decided,  shall  be 

paid, subject to availability of distributable surplus. 

11.2.1.2  Record  date  shall  be  the  date  which  will  be  considered  for  the 

purpose of determining the eligibility of investors whose names 

appear  on  the  register  of  unit  holders  for  receiving  dividends. 

The NAV shall be adjusted to the extent of dividend distribution 

and statutory levy, if applicable, at the close of business hours 

on record date.

record date. The record date shall be five calendar days from the 

issue of public notice. 

 

11.2.1.4  Before  the  issue  of  such  notice,  no  communication  whatsoever 

indicating  the  probable  date  of  dividend  declaration  shall  be 

issued by any Mutual Fund or its distributors of its products. 

11.2.1.5  Such  notice  shall  be  given  in  at  least  one  English  daily 

newspaper  having  nationwide  circulation  as  well  as  in  a

pursuant to dividend distribution, NAV of the scheme would fall 

to the extent of payout and statutory levy (if applicable). 

11.2.2  Liquid / Debt Schemes with frequent dividend distribution 

11.2.2.1 The requirement of giving notice is not mandatory for scheme(s)/ 

plan(s)/  option(s)  with  dividend  distribution  frequency  ranging 

from  daily  up  to  monthly  distribution  if  requisite  disclosures  in 

this regard are made in the SID.

determining  distributable  surplus  and  accounting  the  sale  and 

repurchase  of  units  in  the  books  of the  Mutual  Fund.  The  format

disclosure of Unit Premium Reserve. 

11.3.2  Unit Premium Reserve, which is part of the sales price of units that 

is  not  attributable  to  realized  gains,  cannot  be  used  to  pay 

dividend. Therefore: 

11.3.2.1  When units of an open-ended scheme are sold, and sale price is 

higher  than  face  value  of  the  unit,  part  of  sale  proceeds  that 

represents  unrealised  gains  shall  be  credited  to  a  separate 

account (Unit Premium Reserve) and shall be treated at par with 

unit  capital  and  the  same  shall  not  be  utilized  for  the 

determination of distributable surplus.  

11.3.2.2  When units of an open-ended scheme are sold, and sale price is 

less than face value of the unit, the difference between the  sale 

price  and  face  value  shall  be  debited  to  distributable  reserves 

and  the  dividend  can  be  declared  only  when  distributable 

reserves  become  positive  after  adjusting  the  amount  debited  to 

reserves as per Regulations244.
