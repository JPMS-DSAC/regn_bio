BO(s). 
 
If the DIS booklet is lost / stolen / not traceable by the BO, then the BO 
shall immediately intimate the DP in writing about the loss.  On receipt of 
such intimation, the DP shall cancel the unused DIS of the said booklet. 
 

iv.  The DPs shall not issue more than 10 loose DIS to one accountholder in a 
financial  year  (April  to  March).  The  loose  DIS  can  be  issued  only  if  the

authorised DP official

v.  The  DP  shall  also  ensure  that  a  new  DIS  booklet  is  issued  only  on  the 
strength  of  the  DIS  instruction  request  slip  (contained  in  the  previous 
booklet) duly complete in all respects, unless the request for fresh booklet 
is due to loss, etc., as referred to in clause (c) above 
 

vi.  The DPs shall put in place appropriate checks and balances with regard to 

verification of signatures of the BOs while processing the DIS.  
 

vii.  The DPs shall  cross check with the BOs under exceptional circumstances 

before acting upon the DIS.

case  of  an  account  which  remained  inactive  i.e.,  where  no  debit 
transaction  had  taken  place  for  a  continuous  period  of  6  months, 
whenever all the ISIN balances in that account (irrespective of the number 
of  ISINs)  are  transferred  at  a  time.  However,  in  case  of  active  accounts, 
such verification may be made mandatory only if the BO account has 5 or 
more  ISINs  and  all  such  ISIN  balances  are  transferred  at  a  time.  The 
authorized official of the DP verifying such transactions with the BO, shall 
record the details of the process, date, time, etc., of the verification on the

e.  Pay-out  of  securities  shall  be  completed  by  the  Depositories  by  2:00 

p.m. on T+2. 

iii.  All instructions received by the  DPs shall have an execution date, which 
may be either a current date or a future date. Instructions shall be valid till 
the  pay-in  deadline  or  till  'end  of  day'  (EOD)  of  the  execution  date, 
whichever  is  earlier.  DPs  shall  ensure  that  the  validity  period  of 
instructions  is  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  client  while  accepting  the

Settlement of transactions in case of holidays52  

Due to lack of uniformity of holidays and force majeure conditions which 
necessitate sudden closure of one or more Stock Exchanges and banks in a 
particular state, result in situations where multiple settlements have to be 
completed  by  the  Stock  Exchanges  on  the  working  day  immediately 
following  the  day(s)  of  the  closure  of  the  banks.  Accordingly  the  Stock 
Exchanges/Depositories are advised to follow the guidelines and  adhere 
to the time line. 
 

i.  The Stock Exchanges shall clear and settle the trades on a sequential basis 
i.e.,  the  pay-in  and  the  pay-out  of  the  first  settlement  shall  be  completed 
before  the  commencement  of  the  pay-in  and  pay-out  of  the  subsequent 
settlement/s. 

ii.  The  cash/Securities  pay  out  from  the  first  settlement  shall  be  made 
available  to  the  member  for  meeting  his  pay-in  obligations  for  the 
subsequent settlement/s.  

iii.  Further,  in-order  to  meet  his  pay-in  obligations  for  the  subsequent 
settlement, the member may need to move securities from one depository 
to another. The Depositories shall, therefore, facilitate the inter-depository 
transfers within one hour and before pay-in for the subsequent settlement 
begins.  

iv.  The  Stock  Exchanges/Depositories  shall  follow  a  strict  time  schedule  to 

ensure that the settlements are completed on the same day.  

v.  The  Clearing  Corporation/Clearing  House  of  the  Stock  Exchanges  shall 
execute Auto DO facility for all the settlements together, so as to make the 
funds and the securities available with the member on the same day for all 
the settlements, thereby enabling the availability of the funds/securities at

Supervision of branches of DPs53 

 

i.  To  ensure  compliance  with  Regulation  46  of  the  SEBI  (Depositories  and 
Participants) Regulations, 1996, and Clause 19 of the Code of Conduct for 
Participants  contained  in  the  Third  Schedule  to  the  Regulations  the  DP 
shall  ensure  that  it  has  satisfactory  internal  control  procedure  in  place, 
inclusive  of  their  branch  offices.  DPs  are  therefore  required  in  terms  of 
these  provisions  to  put  in  place  appropriate  mechanisms  to  ensure  that 
their  branches  are  carrying  on  the  operations  in  compliance  with  the 
applicable regulations, bye-laws, etc. DPs are also required to put in place 
suitable  internal  control  systems  to  ensure  that  all  branches  exercise  due 
diligence  in  opening  accounts,  complying  with  KYC  requirements,  in 
ensuring systems safety in complying with client instructions, manner of 
uploading  client  instructions,  in  verifying  signatures  and  maintaining 
client  records,  etc.  DPs  shall  also  ensure  that  the  branches  are  suitably 
integrated.  
 

ii.  Depositories shall examine the adequacy of the above mechanisms during 
their  inspections  of  DPs.  The  Depositories  shall  also  carry  out  surprise 
inspections/ checks of the DP branches apart from the regular inspection 
of  the  DPs.  Depositories  shall  also  put  in  place  appropriate  mechanisms 
for monitoring opening of branches by DPs.  

Designated e-mail ID for regulatory communication with SEBI54  
 
Depositories  shall  create  a  designated  e-mail 
for  regulatory 
communication and inform it to SEBI. This e-mail id shall be exclusive and 
shall not be person-centric.

Section 4:  Other Communications to Depositories having Policy Implications 

Amendment in DP-BO Agreement57 
 
It is observed that one of the clause of the captioned agreement mentions that 
in case the client fails to make the payment of any amount as provided in the 
agreement,  the  DP  has  the  right  to  discontinue  the  depository  services  till 
such time he makes the payment along with interest.  
It  is  felt  that  continuity  of  depository  services  (like  sending  of  account 
statements etc.) may facilitate in payment of dues by BO to DP.  

i. 

ii. 

iii.  Depositories are therefore advised to modify all the relevant clauses including 
the aforementioned clause of the said agreement to state that DP after giving 
two days notice shall have a right to stop processing of instructions of BOs till 
such time he makes the payment along with the interest. 

iv.  This  modification  shall  also  be  made  applicable  to  all  the  DP-BO  agreement 

already signed.

ii. 

Activity of Demat of warehouse receipts58 
 
The aforesaid activity is not in compliance with Regulation 28 of SEBI (D&P) 
Regulations,  1996  and  therefore  depositories  cannot  carry  out  this  activity. 
Depositories are therefore advised to take suitable steps in this regard, either 
to hive-off or to discontinue the activity. 
 
Pledge of Shares through depository system59 
 
Section 12 of the Depositories Act and Regulation 58 of the SEBI (Depositories 
and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996  along  with  the  relevant  Bye  Laws  of  the 
Depositories  clearly  enumerate  the  manner  of  creating  pledge.  It  is  felt  that 
there is a need to communicate to the BOs that any procedure followed other 
than as specified under the aforesaid provisions of law shall not be treated as 
pledge. 
 
In  order  to  clarify  the  same,  the  depositories  are  advised  to  issue  a 
communiqué to the DPs advising them to inform BOs about the procedure for 
pledging of shares held in demat form as enumerated in the relevant sections 
of the Depositories Act and SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 
1996. Depositories may also advise DPs that an off-market transfer of shares 
leads  to  change  in  ownership  and  cannot  be  treated  as  pledge.  Further,  this 
issue may also  be taken up in the investor awareness programs wherein the

manner  of  creation  of  pledge  can  be  effectively  communicated  to  the  BOs 
directly. 
 
Transmission of shares60 
 
Pursuant to the discussions with the depositories on the recommendations of 
the  Committee  on  “Transmission  of  Shares”,  Depositories  were  advised  to 
ensure compliance with the following: 
 

4.4.1  In  cases  of  transmission  of  shares  of  a  deceased  security  holder,  where  the 
shareholding in the BO account of the deceased member, as calculated on the 
date  of  application  for  transmission,  is  within  the  threshold  limit  of  Rupees 
One lakh in value, the DPs shall not insist on additional documents other than 
any one or more of the documents mentioned below. 

 

i.  Affidavit – to the effect of the claim of legal ownership of the shares 
ii.  Deed of indemnity – indemnifying the depository and DP 
iii.  NOC  from  other  legal  heir(s),  wherever  applicable,  along  with  the  Claim 
Form/TRF  and  copy  of  death  certificate  duly  notarized/  attested  by  a 
Gazetted officer or Family Settlement Deed as an alternate to the NOC duly 
executed  by  all  the  legal  heirs  of  the  deceased  Beneficial  Owner,  provided 
that: 
a.  The  Family  Settlement  Deed  clearly  vests  the  securities  in  favour  of  the 

person seeking transmission in his/ her name. 

b.  Vesting of securities in favour of the person seeking transmission in his/ 
her  name  is  not  contingent  upon  any  other  onerous  conditions  in  such 
Family Settlement Deed. 

 

Note:  If  the  division  of  shares  as  per  the  Family  Settlement  Deed  is 
amongst  more  than  one  person,  then  the  Family  Settlement  Deed  can  be 
considered  as  an  NOC  for  transmission  of  shares  to  each  legal  heirs 
applying  for  transmission.  However,  if  DPs  still  have  problems  in 
comprehending  the  contents  of  the  Family  Settlement  Deed,  they  should 
refer the matter to Depositories for necessary advice on case-to-case basis. 

 

4.4.2  DP(s)  shall  automatically  open  new  account  in  the  name  of  the  surviving 
members(s), in the same order as in the original account, on an application by 
the  surviving  member(s)  based  on  existing  documents  required  as  per  the 
KYC  norms.  Submission  of  new  account  opening  form  shall  not  be  insisted 
upon.

4.4.3  A uniform time frame of 7 days, after receipt of all requisite documents, shall 

be prescribed for processing of Transmission requests. 
 

4.4.4  In  case  of  multiple  successors,  NOC  of  non-applicants  shall  be  recorded  on 
the  TRF  of  the  applicant  instead  of  insisting  separate  TRF  from  each  of  the 
successors. 
 

4.4.5  Nomination  facility  shall  be  encouraged  by  the  Depositories  specifically 
targeting BOs who have not opted for nomination. As regards new accounts, 
it shall be provided for at the account opening stage itself. In case the person 
(both an existing and new account holder) is not interested to nominate, then 
such person would have to give a positive declaration to that effect. 

SMS alerts for demat accounts operated by Power of Attorney61 
 
Subscription  to  SMS  Alert  facility  for  depository  accounts  operated  through 
Power  of  Attorney  (POA)  would  be  mandatory  except  in  case  of  accounts 
held by non-individuals, foreign nationals, and NRIs. 

Opening of demat account in case of HUF62 
 
It is noted that as per law, in case of HUF, shares can be held in the name of 
Existing  Karta  on  behalf  of  HUF.  Therefore,  HUF  demat  accounts  can  be 
opened in the name of Existing Karta but not in the name of Deceased Karta 
and HUF entity. 

i. 

Exemption  from  sending  quarterly  statements  of  transactions  by  depository 
participants  (DPs)  to  clients  in  respect  of  demat  accounts  with  no 
transactions and no security balances63 
 
SEBI  has  provided  exemption  to  Depository  Participants  from  sending 
quarterly  transaction  statements  to  the  clients  in  respect  of  demat  accounts 
with  no  transactions  and  no  security  balances  subject  to  the  following

c.  No Annual Maintenance Charges are levied for such an account.  
d.  Information which is required to be disseminated by Participants by way 
of  a  note  in  the  Transaction  Statements  will  be  required  to  be 
communicated to such Clients separately.  

e.  The  Internal  Auditor  of  the  Participant  shall  comment  in  its  internal 

audit report on compliance of the aforesaid requirements.  
 

ii. 

Further,  depository  may  like  to  consider  whether,  DPs  should  send  a 
consolidated Transaction Statements for the entire financial year in case of the 
BOs to whom quarterly Transaction Statements are not sent. 
 
Withdrawal by issuers from the depository64 
 

i.  As  regards  voluntary  withdrawal  by  issuers  from  the  depository,  it  is 
informed  that  listed  companies  may  not  be  allowed  to  withdraw  from  the 
depository system unless they delist their securities from the stock exchanges.  
 

ii.  As  regards  companies  under  liquidation  are  concerned,  it  is  informed  that 
deactivation  of  the  ISIN  may  be  only  done  in  cases  where  companies  have 
been  liquidated.  In  other  cases  where  companies  are  being  liquidated, 
deactivation of ISIN resulting in total freezing may not be desirable as  it will 
disallow investors to hold shares in dematerialized form 
 
Discontinuation      of    sending      transaction      statements      by      depository 
participants to clients65

SEBI allowed discontinuation of sending transaction statements by depository 
participants to clients subject to the following conditions: 
 

i.  Transaction  statements  were  returned  undelivered  on  three  consecutive 

occasions. 

ii.  The  depository  participant  (DP)  maintains  proof  that  the  transaction 

statements were returned undelivered. 

iii.  The transaction statements were returned undelivered for the reasons which 
clearly  establish  that  the  client  no  longer  resides  at  the  given  address  (i.e. 
party  shifted,  etc.)  and  not  for  other  reasons  (i.e.  residence/office  closed, 
address incorrect, address incomplete, etc.).

iv.  The  DP  informs  such  clients  through  alternative  means  (such  as  outbound 
call, SMS or email) that their transaction statements are returned undelivered 
and they need to communicate the proper (new) address. 

v.  The DP ensures that  on receipt of request for address modification from the 
client as per the stipulated procedure, the dispatch of transaction statements 
is  immediately  started.  Further,  the  DP  ensures  that  transaction  statements 
that  were  not  delivered  and  dispatched  due  to  discontinuation  are  also 
dispatched immediately without any additional cost to the clients.

Companies  Act  and  Companies  (Issue  of  Share  Capital  with  Differential 
Voting  Rights)  Rules,  2001,  separate  ISIN  may  be  allotted  to  differentiate 
such shares from ordinary shares. 

Updation of bank accounts details, MICR code and IFSC of bank branches by 
Depository Participants (DPs)67 

4.10. 

 

4.11. 

 

i.      Please   refer   to   SEBI   Circular   No.   SEBI/MRD/DEP/Cir- 3/06   dated 
February  21,  200641      whereby      depositories      were      advised      to      instruct   
Depository  Participants  (DPs)  to  update  the  MICR  code  and  bank  details  of 
the client in database of depositories. 

 

ii.       It  has  been  informed  by  RBI  that  they  have  been  receiving  complaints  from 
managers to the issues that the funds routed through the electronic mode are 
getting  returned  by  destination  banks  because  of  incorrect  or  old  account 
numbers provided by beneficiary account holders. 
 

iii.      RBI  has  stated  that  Investors  will  have  to  ensure  through  their  DPs  that 
bank  account  particulars  are  updated  in  master  record  periodically,  to 
ensure  that  their  refunds,  dividend  payments  etc.  reach  the  correct 
account,  without  loss  of  time.  RBI  has  also  suggested  incorporation  of 
Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) of customer's bank branches apart from 
9  digit  MICR  code;  since  IFSC  of  bank's  branches  is  used  for  remittance 
through National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT). 
 

 

iv.       It is advised that necessary action be taken in this matter to ensure that correct 
the  database  of 

investors  are  available

Establishment  of  connectivity  by  Clearing  House  /  Clearing  Corporation 
(CH/CC) with the Depository – Clarification68 

 

i.  On  examination  of  the  provisions  of  Regulations  19(a)  and  31  of  the  SEBI    

it 

is  advised  that 
(Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996, 
registration  of  a  CC/CH  of  a  stock  exchange  as  a  DP  with  SEBI  is  not 
mandatory  and  a  pre-requisite  for  it  to  obtain  connectivity  with  the 
depositories. However, if the CC/CH of a stock exchange desires to function 
as any other "Depository Participant", i.e. to open BO accounts for investors or 
clearing member account, registration as DP with SEBI is mandatory.  
 
In  view  of  the  above,  Depositories  are  advised  to  provide  continuous 
electronic  means  of  communication  /  connectivity  to  the  CH/CC  of  the 
Exchanges  without  insisting  for  a  mandatory  registration  as  DP  with  SEBI 
with  a  condition  that  such  entities  would  not  be  permitted  to  open  BO 
accounts for investors or clearing member account.

i.       For  the  purpose  of  computing  the  AVPS  of  the  beneficial  owners  held  in 
dematerialised  form  under  Regulation  19(a)(viii)  of  SEBI  (Depositories  and 
Participant)  Regulations,  1996,  the  securities  held  by  bank  and  financial 
institutions  as  well  as  promoters  holdings  of  a  company  held 
in 
dematerialised form, may be excluded69. 
 

ii.       In view of the potential risk to the system and also to maintain the integrity of 
the  market, the  depositories  are  advised  to develop  an  appropriate  systemic 
alert  in  the  depository  system,  so  as  to  enable  the  system  to  generate  and 
convey automatic alerts to those SBDPs that  reach a pre-determined level of 
exposure. These alerts would serve as forewarnings to the SBDPs  to the fact 
that  they  are  approaching  their  respective  maximum  exposure  limits.  [Note: 
For this purpose, the depositories may monitor the value of securities with its 
SBDPs on an "end of the day" basis.]70

under  section  16  of  the  SCRA  (unless  it  is  put  through  the  stock  exchange). 
The DP-BO agreement cannot add anything to or subtract anything from this 
position. However, it should be the responsibility of the DP to ensure that the 
client's contract is not rendered illegal on account of delayed execution of the 
delivery instruction. 

 

ii.       Keeping the hardships to change all the existing DP-BO agreements to enforce 
the above into consideration, it is advised that suitable bye laws can be made 
under section 26(2)(e) and (d)  of Depositories Act,   1996 for imposing   such   
obligation   on   the   DPs.   Therefore,   it is advised to amend/insert bye laws 
which  should  expressly  provide  that  the  DPs  shall  execute  the  non  pay-in 
related  instructions  on  the  same  day  or  on  the  next  day  of  the  instruction. 
Further, pending such amendment, suitable instructions may be issued to DPs 
to adhere to such time limit. 

 

 
 

 

iii.       The  above  clause  may  be  suitably  incorporated  in  the  DP-BO  agreement 

while opening new accounts.

Clarification  on  our  circular  no.  SMDRP/Policy/Cir-28/99  dated  August  23, 
199972. 
 

i.     Please refer to para 4 of the captioned circular which is reproduced below:- 

 
"In  cases  where  a  DP  has  already  sent  information  about  dematerialisation 
electronically to a Registrar but physical shares have not been received, the registrar 
will accept the demat request and carry out dematerialization on the indemnity given 
by the DP and proof of dispatch of document given by DP."  
 

4.16. 

ii.     It  is  clarified  that  the  above  provision  shall  be  applicable  to  all  the  securities 
like scrips, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other marketable securities 
eligible  to  be  held  in  dematerialised  form  in  a  depository  as  defined  in 
Regulation 28 of the SEBl (Depository and Participants) Regulations, 1996. 
 
Voting rights in respect of securities held in pool account73 
 
It  was  informed  that  the  corporate  benefits  availed  by  the  clearing  member, 
clearing  corporation  and  intermediaries  shall  be  held  in  trust  on  behalf  of 
beneficiary  owners.  Therefore,  the  clearing  member,  clearing  corporation  as 
well  as  the  intermediaries  cannot  have  voting  rights  in  respect  of  securities 
held in the pool account.

Operation of minor’s demat account74  
 
Under  [The]  Hindu  Minority  and  Guardianship  Act,  1956,  permission  of 
Court is required in the case of transfer by a natural guardian of immovable 
property  of  a  minor.    However,  shares  are  not  immovable  properly.  Section 
2(7)  of  Sale  of  Goods  Act,  1930  includes  shares  within  the  definition  of 
"goods''.   Neither the Indian Contract Act nor the Sale of Goods Act provide 
for  transfer  by  sale  or  otherwise  by  guardian  /natural  guardian  of 
goods/movable property in the name of minor to the effect that permission of 
court  is  required  in  the  matter  of  such  transfer.      In  the  case  of  accounts  of 
minor in banks also, the guardian is entitled to open, operate and even close 
the  account  also.      The  DP  account  can,  therefore,  be  operated  by  a  natural 
guardian  without  any  order  from  the  court  though  the  same  is  neither 
expressly permitted nor prohibited.
