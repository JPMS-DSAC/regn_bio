different  commodities'  contracts  and  even  in  the  case  of 
contracts of the same commodity.  
The Exchanges will ensure that the ratio between highest to 
lowest  transaction  charges  in  the  turnover  slab  of  any 
contract is not more than 2:1.6

2.3. Spot Price Polling Mechanism7 

2.3.1.  The  Commodity  Derivatives  Exchanges  have  been  using  a  ‘Spot 
Price  Polling  Mechanism’  to  arrive  at  the  prevailing  spot  prices. 
Transparent discovery of spot prices is a critical factor in smooth 
running of futures market as the same are used as reference prices 
for  settlement  of  contracts  traded  on  the  exchange  platform.  To 
arrive at the prevailing spot prices, the exchanges are polling the 
spot  prices  from  various  spot  price  polling  participants.  Some 
exchanges undertake this activity themselves whereas some have 
outsourced this work to an external agency. 

 
2.3.2. 

In order to maintain the transparency of spot price polling process 
and  dissemination  of  spot  prices  arrived  at  through  spot  price 
polling process, the commodity derivatives exchanges are directed

2.4. Criteria  for  Eligibility,  Retention  and  re-introduction  of  derivative 

contracts on Commodities8 

 

2.4.1.  The  Commodity  Derivatives  Advisory  Committee 

(CDAC), 
constituted  for  advising  SEBI  on  matters  concerning  effective 
regulation and development of the commodity derivatives market, 
on the above aspects had inter alia, recommended that: 

 

I. 

II. 

The commodities which are to be recommended by SEBI for 
notification  by  the  Government  or  on  which  the  exchange 
proposes to launch a contract should pass through some test 
based upon the objective parameters and upon satisfaction, 
should be allowed for trading.  
It  is  also  important  that  the  contracts available for  trading  in 
the  commodity  derivatives  market  are  liquid  enough  for  the 
contracts to trade smoothly. 

2.4.2.  Though it may not be practicable to keep a strict objective criteria 
which may be uniformly applied across all commodities for inclusion 
under derivatives, a broad framework can certainly be laid down. 
Thus, based on the recommendation of CDAC and in consultation 
with the stakeholders, it has been decided that the following criteria 
for eligibility, retention and re-introduction of derivative contracts on 
commodities shall be followed by all national commodity derivatives 
exchanges ('exchange'). 

 

2.4.3.  Eligibility criteria for allowing derivative contracts on commodities 

 

I.  Exchanges  shall  examine  following  basic  parameters  and 
the  commodity  may  be  permitted  to  be  included  under 
derivatives if such commodity satisfies these parameters. 

 

A.  Commodity Fundamentals 

 

i.  Size of the market / Volume of the market: The total 
supply value of the commodity in each year is taken 
as  a  measure  of  the  physical  market  size  of  that 
commodity in that year. A higher physical market size 
could  create  higher 
trading  volume  by 
attracting  more  hedgers  and  speculators  into  the 
futures market. 

futures 

ii.  Homogeneity/Standardization: 

commodity 
should  be  either  Homogeneous  or  should  be 
conducive to standardization. This is required so that 
participants  trading  the  commodity  on  exchange 

The

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

platform should be able to unambiguously understand 
exactly  what  they  are  trading  as  on  exchange  only 
standardized contracts can be traded. 

iii.  Durable / Storable: The commodity should be durable 
and storable for better price discovery. Durability i.e. 
higher  shelf  life  makes  commodity  conducive  for 
storage, which creates opportunity for cash and carry 
and hence would attract arbitragers thus make it more 
suitable for derivatives trading. 
 

B.  Trade Factors 

 

i.  Global:  Global  market  in  a  commodity  could  be  a 
positive indicator as internationally linked commodity 
prices  are  influenced  by  various  global  factors  and 
thus  create  multiple  reference  points 
for  price 
discovery  which  may  make 
for 
derivatives trading. 

it  conducive 

ii.  Value chain: The term ‘’value chain’’ describes the full 
range  of  value  adding  activities  required  to  bring  a 
product  or  service  through  the  different  phases  of 
production,  including  procurement  of  raw  materials 
and  other  inputs”,  connected  along  a  chain  of 
producing,  transforming  and  bringing  goods  and 
services to end-consumers through a sequenced set 
of activities and a strategic network among a number 
of business organizations”. Larger is the value chain 
larger would be the number of participants interested 
in derivatives trading of such commodity.  

iii.  Geographical  coverage:  The  commodity  should 
ideally have a vast distribution across the country. The 
coverage  can  be  in  the  form  of  production  of 
commodity or the distribution of the commodity across 
the  country.  Higher  coverage  would  attract  higher 
number of participants to the derivatives. 
 

C.  Ease-of- doing-business 

 

i.  Price  Control:  Price  controls  are  government 
mandated  minimum  or  maximum  prices  that  can  be 
charged for specified goods. Government sometimes 
implements  price  controls  when  prices  on  essential 
items, such as food grain or oil are rising rapidly. Such 
goods  which  are  prone  to  price  control  may  be  less 
conducive for derivatives markets 

ii.  Applicability  of  other 

laws:  The  Food  control 
Regulation Act, Essential commodities Act, APMC Act 

Page 18 of 217 

 
 

 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और वितिमय बोर्ड 

 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

etc.,  may  have  an  impact  on  the  commodities  to  be 
introduced for derivatives trading. Commodities which 
have excessive restrictions may be less conducive for 
derivatives markets. 
 

D.  Risk management 

 

i.  Correlation  with  International  Market:  Commodities 
which have a strong correlation with the global market 
have  higher  need  for  price  risk  management.  Such 
commodities are conducive for derivatives trading. 
Indian  commodity  sphere 

ii.  Seasonality:  The 

is 
characterized  by  seasonality.  The  prices  fluctuate 
with  the  supply  season  and  the  off  season.    The 
derivatives  market  is  necessary  to  even  out  this 
fluctuation and facilitate better price discovery. Thus 
the  commodities  with  higher  seasonality  are 
conducive for derivatives trading. 

iii.  Price  Volatility:    Commodities  with  high  volatility  of 
prices have high need for hedging. Such commodities 
are conducive for Derivatives trading. 
 

In  order  to  bring  in  uniformity  among  the  commodity 
derivatives exchanges, the indicative template as enclosed 
at  Annexure C shall be adopted by the exchanges. In this 
regard  the  exchanges  shall  decide  upon  the  specific 
numerical  weight  ages  as  approved  by  their  oversight 
committee for 'Product Design'. 
 
The  exchanges  shall  also  analyze  all 
the  proposed 
commodities/ commodity derivatives contracts on the afore-
said  parameters  comprised  in  the  template and  submit  the 
same  to  SEBI  while  applying  for  the  approvals  along  with 
necessary supporting documentary evidence. 

II. 

III. 

 

2.4.4.  Applicability  of  the  template  on  the  commodities  presently  being 

traded 

 

I.  As  regards  the  commodities  which  are  presently  being 
traded on the exchange platforms, the exchanges shall apply 
the afore-said parameters comprised in the template on each 
of the commodities. 
The results of such exercise is to be submitted to SEBI within 
a period of 3 months.

2.4.5.  Criteria  for  retention  and  reintroduction  of  derivative  contracts  on 

commodities 

 

I. 

For  any  commodity  to  continue  to  be  eligible  for  Futures 
trading on Exchange, it should have annual turnover of more 
than  Rs.500  Crore  across  all  National  Commodity 
Derivatives  Exchanges  in  at  least  one  of  the  last  three 
financial years. For validating this criteria, gestation period of 
three  years  is  provided  for  commodities  from  the  launch 
date/re-launch date, as may be applicable. 

III. 

II.  Once, a commodity becomes ineligible for derivatives trading 
due  to  not  satisfying  the  retention  criteria,  the  exchanges 
shall  not  reconsider  such  commodity  for  re-launching 
contract for a minimum period of one year.  
Further,  a  commodity  which  is  discontinued/suspended  by 
the exchange from derivatives trading on its platform, shall 
not  be  re-considered  by  the  concerned  exchange  for  re-
launching of derivatives contract on such commodity at least 
for a minimum period of one year.  
 

2.5. Unique Client Code (UCC) and Mandatory Requirement of Permanent 

Account Number (PAN)9 

2.5.1.

However, the investors residing in the State of Sikkim are exempted 
from the mandatory requirement of PAN. The exchanges should, 
however, ensure a system of proper verification to verify that such 
members / investors are residents of the State of Sikkim. 

 

Further,  PAN  may  not  be  insisted  in  the  case  of  Central 
Government, State Government, and the officials appointed by the

2.10. Position  Limits  for  Agricultural  and  Non- Agricultural  Commodity 

Derivatives/Hedgers 

 

2.10.1.  General Norms For Position Limits18 

 

 

The following norms shall be applicable to the Agricultural as well 
as Non- Agricultural commodity derivatives at commodity level: 

I.  Numerical  value  of  overall  client  level  open  position 
limits,  shall  be  applicable  for  each  commodity  as 
explained subsequently. 

II. 

III. 

IV. 

The  Exchanges,  however,  in  their  own  judgment,  may 
prescribe limits lower than what is prescribed by SEBI by 
giving advance notice to the market under intimation to 
SEBI. 

For  the  purpose  of  position  limits,  norms  applicable  on 
client  level  positions  shall  also  be  applicable  to  the 
proprietary  positions  of  trading  members  and  while 
calculating  member’s  open  positions,  his  proprietary 
positions  shall  be  treated  and  computed  like  a  client’s 
positions. 

For  the  purpose  of  calculating  overall  position  of  a 
member,  the  overall  position  of  its  all  clients  (as 
determined in Clause ‘2.10.2(I) or 2.10.3 (I)’below) shall 
be added without netting off among themselves as also 
against  proprietary  positions  of  the  member.  Thus,  all 
long  clients  and  all  short  clients  shall  be  added  up 
separately  and  higher  of  the  two  shall  be  reckoned  as 
Member’s open position in a commodity derivative. 

2.10.2.  Agricultural Commodity Derivatives19

added  up  separately  and  higher  of  the  two  shall  be 
considered as his overall open position. 

II. 

For  determination  of  numerical  value  of  overall  client  level 
open  position  limits,  following  framework  is  prescribed  for 
agricultural commodities20: 

A.  Categorization of commodities: In any given year, based 
on the average of production data and import data of past 
five years on a rolling basis and keeping in view  various 
extraneous factors that affect the trading in derivatives, the 
agricultural  commodities  shall  be  classified  into  three 
categories viz., sensitive, broad and narrow as below:- 

i.  Sensitive  commodity:  An  agricultural  commodity 

 
 

 

to 

shall be classified as a sensitive commodity if it: 
a.  is  prone 

frequent  Government/External 
interventions. These interventions may be in the 
nature  of  stock  limits, import/export  restrictions 
or any other trade related barriers; or 

b.  has  observed 

instances  of  price 
manipulation  in  past  five  years  of  derivatives 
trading 

frequent 

 

ii.  Broad Commodity: An agricultural  commodity shall 
be  classified  as  ‘Broad  Commodity’  if  it  is  not 
‘Sensitive  Commodity’  and  satisfies 
following 
criteria; 
a.  Average deliverable supply for past five year is 
at least 10 lakh Metric Ton (MT) in quantitative 
term and is at least INR 5,000 Crore in monetary 
term. 

 

iii.  Narrow  Commodity:    An  agricultural  commodity 
which  is  not  falling  in  either  of  the  above  two 
categories,  viz  ‘Sensitive’  or  ‘Broad’  commodity, 
shall be classified as ‘Narrow Commodity’ 

 

 

B.  Deliverable  Supply:  The  deliverable  supply  for  an 

agricultural commodity would be “Production + Imports” 

C.  Client Level Numeric Position Limits: Numerical Value 
of  overall  client  level  open  position  limits  for  each 
commodity  shall  be  calculated  from  'deliverable  supply'

The  numbers  arrived  based  upon  above  formula  should  be 
rounded off downward to appropriate number of zeroes. 

 

D.  Yearly  Categorization

and 

 
i.  All  the  national  commodity  derivatives  exchanges  shall 
jointly  classify  agricultural  commodities  into  the  afore-
stated  three  categories  on  annual  basis  as  per  the 
principles indicated at para No. II(A) above. 

 

ii.  Whenever an agricultural commodity of 'narrow' category 
is required  to be re-categorized to 'broad' in subsequent 
years,  such  re-categorization  may  be  possible  only  if 
both,  average deliverable supply of such commodity for 
the  past  five  years    and  monetary  value  thereof    as 
mentioned at Para ‘II(A)(ii)(a)’ exceeds by more than 5%. 

 

iii. 

For  determination  of  'deliverable  supply'  of  various 
agricultural  commodities  for  each  year,  the  national 
commodity derivatives exchanges shall take into account 
the  latest    production  figures  of  such  commodities  as 
annually  declared  by  relevant  government  sources  or 
from  the    latest  ‘third  advance  estimates’  of  agricultural 
commodities  published  by  the  Ministry  of  agriculture  or 
any  other  yearly  estimates/assessments  of  production 
and  imports  made  by  any  governmental  agencies  such 
as Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Textiles, Ministry of 
Commerce,  different  statutory  boards/associations  etc., 
concerned  with  different  agricultural  commodities.  The 
national commodity derivatives exchanges shall indicate 
the sources from which the production and import / export 
data have been obtained for the purpose of determination 
of 
supply’  of  different  agricultural 
commodities.

iv.  Every year, for each agricultural commodity that is being 
traded in the derivatives market, all national commodity 
derivatives exchanges shall jointly complete the exercise 
of determination of ‘deliverable supply, categorization/re-
categorization  of  commodities  and  computation  of 
numerical  value  of  position  limits.  Numerical  values  of 
position  limits  for  any  agricultural  commodity  shall  be 
revised only if the computation results in a revision in the 
value by at least 5% compared to previous year's limits. 
Exchanges  shall,  after  prior  intimation  to  SEBI,  notify 
such  details  to  the  market  through  their  respective 
websites sufficiently in advance and latest by 31st of July

limit or 15% of the market-wide open interest, whichever is 
higher. 

IV.  Near  Month  Position  Limits  :  In  case  of  near  month 

contracts: 

A.  Client  level  position  limits  shall  be  equivalent  to  the  one 
fourth of the overall Client level position limit as prescribed 
in II under 2.10.2 above. 

B.  Member level position limits shall also be equivalent to the 

one fourth of the overall member level position limit. 

C.  For calculating near month open position of a client, higher 
of  long  and  short  positions  of  the  client  in  near  month

contracts to be considered. Thus, netting out near month 
contract  with  off-setting  positions  in far  months  contracts 
shall  not  be  permitted  for  the  purpose  of  computation  of 
near month position of any client.22  

D.  For calculating near month open position of a member, the 
position of the clients as determined in IV (C) above will be 
added  without  netting  off  among  themselves  as  also 
against proprietary position of the member (which will also 
be treated like a client position). All longs and shorts will 
be  added  up  separately  and  higher  of  the  two  will  be 
reckoned.23 

V.  Exchange-wide  Position  Limit 

for  Agricultural 
Commodities:  The  overall  Exchange-wide  gross  position 
limit on open interests shall be 50% of its ‘deliverable supply’ 
determined for the relevant year, which shall also be jointly 
notified  by  Exchanges  along  with  client  level  numerical 
limits.24  

2.10.3.  Non-Agricultural Commodity Derivatives25 

 

The  following  norms  shall  be  applicable  to  Non-  Agricultural

2.17.1.  Any order that is generated using automated execution logic shall 

be known as algorithmic trading. 
 

2.17.2.  The  commodity  exchanges  shall  have  arrangements,  procedures 
and system capability to manage the load on their systems in such 
a  manner  so  as  to  achieve  consistent  response  time  to  all 
members.  The  capacity  of  the  trading  system  of  the  Exchange 
should be at least four times the peak order load encountered and 
the Exchange system should be upgraded on a regular basis. The 
exchange shall continuously study the performance of its systems 
and,  if  necessary,  undertake  system  upgrade,  including  periodic 
upgrade of its surveillance system, in order to keep pace with the 
speed  of  trade  and  volume  of  data  that  may  arise  through 
algorithmic trading.    
 

2.17.3.  While  approving  the  algorithmic  trading,  the  Exchanges  shall 

ensure that: 

 

I. 

II. 

III. 

IV. 

There is clear classification of algorithmic orders in terms of 
CTCL terminal code/ATS User ID approved by the Exchange 
for algorithmic trading. 
 
The orders of clients are routed through member server only 
and  client  orders  are  not  placed  directly  to  the  Exchange 
System. 

The Exchanges shall not approve algorithms that may not be 
conducive to efficient price discovery or fair play. 
 
The  Exchange  shall  subject  the  systems  of the  members  to 
initial  conformance

that 

V. 

Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) orders shall not be allowed to be 
placed using algorithmic trading. 

VI. 

The algorithms which will ‘take liquidity’ away from the market 
shall not be approved. While approving algorithmic strategies, 
Exchanges shall record the reason as to why such strategy is 
allowed  and  how  it  will  induct  more  liquidity  in  the  contract 
system. Exchanges shall also make half yearly review of effect

of the approved strategies on liquidity and would discontinue / 
disapprove any strategy which fails to induct liquidity. 
 

2.17.4.  As  mini  and  micro  contracts  are 

towards  small 
participants,  while  allowing  algorithmic  trading  in  mini  and  micro 
contracts Exchange should exercise caution and permit algorithmic 
trading  only  after  taking  into  account  liquidity  in  the  contract  and 
ascertaining that it will not put small participants in disadvantage.

puts  some  members  in  disadvantageous  position  vis-à-vis  other 
members  shall  not  be  allowed.  Algorithmic  trading  shall  not  be 
permitted from Exchange hosted CTCL terminals. 
 

2.17.6.  In order to ensure orderly trading in the market and fair usage of 
the  trading  platform  by  all  the  members,  Exchanges  shall  put  in 
place  the  following  economic  disincentives  for  daily  algorithmic 
order–to–trade ratio:

In case the ratio is 500 or more than 500 during a trading  day, 
the  concerned  member  shall  not    be  permitted  to  place  any  
order for the first  15 minutes on the next trading day (in the 
continuous trading session) as  a cooling  off action . However, 
the  trading  member  shall be  permitted  to enter transaction  
in risk  reducing  mode during  such a cooling  off period. 
For the purpose of calculation of daily Order-to-trade ratio, all 
algorithmic  orders,  i.e.  order  entry,  order  modifications  and 
order cancellation shall be considered. 
The algorithmic  orders  entered  and /or  modified  within 1 % 
of the last traded price (LTP) of the respective  contract  shall 
not be  included  in the calculation  of the Order-to-Trade ratio 
for the purpose  of arriving at the penalty for higher order-to-
trade  ratio. 
The  penalty  structure  will  be  applicable  for  only  those 
members who have placed 10,000 orders or more in a day. 
The exchange shall put in place monitoring systems to identify 
and  initiate  measures  to  impede  any  possible  instances  of 
order flooding by algorithmic trading.

Chapter 3. Warehousing Norms for Agriculture and Agri-processed 

Commodities45 

 
 

 

Warehousing  infrastructure  and  its  ancillary  services  play  a  critical  role  in  the 
delivery  mechanism  of  the  Commodity  Derivatives  Market.  A  robust  &  credible 
warehousing infrastructure is sine qua non for an effective Commodity Derivatives 
Market  that  can  inspire  confidence  amongst  the  market  participants  and  other 
stakeholders. It is therefore, incumbent upon the commodity derivatives exchanges 
to  have  in  place  comprehensive  framework  of  norms  for  adherence  by  the 
Warehouse  Service  Providers  (WSP),  warehouse,  assayers  and  other  allied 
service  providers  engaged  by  them  so  as  to  exercise  a  robust  mechanism,  for 
ensuring good delivery as mandated under the SECC Regulations. The national 
commodity  derivatives  exchanges  shall  frame  guidelines  in  accordance  with  the 
following norms for their accredited WSPs, warehouses, assayers etc. 

At  the  outset,  it  is  clarified  that  the  norms  prescribed  herein  are  the  minimum 
requirements/standards  for  compliance  by  the  exchange  accredited  WSPs, 
warehouses  and  assayers  and  are  to  be  complied  with  in  addition  to  those  laid 
down by Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA), any other 
government authority from time to time.  The Exchanges are at liberty to prescribe 
additional norms/guidelines for compliance by their accredited WSPs, warehouses 
and assayers, if they deem so fit, in addition to the norms laid down hereunder, for 
ensuring  good  delivery  of  commodities  by  them.  Provided  that  such  additional 
norms  specified  by  the  exchanges  are  not  in  contravention  with  the  instruction 
issued herein.

being/to be followed for such accreditation shall be displayed on the 
website of the Exchange in advance. The accreditation of the WSP 
shall be done with the approval of the Risk Management Committee 
of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Exchange.  The  exchange  shall 
ensure that the application of the WSP/warehouses are processed 
within a stipulated time frame. 
 

3.1.2.  A WSP can be accredited with more than one exchange. In such 
case,  no  exchange  shall  mandate  that  its  WSP  cannot  provide 
services  to  another  exchange.  However,  it  shall  be  ensured  that 
same warehouse may not be shared by more than one Exchange.

4.1.3.  Commodity Futures 

 

I. 

Initial Margins (IM)51 
 
Exchanges  shall  impose  initial  margins  sufficient  to  cover  its 
potential future exposure to participants in the interval between 
the last margin collection and the close out of positions following 
a  participant  default.  Exchanges  shall  therefore  estimate 
appropriate  Margin  Period  of  Risk  (MPOR)  for  each  product 
based  on  liquidity  in  the  product.  However,  the  MPOR  for  all 
commodity derivatives contracts shall be at least 2 days.  

A.  Minimum  value  for  Initial  Margin:  Minimum  value  of  initial 
margin would be subject to commodity specific floor value as 
may  be  specified  by  SEBI  from  time  to  time.  Currently  floor 
value of IM applicable for Nickel shall be 5% and for all other 
commodities it shall be 4%. 

B.  Margin Computation at client portfolio level: Margins shall 
be computed at the level of portfolio of each individual client 
comprising  his  positions  in futures  contracts  across  different 
maturities.  For  Trading/Clearing  Member 
level  margins 
computation,  margins  would  be  grossed  across  various 
clients. The proprietary positions of the Trading Member would 
also be treated as that of a client for margin computation.   

C.  Spread margin benefit: – 

 

i.  Spread benefit in initial margin shall be permitted in the 

following cases:  
 

a)  Different expiry date contracts of the same underlying  

 

b)  Two  contracts  variants  having  the  same  underlying 

commodity 
 

c)  Futures  contracts  in  a  commodity  complex  provided 

the conditions in para ii below are met52. 

ii.  Exchanges may provide spread benefit in initial margin 
across  futures  contracts  in  a  commodity  complex 
provided the following conditions are met: 
 
a)  Minimum  coefficient  of  correlation  (r)  between 

futures prices of the two commodities is 0.90.

b)  Back testing for adequacy of spread margin to cover 
MTM has been carried out for a minimum period of 
one year (back testing for at least 250 days wherein 
daily  settlement  price  of  futures  used  for  back 
testing have been determined from traded futures 
prices). 

c)  Initial margin after spread benefit has been able to 
cover MTM on at least 99% of the days as per back 
testing. 

iii.  Maximum benefit in initial margin on spread positions 
indicated in para [i – (a) and (b)] is restricted to 75%. 
Maximum benefit in initial margin on spread positions 
indicated in para [i – (c)] is restricted to 50%. 

iv. 

v. 

vi. 

vii. 

In case of spread positions additional margins shall not 
be  levied.  No  benefit  in  ELM  would  be  provided  for 
spread  positions  i.e.  ELM  shall  be  charged  on  both 
individual legs. Exchanges are free to charge margins 
higher  than  the  minimum  specified  depending  upon 
their risk perception. 

53Margin  benefit  on  spread  positions  shall  be  entirely 
withdrawn latest by the start of tender period or start of 
expiry day, whichever is earlier. 

To be eligible for initial margin benefit, each individual 
contract in the spread shall be from amongst the first 
three expiring contracts. 

54While  providing  spread  benefit  across 
futures 
contracts  in  a  commodity  complex,  exchanges  shall 
continuously monitor dynamics of the commodities and 
their  correlation  and  if  there  are  changes  such  that 
spread  margin  benefit  is  no  longer  appropriate  to  be 
given, shall take appropriate further course of action. 
 

D.  Real Time Computation: The margins should be computed 
on real time basis. The computation of portfolio initial margin 
would have two components. The first is the computation of 
initial margin for each individual contract. At the second stage, 
these  contract  initial  margins  would  be  applied  to  the  actual 
portfolio positions to compute the portfolio initial margin. The 
exchanges are permitted to update EWMA volatility estimates 
for contracts at discrete time points each day (with a gap of

not more than 2 hours between any two consecutive updates 
and at the end of the trading session) and the latest available 
scaled  up  WMA  volatility  estimates  would  be  applied  to 
member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 

 

II.  Extreme  Loss  Margin  (ELM):  ELM  of  1%  on  gross  open 
positions shall be levied and shall be deducted from the liquid 
assets of the clearing member on an online, real time basis.  

III.  Additional  Margins:  Exchanges  may  levy  Additional  Margins 
based  on  their  evaluation  in  specific  situations  as  may  be 
necessary. 

IV. 

Tender  Period  Margin:  Exchanges  shall 
levy  Tender 
period/Pre-expiry  margin  which  shall  be  increased  gradually 
every  day  beginning  from  the  pre-determined  number  of  days 
before the expiry of the contract as applicable. Exchanges shall 
determine the quantum of tender period margin as appropriate 
based on the risk characteristics of the particular commodity. 

V.  Delivery  Period  Margin55: Appropriate  delivery  period margin 
shall  be  levied  by  Exchanges  on  the  long  and  short  positions 
marked for delivery till the pay-in is completed by the member. 
Once  delivery  period  margin  is  levied,  all  other  applicable 
margins may be released.  

However, delivery period margins shall be higher of: 
 

A.  3% + 5 day 99% VaR of spot price volatility  

Or  

B.  20%  

Or 

C.  Applicable delivery period margins as on September 01, 2016 

Exchanges may impose higher margins if deemed fit. 
 

VI.  Mark  to  Market  (MTM)  Settlement:  All  open  positions  of  a 
futures contract would be settled daily, only in cash, based on 
the Daily Settlement Price (DSP). DSP shall be reckoned and 
disseminated by the Exchange at the end of every trading day. 
The  mark  to market  gains  and  losses  shall  be  settled  in  cash 
before  the  start  of  trading  on  T+1  day.  If  mark  to  market 
obligations  are  not  collected  before  start  of  the  next  day’s 
trading, the exchange shall collect correspondingly higher initial 
margin (scaling up by a factor of square root of two) to cover the

potential  losses  over  the  time  elapsed  in  the  collection  of 
margins.  
 

4.1.4.  Options on commodity futures56 

 
Exchanges shall adopt risk management framework compliant with the 
CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, including 
the following: 

I.  Margining    model    and    quantum    of    initial    margins:  
Exchanges  shall adopt  initial  margin  models  and  parameters  
that    are    risk-based    and  generate      margin      requirements   
sufficient      to      cover      potential      future  exposure    to  
participants/clients  in  the  interval  between  the  last  margin 
collection    and    the    close    out    of    positions    following    a  
participant/client default. The model should : 
 

A.  use a conservative estimate of the time horizons for close out 

of the positions (including in stressed market conditions), 
 

B.  have  an  appropriate  method  for  measuring  credit  exposure  
that accounts for relevant risk factors and portfolio effects, and 

 

 

C.  to   the   extent   practicable   and   prudent,   limit the   need  

for destabilizing, pro-cyclical changes. 
 

Initial margin requirement shall be adequate to cover 99% VaR 
(Value  at  Risk)  and  Margin  Period  of  Risk  (MPOR)  shall  be  at 
least  two  days.  In  case  of  portfolio  based  margining,  this 
requirement  applies  to  each  portfolio’s  distribution  of  future 
exposure. 
  
Accordingly,  exchanges  shall  fix  prudent  price  scan  range, 
volatility  scan  range  and/or  plausible  changes  in  any  other 
parameters  impacting  options  price.  Exchange  shall  impose 
appropriate  short  option  minimum  margin,  calendar  spread 
charge and extreme loss margin for option contracts. 

 

II.  Margining  at  client  level:  Exchanges  shall  impose  initial 
margins at the level of portfolio of individual client comprising of 
his  positions  in  futures  and  options  contracts  on  each 
commodity.

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

III.  Real  time  computation:  Though  the  margining  models  may  
update  various  scenarios  of  parameter  changes  (underlying 
price, volatility etc.) at  discrete  time  points  each  day  (at  least  
every  two  hours),  the  latest Page 4 of 4 available  scenarios  
shall  be  applied  to  client  portfolios  on  a  real  time basis. 

IV.  Mark to market:  Exchanges shall mark to market the options 
positions  by  deducting/adding  the  current  market  value  of 
options  (positive  for  long  options    and    negative    for    short  
options)    times    the    number    of    long/short  options    in    the  
portfolio    from/to    the    margin    requirement.    Thus,    mark    to 
market  gains  and  losses would  not  be  settled  in  cash  for  
options positions. 
 

V.  Risks  pertaining  to  options  that  devolve  into  futures  on 

expiry: 

A.  For  handling  increase  in  margins  on  expiry  when  options 
devolve  into  futures  position,  specifically  for  long  option 
positions which are probable  to  be  exercised,  exchanges  
shall  start  sensitizing  the option  holders  of  the  impending  
increase  in  margins  (along  with the  estimated  increase)  
at  least  few  days  in  advance,  and/or, based  on  their  risk  
perception,    may    also    consider    gradually  collecting 
increased  margins  during  the  last  few  days  so  as  to  have 
adequate  margins  to  cover  the  risk  of  futures  position  that 
will be created on devolvement of options into futures. 

B.  As per the provisions given in 4.1.14 below, penalty is levied 
on  members  for  short-collection/non-collection  of  the  initial 
margins. Penalty for such short-collection/non-collection due 
to increase in initial margins resulting from devolvement of 
options into futures may not be levied by Exchanges for the 
first day. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

4.1.5.  Concentration Margins57 

Exchanges  shall  impose  adequate  concentration  margins  (only  on 
concentrated positions) to cover the risk of longer period required for 
liquidation of concentrated positions in any commodity. The threshold 
value for imposing concentration margin may be determined taking into 
account  factors  including  open  interest,  concentration  and  estimated 
time to liquidation based on prevailing liquidity and possible reduction

in liquidity in times of market stress etc. The quantum of concentration 
margins imposed may vary based on the level of concentration. 

 

4.1.6.  Additional Ad-hoc Margins 

 

Exchanges  have  the  right  to  impose  additional  risk  containment 
measures  over  and  above  the  risk  containment  system  mandated  by 
SEBI. However, the Exchanges should keep the following three factors 
in mind while taking such action:  
 

A.   Additional  risk  management  measures  (like  ad-hoc  margins) 
would normally be required only to deal with circumstances that 
cannot be anticipated or were not anticipated while designing the 
risk management system. If ad-hoc margins are imposed with any 
degree  of  regularity,  exchanges  should  examine  whether  the 
circumstances that give rise to such margins can be reasonably 
anticipated  and  can  therefore  be  incorporated  into  the  risk 
management  system  mandated  by  SEBI.  Exchanges  are 
encouraged  to  analyse  these  situations  and  bring  the  matter  to 
the attention of SEBI for further action.  

 

  

B.  Any additional margins that the exchanges may impose shall be 
based  on  objective  criteria  and  shall  not  discriminate  between 
members on the basis of subjective criteria.  

C.  Transparency is an important regulatory goal and therefore every 
effort must be made to make the risk management systems fully 
transparent by disclosing their details to the public.  

 
4.1.7.  Margin Provisions for Intra-day crystallized losses:58 

 
To  mitigate  the  risk  arising  out  of  accumulation  of  crystallized 
obligations incurred on account of intra-day squaring off of positions, 
the following has been decided: 

 

A.  The intra-day  crystallized  losses  shall  be  monitored  and  
blocked  by Clearing Corporations  from  the  free collateral 
on  a  real-time  basis only  for  those transactions   which   
are   subject   to   upfront   margining.   For   this purpose, 
crystallised losses can be offset against crystallised profits 
at a client level, if any.

4.1.13.     Regaining matched book 

In  the  event  of  a  member/client  failing  to  honor  pay-in/margin 
obligations, exchanges may employ the below given alternative tools 
to  liquidate  the  positions  and  regain  a  matched  book  based  on  the 
conditions of market liquidity, volatility, size of position to be liquidated 
etc. Any tool lower in the list prescribed hereunder may be resorted to 
only  in  extremely  rare  occasions  when  the  exchange  reasonably

writing:  

I.  Alternative  1:  Liquidation  in  normal  market  in  orderly  manner

The penalty structure and framework for short-collection/non-collection 
of margins by members from their clients shall be as under:  

I. 

II. 

The ‘margins’ for this purpose shall mean initial margin, extreme 
loss margin (ELM), mark to market margin, special / additional 
margin,  delivery  margin  or  any  other  margin  as  prescribed  by 
the Exchange to be collected by member from their clients.  

The members are required to collect upfront initial margins and 
extreme  loss  margins64  from  their  clients.  The  members  will 
have time till ‘T+2’ working days to collect margins (except initial 
margins  and  extreme  loss  margins)  from  their  clients.  (The 
clients  must  ensure  that  the  initial  margins  and  extreme  loss 
margins are paid in advance of trade and other margins are paid 
as soon as margin calls are made by Exchanges/Members. The 
period  of  T+2  days  has  been  allowed  to  members  to  collect 
margin from clients taking into account the practical difficulties 
often faced by them only for the purpose of levy of penalty and 
it should not be construed that clients have been allowed 2 days 
to pay margin due from them.) 

III. 

The  members  shall  report  to  the  Exchange  on  T  +  5  day  the 
actual short-collection/non-collection of all margins from clients.  

IV.  Penalty  shall  be  levied  as  per  the  details  given  below  on  the 
members for short / non-collection of margins from their clients 
beyond T + 2 working days:  

For each member  

 

‘a’  

Per day penalty as % of ‘a’  

(<  INR  1  lakh)  and  (<  10%  of 
applicable margin)  

0.5  

(>=  INR  1  lakh)  or  (>=  10%  of 
applicable margin)  

1.0  

 
 

 

 

Where a = short-collection / non-collection of margins per client per day  
 

V. 

In case of short-collection /non collection of initial margins and 
extreme  loss  margins,  the  above  penalty  structure  would  be 
applicable from T day.

VI. 

The  Exchanges  should  put  in  place  a  suitable  mechanism  to 
enable the members to report the collection of all margins from 
their clients at the end of each trading day and to report short 
collection/non-collection of all margins on the T+5 day.  

VII.  All  instances  of  non-reporting  shall  amount  to  100%  non-
collection of margin and the penalty as prescribed above shall 
be charged on these instances in respect of non-collection.  

VIII. 

The penalty shall be collected by the Exchanges not later than 
five days of the last working day of the trading month.   

IX.  With respect to repeated defaulters, who default 3 times or more 
during a month, the penalty would be 5% of the shortfall in such 
instances.  (Every  short/non  collection  of  margin  is  to  be 
considered as one instance of default. In case margin shortage 
is reported for a client 3 times or more during a month, i.e., either 
in consecutive instances or in 3 different instances, the penalty 
would be 5% of the shortfall from 4th instance of shortfall. E.g. 
shortage  is  reported for  a  client on 1st and 2nd day  of month 
consecutively;  thereafter  again  on  10th  day  shortage  is 
reported. So the number of instances are 3 and in case shortage 
is reported on any day later in the month, the penalty shall be 
5%  of  the  shortfall  amount  for  all  such  instances  beyond  3rd 
instance.)  

X.  All the penalties collected as prescribed above shall be credited 

to the Investor Protection Fund.  

XI.  Report on the penalties as collected by the Exchanges shall be 

submitted to SEBI by the 10th day of the following month.  

XII.  Exchanges shall examine implementation of these instructions 
during  the  inspection  of  its  members.  If  during  inspection  or 
otherwise, incorrect reporting on collection of margin from client 
by member is found, the member shall be penalized up to 100% 
of such amount short collected.  

XIII. 

The  Exchange  shall  direct  their  members to monitor  trades of 
every client. Suitable mechanism may be put in place to intimate 
the  clients  as  and  when  the  margins  are  used  up  to  an 
appropriate level as considered fit.  

XIV. 

In exceptional situations wherein members and/or clients were 
not in position to square off the open positions to avoid levy of 
penalty  for  margin  shortfall  due  to  lack  of  adequate  liquidity

and/or  high  market  volatility,  exchanges  may  take  a  suitable 
decision  depending  upon  the  merit  of  the  circumstances  and 
keep  SEBI  informed  of  the  same.  Further,  the  exchanges  are 
directed  to  take  such  exceptional  matters  to  their  Board  of 
Directors for decision.

6.1.1.  Staggered delivery  

In all futures contracts for which staggered delivery is mandated, the 
framework shall be as given below:   

I. 

The  tender  period  shall  start  with  onset  of  the  applicable 
staggered  delivery  period.  In  case  the  day  happens  to  be  a 
Saturday, Sunday or exchange holiday, the tender period shall 
start from the next working day.  

II.  Seller/buyer  shall  have  an  option  of  marking  an  intention  of 
giving/taking  delivery  on  any  day  from  start  of  the  tender 
period up to expiry of the contract.   

III.  Exchange shall allocate delivery to buyers having open long 
position as per random allocation methodology to ensure that 
all  buyers  have  an  equal  opportunity  of  being  selected  to 
receive delivery irrespective of the size or value of the position. 
However,  preference  may  be  given  to  buyers  who  have 
marked an intention of taking delivery.  
If the tender date is T, then pay-in and pay-out shall happen 
latest by T+2th working day.  

IV. 

 

V.  Open  position  on  expiry  of  the  contract  would  result  in 
compulsory delivery and would be settled at Final Settlement 
Price (FSP) of the respective contracts and pay-in and pay-out 
shall happen latest by the 2nd working day after expiry. 

 

6.1.2.  Early delivery system  

In all futures contracts for which early delivery system is mandated, 
the framework shall be as given below:  

I.  An early delivery period may be provided during E-14 to E-1 
days  (where  E  stands  for  expiry  day)  of  the  contract  during 
which buyers/sellers can give intention to take/give delivery. If 
the intentions of the buyers/sellers match, then the respective 
positions will be closed out by physical deliveries. The process 
of pay in and pay-out will be completed on T + 2 basis, where 
'T' stands for the day on which matching has been done.

extinguished  at  the  close  of  E-1  day.  The  intentions  can  be 
withdrawn  during  the  course  of  E-14  to  E-1  day  if  they 
remained unmatched. 

In  respect  of  delivery  defaults  after  the  matching  of  delivery

be settled by delivery and all the penalty provisions for delivery 
default  applicable  in  the  compulsory  delivery  contracts  shall 
apply. 

 
6.1.3.  Early pay-in facility  

 

 

I.  Exchanges  shall  provide  early  pay-in 

facility 

to  market 
participants  permitting  market  participants  to  deposit  certified 
goods to the Exchange accredited warehouse against relevant 
futures  contracts  sold.  For  such  short  positions  against  which 
early  pay-in  has  been  made,  based  on  risk  perception, 
exchanges  may  exempt  imposition  of  all  types  of  margins. 
However,  Exchanges  shall  continue  to  collect  mark  to  market 
margins from such market participants against such positions.  

  
II. 

In  case  of  compulsory  delivery  and  seller’s  option  contracts, 
delivery  to  the  extent  of  open  position  at  the  expiry  of  the 
contract shall be mandatory after claiming early pay-in facility on 
the position. The exchanges should provide for extremely strict 
penalties  including  disciplinary  actions  against  such  members 
who fail to do so. 

6.1.4.  Penalty on delivery default 

 

I.  Penalty on seller in case of delivery default (default in delivery

contracts,  default  in  delivery  after  giving  intention  for  delivery) 
shall be as follows:

average price so determined is higher than Settlement Price, 
else this component will be zero.)

B.  Futures  contracts  on  non-agri  commodities:  3%  of

price  so  arrived  is  higher  than  Settlement  Price,  else  this

Exchange towards administration expenses  

C.  1% of Settlement Price + replacement cost shall go to buyer 

who was entitled to receive delivery  

IV.  Exchange  shall  have  appropriate  deterrent  mechanism 
in  place  against

6.1.5.  Fixation of Final Settlement Price (FSP)  

 
I. 

 

For contracts where Final Settlement Price (FSP) is determined 
by polling, unless specifically approved otherwise, the FSP shall 
be arrived at by taking the simple average of the last polled spot 
prices of the last three trading days viz., E0 (expiry day), E-1 and 
E-2. In the event the spot price for any one or both of E1 and E-
2 is not available; the simple average of the last polled spot price 
of E0, E-1, E-2 and E-3, whichever available, shall be taken as 
FSP. Thus, the FSP under various scenarios of non-availability 
of polled spot prices shall be as under

further course of action for determining FSP in consultation with 
SEBI. 

 
 

 

 

6.1.6.  Change in expiry date  

 

I.  Exchange may advance expiry date of running contract in case 
physical  market  is  closed  in  the  notified  basis  centre  on  the 
expiry  day  of  the  contract,  due  to  festivals,  strikes,  erratic 
weather conditions, etc. 
  

II.  Decision  about  advancing  expiry  of  running  contract  shall  be 
intimated  to  the  trade  participants  at  least  10  days  before  the 
revised  expiry  date.  The  delivery  period  may  be  advanced 
accordingly for contract having staggered delivery. The FSP of 
such contract shall be fixed as per the above procedure (para 
6.1.5 above). 

 

6.2.   Criteria for Settlement Mode of Commodity Derivative Contracts69 

The following broad guidelines are being specified for deciding appropriate 
settlement mode for commodity derivatives contracts: 

6.2.1.  The first preference of settlement type shall always be by the way 

of physical delivery. 

 

6.2.2.  Any exemption from the above i.e. cash settlement of commodity 
derivatives contract, may be considered only in following scenarios 
with a proper justification – 

 

I.  Physical  delivery  is  difficult  to  implement  due  to  any  reason, 

which may inter-alia include the following: 

 

A.  commodity is intangible; or

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

B.  commodity is difficult to store may be due to low shelf life or 

inadequate storage infrastructure; or  

C.  it is difficult to physically handle and transport the commodity 

due to inadequate logistics and transport infrastructure. 

There  is  availability  of  reliable  benchmark  price  of  the 
commodity which can be used as reference for settlement price. 
Exchanges  shall  satisfy  themselves  that  the  reference  spot 
price  is  robust  –  fair  indicator  of  prevailing  prices  and  not 
susceptible to any distortion/manipulation. 

II. 

 

Subject  to  the  above  conditions,  both  cash  settled  and  physically  settled 
derivative  contracts  on  the  same  commodity  may  also  be  considered  for 
trading,  in  case  basis  of  price  discovery  of  the  proposed  contracts  is 
different. 
 

6.3.  Disclosure of disablement of member terminals70 

 

The  disablement  of  terminals  of  the  members  along  with  duration  of 
disablement  due  to  shortage  of  funds,  margin  money  etc.,  shall  be 
disclosed by Exchange on its website at the end of  every  quarter  i.e.,  
30th  June,  30th  September,  31st  December  and  31st March. 

 

6.4.  Timelines for marking delivery intention  

Exchanges may decide the timelines for submission of delivery instruction 
by members based on their assessment of the time required for marking 
as well as for modifying any delivery intentions wrongly marked. 

6.5.  Location premium/discount  

Exchanges    shall    determine    and    disclose  for  contracts  the    location 
premium/discount    prior    to    launch    of    the    contract    in  various 
commodities.

8.2.19.  Automatic Process and Common Pool of arbitrators89:  

 
The  national  commodity  derivatives  exchanges  shall  pool  all 
arbitrators of their exchange in the common pool across all national 
commodity  derivatives  exchanges,  facilitate  automatic  selection  of 
arbitrators from the common pool. Details are prescribed below: 
 
I. 

List  of  Arbitrators  on  the  panel  of  all  exchanges  having  nation-
wide  trading  terminals  shall  be  pooled  and  will  be  called  a 
'Common Pool'. This list shall be made publicly available including 
by way of display on websites of the exchanges. 
 
'Common  pool'  of  Arbitrators  will  consist  of  Arbitrators  listed  on 
the panels of all exchanges having nation-wide trading terminals. 
The pooling of arbitrators will be done Centre-wise. To illustrate, 
the list of arbitrators on the panel of all exchanges for the region 
covered by the Delhi centre will be pooled. This would enable an 
applicant  from  the  region  to  choose  any  arbitrator  from  the 
'Common Pool' for Delhi. 

II. 

III. 

IV. 

V. 

 

 

 

If  the  client  and  member  (broker,  trading  member  or  clearing 
member) fail to choose the Arbitrator(s) from the Common Pool, 
the Arbitrator(s) will be chosen by an 'Automatic Process' wherein 
neither  the  parties  to  arbitration  (i.e.  client  or  member)  nor  the 
concerned Exchanges will be directly involved.  

The  'Automatic  Process'  will  entail  a  randomized,  computer 
generated selection of Arbitrator, from the list of Arbitrators in the 
'Common Pool'. The selection process shall be in chronological 
order of the receipt of arbitration reference i.e. only after selecting 
an  arbitrator  for  the  former  arbitration  reference  received, 
selection for the latter shall be taken up. 
 
The 'Automatic Process' will send a system generated, real time 
alert (sms, email etc.) to all entities involved in the particular case. 
Further, the communication for the appointment of the Arbitrator 
will be sent immediately and in any case not later than the next 
working  day  from  the  day  of  picking  of  the  Arbitrator.  This 
communication will be sent by the exchange on which the dispute 
had  taken  place,  to  all  concerned  entities  including  clients, 
arbitrators, members, exchanges etc. 

VI. 

The selection of Arbitrators by exchanges as done currently, shall 
henceforth be replaced by the 'Automatic Process'. In case of any 
probable  conflict  of  interest  in  an  arbitration  reference  being

assigned  to  any  Arbitrator  the  Arbitrator  will  have  to  upfront 
decline the arbitration reference. After the said arbitrator declines, 
the 'automatic process' will pick the name of another Arbitrator. 
This will continue till the time there is no conflict of interest, by the 
selected  arbitrator.  The  exchanges  should  ensure  that  the 
process  of  appointment  of  arbitrator(s)  is  completed  within  30 
days.  However,  the  timeline  can  be  extended  and  exchanges 
shall put on record the reasons of such extension. 
In case of conflict of interest by the arbitrator, the information for 
the same may reach the exchange on which the dispute has taken 
place  within  15  days  of  receipt  of  communication  from  the  SE 
above. The said information may be sent by any method which 
ensures proof of delivery. 

VII. 

VIII. 

Fees of arbitrator shall be dealt in line with existing provisions, by 
the exchange on which the dispute had taken place.

the setting up of Disaster Recovery Site (DRS) and Near Site (NS), 
Configuration of DRS/NS with Primary Data Centre (PDC), DR drills 
/ Testing, BCP DR Policy as mentioned below:  

 

I. 

The exchanges should have in place Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP) and Disaster Recovery Site (DRS) so as to maintain data 
and transaction integrity. 
 

II.  Apart from DRS, exchanges should also have a Near Site (NS) 

III. 

to ensure zero data loss. 
 
The DRS should be set up sufficiently away, i.e. in a different 
seismic zone, from Primary Data Centre (PDC) to ensure that 
both DRS and PDC are not affected by the same disasters.

Page 129 of 217 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और वितिमय बोर्ड 

 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

The  manpower  deployed  at  DRS  /  NS  should  have  similar 
expertise  as  available  at  PDC  in  terms  of  knowledge  / 
awareness  of  various  technological  and  procedural  systems 
and processes relating to all operations such that DRS / NS can 
function at short notice, independently. 

IV. 

 

V.  Configuration of DRS / NS with PDC  

A.  Hardware,  system  software,  application  environment,  network  and 
security devices and associated application environments of DRS / 
NS and PDC should have one to one correspondence between them. 

 

B.  Exchanges  Depositories  should  have  Recovery  Time  Objective 
(RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) not more than 4 hours 
and 30 minutes, respectively. 

C.  Solution  architecture  of  PDC  and  DRS  /  NS  should  ensure  high 
availability, fault tolerance, no single point of failure, zero data loss, 
and data and transaction integrity. 

D.  Any  updates  made  at  the  PDC  should  be  reflected  at  DRS  /  NS 
immediately  (before  end  of  day)  with  head  room  flexibility  without 
compromising any of the performance metrics. 

E.  Replication architecture, bandwidth and load consideration between 
the DRS / NS and PDC should be within stipulated RTO and ensure 
high availability, right sizing, and no single point of failure. 

F.  Replication between PDC and NS should be synchronous to ensure 
zero data loss. Whereas the one between PDC and DR and between 
NS and DR may be asynchronous. 

G.  Adequate  resources  (with  appropriate  training  and  experience) 
should  be  available  at  all  times  to  handle  operations  on  a  regular 
basis as well as during disasters. 

 

VI.  DR Drills / Testing 

A.  DR  drills  should  be  conducted  on  quarterly  basis.  In  case  of 
exchanges, these drills should be closer to real life scenario (trading 
days) with minimal notice to DR staff involved. 

B.  During  the  drills,  the  staff  based  at  PDC  should  not  be  involved  in 
supporting operations in any manner. To begin with, initial three DR 
drills from the date of this circular may be conducted with the support 
of staff based at PDC. 

C.  The drill should include running all operations from DRS for at least 

1 full trading day.  

D.  Before DR drills, the timing diagrams clearly identifying resources at 

both ends (DRS as well as PDC) should be in place. 

E.  The results and observations of these drills should be documented 
and  placed  before  the  Governing  Board  of  Stock  Exchange  /

the Governing Board should be forwarded to SEBI within a month of 
the DR drill. 

F.  The  system  auditor  while  covering  the  BCP  –  DR  as  a  part  of 
mandated annual system audit should also comment on documented 
results and observations of DR drills. 

 
VII.  BCP – DR Policy Document 
 

A.  The BCP – DR policy of national commodity derivatives exchanges 
should be well documented covering all areas as mentioned above 
including disaster escalation hierarchy. 

B.  The  exchanges  should  specifically  address  their  preparedness  in 
terms  of  proper  system  and  infrastructure  in  case  disaster  strikes 
during business hours. 

C.  Depositories should also demonstrate their preparedness to handle 

any issue which may arise due to trading halts in stock exchanges. 

D.  The policy document and subsequent changes / additions / deletions 
should  be  approved  by  Governing  Board  of  the  exchange  and 
thereafter communicated to SEBI.

members of exchanges have multiple options for using software i.e.  
either  exchange provided  or  in-house  developed  software which  
is  being  used  for  trading  and risk management related activities. 
Since  new  software  or  changes  to  the  existing  software  without 
proper testing may affect the integrity of the markets, it has been 
decided  to  make  the  applicable  the  following  provisions  to 
commodity derivatives markets.  
 
'Software’  shall  mean  electronic  systems  or  applications  used  by 
stock  brokers  /  trading  members  for  connecting  to  the  stock

9.4.3.  Testing of Software 
 

In  addition  to  the  testing  and  approval  requirements  specified 
through various circulars issued by SEBI on IBT, DMA, STWT, SOR 
and AT,  stock  exchanges  shall frame  appropriate  testing  policies 
for  functional  as  well  as  technical  testing  of  the  software.  Such 
framework shall at the minimum include the following: 

I. 

Testing  in  a  simulated  test  environment:  National  commodity 
derivatives exchanges shall provide suitable facilities to market 
participants / software vendors to test new software or existing

undertake  UAT  of  the  software  to  satisfy  itself  that  the  newly 
developed / modified software meets its requirements.  

 
 

III.  With respect to testing of software related to (a) fixes to bugs in 
the  software,  (b)  changes  undertaken  to  the  stock  brokers’ 
software / systems pursuant to a change to any stock exchange's 
trading  system,  and  (c)  software  purchased  from  a  software 
vendor that has already been tested in the mock environment by

A.  Guidelines for Clubbing of Open Positions: 

1.  When  a person  is a partner  in one or more  partnership  firms and /or  is a 
director  in one or more  companies  and/or is a  manager(karta) of a Hindu 
Undivided  Family (HUF), the total  open  position  of  

a.  the person  as an individual  operator,  
b.  the firm  or  firms  in which  he is  a partner ;  
c.  the Company or companies  in which he  is a director ; and  
d.  the HUF  of which he is a manager(karta)  

taken together shall not exceed the prescribed limit. 

2.  Where two or more persons are partners in a partnership firm or firms and 
where two or more persons  are director in a company or companies and 
where  two or more persons  are Kartas of  HUFs,  the total open  position  
held by  

a.  all the partners  of partnership firm or firms;  
b.  the  concerned  partnership  firm or firms;  
c.  all the directors of  the company or companies ; 
d.  the concerned company or companies ;  
e.  all the  Kartas  of  the HUFs ; and  
f. 

the concerned  HUFs 

taken together shall not exceed the limit  as mentioned above. 

3.  Where a person or persons  operating  as individuals  and /or  being partners  
in  one or more partnership  firms  and/or being  directors in one or more 
companies  and/or being  kartas  of HUFs  are also  trustees in one  or more 
trusts, the total open  position of  

a.  the person  as individual  operator, 
b.  the firm or firms in which they are partners; 
c.  the company or companies in which they are directors; 
d.  the HUFs in which they are Kartas; and  
e.  the trust  or trusts in which  they  are trustees,  

taken together shall not exceed the limit as mentioned above. 

 

 

Provided  that,  if  at  any  time  more  deliveries  than  one  are  running  in  the 
same commodity, the above limit shall apply to the combined open position 
of the member or the non-member, as the case may be, in all such deliveries 
running concurrently.  

4.  Open position of a member shall be the total of the open position acquired 
by him by trading through or with other member and by appropriating the 
business of his clients(collectively for all clients). 

Page 159 of 217

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

5.  The open position of a non-member shall be the total of the open position 

acquired by him trading through or with one or more members. 

B.  Exemptions from Clubbing: 

1.  In the agriculture marketing set up of the rural India, co-operative societies 
play a crucial role. Primary Agriculture Marketing Societies registered under 
the  state  cooperative  Acts,  thus,  are  active  in  different  agricultural 
commodities. These societies are also member of Federations at the State 
and  National  level.  Due  to  this  Federal  structure  there  may  be  some 
instances when these societies have common Directors.  Also, the persons 
from  State  Governments/RCS  may  be  nominated  as  Directors  in  these 
societies.  In  view    of  this,  the  position    of  different    societies  if  they  are 
members of a Federation  will not  be clubbed  with the open interest position 
of the Federation  for the purpose  of determining  the open interest  position  
of the Federal  or vice versa. Similarly, if Govt/RCS nominated directors sits 
on the Boards of different societies, this will not amount to common interest 
for the purpose of clubbing of positions.  

2.  As  a  practice  of  good  corporate  governance,  the  companies  now  have 
independent  directors  on  their  Board  with  no  financial  interest  in  the 
company.  Similarly,  companies  also  have  Govt/Financial  Institutions 
nominated Directors without any financial interest in the company. In such 
cases, when the Directors don’t have any financial interest in the company. 
The  Commission  has 
the  position  of  such 
companies/corporates may not be clubbed just because they have common 
directors. 

taken  a  view 

that 

C.  The  above  stated  guidelines  are  indicative  only.  The  Exchanges  are 
directed  to  take  suitable  measures  for  clubbing  of  open  positions  on  the 
basis of the criteria laid down above and also include other criteria such as 
PAN, patterns such as ‘acting in concert’ through common ownership and 
control structures and any other relevant criteria to club open positions that 
may be observed during the course of regular monitoring and surveillance 
that may appear to compromise market integrity.

Position Limit Violation 

The following penal provisions are made to discourage/ prevent open interest 
violations at Commodity level / near month contract level- 

1.  Monetary  penalty  on  the  concerned  member  for  violations  in  the  open 
interest (either on own account or on account of clients) are  linked to the 
quantum/  value  of  violation  committed  and  to  be  charged  from  the 
concerned member for each such violation as under: 

a.  Where the violation is more than 2% of the prescribed limit(s) –  

Limit  exceeded  x  Closing  price  x  number  of  days  such  violation 
continued x 2% (0.02) or Rs. 10,000/- whichever is higher. 
 

b.  Where the violation is up to 2% of the prescribed limit(s) –  

Limit  exceeded  x  Closing  price  x  number  of  days  such  violation 
continued x 2% (0.02) or Rs. 10,000/- whichever is lower. 
 

c.  The member has to ensure reduction in position and to bring it within 
the  prescribed  limit(s)  by  the  next  trading  day  after  the  day  of 
violation.  In  case  such  violation  continues,  the  Exchange  would 
square-off  the  excess  position  without  any  further  notice  to  the 
member by putting the orders on behalf of the member in that client 
code and will not be responsible for the consequences of such action 

 

 

2.  In case, the instance at 1 (a) above is observed for more than 3 times in a 
month  across  the  market,  the  Exchange  would  suspend  the  concerned 
member  for  a  period  of  one  week.  For  instances  at  1  (b)  above,  the 
Exchange may devise its norms to deal with habitual defaulters. 
 

3.  Further, in case repeated violations of such nature are observed by SEBI, 

SEBI may consider action against the concerned Exchange. 
 

The monetary penalty as stated above, will be credited to the Investor Protection 
Fund of the Exchange.

(i) 

Liquidity Categorization of Securities 

 

The securities shall be classified into three groups based on their liquidity: 

Group 

Liquid Securities (Group 
I) 

Trading Frequency 
(over the previous six 
months – see Note A) 

Impact Cost (over the 
previous six months – 
see Note A 

At least 80% of the days 

Less than or equal to 1% 

Less   Liquid  Securities 

At least 80% of the days  More than 1% 

( Group II ) 

Illiquid Securities (Group 

Less than 80% of the 
days 

N/A 

III) 

 

Notes: 

A.  For  securities  that  have  been  listed  for  less  than  six  months,  the  trading 
frequency and the impact cost shall be computed using the entire trading history 
of the scrip. 

 

(ii) 

Computation of VaR Margin 

 
The  VaR  Margin  is  a  margin  intended  to  cover the  largest  loss  that  can  be 
encountered on 99% of the days (99% Value at Risk). For liquid stocks, the margin 
covers one-day losses while for illiquid stocks, it covers three-day losses so as to 
allow the clearing corporation to liquidate the position over three days. This leads 
to a scaling factor of square root of three for illiquid stocks. 
 
For liquid stocks, the VaR margins are based only on the volatility of the stock while 
for other stocks, the volatility of the market index is also used in the computation. 
Computation of the VaR margin requires the following definitions: 

  Scrip sigma means the volatility of the security computed as at the end of 
the previous trading day. The computation uses the exponentially weighted 
moving average method applied to daily returns in the same manner as in 
the derivatives market. 

 

Page 164 of 217 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और वितिमय बोर्ड 

 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 

  Scrip VaR means the higher of 7.5% or 3.5 scrip sigmas. 
 

Index sigma means the daily volatility of the market index (S&P CNX Nifty 
or BSE Sensex) computed as at the end of the previous trading day. The 
computation  uses  the  exponentially  weighted  moving  average  method 
applied to daily returns in the same manner as in the derivatives market. 
Index VaR means the higher of 5% or 3 index sigmas. The higher of the 
Sensex VaR or Nifty VaR would be used for this purpose.

Annexure K 
 

Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF)  

Objective of Core SGF  

 

1)   Clearing Corporation (CC) shall have a fund called Core SGF for each segment 
of each Recognised Stock Exchange (SE) to guarantee the settlement of trades 
executed in respective segment of the SE. In the event of a clearing member 
(member)  failing  to  honour  settlement  commitments,  the  Core  SGF  shall  be 
used  to  fulfill  the  obligations  of  that  member  and  complete  the  settlement 
without affecting the normal settlement process.  

Corpus of Core SGF  

2)  The corpus of the fund should be adequate to meet out all the contingencies 
arising on account of failure of any member(s). The risk or liability to the fund 
depends  on  various  factors  such  as  trade  volume,  delivery  percentage, 
maximum  settlement  liability  of  the  members,  the  history  of  defaults,  capital 
adequacy  of  the  members,  the  degree  of  safety  measures  employed  by  the 
CC/SE etc. A fixed formula, therefore, cannot be prescribed to estimate the risk 
or liability of the fund. However, in order to assess the fair quantum of the corpus 
of Core SGF, CC should consider the following factors:  

  Risk management system in force  
  Current and projected volume/turnover to be cleared and settled by the 

CC on guaranteed basis  

  Track  record  of  defaults  of  members  (number  of  defaults,  amount  in 

default)   

  

3)  However, Minimum Required Corpus of Core SGF (MRC) for each segment of 

each stock exchange shall be subject to the following:  

  

i) 
ii) 

iii) 

 

The MRC shall be fixed for a month.  
By  15th  of  every  month,  CC  shall  review  and  determine  the  MRC  for 
next month based on the results of daily stress tests of the preceding 
month.  (For  example,  by  15th  February,  CC  shall  determine  MRC  for 
March based on results of various stress tests conducted in January). 
CC  shall  also  review  and  determine  by  15th  of  every  month,  the 
adequacy of contributions made by various contributors and any further 
contributions  to  the  Core  SGF  required  to  be  made  by  various 
contributors (as per clause 4)  for the next month.  
For every day of the preceding month (i.e., January as per example in 
(ii) above), uncovered loss numbers shall be estimated by the various 
stress tests for credit risk conducted by the CC for the segment (as per 

Page 166 of 217 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और वितिमय बोर्ड 

 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 

iv) 

v) 

clause 14) and highest of such numbers shall be taken as worst case 
loss number for the day.  
Average  of  all  the  daily  worst  case  loss  numbers  determined  in  (iii) 
above shall be calculated.  
The MRC for next month (i.e., March as per example in (ii) above) shall 
be higher  of  the  average  arrived  in  at  step  iv  above  and the  segment 
MRC as per previous review (i.e., review done on 15th January for the 
month of February).  

vi)  Minimum threshold value of MRC for commodity derivatives segment of 

any stock exchange shall be INR 10 Crores. 

Contribution to Core SGF  

4)  At any point of time, the contributions of various  contributors to Core SGF of 

any segment shall be as follows:  

a)  Clearing Corporation contribution: CC contribution to Core SGF shall be 
at least 50% of the MRC. CC shall make this contribution from its own 
funds. CC contribution to core SGFs shall be considered as part of its 
net worth. 

b)  Stock Exchange contribution: Stock Exchange contribution to Core SGF 
shall be at least 25% of the MRC (can be adjusted against transfer of 
profit by Stock Exchange as per Regulation 33 of SECC Regulations, 
which may be reviewed in view of these guidelines).  

c)  Clearing Member primary contribution: If the CC wishes, it can seek risk 
based  contribution  from  Clearing  Members  (CMs)  of  the  segment 
(including custodial clearing members) to the Core SGF subject to the 
following conditions:  

 

 

 

that total contribution from CMs shall not be more than  25% of 
the MRC,  
that no exposure shall be available on Core SGF contribution of 
any CM (exposure-free collateral of CM available with CC can 
be considered towards Core SGF contribution of CM), and  
that  required  contributions  of  individual  CMs  shall  be  pro-rata 
based on the risk they bring to the system.  

       CC shall have the flexibility to collect CM primary contribution either upfront or 
staggered  over  a  period  of  time.  In  case  of  staggered  contribution,  the 
remaining balance shall be met by CC to ensure adequacy of total Core SGF 
corpus  at  all  times.  Such  CC  contribution  shall  be  available  to  CC  for 
withdrawal as and when further contributions from CMs are received.  

  

       The  above  prescribed  limits  of  contribution  by  CC,  SE  and  CMs  may  be 
reviewed  by  SEBI  from  time  to  time  considering  the  prevailing  market 
conditions.

5)  Any penalties levied by CC (as per Regulation 34 of SECC Regulations) shall 

be credited to Core SGF corpus.   

  

6)  Interest on cash contribution to Core SGF shall also accrue to the Core SGF 
and  pro-rata  attributed  to  the  contributors  in  proportion  to  their  cash 
contribution.  
 

7)  CC shall ordinarily accept cash collateral for Core SGF contribution. However, 
CC may accept CM contribution in the form of bank FDs too. CC shall adhere 
to  specific  guidance  which  may  be  issued  by  SEBI  from  time  to  time  in  this 
regard.  

  

Management of Core SGF  

8)  The  Defaulter's  Committee/SGF  utilization  Committee  of 

the  Clearing 

Corporation shall manage the Core SGF.

11) The  monthly  review  results  shall  be  communicated  to  the  Risk  Management 
Committee  and  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Clearing  Corporation.  The 
exception reporting shall be made to SEBI detailing the outcome of the review 
by the CC Governing Board, including steps taken to enhance the Core SGF.   

Default waterfall  

12) The default waterfall of CC for any segment shall generally follow the following 

order –   

i.  Monies  of  defaulting  member  (including  defaulting  member's  primary 
contribution    to Core SGF(s) and excess monies of defaulter in other 
segments).  
Insurance, if any.  

ii. 
iii.  CC resources (equal to 5% of the segment MRC).  
iv.  Core SGF of the segment in the following order:  

a.  Penalties 
b.  CC contribution to the extent of at least 25% of the segment MRC 
c.  Remaining  Core  SGF:  CC  contribution,  Stock  Exchange 
contribution  and  non-defaulting  members’  primary  contribution  to 
Core SGF on pro-rata basis.  

v.  Proportion  of  remaining  CC  resources  (excluding  CC  contribution  to 
core  SGFs  of  other  segments  and  INR  100  Crore)  equal  to  ratio  of 
segment MRC to sum of MRCs of all segments.*  

vi.  CC/SE  contribution  to  Core  SGFs  of  other  segments  (after  meeting 
obligations  of  those  segments)  and  remaining  CC  resources  to  that 
extent as approved by SEBI.  

vii.  Capped  additional  contribution  by  non-defaulting  members  of  the 

segment.** 

viii.  Any  remaining  loss  to  be  covered  by  way  of  pro-rata  haircut  to 

payouts.***  

  

* INR 100 Crore to be excluded only when remaining CC resources (excluding CC 

contribution to core SGFs of other segments) are more than INR 100 Crore.  

**CC  shall  limit  the  liability  of  non-defaulting  members  towards  additional 
contribution  to  a  multiple  of  their  required  primary  contribution  to  Core  SGF 
and the framework regarding the same should be disclosed. In case of shortfall

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 

in  recovery  of  assessed amounts from  non-defaulting members, further  loss 
can be allocated to layer 'VI' with approval of SEBI.  

***In case loss allocation is effected through haircut to payouts, any subsequent 
usage of funds shall be with prior SEBI approval. Further, any exit by CC post 
using this layer shall be as per the terms decided by SEBI in public interest. 

 
Stress testing and back testing 
 
13) CC shall effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to its 
participants  and  those  arising  from  its  payment,  clearing,  and  settlement 
processes.  

 
14)  Stress test for credit risk: CC shall carry out daily stress testing for credit risk 
using at least the standardized stress testing methodology prescribed in para 
22 below. Apart from the prescribed stress scenarios , CCs shall also develop 
own scenarios for a variety of ‘extreme but plausible market conditions’ (in terms 
of both defaulters’ positions and possible price changes in liquidation periods, 
including the risk that liquidating such positions could have an impact on the 
market)  and  carry  out  stress  testing  using  self-developed  scenarios.  Such 
scenarios should include relevant peak historic price volatilities, shifts in other 
market factors such as price determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults 
over various time horizons and a spectrum of forward looking stress scenarios 
in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions.  

  
15)  Liquidity  stress  test  and  adequacy  of  liquidity  arrangements:  CC  shall 
ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid resources to manage liquidity risks from 
members, settlement banks and those generated by its investment policy. CC 
shall daily test the adequacy of its liquidity arrangements in order to ensure that 
its liquid resources are adequate to meet simultaneous default of at least two 
clearing  members  and  their  associates  that  would  generate  the  largest 
aggregate  liquidity  obligation  for  the  CC  in  extreme  but  plausible  market 
conditions  and  compare  such  obligation  with  the  resources  mentioned 
hereunder:  

 

a.  Cash  
b.  Committed lines of credit available to CC  

  
16)  Reverse  stress  test:  CC  shall  periodically  carry  out  reverse  stress  tests 
designed to identify under which market conditions and under what scenarios 
the combination of its margins, Core SGF and other financial resources prove 
insufficient to meet its obligations (e.g. simultaneous default of top N members 
or N% movement in price of top 2 scrips by turnover or 20% movement in price 
of top N scrips by turnover etc.)   

 

17)  Back testing for adequacy of margins: CC shall daily conduct back testing 
of  the  margins  collected  vis-à-vis  the  actual  price  changes  for  the  contracts 

 

Page 170 of 217 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और वितिमय बोर्ड 

 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 

being  cleared  and  settled  in  every  segment  to  assess  appropriateness  of  its 
margining models.  

 

18)  Adequacy of financial resources: CC shall ensure that it maintains sufficient 
financial  resources  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  potential  stress  scenarios  that 
should include, but not be limited to, the default of the two participants and their 
associates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure 
to  the  CC  in  extreme  but  plausible  market  conditions.  Thus,  CC  shall 
continuously  monitor  the  adequacy  of  financial  resources  (as  available  in  its 
default  waterfall)  against  the  uncovered  loss  estimated  by  the  various  stress 
tests  conducted  by  the  CC  and  take  steps  to  beef  up  the  same  in  case  of 
shortfall.  

 

19)  On at least a monthly basis, CC shall perform a comprehensive and thorough 
analysis  of  stress  testing  scenarios,  models,  and  underlying  parameters  and 
assumptions  used  to  ensure  they  are  appropriate  for  determining  the  CCP’s 
required  level  of  default  protection  in  light  of  current  and  evolving  market 
conditions.  CC  shall  perform  this  analysis  of  stress  testing  more  frequently 
when  the  products  cleared  or  markets  served  display  high  volatility,  become 
less  liquid,  or  when  the  size  or  concentration  of  positions  held  by  a  CC’s 
participants increases significantly. A  full validation of CC’s risk-management 
model shall be performed at least annually.  

 

20)  The results of tests carried out as per clauses 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 above and 
review conducted as per clause 19 shall be monitored by the Risk Management 
Committee  of  the  CC  and  the  same  should  be  communicated  for  discussion 
and review by the Board of the CC.  

 

21)  Clearing corporations and Stock Exchanges are directed to make the following 

details available on its website:  

 

i.  Policy on composition and contributions to be made to the Core SGF; 
ii. 
iii.  Default  waterfall  for  each  segment  along  with  the  quantum  of 

Investment policy for Core SGF;  

resources available in each layer of default waterfall;  

 
Standardized Stress Testing for Commodity Derivatives 

 

Part A. Scenarios 
 
Historical Scenarios 
 
1 
Price movement in respect of each underlying over the MPOR period during the 
last 15 years to be considered: 
Scenario 1A: Maximum percentage rise over MPOR period  
Scenario 1B: Maximum percentage fall over MPOR period 

Peak Historical Return  

 

Page 171 of 217 

भारतीय प्रततभूतत और वितिमय बोर्ड 

 

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 
  

Peak historical price volatility 

2 
Historical price volatility (EWMA volatility) in respect of each commodity during the 
previous 15 years is to be considered. Percentage price movement equal to 3.5 
times  the  peak  historical  volatility  adjusted  for  applicable  MPOR  period  of  the 
commodity  shall  be  considered  (subject  to  a  maximum  of  110%  of  the  price 
movement considered for the commodity under the peak historical return scenario): 
Scenario 2A: Percentage price rise  
Scenario 2B: Percentage price fall 
 

2  Augmented historical 
 

Exchange shall identify top 10 days during the previous 15 years based on average 
of absolute percentage price change across all commodities witnessed over the 
MPOR  period.  For  each  of  the  day,  exchange  shall  identify  percentage  price 
change  in  each  commodity  (in  case  of  unavailability  of  prices  in  any  of  the 
commodity on any of the identified days, price change equal to applicable initial 
margin in the commodity to be considered). All the price movements to be scaled 
up by 10%.  
 
Thus,  one  scenario  corresponding  to  each  of  the  10  identified  days  shall  be 
generated. 
 

Stressed MPOR 

Hypothetical scenarios 
 
4 
 
It  shall  be  assumed  that  liquidation  of  open  positions  would  require  5  days  and 
percentage price movement equal to 3.5 times current volatility adjusted for 5 day 
period (i.e., scaling up by square root of 5) shall be considered. 

Scenario 4A: Percentage rise over 5 day period  

Scenario 4B: Percentage fall over 5 day period 

Stressed PSR and VSR 

5 
 
Price movement in respect of each underlying to the extent of 1.5 times the normal 
price  scan  range  (PSR)  over  the  MPOR  period  and  change  in  implied  volatility 
equal to 1.5 times the normal volatility scan range shall be considered.  
Scenario 5A: Underlying price increasing by 1.5 PSR adjusted for MPOR period, 
volatility increasing by 1.5 VSR.   
Scenario 5B: Underlying price decreasing by 1.5 PSR adjusted for MPOR period, 
volatility increasing by 1.5 VSR.

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 
Exchanges shall carry out stress tests using each of the scenarios given in 
Part A as follows –  
 
By stressing positions in all commodities simultaneously 
a. 
By  first  identifying  top  10  commodities based  on  OI  and  stressing 1 
b. 
commodity  at  a  time  (ignoring  positions  in  other  commodities  and  the 
corresponding margins) 
 
 
Part B. Methodology 
 
The percentage price movements identified in each of the above scenarios shall 
be  applied  to  the  commodity  price  on  the  day  for  which  the  stress  test  is  being 
done. All open positions shall be assumed to be squared up at the theoretical price 
corresponding  to  the  revised  prices/volatility  of  the  underlying  in  each  of  the 
scenarios. For each clearing member, the credit exposure to Clearing Corporation 
shall be calculated as follows: 
 

a)  The time of stress test shall be end of day 
b)  It shall be assumed that clearing member will default in paying the settlement 
obligations and all outstanding positions will be squared off at the theoretical 
price  corresponding  to  the  revised  price/volatility  of  the  underlying  in  the 
scenario. 

c)  Loss shall be calculated at client portfolio level.  
d)  For each client, residual loss shall be equal to –> (loss due to close-out of client 

positions– margin supporting that specific client’s positions)  

e)  All residual losses (residual profits to be ignored) for all clients shall be grossed 

to compute total residual losses due to client positions.  

f)  Loss due to close-out of proprietary positions shall be considered. 
g)  Loss at (e) and loss at (f) and the net pay-in/pay-out requirement of the clearing 
member  shall  be  assessed  against  required  margins  (excluding  margin 
supporting client positions and excess collateral, if any) and other mandatory 
deposits  of  defaulting  member  to  calculate  credit  exposure  of  Clearing 
Corporation to the member. Equity scrips as collateral, if any, shall be valued 
with minimum 20% haircut.  
 

Part C. Coverage 

                                                                                           

To  begin  with,  for  each  of  the  scenarios  in  Part  A,  Clearing  Corporations  shall 
calculate –  

 

 

A.  Credit  exposure  due  to  simultaneous  default  of  at  least  2  clearing 

members (and their associates) causing highest credit exposure. 

Page 173 of 217

Securities and Exchange Board of India 

 
 

B.  25%  of  the  credit  exposure  due to  simultaneous  default of  all  clearing 

members.  

However, within a year from the deadline of implementation of the circular, for each 
of the scenarios in Part A, Clearing Corporations shall calculate –  

A.  Credit  exposure  due  to  simultaneous  default  of  at  least  2  clearing 

members (and their associates) causing highest credit exposure. 

B.  50%  of  the  credit  exposure  due to  simultaneous  default  of  all  clearing 

members.
