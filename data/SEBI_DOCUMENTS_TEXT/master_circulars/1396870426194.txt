  Simplification of demat account opening process23 

SEBI  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  in  the  recent  past  to  simplify  the 
Account  opening  and  KYC  process  in  the  securities  markets.  In 
continuation of the efforts in the same direction, it has now been decided 
in  consultation  with  both  the  Depositories  and  Associations  of  stock 
brokers and Depository Participants to further simplify and rationalize the 
demat account opening process.  

 

 

ii.  The existing Beneficial Owner-Depository Participant Agreements shall be 
replaced  with  a  common  document  “Rights  and  Obligations  of  the 
Beneficial  Owner  and  Depository  Participant”.  The  document  annexed 
herewith  shall  be  mandatory  and  binding  on  all  the  existing  and  new 
clients  and  depository  participants.  This  will  harmonize  the  account 
opening  process  for  trading  as  well  as  demat  account.  This  will  also 
rationalise the number of signatures by the investor, which he is required 
to affix at present on a number of pages. 
 

iii.  The Depository Participant shall provide a copy of Rights and Obligations 
Document to the beneficial owner and shall take an acknowledgement of 
the  same.  They  shall  ensure  that  any  clause  in  any  voluntary  document 
neither dilutes the responsibility of the depository participant nor it shall 
be  in  conflict  with  any  of  the  clauses  in  this  Document,  Rules,  Bye-laws, 
Regulations,  Notices,  Guidelines  and  Circulars  issued  by  SEBI  and  the 
Depositories from time to time. Any such clause introduced in the existing 
as well as new documents shall stand null and void.

immovable  property  of  a  minor.    However,  shares  are  not  immovable 
properly.  Section  2(7)  of  Sale  of  Goods  Act,  1930  includes  shares  within 
the definition of "goods''.   Neither the Indian Contract Act nor the Sale of 
Goods Act provide for transfer by sale or otherwise by guardian /natural 
guardian  of  goods/movable  property  in  the  name  of  minor  to  the  effect 
that permission of court is required in the matter of such transfer.   In the 
case of accounts of minor in banks also, the guardian is entitled to open, 
operate and even close the account also.   The DP account can, therefore, 
be  operated  by  a  natural  guardian  without  any  order  from  the  court 
though the same is neither expressly permitted nor prohibited.

deactivation of the ISIN may be only done in cases where companies have 
been  liquidated.  In  other  cases  where  companies  are  being  liquidated,

before pay-in deadline or till EOD, such instructions shall fail. 

Settlement of transactions in case of holidays63  

 

Due to lack of uniformity of holidays and force majeure conditions which 
necessitate sudden closure of one or more Stock Exchanges and banks in a 
particular state, result in situations where multiple settlements have to be 
completed  by  the  Stock  Exchanges  on  the  working  day  immediately 
following  the  day(s)  of  the  closure  of  the  banks.  Accordingly  the  Stock 
Exchanges/Depositories are advised to follow the guidelines and  adhere 
to the time line. 
 

i.  The Stock Exchanges shall clear and settle the trades on a sequential basis 
i.e.,  the  pay-in  and  the  pay-out  of  the  first  settlement  shall  be  completed 
before  the  commencement  of  the  pay-in  and  pay-out  of  the  subsequent 
settlement/s. 

ii.  The  cash/securities  pay  out  from  the  first  settlement  shall  be  made 
available  to  the  member  for  meeting  his  pay-in  obligations  for  the 
subsequent settlement/s.  

iii.  Further,  in-order  to  meet  his  pay-in  obligations  for  the  subsequent 
settlement, the member may need to move securities from one depository 
to another. The Depositories shall, therefore, facilitate the inter-depository 
transfers within one hour and before pay-in for the subsequent settlement 
begins.  

iv.  The  Stock  Exchanges/Depositories  shall  follow  a  strict  time  schedule  to 

ensure that the settlements are completed on the same day.  

v.  The  Clearing  Corporation/Clearing  House  of  the  Stock  Exchanges  shall 
execute Auto DO facility for all the settlements together, so as to make the 
funds and the securities available with the member on the same day for all 
the settlements, thereby enabling the availability of the funds/securities at 
the client level by the end of the same day. 

4.3 

Deadline time for accepting non pay-in related instructions64  

 

 

i.      The  depositories  are  advised  that  any  overrun  of  the  time  specified  for 
'spot delivery contract' in the SCRA would result in the contract becoming 
illegal  under  section  16  of  the  SCRA  (unless  it  is  put  through  the  stock 
exchange).  The  DP-BO  agreement  cannot  add  anything  to  or  subtract

anything  from  this  position.  However,  it  should  be  the  responsibility  of 
the  DP  to  ensure  that  the  client's  contract  is  not  rendered  illegal  on 
account of delayed execution of the delivery instruction. 

 

ii.       Keeping  the  hardships  to  change  all  the  existing  DP-BO  agreements  to 
enforce  the  above  into  consideration,  it  is  advised  that  suitable  bye  laws 
can be made under section 26(2)(e) and (d)  of Depositories Act,   1996 for 
imposing   such   obligation   on   the   DPs.   Therefore,   it is advised to 
amend/insert bye laws which should expressly provide that the DPs shall 
execute the non pay-in related instructions on the same day or on the next 
day  of  the  instruction.  Further,  pending  such  amendment,  suitable 
instructions may be issued to DPs to adhere to such time limit. 

 

 

iii.       The  above  clause  may  be  suitably  incorporated  in  the  DP-BO  agreement 

while opening new accounts. 

 

4.4 

Approval  of  amendments  to  Bye  Laws  /  Rules  of  Stock  Exchanges  and 
Depositories65 

 
i.  Depositories and exchanges shall submit the following information while 
seeking SEBI approval for amendment to Bye Laws/ Rules/ Regulations 
and amendments thereto: 
 
a.  The objective/purpose of amendments. 
b.  Whether  the  amendment  is  consequential  to  any  directive/circulars/ 

guidelines from SEBI/ Government and the details thereof. 

c.  Whether such amendments necessitate any consequential amendments 

to any other Bye Laws/ Rules/ Regulations. 

d.  The proceedings of the Governing Board or Governing Council, as the 
case may be, wherein these proposed amendments were approved by 
the Exchanges/ Depositories. 

e.  If  documents  other  than  Bye  Laws/  Rules/  Regulations  are  sent  for 
approval,  the  justification  and  need  for  forwarding  the  same  to  SEBI, 
indicating whether it forms a part of any Bye Law/ Rule/ Regulation. 

 
Further,  all  Exchanges  shall  ensure  that  requests  for  dispensation  of  the 
requirement  of  pre-publication  shall  be  accompanied  with  proper 
justification and indicate how the public interest or interest of trade shall 
be served by such dispensation of pre-publication.

Preservation of Records66 
 

i.  Depositories  and  Depository  Participants  are  required  to  preserve  the 

records and documents for a minimum period of 5 year. 
 

ii.  Depositories  and  DPs  shall  preserve  respective  original  forms  of 
documents either in physical form or an electronic record, copies of which 
have  been  taken  by  CBI,  Police  or  any  other  enforcement  agency  during 
the course of their investigation till the trial is completed.   

Pledge of Shares through depository system67 
 
Section  12  of  the  Depositories  Act  and  Regulation  58  of  the  SEBI 
(Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 along with the relevant 
Bye  Laws  of  the  Depositories  clearly  enumerate  the  manner  of  creating 
pledge.  It is felt that  there is a need to communicate to the BOs that  any 
procedure followed other than as specified under the aforesaid provisions 
of law shall not be treated as pledge. 
 
In  order  to  clarify  the  same,  the  depositories  are  advised  to  issue  a 
communiqué to the DPs advising them to inform BOs about the procedure 
for pledging of shares held in demat form as enumerated in the relevant 
sections of the Depositories Act and SEBI (Depositories and Participants) 
Regulations,  1996.  Depositories  may  also  advise  DPs  that  an  off-market 
transfer of shares leads to change in ownership and cannot be treated as 
pledge. Further, this issue may also be taken up in the investor awareness 
programs  wherein  the  manner  of  creation  of  pledge  can  be  effectively 
communicated to the BOs directly.

i.  On examination of the provisions of Regulations 19(a) and 31 of the SEBI    

(Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations,  1996,  it  is  advised  that

mandatory  and  a  pre-requisite  for  it  to  obtain  connectivity  with  the 
depositories.  However,  if  the  CC/CH  of  a  stock  exchange  desires  to 
function  as  any  other  "Depository  Participant",  i.e.  to  open  BO  accounts 
for investors or clearing member account, registration as DP with SEBI is 
mandatory.  
 
In  view  of  the  above,  Depositories  are  advised  to  provide  continuous 
electronic  means  of  communication  /  connectivity  to  the  CH/CC  of  the 
Exchanges without insisting for a mandatory registration as DP with SEBI 
with  a  condition  that  such  entities  would  not  be  permitted  to  open  BO 
accounts for investors or clearing member account.

Principles of Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs)79 
 
Background 
 

i.  To  promote  and  sustain  an  efficient  and  robust  global  financial 
infrastructure,  the  Committee  on  Payments  and  Settlement  Systems 
(CPSS)  and  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions 
(IOSCO)  published  the  Principles  for  financial  market  infrastructures1 
(PFMIs) on April 2012. They replace the three existing sets of international 
standards  set  out  in  the  Core  Principles  for  Systemically  Important 
Payment  Systems 
for  Securities 
Settlement  Systems  (RSSS);  and  the  Recommendations  for  Central 
Counterparties  (RCCP).  CPSS  and  IOSCO  have  strengthened  and 
harmonised 
three  sets  of  standards  by  raising  minimum 
requirements,  providing  more  detailed  guidance  and  broadening  the 
scope  of  the  standards  to  cover  new  risk-management  areas  and  new 
types of FMIs. 

the  Recommendations 

(CPSIPS); 

these 

 

 

 

 

ii.  The  PFMIs  comprise  of  24  principles  (Annex  1)  for  Financial  Market 
Infrastructure  to  provide  for  effective  regulation,  supervision  and 
oversight  of  FMIs.  They  are  designed  to  ensure  that  the  infrastructure 
supporting global financial markets is robust and well placed to withstand 
financial shocks. 

iii. 

Full, timely and consistent implementation of the PFMIs is fundamental to 
ensuring  the  safety,  soundness  and  efficiency  of  key  FMIs  and  for 
supporting  the  resilience  of  the  global  financial  system.  In  addition,  the 
PFMIs play an important part in the G20's mandate that all standardized 
over-the-counter  (OTC)  derivatives  should  be  centrally  cleared.  Global 
central  clearing  requirements  reinforce 
importance  of  strong 
safeguards and consistent oversight of derivatives CCPs in particular. 

the 

Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) 

iv.  The  Principles  apply  to  systematically  important  financial  market 
infrastructures  entities  such  as  Central  Counterparty  (CCP),  Central 
Securities Depository (CSD)/ Securities Settlement System (SSS), Payment 
and Settlement systems, and Trade Repository (TR) which are responsible

for  providing  clearing,  settlement  and  recording  of  monetary  and  other 
financial transactions. The principles are international standards set forth 
to – 
a.  Enhance  safety  and  efficiency  in  payment,  clearing,  settlement,  and 

recording arrangements, 

b.  Reduce systemic risk. 
c.  Foster transparency and financial stability and 
d.  Promote protection of participants and investors. 

Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) are critically  important  institutions 
responsible for providing clearing,  settlement and recording of monetary 
and  other  financial  transactions.  The  different  categories  of  FMIs,  as 
identified under PFMIs, are listed below - 
 
Payment Systems (PSS) 
 
A  payment  system  is  a  set  of  instruments,  procedures,  and  rules  for  the 
transfer of funds between or among participants. The system includes the 
participants  and  the  entity  operating  the  arrangement.  Payment  systems 
are  typically  based  on  an  agreement  between  or  among  participants  and 
the operator of the arrangement, and the transfer of funds is effected using 
an agreed-upon operational infrastructure. 

Central Securities Depositories (CSD) 
 
Central  securities  depository  provides  securities  accounts,  central 
safekeeping  services,  and  asset  services,  which  may 
include  the 
administration  of  corporate  actions  and  redemptions,  and  plays  an 
important role in helping to ensure the integrity of securities issues (that 
is,  ensure  that  securities  are  not  accidentally  or  fraudulently  created  or 
destroyed  or  their  details  changed).  A  CSD  can  hold  securities  either  in 
physical  form  (but  immobilised)  or  in  dematerialised  form  (that  is,  they 
exist  only  as  electronic  records).  A  CSD  may  maintain  the  definitive 
record  of  legal  ownership  for  a  security;  in  some  cases,  however,  a 
separate securities registrar will serve this notary function. 
 
Securities Settlement Systems (SSS) 
A  securities  settlement  system  enables  securities  to  be  transferred  and 
settled  by  book  entry  according  to  a  set  of  predetermined  multilateral 
rules. Such systems allow transfers of securities either free of payment or 
against  payment.  When  transfer  is  against  payment,  many  systems

provide  delivery  versus  payment  (DvP),  where  delivery  of  the  security 
occurs if and only if payment occurs. An SSS may be organised to provide 
additional  securities  clearing  and  settlement  functions,  such  as  the 
confirmation of trade and settlement instructions. 

Central Counterparties (CCP) 
 
A  central  counterparty  interposes  itself  between  counterparties  to 
contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to 
every  seller  and  the  seller  to  every  buyer  and  thereby  ensuring  the 
performance  of  open  contracts.  A  CCP  becomes  counterparty  to  trades 
with  market  participants  through  novation,  an  open-offer  system,  or 
through  an  analogous  legally  binding  arrangement.  CCPs  have  the 
potential  to  significantly  reduce  risks  to  participants  through  the 
multilateral netting of trades and by imposing moreeffective risk controls 
on  all  participants.  For  example,  CCPs  typically  require  participants  to 
provide  collateral  (in  the  form  of  initial  margin  and  other  financial 
resources) to cover current and potential future exposures. CCPs may also 
mutualise certain risks through devices such as default funds. As a result 
of  their  potential  to  reduce  risks  to  participants,  CCPs  also  can  reduce 
systemic risk in the markets they serve. 
 
Trade Repositories (TR) 
 
A  trade  repository  is  an  entity  that  maintains  a  centralised  electronic 
record (database) of transaction data. TRs have emerged as a new type of 
FMI  and  have  recently  grown  in  importance,  particularly  in  the  OTC 
derivatives  market.  By  centralising 
the  collection,  storage,  and 
dissemination of data, a well designed TR that operates with effective risk 
controls  can  serve  an  important  role  in  enhancing  the  transparency  of 
transaction information to relevant authorities and the public, promoting 
financial stability, and supporting the detection and prevention of market 
abuse.  An  important  function  of  a  TR  is  to  provide  information  that 
supports risk reduction, operational efficiency and effectiveness, and cost 
savings  for  both  individual  entities  and  the  market  as  a  whole.  Such 
entities  may  include  the  principals  to  a  trade,  their  agents,  CCPs,  and 
other service providers offering complementary services, including central 
settlement  of  payment  obligations,  electronic  novation  and  affirmation, 
portfolio compression and reconciliation, and collateral.

Annexure 1 

Principles for financial market infrastructures 
 
General Organisation 

Principle 1: Legal basis 
 
An  FMI  should  have  a  well-founded,  clear,  transparent,  and  enforceable 
legal  basis  for  each  material  aspect  of  its  activities  in  all  relevant 
jurisdictions. 
 
Principle 2: Governance 
 
An  FMI  should  have  governance  arrangements  that  are  clear  and 
transparent, promote the safety and efficiency of the FMI, and support the 
stability  of  the  broader  financial  system,  other  relevant  public  interest 
considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.  
 
Principle 3: Framework for the comprehensive management of risks 
 
for 
An  FMI  should  have  a  sound  risk-management 
comprehensively managing legal, credit, liquidity, operational, and other 
risks. Credit and liquidity risk management. 
 
Principle 4: Credit risk 
 
An  FMI  should  effectively  measure,  monitor,  and  manage  its  credit 
exposures  to  participants  and  those  arising  from  its  payment,  clearing, 
and  settlement  processes.  An  FMI  should  maintain  sufficient  financial 
resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high 
degree of confidence. In addition, a CCP that is involved in activities with 
a  more-complex risk  profile  or that  is  systemically  important  in multiple 
jurisdictions  should  maintain  additional  financial  resources  sufficient  to 
cover  a  wide  range  of  potential  stress  scenarios  that  should  include,  but 
not  be  limited  to,  the  default  of  the  two  participants  and  their  affiliates 
that  would  potentially  cause  the  largest  aggregate  credit  exposure  to  the 
CCP  in  extreme  but  plausible  market  conditions.  All  other  CCPs  should 
maintain additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of 
potential  stress  scenarios  that  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the 
default of the participant and its affiliates that would potentially cause the 

framework

largest  aggregate  credit  exposure  to  the  CCP  in  extreme  but  plausible 
market conditions. 
 
Principle 5: Collateral 
 
An  FMI  that  requires  collateral  to  manage  its  or  its  participants‟  credit 
exposure  should  accept  collateral  with  low  credit,  liquidity,  and  market 
risks.  An  FMI  should  also  set  and  enforce  appropriately  conservative 
haircuts and concentration limits. 
 
Principle 6: Margin 
 
A CCP should cover its credit exposures to its participants for all products 
through  an  effective  margin  system  that  is  risk-based  and  regularly 
reviewed. 
 
Principle 7: Liquidity risk 
 
An  FMI  should  effectively  measure,  monitor,  and  manage  its  liquidity 
risk.  An  FMI  should  maintain  sufficient  liquid  resources  in  all  relevant 
currencies  to  effect  same-  day  and,  where  appropriate,  intraday  and 
multiday  settlement  of  payment  obligations  with  a  high  degree  of 
confidence  under  a  wide  range  of  potential  stress  scenarios  that  should 
include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the  default  of  the  participant  and  its 
affiliates that would generate the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for 
the FMI in extreme but plausible market conditions. 
 
Settlement 
 
Principle 8: Settlement finality 
 
An FMI  should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum 
by  the  end  of  the  value  date.  Where  necessary  or  preferable,  an  FMI 
should provide final settlement intraday or in real time. 
 
Principle 9: Money settlements 
 
An  FMI  should  conduct  its  money  settlements  in  central  bank  money 
where practical and available. If central bank  money is not used, an FMI 
should  minimise  and  strictly  control  the  credit  and  liquidity  risk  arising 
from the use of commercial bank money.

Principle 10: Physical deliveries 
 
An FMI should clearly state its obligations with respect to the delivery of 
physical  instruments  or  commodities  and  should  identify,  monitor,  and 
manage the risks associated with such physical deliveries.

systems 
 
Principle 11: Central securities depositories 
 
A CSD should have appropriate rules and procedures to help ensure the 
integrity  of  securities  issues  and  minimise  and  manage  the  risks 
associated with  the safekeeping and transfer of securities. A  CSD  should 
maintain  securities  in  an  immobilised  or  dematerialised  form  for  their 
transfer by book entry. 
 
Principle 12: Exchange-of-value settlement systems 
 
If  an  FMI  settles  transactions  that  involve  the  settlement  of  two  linked 
obligations  (for  example,  securities  or  foreign  exchange  transactions),  it 
should eliminate principal risk by conditioning the final settlement of one 
obligation upon the final settlement of the other. 
 
Default management 
 
Principle 13: Participant-default rules and procedures 
 
An FMI should have effective and clearly defined rules and procedures to 
manage  a  participant  default.  These  rules  and  procedures  should  be 
designed  to  ensure  that  the  FMI  can  take  timely  action  to  contain  losses 
and liquidity pressures and continue to meet its obligations. 
 
Principle 14: Segregation and portability 
 
A CCP should have rules and procedures that enable the segregation and 
portability  of  positions  of  a  participant‟s  customers  and  the  collateral 
provided to the CCP with respect to those positions.

An  FMI  should  identify,  monitor,  and  manage  its  general  business  risk 
and  hold  sufficient  liquid  net  assets  funded  by  equity  to  cover  potential 
general business losses so that it can continue operations and services as a 
going concern if those losses materialise. Further, liquid net assets should 
at  all  times  be  sufficient  to  ensure  a  recovery  or  orderly  wind-down  of 
critical operations and services. 
 
Principle 16: Custody and investment risks 
 
An  FMI  should  safeguard  its  own  and  its  participants‟  assets  and 
minimise the risk of loss on and delay in access to these assets. An FMI‟s 
investments  should  be  in  instruments  with  minimal  credit,  market,  and 
liquidity risks. 
 
Principle 17: Operational risk 
 
An  FMI  should  identify  the  plausible  sources  of  operational  risk,  both 
internal  and  external,  and  mitigate  their  impact  through  the  use  of 
appropriate  systems,  policies,  procedures,  and  controls.  Systems  should 
be designed to ensure a high degree of security and operational reliability 
and  should  have  adequate,  scalable  capacity.  Business  continuity 
management should aim for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment 
of  the  FMI‟s  obligations,  including  in  the  event  of  a  wide-scale  or  major 
disruption. 
 
Access 
 
Principle 18: Access and participation requirements 
 
An FMI should have objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria 
for participation, which permit fair and open access.
