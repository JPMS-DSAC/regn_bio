a.  The  depositories  shall  give  more  emphasis  on  investor  education 
particularly with regard to careful preservation of Delivery Instruction 
Slip  (DIS)  by  the  BOs.  The  Depositories  may  advise  the  BOs  not  to 
leave “blank or signed” DIS with the Depository Participants (DPs) or 
any other person/entity. 

  
b.  The DPs shall not accept pre-signed DIS with blank columns from the 

BO(s). 

c.  If the DIS booklet is lost / stolen / not traceable by the BO, then the BO 
shall  immediately  intimate  the  DP  in  writing  about  the  loss.    On 
receipt of such intimation, the DP shall cancel the unused DIS of the 
said booklet. 

 
d.  The DPs shall not issue more than 10 loose DIS to one accountholder in 
a financial year (April to March). The loose DIS can be issued only if 
the BO(s) come in person and sign the loose DIS in the presence of an 
authorised DP official 

e.  The DP shall also ensure that a new DIS booklet is issued only on the 
strength of the DIS instruction request slip (contained in the previous 
booklet)  duly  complete  in  all  respects,  unless  the  request  for  fresh 
booklet is due to loss, etc., as referred to in clause (c) above 

f.  The  DPs  shall  put  in  place  appropriate  checks  and  balances  with 
regard  to  verification  of  signatures  of  the  BOs  while  processing  the 
DIS.

g.  The  DPs  shall  cross  check  with 

the  BOs  under  exceptional 

circumstances before acting upon the DIS. 

h.  The  DPs  shall  mandatorily  verify  with  a  BO  before  acting  upon  the 
DIS, in case of an account which remained inactive i.e., where no debit 
transaction  had  taken  place  for  a  continuous  period  of  6  months, 
whenever  all  the  ISIN  balances  in  that  account  (irrespective  of  the 
number of ISINs) are transferred at a time. However, in case of active 
accounts,  such  verification  may  be  made  mandatory  only  if  the  BO

at a time. The authorized official of the DP verifying such transactions 
with the BO, shall record the details of the process, date, time, etc., of

3.7  Supervision of branches of DPs42 
 

To  ensure  compliance  with  Regulation  46  of  the  SEBI  (Depositories  and 
Participants)  Regulations,  1996,  and  Clause  19  of  the  Code  of  Conduct  for 
Participants  contained  in  the  Third  Schedule  to  the  Regulations  the  DP  shall 
ensure  that  it  has  satisfactory  internal  control  procedure  in  place,  inclusive  of 
their  branch  offices.  DPs  are  therefore  required  in  terms  of  these  provisions  to 
put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that their branches are carrying 
on  the  operations  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  regulations,  bye-laws,  etc. 
DPs are also required to put in place suitable internal control systems to ensure 
that  all  branches  exercise  due  diligence  in  opening  accounts,  complying  with 
KYC  requirements,  in  ensuring  systems  safety  in  complying  with  client 
instructions, manner of uploading client instructions, in verifying signatures and 
maintaining  client  records,  etc.  DPs  shall  also  ensure  that  the  branches  are 
suitably integrated.  

Depositories shall examine the adequacy of the above mechanisms during their 
inspections  of  DPs.  The  Depositories  shall  also  carry  out  surprise  inspections/ 
checks  of  the  DP  branches  apart  from  the  regular  inspection  of  the  DPs. 
Depositories  shall  also  put  in  place  appropriate  mechanisms  for  monitoring 
opening of branches by DPs.
