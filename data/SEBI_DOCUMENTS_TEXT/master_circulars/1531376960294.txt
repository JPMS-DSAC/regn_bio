1.10 Restriction on Redemption in Mutual Funds31 

1.10.1 Presently  in  terms  of  circular  SEBI/IMD/CIR  No.5/126096/08 

dated May 23, 2008, facility of restriction on redemption under any 

scheme  of  the  mutual  fund  can  be  made  only  after  the  approval 

from  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asset  Management  Company 

(AMC) and the Trustees. The provisions are general in nature and 

do not specifically spell out the circumstances in which restriction 

on redemption may be applied; leading to discretionary disclosures 

and practices in the industry. 

1.10.2 As  a  philosophy,  restriction  on  redemption  should  apply  during 

excess redemption requests that could arise in overall market crisis 

situations rather than exceptional circumstances of entity specific 

situations. The circumstances calling for restriction on redemption 

should  be  such  that  illiquidity  is  caused  in  almost  all  securities

affecting  the  market  at  large,  rather  than  in  any  issuer  specific 

securities. 

1.10.3 Therefore, in order to bring more clarity and to protect the interest 

of the investors, the following requirement shall be observed before 

imposing restriction on redemptions: 

1.10.3.1  Restriction  may  be 

imposed  when 

there  are 

circumstances leading to a systemic crisis or event that 

severely  constricts  market  liquidity  or  the  efficient 

functioning of markets such as: 

1.10.3.1.1  Liquidity  issues  -  when  market  at  large 

becomes  illiquid  affecting  almost  all  securities 

rather  than  any  issuer  specific  security.  AMCs 

should  have  in  place  sound  internal  liquidity 

management  tools  for  schemes.  Restriction  on 

redemption  cannot  be  used  as  an  ordinary  tool 

in  order  to  manage  the  liquidity  of  a  scheme. 

Further,  restriction  on  redemption  due  to 

illiquidity of a specific security in the portfolio of 

a  scheme  due  to  a  poor  investment  decision, 

shall not be allowed. 

1.10.3.1.2  Market  Failures,  exchange  closures  -  when 

markets are affected by unexpected events which 

impact  the  functioning  of  exchanges  or  the 

regular course of transactions. Such unexpected 

events  could  also  be  related  to  political, 

18                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

 

economic,  military,  monetary 

or 

other 

emergencies. 

1.10.3.1.3  Operational 

Issues 

-  when  exceptional 

circumstances  are  caused  by  force  majeure, 

unpredictable 

operational 

problems 

and 

technical failures (e.g. a black out). Such cases 

can  only  be  considered  if  they  are  reasonably 

unpredictable and occur in spite of appropriate 

diligence of third parties, adequate and effective 

disaster recovery procedures and systems. 

1.10.3.2  Restrictions  on  redemption  may  be  imposed  for  a 

specified period of time not exceeding 10 working days 

in any 90 days period. 

1.10.3.3  Any  imposition  of  restriction  would  require  specific 

approval of Board of AMCs and Trustees and the same 

should be informed to SEBI immediately. 

1.10.3.4  When  restriction  on  redemption  is  imposed,  the 

following procedure shall be applied: 

1.10.3.4.1  No redemption requests upto INR 2 lakh shall 

be subject to such restriction. 

1.10.3.4.2  When  redemption  requests  are  above  INR  2 

lakh,  AMCs  shall  redeem  the  first  INR  2  lakh 

without such restriction and remaining part over 

19                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 

and  above  INR  2  lakh  shall  be  subject  to  such 

restriction. 

1.10.4 Disclosure: The above information to investors shall be disclosed 

prominently  and  extensively  in  the  scheme  related  documents 

regarding the possibility that their right to redeem may be restricted 

in such exceptional circumstances and the time limit for which it 

can be restricted. 

1.10.5 The circular shall be applicable immediately for (i) all schemes to 

be  launched  on  or  after  the  date  of  this  circular  and  (ii)  all  the 

existing schemes with effect from July 01, 2016. 

1.11 Discontinuation  of  the  nomenclature  –  ‘Liquid  Plus 

Scheme(s)’32 

1.11.1 The nomenclature “Liquid Plus Scheme(s)” has been discontinued 

from  January  2009  since  it  gives  a  wrong  impression  of  added 

liquidity.

PART IV – CATEGORIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION OF 

MUTUAL FUND SCHEMES53 

 

It is desirable that different schemes launched by a Mutual Fund are clearly 

distinct in terms of asset allocation, investment strategy etc. Further, there 

is  a  need  to  bring  in  uniformity  in  the  characteristics  of  similar  type  of 

schemes launched by different Mutual Funds. This would ensure that an 

investor of Mutual Funds is able to evaluate the different options available, 

before taking an informed decision to invest in a scheme. 

In  order  to  bring  the  desired  uniformity  in  the  practice,  across  Mutual 

Funds and to standardize the scheme categories and characteristics of each 

category, it has been decided to categorize the MF schemes as given below: 

2.6  Categories  of  Schemes,  Scheme  Characteristics  and 

Type of Scheme (Uniform Description of Schemes): 

2.6.1  The Schemes would be broadly classified in the following groups: 

i.  Equity Schemes 

ii.  Debt Schemes 

iii.  Hybrid Schemes 

iv.  Solution Oriented Schemes 

v.  Other Schemes 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
53 SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2017/114 dated October 06, 2017 
29                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

The  details  of  the  scheme  categories  under  each  of  the  aforesaid 

groups along with their characteristics and uniform description are 

given in the Annexure 8. 

2.6.2  As  per  the  annexure,  the  existing  ‘type  of  scheme’  (presently 

mentioned  below  the  scheme  name  in  the  offer  documents/ 

advertisements/  marketing  material/etc.)  would  be  replaced  with 

the  type  of  scheme  (given  in  the  third  column  of  the  tables  in  the 

Annexure)  as  applicable  to  each  category  of  scheme.  This  will 

enhance the existing disclosure.  

2.6.3  In case of Solution oriented schemes, there will be specified period 

of lock in as stated in the Annexure 8. 

However,  the  said  lock-  in  period  would  not  be  applicable  to  any 

existing  investment  by  an  investor,  registered  SIPs  and  incoming 

STPs  in  the  existing  solution  oriented  schemes  as  on  the  date  on 

which such scheme is getting realigned with the provisions of this 

circular. 

 

 

2.6.4  The investment objective, investment strategy and benchmark of 

each scheme shall be suitably modified (wherever applicable) to 

bring it in line with the categories of schemes listed above. 

2.7  Definition of Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap: 

2.7.1  In  order  to  ensure  uniformity  in  respect of  the  investment  universe 

for equity schemes, it has been decided to define large cap, mid cap 

and small cap as follows: 

i.  Large Cap: 1st -100th company in terms of full market 

capitalization 

30                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 

ii.  Mid Cap: 101st -250th company in terms of full market 

capitalization 

iii.  Small Cap: 251st company onwards in terms of full market 

capitalization 

2.7.2  Mutual Funds would be required to adopt the list of stocks prepared 

by AMFI in this regard and AMFI would adhere to the following points 

while preparing the list: 

i. 

If a stock is listed on more than one recognized stock exchange, 

an average of full market capitalization of the stock on all such 

stock exchanges, will be computed; 

ii. 

In case a stock is listed on only one of the recognized stock 

exchanges, the full market capitalization of that stock on such 

an exchange will be considered. 

iii. 

This list would be uploaded on the AMFI website and the same 

would be updated every six months based on the data as on the 

end of June and December of each year. The data shall be 

available on the AMFI website within 5 calendar days from the 

end of the 6 months period. 

 

iv.  While preparing the single consolidated list of stocks, average 

full market capitalization of the previous six month of the stocks 

shall be considered54. 

2.7.3  Subsequent to any updation in the list, Mutual Funds would have to 

rebalance their portfolios (if required) in line with updated list, within 

a period of one month.

CHAPTER 4 

RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM84 

 

4.1  An Operating Manual85 for Risk Management has been developed to ensure 

minimum standards of due diligence and Risk Management Systems for all

4.2.1  Existing Industry Practices:  

 

4.2.1.1 Under each head of risk, the Manual covers the exemplary practices 

followed  by  some  /  most  of  Mutual  Funds  in  India.  However,  the 

extent and degree of observance of these practices differs among the 

Mutual Funds. Mutual Funds shall accordingly develop their systems 

and follow these practices.

 Stress Testing of Liquid Fund and Money Market Mutual Fund 

Schemes 86  

 

 

4.4.1  As a part of risk management framework, Mutual Funds (MFs) carry out 

stress testing of their portfolio, particularly for debt schemes. In order 

to standardize this practice across industry, AMFI came out with Best 

Practice Guidelines dated September 12, 2014 on stress testing of Liquid 

Funds and Money Market Mutual Fund Schemes (MMMFs). 

4.4.2  In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  risk  management  practices  and  to 

develop a sound framework that would evaluate potential vulnerabilities 

on account of plausible events and provide early warning on the health 

of the underlying portfolio of Liquid Fund and MMMF Schemes, it has 

been decided to stipulate the following guidelines: 

4.4.2.1  As a part of the extant risk management framework, AMCs 

should have stress testing policy in place which mandates 

them to conduct stress test on all Liquid Fund and MMMF 

Schemes. 

4.4.2.2  The stress test should be carried out internally at least on 

a monthly basis, and if the market conditions require so, 

AMC should conduct more frequent stress test.

4.4.2.3  The  concerned  schemes  shall  be  tested  on  the  following 

risk  parameters,  among  others  deemed  necessary  by  the 

 

AMC: 

a)  Interest rate risk; 
b)  Credit risk; 
c)  Liquidity & Redemption risk. 

4.4.2.4  While conducting stress test, it will be required to evaluate 

impact of the various risk parameters on the scheme and 

its  Net  Asset  Value  (NAV).  The  parameters  used  and  the 

methodology  adopted  for  conducting  stress  test  on  such 

type  of  scheme,  should  be  detailed  in  the  stress  testing 

policy,  which  is  required  to  be  approved  by  the  Board  of 

AMC. 

4.4.2.5  Further,  in  the  event  of  stress  test  revealing  any 

vulnerability or early warning signal, it would be required 

to bring it to the notice of the Trustees and take corrective 

action as deemed necessary, to reinforce their robustness. 

Each  AMC  should  also  be  required  to  have  documented 

guidelines, to deal with the adverse situation effectively. 

4.4.2.6  Such stress-testing policy shall be reviewed by the Board 

of AMC and Trustees, at least on an annual basis, in light 

of  the  evolving  market  scenarios  and  should  cover  the 

following aspects:  

i. Adequacy of the documentation for various elements of 
the stress testing framework  

ii.  Scope  of  coverage  of  the  stress  testing  policy  and  the 
levels of stress applied  

iii. Integration of the stress testing framework in the day-
to-day risk management processes  

45                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds

with  this  circular  and  steps  taken  to  deal  with  adverse 

situations faced, if any, in the Half Yearly Trustee Report 

submitted to SEBI. 

4.5 

Internal Credit Risk Assessment 87, 88:  

4.5.1  In order to ensure that MFs / AMCs are able to carry out their own credit 

assessment of assets and reduce reliance on credit rating agencies, all 

MFs/ AMCs are required to have an appropriate policy and system in 

place  to  conduct  an  in-house  credit  risk  assessment  /  due  diligence

6.6.3.2 Investments through the secondary markets:  

a.  An  access  person  who  wishes  to  make  a  secondary  market 

transaction shall submit a written application to that effect to 

the  Compliance  Officer.  Such  an  application  shall  specify  the 

name of the company whose securities the employee wishes to 

buy  and/or  sell,  type  of  security,  and  the  number  of  shares 

and/or  debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or  warrants  and/or 

derivatives that the access person wishes to buy/sell.  

b.  The  Compliance  Officer  shall  clear  these  requests  if  the 

following conditions are met:  

1. 

If  the  shares  and/or  debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or 

warrants  of  the  company  or  derivatives specified  by  the 

access person are not held by any scheme of the Mutual 

Fund of which the AMC is the investment manager; 

2. 

163If the shares and/or debentures and/or bonds and/or 

warrants  of  the  company  or  derivatives specified  by  the 

employee are held by any Scheme of the Mutual Fund of 

which the AMC is the investment manager, there should 

be  a  "cooling  off"  period  of  15  calendar  days.  The 

Compliance    Officer    shall    ensure    that    the    last  

transaction  in  that  particular  security was  done  by  

the  Mutual  Fund  at  least  15  calendar  days  prior  to  

the    date    of    the  written    application    by    the    access  

person. In  other words,  an  application  for  a purchase  

/sale transaction on a  personal basis  would be  cleared 

only    if    the    Mutual  Fund  has  not  transacted  in  that 

particular security for at least 15 calendar days. However,

that    such  trading  plan  does  not  entail  trading  in 
securities for market abuse. 

c.   The Compliance Officer shall keep a track of the transactions of the 

employees and transactions of the Mutual Fund to ensure that there 

is  no  conflict  of  interest  between  them  i.e.  the  Compliance  Officer

by  any  employee  whether  for  self  or  for  any  other  person,  knowing 

fully well that the AMC also intends to purchase and/or sell the same 

security  for  its  Mutual  Fund  operations.  To  ascertain  that  the 

employee  had  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  Mutual  Fund's  intended

securities based on price sensitive information to which the employee 

has  access  by  virtue  of  his  office.  Declaration  to  this  effect  may  be 

taken from the employee while clearing the proposals for investment.

Compliance  Test  Reports  (CTRs)  and  Half  Yearly  Trustee 

Reports. 

6.10  Minimum  Assets  under  Management  (AUM)  of  Debt 

Oriented Schemes 171 

6.10.1  It has been observed that many debt oriented schemes are operating 

with a  very  low  AUM.  In  the  interest  of  investors,  it  is  important  

that  debt oriented  schemes  have  an  adequate  corpus  to  ensure  

adherence    to    the  investment    objectives    as    stated    in    Scheme  

Information    Document    and  compliance    with    investment  

restrictions  specified  under  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds) Regulations, 

1996.   

6.10.2  In this regard, it has been decided that:  

a)  The    minimum    subscription    amount    of    debt    oriented    and  
balanced  schemes  at the  time of new fund offer shall be at least  20 
crore  and that of other schemes shall be at least 10 crore.  

  

b) An  average  AUM  of  20  crore  on  half  yearly  rolling  basis  shall  

be maintained for open ended debt oriented schemes.  

  

 c) The  existing  open  ended  debt  oriented  schemes  shall  comply  
with point  (b)  stated  above within  one  year  from  the  date  of  
issue  of  this circular.  

  

d) In case of breach of points  (b) and (c) above, the AMC shall scale up 
the  AUM  of  such  scheme  within  a  period  of  six  months  so  as  
to  comply    with    point    (b)    stated    above,    failing    which    the  
provisions    of  Regulation  39  (2)  (c)  of  SEBI  (Mutual  Funds) 
Regulations, 1996 would become applicable.

 e) The  confirmation  on  compliance  of  the  above  shall  be  reported  

to SEBI in the Half Yearly Trustee Reports.  

 

6.11  Scheme Performance Review 

6.11.1  AMCs and Trustees shall review the performance of their schemes 

on periodic basis172. Such review can take place by comparing the 

performance of the schemes with benchmark indices as well as in 

light  of  the  performance  of  the  entire  Mutual  Funds  industry  by 

relying on data published from time to time by independent research 

agencies and financial newspapers and journals.  Corrective action 

if required may be taken in case of unsatisfactory performance. Its 

compliance should be   reported in the bimonthly CTRs of AMCs and 

half-yearly  reports  of  the  Trustees  to  SEBI  (while  reporting 

compliance  of  Regulation  25(2)  on  exercise  of  due  diligence  in 

investment decisions). 

6.12  Benchmarking of Scheme's performance to Total Return 

Index173 

6.12.1  Total  Return  variant  of  an  Index  (TRI)  takes  into  account  all 

dividends/ interest payments that are generated from the basket of 

constituents that make up the index in addition to the capital gains.

Hence,  TRI  is  more  appropriate  as  a  benchmark  to  compare  the 

performance of mutual fund schemes. 

6.12.2  With  an  objective  to  enable  the  investors  to  compare  the 

performance of a scheme vis-a-vis an appropriate benchmark, it has 

been decided that - 

6.12.2.1  Selection of a benchmark for the scheme of a mutual fund shall 

be  in  alignment  with  the  investment  objective,  asset  allocation 

pattern and investment strategy of the scheme. 

6.12.2.2  The  performance  of  the  schemes  of  a  mutual  fund  shall  be 

benchmarked to the Total Return variant of the Index chosen as 

a benchmark as stated in para 6.12.2.1 above 

6.12.2.3  (i)  Mutual  funds  shall  use  a  composite  CAGR  figure  of  the 

performance of the PRI  benchmark (till the date from which TRI 

is  available)  and  the  TRI  (subsequently)  to  compare  the 

performance of their scheme in case TRI is not available for that 

particular period(s). 

(ii)  The  calculation  of  composite  CAGR  is  elaborated  with  an 

example in the following paragraph. 

 For  instance,  ABC  scheme  had  been  launched  on  August  2, 

1995. The benchmark PRI values are available from the date of 

inception of the fund. The benchmark TRI values are available 

from June 30, 1999. The calculation of a composite benchmark 

performance return in CAGR terms would be as given below:

CHAPTER 9 

VALUATION 

9.1  Definitions222 

9.1.1  Non Traded Securities223  

9.1.1.1 When  a  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  is  not  traded 

on  any  Stock  Exchange  for  a  period  of  thirty  days  prior  to  the 

valuation date, the scrip shall be treated as a non traded security. 

9.1.2  Thinly Traded Securities 

9.1.2.1 Thinly traded equity/ equity related securities:224 

a.  When trading in an equity and/or equity related security (such 

as convertible debentures, equity warrants etc.) in a month is 

both  less  than  Rs.5  lacs  and  the  total  volume  is  less  than 

50,000  shares,  the  security  shall  be  considered  as  thinly 

traded security and valued accordingly.  

 
b.  In order to determine whether a security is thinly traded or not, 

the volumes traded in all recognized Stock Exchanges in India 

may be taken into account.  

c.  For  example,  if  the  volume  of  trade  is  1,00,000  and  value  is 

Rs.4,00,000, the shares do not qualify as thinly traded. Also if 

the  volume  traded  is  40,000,  but  the  value  of  trades  is 

Rs.6,00,000, the shares do not qualify as thinly traded.

d.  Where a Stock Exchange identifies the thinly traded securities 

by applying the above parameters for the preceding calendar 

month  and  publishes  or  provides  the  required  information 

along with the daily quotations, the same can be used by the 

Mutual Funds. 

e.  If  the  shares  are  not  listed  on  the  Stock  Exchanges  which 

provide such information, then Mutual Funds shall make their 

own analysis in line with the above criteria to check whether 

such securities are thinly traded or not and then value them 

accordingly. 

9.1.3  Thinly traded Debt Securities225  

9.1.3.1 A  debt  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  shall  be 

considered as a thinly traded security if, on the valuation date, there 

are no individual trades in that security in marketable lots (currently 

applicable)  on  the  principal  Stock  Exchange  or  any  other  Stock 

Exchange.

traded on any Stock Exchange on any particular valuation day, the 

value at which it was traded on the principal Stock Exchange or any 

other Stock Exchange, as the case may be, on the earliest previous 

day may be used provided such date is not more than fifteen days 

prior  to  valuation  date.  When  a  debt  security  (other  than

Revaluation  Reserves)  –  Miscellaneous  expenditure  and  Debit 

Balance in Profit and Loss Account] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

 

b.  Average  Capitalization  rate  (P/E  ratio)  for  the  industry  based 

upon  either  BSE  or  NSE  data  (which  shall  be  followed 

consistently and changes, if any, noted with proper justification 

thereof) shall be taken and discounted by 75 per cent i.e. only 25 

per  cent.  Of  the  industry  average  P/E  shall  be  taken  as 

Capitalization  rate  (P/E  ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the

purpose.  

 

c.  The value as per the Net Worth value per share and the capital 

earning value calculated as above shall be averaged and further 

discounted by 10 per cent. for illiquidity so as to arrive at the fair 

value per share.  

d. 

In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken 

as zero for arriving at capitalised earning. 

e. 

In  case  where  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not 

available within nine months from the close of the year, unless 

the  accounting  year  is  changed,  the  shares  of  such  companies 

shall be valued at zero.  

f. 

In case an individual security accounts for more than 5 per cent. 

of the total assets of the scheme, an independent valuer shall be 

appointed for the valuation of the said security. To determine if a 

security accounts for more than 5 per cent. of the total assets of 

the  scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  by  the  procedure  above  and  the 

proportion which it bears to the total net assets of the scheme to 

which it belongs will be compared on the date of valuation228.  

g. 

In  case  trading  in  an  equity  security  is  suspended  up  to  thirty 

days, then the last traded price shall be considered for valuation 

of that security. If an equity security is suspended for more than 

thirty  days,  then  the  AMC(s)  or  Trustees  shall  decide  the 

valuation  norms  to  be  followed  and  such  norms  shall  be 

documented and recorded.

9.2.4  Non traded/thinly Traded Debt security 

9.2.4.1 A thinly traded debt security as defined above shall be valued as per 

the norms for non traded debt security. 

a.  Valuation229  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 

maturity of upto 60230 days: 

1.  All  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including  floating  rate 

securities,  with  residual  maturity  of  upto  60  days  shall  be 

valued at the weighted average price at which they are traded 

on the particular valuation day. When such securities are not 

traded  on  a  particular  valuation  day  they  shall  be  valued  on 

amortization basis. It is further clarified that in case of floating 

rate securities with floor and caps on coupon rate and residual 

maturity  of  upto  60  days  then  those  shall  be  valued  on 

amortization basis taking the coupon rate as floor. 

b.  Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 

maturity of over 60231 days: 

1.  All  money  market  and  debt  securities,  including  floating  rate 

securities,  with  residual  maturity  of  over  60  days  shall  be 

valued  at  weighted  average  price  at  which  they  are  traded  on 

the  particular  valuation  day.  When  such  securities  are  not 

traded  on  a  particular  valuation  day  they  shall  be  valued  at 

benchmark  yield/  matrix  of  spread  over  risk  free  benchmark 

yield obtained from agency(ies) entrusted for the said purpose 

by AMFI.

2.  The approach in valuation of non traded debt securities is based 

on  the  concept  of  using  spreads  over  the  benchmark  rate  to 

arrive at the yields for pricing the non traded security.  

3.  The  Yields  for  pricing  the  non  traded  debt  security  would  be 

arrived at using the process as defined below.  

Step  1:  A  Risk  Free  Benchmark  Yield  is  built  using  the 

government  securities  as  the  base.  Government  securities  are 

used  as  the  benchmarks  as  they  are  traded  regularly;  free  of 

credit risk; and traded across different maturity spectrums every 

week.  

 
Step 2: A Matrix of spreads (based on the credit risk) are built 

for marking up the benchmark yields. The matrix is built based 

on traded corporate paper on the wholesale debt segment of an 

appropriate stock exchange and the primary market issuances. 

The  matrix  is  restricted  only  to  investment  grade  corporate 

paper.  

 
Step 3: The yields as calculated above are Marked-up/Marked-

down for ill-liquidity risk  

 
Step 4: The Yields so arrived are used to price the portfolio. 

 
9.3  Methodology:  

9.3.1  Construction of Risk Free Benchmark232 

9.3.1.1 Using  Government  of  India  dated  securities;  the  Benchmark  shall 

be constructed as below:

a.  Government  of  India  dated  securities  will  be  grouped  into  various 

duration buckets such as 0.164-0.25 yrs233, 0.25- 0.5 yrs234, 0.5-1 

year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, 5-6 years and 6 years and the 

volume  weighted  yield  would  be  computed  for  each  bucket.  These 

duration buckets may be changed to reflect the market value more 

closely by any agency suggested by AMFI giving benchmark yield/ 

matrix of spreads over benchmark yield.  

b.  The benchmark as calculated above will be set at least weekly, and 

in  the  event  of  any  significant  movement  in  prices  of  Government 

Securities on account of any event impacting interest rated on any 

day such as a change in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  policies, 

the  benchmark  will  be  reset  to  reflect  any  change  in  the  market 

conditions.  

9.3.2  Building a Matrix of Spreads for Marking-up the Benchmark Yield235  

9.3.2.1 Mark  up  for  credit  risk  over  the  risk  free  benchmark  YTM  as 

calculated  in  9.3.1  above,  will  be  determined  using  the  trades  of 

corporate  debentures/bonds  of  different  ratings.  All  trades  on 

appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  fortnight  prior  to  the 

benchmark  date  will  be  used  in  building  the  corporate  YTM  and 

spread  matrices.  Initially  these  matrices  will  be  built  only  for 

corporate securities of investment grade. The matrices are dynamic 

and  the  spreads  will  be  computed  every  week.  The  matrix  will  be 

built for all duration buckets for which the benchmark GOI matrix 

is  built  to  effectively  link  the  corporate  matrix  with  the  GOI 

securities matrix. Accordingly:

a.  All  traded  paper  (with  minimum  traded  value  of  Rs.1  crore)  will  be 

classified by their ratings and grouped into 7 duration buckets; for 

rated securities, the most conservative publicly available rating will 

be used;  

b. For  each  rating  category,  average  volume  weighted  yield  will  be 

obtained  both  from  trades  on  the  appropriate  stock  exchange  and 

from the primary market issuances  

c. Where  there  are  no  secondary  trades  on  the  appropriate  stock 

exchange  in  a  particular  rating  category  and  no  primary  market 

issuances during the fortnight under consideration, then trades on 

appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  30  day  period  prior  to  the 

benchmark date will be considered for computing the average YTM 

for such rating category;  

d. If the matrix cannot be populated using any or all of the above steps, 

then credit spreads from trades on appropriate stock exchange of the 

relevant rating category over the AAA trades will be used to populate 

the matrix;  

e. In each rating category, all outliers will be removed for smoothening 

the YTM matrix;  

f.  Spreads  will  be  obtained  by  deducting  the  YTM  in  each  duration 

category from the respective YTM of the GOI securities;  

g. In the event of lack of trades in the secondary market and the primary 

market the gaps in the matrix would be filled by extrapolation. If the 

spreads  cannot  be  extrapolated  for  the  reason  of  practicality,  the 

gaps in the matrix will be filled by carrying the spreads from the last 

matrix. 

h. Accordingly,  all  Mutual  Funds  shall  provide  transaction  details  of 

various types of debt securities like NCDs, Mibor linked floaters and 

CPs on daily basis in the prescribed format enclosed at Annexure 3 

to the agency recommended by AMFI. Submission of data would help 

117                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

in daily matrix generation, would improve uniformity and accuracy 

of valuation in the Mutual Funds industry236.  

 

9.3.3  Mark-up/Mark-down Yield 

9.3.3.1 The  Yields  calculated  would  be  marked-up/marked-down  to 

account  for  the  illiquidity  risk,  promoter  background,  finance 

company risk and the issuer class risk. As the level of illiquidity risk 

would  be  higher  for  non  rated  securities  the  marking  process  for 

rated and non rated securities would be differentiated as follows:  

a.  Adjustments for Securities rated by external rating     agencies237

cognizance  of  the  differential  interest  rate  risk  of  the  securities. 

This structure will be reviewed periodically.  

b.  Adjustments for Internally Rated Securities238  

1.  To value an un-rated security, the fund manager shall assign an 

internal credit rating, which will be used for valuation. Since un-

rated instruments tend to be more illiquid than rated securities,

9.4  Valuation of securities with Put/Call Options:240  

9.4.1  The option embedded securities would be valued as follows:  

 

 

9.4.1.1 Securities with call option  

a.  The securities with  call option shall be  valued at the lower  of the

of the instrument.  

9.4.1.2 Securities with Put option 

a.  The securities with put option shall be valued at the higher of the 

value  as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and 

valuing  the  security  to  put  option.  In  case  there  are  multiple  put 

options,  the  highest  value  obtained  by  valuing  to  the  various  put 

dates and valuing to the maturity date is to be taken as the value 

of the instruments.

defined as non-traded, thinly traded and unlisted equity shares, shall 

not exceed 15 per cent of the total assets of the scheme and any illiquid 

securities held above 15 per cent of the total assets shall be assigned 

zero value. 

9.6.2  All Mutual Funds shall disclose as on March 31 and September 30 the 

scheme wise total illiquid securities in value and percentage of the net 

assets while disclosing Half Yearly Portfolios to the unit holders. In the 

list  of  investments,  an  asterisk  mark  shall  be  given  against  all  such 

investments which are recognised as illiquid securities.  

9.6.3  Mutual Funds shall not be allowed to transfer illiquid securities among 

their schemes.  

                                                 
242 SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 dated September 18, 2000. 

1.  Provided  that  in  case  any  scheme  has  illiquid  securities  in  excess  of  15%  of  total 
assets  as  on  September  30,  2000  then  such  a  scheme  shall  within  a  period  of  two 
years bring down the ratio of illiquid securities within the prescribed limit of 15 per 
cent. in the following time frame:  
a.  All the illiquid securities above 20 per cent. of total assets of the scheme shal l be 

assigned zero value on September 30, 2001.  

b.  All the illiquid securities above 15 per cent. of total assets of the scheme shall be 

assigned zero value on September 30, 2002. 

2.  In respect of closed ended funds, for the purposes of valuation of illiquid se curities, 
the limits of 15 per cent. and 20 per cent. applicable to open ended funds should be 
increased to 20 per cent. and 25 per cent. respectively.  

3.  Where a scheme has illiquid securities as at September 30, 2001 not exceeding 15% 
in  the  case  of  an  open-ended  fund  and  20%  in  the  case  of  closed  fund,  the 
concessions of giving time period for reducing the illiquid security to the prescribed 
limits would not be applicable and at all time the excess over 15% or 20% shall be 
assigned nil value

9.7  Guidelines  for  Identification  and  Provisioning  for  Non 

 

Performing Assets (Debt Securities)243 

9.7.1  Definition of a Non Performing Asset (NPA)  

9.7.1.1  An ‘asset’ shall be classified as NPA if the interest and/or principal 

amount  have  not  been  received  or  remained  outstanding  for  one 

quarter from the day such income and/or installment was due.  

9.7.2  Effective date for classification and provisioning of NPAs  

9.7.2.1 The definition of NPA may be applied after a quarter past due date 

of the interest. For e.g. if the due date for interest is 30.06.2000, it 

will be classified as NPA from 01.10.2000.  

9.7.3  Treatment of income accrued on the NPA and further accruals 

9.7.3.1 After the expiry of the 1st quarter from the date the income has fallen 

due, there will be no further interest accrual on the asset i.e. if the 

due  date  for  interest  falls  on  30.06.2000  and  if  the  interest  is  not 

received, accrual will continue till 30.09.2000 after which there will 

be no further accrual of income. In short, taking the above example, 

from the beginning of the 2nd quarter there will be no further accrual 

on income.  

9.7.3.2 On classification of the asset as NPA from a quarter past due date 

of  interest,  all  interest  accrued  and  recognized  in  the  books  of 

accounts of the Mutual Fund till the date shall be provided for. For 

e.g.  if  interest  income  falls  due  on  30.06.2000,  accrual  of  interest 

will  continue  till  30.09.2000  even  if  the  income  as  on  30.06.2000 

has  not  been  received.  Further,  no  accrual  will  take  place  from

122                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

01.10.2000  onwards.  Full  provision  will  be  made  for  interest 

accrued and outstanding as on 30.06.2000.  

 

9.7.4  Provision for NPAs – Debt Securities 

9.7.4.1 Both secured and unsecured investments, once they are recognized   

as NPAs, call for provisioning in the same manner and where these 

are related to close ended schemes, the phasing would be such that 

to ensure full provisioning prior to the closure of the scheme or the 

scheduled phasing whichever is earlier.  

9.7.4.2 The value of the asset shall be provided in the following manner or 

earlier at the discretion of the Mutual Fund. Mutual Funds will not 

have  discretion  to  extend  the  period  of  provisioning.  The 

provisioning against the principal amount or installments shall be 

made at the following rates irrespective of whether the principal is 

due for repayment or not. 

a.  10 percent of the book value of the asset shall be provided for after 

6  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e. 3  months  form  the date  of 

classification of the asset as NPA.  

b.  20 percent of the book value of the asset should be provided for after 

9  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e. 6  months  from  the date  of 

classification of the asset as NPA.  

c.  Another 20 percent of the book value of the assets shall be provided 

for after 12 months past due date of interest i.e. 9 months from the 

date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

d.  Another 25 percent of the book value of the assets shall be provided 

for after 15 months past due date of interest i.e. 12 months from the 

date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

123                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

e.  The  balance  25  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  shall  be 

provided  for  after  18  months  past  due  date  of  the  interest  i.e.  15 

months from the date of classification of the assets as NPA.  

9.7.4.3 Book value for the purpose of provisioning for NPAs shall be taken 

as a value determined as per the prescribed valuation method.  

9.7.4.4 This can be explained by an illustration:  

a.  Let  us  consider  that  interest  income  is  due  on  a  half  yearly  basis 

and the due date falls on 30.06.2000 and the interest is not received 

till 1st quarter after due date i.e. 30.09.2000. The provisioning will 

be done in the following phased manner:   

10% provision  01.01.2001 

20% provision  01.04.2001 
20% provision  01.07.2001 
25% provision  01.10.2001 
25% provision  01.01.2002 

6 months past due date of 
interest i.e. 3 months from the 
date of classification of asset 
as NPA (01.10.2000) 
  
  
  
  

b.  Thus, one and half  years past the due  date of income or one year 

and three months from the date of classification of the ‘asset’ as an 

NPA, the ‘asset’ will be fully provided for. If any installment is fallen 

due, during the period of interest default, the amount of provision 

shall  be  the  installment  amount  or  above  provision  amount, 

whichever is higher.  

9.7.5  Reclassification of assets 

9.7.5.1 Upon reclassification of assets as ‘performing assets’:  

a.  In case a company has fully cleared all the arrears of interest, the 

interest provisions can be written back in full.  

124                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

 

b.  The  asset  will  be  reclassified  as  performing  on  clearance  of  all 

interest  arrears  and  if  the  debt  is  regularly  serviced  over  the  next 

two quarters.  

c.  In case the company has fully cleared all the arrears of interest, the 

interest not credited on accrual basis shall be credited at the time of 

receipt.  

d.  The provision made for the principal amount can be written back in 

the following manner  

1.  100% of the asset provided for in the books will be written back 

at  the  end  of  the  2nd  quarter  where  the  provision  of  principal 

was made due to the interest defaults only.

Investment in Unlisted Equity Shares246 

 

9.8.1  To ensure uniformity in calculation of NAV the following guidelines are 

issued: 

9.8.1.1 Methodology  for  Valuation  -  unlisted  equity  shares  of  a  company 

shall be valued "in good faith" as below:  

a.  Based on the latest available audited balance sheet, Net Worth shall 

be calculated as the lower of item (1) and (2) below:  

1.  Net Worth per share = [Share Capital + Free Reserves (excluding 

revaluation reserves) - Miscellaneous expenditure not written off 

or  deferred  revenue  expenditure, 

intangible  assets  and 

accumulated losses] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

2. 

 After taking into account the outstanding warrants and options, 

Net  Worth  per  share  shall  again  be  calculated  and  shall  be  = 

[Share  Capital  +  consideration  on  exercise  of  Option  and/or 

Warrants received/receivable by the Company + Free Reserves 

(excluding  Revaluation  Reserves)  -  Miscellaneous  expenditure 

not written off or deferred revenue expenditure, intangible assets 

and  accumulated  losses]  /  Number  of  Paid  up  Shares  plus 

Number of Shares that would be obtained on conversion and/or 

exercise of Outstanding Warrants and Options. 

3.  The lower of (1) and (2) above shall be used for calculation of Net 

Worth per share and for further calculation in (c) below. 

b.  Average capitalisation rate (P/E ratio) for the industry based upon 

either  BSE  or  NSE  data  (which  shall  be  followed  consistently  and

changes,  if  any,  noted  with  proper  justification  thereof)  shall  be 

taken  and  discounted  by  75  per  cent.  i.e.  only  25  per  cent  of  the 

industry  average  P/E  shall  be  taken  as  capitalisation  rate  (P/E 

ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the  latest  audited  annual 

accounts will be considered for this purpose.  

c.  The  value  as  per  the  Net  Worth  value  per  share  and  the  capital 

earning  value  calculated  as  above  shall  be  averaged  and  further 

discounted  by  15  per  cent  for  illiquidity  so  as  to  arrive  at  the  fair 

value per share. 

9.8.1.2 The  above  valuation  methodology  shall  be  subject  to  the  following 

conditions:  

a.  All calculations shall be based on audited accounts.  

b. 

If  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not  available  within 

nine months from the close of the year, unless the accounting year 

is changed, the shares of such companies shall be valued at zero.  

c. 

If  the  Net  Worth  of  the  company  is  negative,  the  share  would  be 

marked down to zero.  

d. 

In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken 

as zero for arriving at capitalised earning.  

e. 

In case an individual security accounts for more than 5 per cent of 

the  total  assets  of  the  scheme,  an  independent  valuer  shall  be 

appointed  for  the  valuation  of  the  said  security.  To  determine  if  a 

security accounts for more than 5 per cent of the total assets of the 

scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  as 

mentioned above on the date of valuation.

less  than  face  value  of  the  unit,  the  difference  between  the  sale 

price and face value shall be debited to distributable reserves and 

the  dividend  can  be  declared  only  when  distributable  reserves 

become positive after adjusting the amount debited to reserves as 

per Regulations302.

12.18 Norms  for  investment  and  disclosure  by  Mutual  Funds  in 

 

derivatives348 

12.18.1  Exposure Limits  

12.18.1.1  The  cumulative  gross  exposure  through  equity,  debt  and 

derivative positions should not exceed 100% of the net assets of 

the scheme.  

12.18.1.2  Mutual  Funds  shall  not  write  options  or  purchase  instruments 

with embedded written options. 

12.18.1.3  The  total  exposure  related  to  option  premium  paid  must  not

12.18.1.4  Cash or cash equivalents with residual maturity of less than 91 

days may be treated as not creating any exposure.  

 

12.18.1.5  Exposure  due  to  hedging  positions  may  not  be  included  in  the 

above mentioned limits subject to the following:  

a.  Hedging  positions  are  the  derivative  positions  that  reduce 

possible losses on an existing position in securities and till the 

existing position remains.  

b.  Hedging  positions  cannot  be  taken  for  existing  derivative 

positions. Exposure due to such positions shall have to be added 

and treated under limits mentioned in Point 12.18.1.1.  

c.  Any  derivative  instrument  used  to  hedge  has  the  same 

underlying security as the existing position being hedged.

d.  The  quantity  of  underlying  associated  with  the  derivative 

position  taken  for  hedging  purposes  does  not  exceed  the 

quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been 

taken.  

12.18.1.6  Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla interest rate swaps for 

hedging purposes. The counter party in such transactions has to 

be an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI. Further, the 

value of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the 

value  of  respective  existing  assets  being  hedged  by  the  scheme. 

Exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not 

exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme.  

12.18.1.7  Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes 

in  excess  of  the  underlying  position  against  which  the  hedging 

position  has  been  taken,  shall  be  treated  under  the  limits 

mentioned in point 12.18.1.1.  

 

12.18.1.8  Hedging of Interest Rate Risk  

a.  349To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may 

hedge  the  portfolio  or  part  of  the  portfolio  (including  one  or  more 

securities)  on  weighted  average  modified  duration  basis  by  using 

Interest Rate Futures (IRFs).The maximum extent of short position 

that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio 

or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: 

(Portfolio Modified Duration * Market Value of the Portfolio) 

(Futures Modified Duration * Futures Price / PAR)

b.  In  case  the  IRF  used  for  hedging  the  interest  rate  risk  has  

different underlying  security(s)  than  the  existing  position  being  

hedged,  it  would result in imperfect hedging. 

c.  Imperfect hedging using  IRFs may  be  considered  to  be  exempted  

from the  gross  exposure, upto maximum of 20%  of  the  net  assets  

of  the scheme, subject to the following: 

i.  Exposure to  IRFs is  created only  for  hedging the  interest  

rate risk  based  on  the  weighted  average modified duration  

of  the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio. 

 

ii.  Mutual  Funds  are  permitted  to  resort  to  imperfect  hedging, 

without it being  considered  under  the gross  exposure  limits,  

if and  only  if, the  correlation between  the  portfolio  or  part  

of  the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions,  if  any)and  the  

IRF  is at least  0.9  at  the  time  of  initiation  of  hedge.  In case 

of  any  subsequent  deviation  from  the  correlation  criteria,  the 

same  may  be  rebalanced  within  5  working  days  and  if  not 

rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created 

for  hedging  shall  be  considered  under  the  gross  exposure 

computed in terms of Para 12.18.1.1. The correlation should be 

calculated for a period of last 90 days. 

 

Explanation:  If  the  fund  manager  intends  to  do  imperfect 

hedging upto 15%  of  the  portfolio  using  IRFs on  weighted  

average  modified  duration  basis,  either  of  the  following 

conditions need to be complied with: 

 

(a) 

The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and 

the IRF is at least 0.9 or 

 

171                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

(b) 

The  correlation for  past  90  days between  the  part  of  

the portfolio(excluding the hedged portions,  if  any)i.e. at  

least 15%  of  the  net  asset of  the  scheme(including  one  

or  more securities)and the IRF is at least 0.9. 

iii.  At  no  point  of  time,  the  net  modified  duration  of  part  of  the 

portfolio being hedged should be negative. 

iv.  The portion  of imperfect hedging  in  excess  of  20%  of  the  net 

assets of the scheme should be considered as creating exposure 

and  shall  be  included  in  the  computation  of  gross  exposure  

in terms of 12.18.1.1. 

d.  The  basic characteristics  of  the  scheme  should  not  be  affected 

by hedging the  portfolio or part  of  the  portfolio  (including  one  or  

more securities)based on the weighted average modified duration.  

Explanation:  In  case  of  long  term  bond  fund,  after  hedging  

the portfolio based on the modified duration of the portfolio, the 

net  modified  duration  should  not  be  less  than  the  minimum 

modified duration of the portfolio as required to consider the fund 

as a long term bond fund. 

e.  The interest rate hedging of the portfolio should be in the interest of 

the investors. 

f.  Mutual Fund schemes may imperfectly hedge their portfolio or part 

of their portfolio using IRFs, subject to the following conditions: 

i. 

Prior    to    commencement    of  imperfect    hedging,  existing  

schemes shall comply  with  the  provisions  of  Regulation  18  

(15A)    of    SEBI    (Mutual  Funds)    Regulations,    1996    and    all  

unit  holders  shall  be  given a  time-period of at least 30 days 

 

 

172                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 

 
 

 

 

to exercise the option to exit at prevailing NAV without charging 

 

of exit load.  

 

The    risks    associated    with    imperfect    hedging    shall    be  

disclosed  and explained  by  suitable  numerical  examples in  

the  offer  documents  and also needs to be communicated to the 

investors  through  public  notice  or  any  other 

form  of 

correspondence. 

 

ii. 

In  case  of  new  schemes, the risks  associated  with  imperfect  

hedging  shall    be    disclosed    and    explained    by    suitable  

numerical  examples in  the offer documents 

12.18.2  Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions  

12.18.2.1  Each  position  taken  in  derivatives  shall  have  an  associated 

exposure  as  defined  under.  Exposure  is  the  maximum  possible 

loss  that  may  occur  on  a  position.  However,  certain  derivative 

positions  may  theoretically  have  unlimited  possible 

loss. 

Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as follows:  

Position  
Long Future  

Short Future  

Option bought  

Exposure  
Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of 
Contracts  
Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of 
Contracts  
Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number 
of Contracts.  

12.18.2.2  The provisions shall be applicable for all new schemes launched 

post  the  issue  of  the  aforementioned  guidelines.  For  all  existing 

173                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds

October 01, 2010.  

 
12.19 Interval Schemes/Plans350 

12.19.1  Certain SIDs provide that the subscription to the scheme can be 

made  during  a  specific  period  (known  as  specified  transaction 

period) and the repurchase of units is permitted on all business 

days  subject  to  applicable  loads  (except  for  redemption  during 

specified  transaction  period  when  no  load  is  charged).  These 

schemes are generally referred to as ‘interval schemes’.

depositories shall then consolidate and dispatch the CAS within 

ten days from the month end. 

15.3.2.7   Where statements are presently being dispatched by email either

receive CAS through email, option shall be given to the investor 

to receive the CAS in physical form at the address registered in 

the Depository system. 

15.3.2.8   A proper grievance redressal mechanism shall be put in place by 

the  depositories  and  the  AMCs/MF-RTAs  which  shall  also  be 

communicated  to  the  investors  through  CAS.  AMCs/MF-RTAs 

would  be  accountable  for  the  authenticity  of  the  information 

provided through CAS in respect of MF investments and timely 

sharing of such information with Depositories. The Depositories 

would  be  responsible  for  the  timely  dispatch  of  CAS  to  the 

investors serviced by them and the demat account information. 

15.3.2.9   The  depositories  and  the  AMCs/  MF-RTAs  shall  ensure  data 

integrity and confidentiality in respect of the shared information.

printers,  the  depositories  shall  enter  into  necessary  data 

confidentiality agreements with them.

15.3.2.11 If  an  investor  does  not  wish  to  receive  CAS,  an  option  shall  be 

given  to  the  investor  to  indicate  negative  consent.  Depositories 

shall  accordingly  inform  investors  in  their  statements  from  the 

month of January 2015 about the facility of CAS and give them 

information on how to opt out of the facility if they do not wish to 

avail it. 

15.3.2.12 Where  such  an  option  is  exercised,  the  concerned  depository 

shall  inform  the  AMC/MF-RTA  accordingly  and  the  data  with 

respect to the said investor shall not be shared by the AMC/MF-

RTA with the depository. 

15.3.2.13 If  there  is  any  transaction  in  any  of  the  demat  accounts  of  the 

investor  or  in  any  of  his  mutual  fund  folios,  then  CAS  shall be 

sent  to  that  investor  on  monthly  basis.  In  case  there  is  no 

transaction in any of the mutual fund folios and demat accounts 

then CAS with holding details shall be sent to the investor on half 

yearly basis. However, in case of demat accounts with nil balance 

and no transactions in securities and in mutual fund folios, the 

requirement  to  send  physical  statement  shall  be  applicable  as 

specified in SEBI circular no. CIR/MRD/DP/21/2014 issued on

compliance  by  the  Depository  Participants  with  requirement 

under  Regulation  43  of  SEBI  (Depositories  and  Participants) 

203                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds

/    rewards,    trips,    event    sponsorships    etc.  by  

AMCs/MFs  to  distributors. Further,  a  mention  may  

be  made  in  such  CAS  indicating  that the  commission 

disclosed      is      gross      commission      and      does      not   

exclude costs incurred by distributors  such  as  service  

tax    (wherever    applicable,    as    per    existing    rates), 

operating expenses, etc. 

ii.  The    scheme’s    average    Total    Expense    Ratio    (in

per investor. 

c. Liquidity 

i. 

Liquidity for IAF has to be provided out of the  available funds with the  

scheme  and MFs/ AMCs  should  put  in  place  a  mechanism so that  

adequate balance is  available  in  the  bank  account  of  the scheme  

to    meet  liquidity/    redemption    requirements    under  IAF.  Such 

mechanism may be based on historical trends of instant access. For 

example, AMCs offering IAF may set aside in cash at least 3 times of –

the  higher  of,  last  one  month’s  or  three  month’s  daily  average  of 

redemptions under instant access on a rolling day basis. AMCs should 

also  lay  down  robust  processes  for  continuous  monitoring  and  for 

funding the redemptions under the IAF.

under IAF. 

 
 
d. Disclosures   

i.  AMCs  shall  make  appropriate  disclosures  in  the  scheme  related 

documents  about IAF  and  ensure  that  no  mis-selling  is  done  on  the 

pretext of instant availability of funds to the investors.  

ii.  Appropriate  disclosures shall be made to the investors mentioning the  

scenarios  under  which  IAF  may  be  suspended  and that IAF request  

would    be    processed    as    a  normal  redemption    request  in  such 

circumstances.

e. Approvals and Controls 

 

i.  MFs/  AMCs  shall  offer  IAF  only  after  obtaining  approvals  from  

the AMC   Board   and   the   Trustees and   keep   in   place   adequate 

safeguards in the system to implement this facility.

schemes. 

15.8.2  Use of e-wallet for investment in MFs 

15.8.2.1  With  an  objective  to  promote  digitalization,  MFs/AMCs  can

d.  MFs/  AMCs  shall  ensure  that  total  subscription  through  e-

wallets for an investor is restricted to INR 50,000/-per MF per 

financial year. Further, in  partial  modification  to  the Circular 

CIR/IMD/DF/10/2014  dated  May 22,  2014, the  limit of  INR  

50,000/-would    be  an    umbrella  limit    for  investments  by    an  

investor    through  both  e-wallet    and/or  cash,    per  MF  per 

financial year.

16.7  Certification  Programme  for  sale  and/  or  distribution  of 

mutual fund products396 

16.7.1  With  effect  from  June  01,  2010,  the  certification  examination  for 

distributors, agents or any other persons employed or engaged or to 

be  employed  or  engaged  in  the  sale  and/or  distribution  of  mutual

from  the  AMFI  certification  examination  if  he  had  completed  fifty 

years of age and had at least five years of experience in distribution 

of  mutual  fund  units.  As  per  regulation  4(3)  of  the  Certification

paragraph 16.7.1 above to comply with the requirements for CPE as 

specified by NISM within the validity period of the certificate obtained 

by  passing  the  certification  examination.  However,  to  facilitate  the 

transition  process  from  AMFI  to  NISM,  it  has  been  decided  that  a 

person  holding  a  valid  AMFI  certification  whose  validity  expires

16.8    New cadre of distributors398 

16.8.1  A  new    cadre    of    distributors,  such  as    postal    agents,    retired     

government  and semi-government  officials (class III and  above or 

equivalent) with a service of at least  10 years,  retired teachers with 

a    service  of    at  least  10    years,    retired  bank    officers    with    a  

service  of  at  least  10  years,  and  other  similar  persons (such as

returns  equal  to  or better than their  scheme  benchmark  returns  

during each of the last three years. 

16.8.3  These  new  cadre  of  distributors  would  require  a  simplified  form  

of  NISM certification and AMFI Registration.   

 
 

 

16.9  Developing alternative distribution channels400 

16.9.1  In  order  to  increase  penetration  of  Mutual  Fund  products  and  

to  energise  the distribution network while protecting the interest of 

investors, SEBI had permitted additional  expense  ratio  of  30  bps  

for  garnering  funds  from  B-30  cities.  This development  would  

lead    to    setting    up    of    distribution    infrastructure    by    AMCs. 

However,  in  order  to  achieve  participation  from  all  parts  of  the 

country  in  Mutual  Funds    there    is    greater    need    for    developing  

additional    distribution    channels.  Therefore,  it  has  been  decided 

that:  

a.  Distribution  through  PSU  banks:  PSU  banks  which  have  wide  

bank branches  network  and  have  distribution  reach  in  the  nook  

and  corner  of the country, could play a key role in Mutual Funds  

distribution.  In  order  to  leverage    the    PSU    banks    infrastructure,  

Mutual    Funds/    AMCs    need    to  develop    a    system    for    active  

support    to    PSU    banks    to    distribute    Mutual  Fund    products  

through    them.  Such  active    support  would    also  encourage  PSU 

banks to distribute products of all Mutual Funds.  

b.      Online    distribution:    Online    distribution    not    only    increases 

customer convenience, but also significantly  improves  distributor 

economics.  The  online  phenomenon  is  increasing  rapidly  and  it  is 

observed that more and more  people  especially  younger  generation 

prefers  online  transactions. Therefore, it has  been decided that all

Mutual  Funds should enhance the online  investment  facility  and  

tap    the    internet    savvy    users    to    invest    in  Mutual  Funds  by  

providing  an  online  investment  facility  on  their  websites.  Mutual 

Funds also  need  to tap the burgeoning mobile-only internet users 

for direct distribution of Mutual Fund products. 

16.10 Unique Identity Number 

16.10.1 AMFI  shall  create  a  unique  identity  number  of  the  employee/  

relationship manager/  sales  person  of  the  distributor  interacting  

with    the    investor    for    the  sale    of    mutual    fund    products,    in  

addition  to  the  AMFI  Registration  Number (ARN) of the distributor.   

16.10.2 The  application  form  for  mutual    fund    schemes    shall    have                                          

provision for disclosing the unique identity   number of  such sales 

personnel along with the ARN of distributor.
