1  INDEX FUTURES 

 

 

1.1  Product Design 
 
1.1.1  Underlying 

1.1.2  Eligibility Criteria 

The  benchmark  indices  and  the  various  sectoral  indices  are  permitted  as  per 
eligibility criteria. 
 

The  Exchange  may  consider  introducing  derivative  contracts  on  an  index,  if 
weightage  of  constituent  stocks  of  the  index,  which  are  individually  eligible  for 
derivatives trading, is atleast 80%. However, no single ineligible stock in the index 
shall have a weightage of more than 5% in the index. The index on which futures 
and options contracts are permitted shall be required to comply with the eligibility 
criteria  on  a  continuous  basis.  The  Exchange  shall  check  whether  the  index 
continues to meet the aforesaid eligibility criteria on a monthly basis. If the index 
fails  to  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  three  consecutive  months,  then  no  fresh 
contract  shall  be  issued  on  that  index.  However,  the  existing  unexpired  contracts 
shall be permitted to trade till expiry and new strikes may also be introduced in the 
existing contracts. 
 

The  trading  hours  for  index  futures  would  be  decided  from  time  to  time  by  the 
exchange subject to the condition that the trading hours are between 9 AM and 5 
PM,  and  the  exchange  has  in  place  risk  management  system  and  infrastructure 
commensurate to the trading hours. 
 

1.1.3  Trading Hours 

1.1.4  Size of the Contract 
 

A derivative contract shall have a value of not less than Rs. 2 Lakhs at the time of 
its introduction in the market.  
 

1.1.5  Quotation 

The index futures contract shall be quoted in rupee terms. 
 

1.1.6  Tenor of the contract 

The index futures contract shall have a maximum maturity of 12 months. 
 

1.1.7  Available Contracts 

Monthly maturities from 1 to12 months would be available. 
 

1.1.8  Settlement Mechanism 

The index futures contract shall be settled in Indian Rupees. 
 

 

Page 11 of 156 

 

1.1.9  Settlement Price 

1.1.10  Final Settlement Day 

The settlement price shall be the closing price of the underlying index on the day of 
expiry. The closing price of the underlying index shall be based on last half an hour 
VWAP(Volume  Weighted  Average  Price)  of  the  constituents  of  the  underlying 
index. 
 

The  Stock  Exchanges  have  the  flexibility  to  set  the  expiry  date/day  for  index 
futures. While doing so, the Stock Exchanges shall have to ensure that there is no 
change  in  the  contract  specifications  or  the  risk  management  framework  and  the 
integrity of the market is not affected in any manner. 
 

1.1.11  Application 

The Derivative Exchange/Segment shall submit their proposal for approval of the 
index futures contract to SEBI which shall include: 
a.  the details of proposed derivative contract to be traded on the exchange  
b.  the economic purpose it is intended to serve,  
c.  likely contribution to market development,  
d.  the safeguards and the risk protection mechanism adopted by the exchange to 
ensure market integrity, protection of investors and smooth and orderly trading,  
e.  the  infrastructure  of  the  exchange  and  the  surveillance  system  to  effectively 

monitor trading in such contracts, and  

f.  details of settlement procedures & systems with regard to Index Futures. 
 
 

1.2  Risk Management 
 
Liquid Net Worth and Exposure Limits of a Clearing Member  
The Liquid Net Worth is defined as under:  
total liquid assets deposited with the exchange / clearing corporation / house towards initial 
margin and capital adequacy, LESS  
initial margin applicable to the total gross open positions at any given point of time on all 
trades to be cleared through the clearing member.  
 
The clearing member’s liquid net worth must satisfy both the conditions given below on a 
real time basis:  
Condition 1: Liquid Net Worth shall not be less than Rs 50 lacs at any point of time.  
Condition 2: The mark to market value of gross open positions at any point of time of all 
trades  cleared  through  the  clearing  member  shall  not  exceed  33  1/3  (thirty  three  one  by 
three) times his liquid networth.  
 
The notional value of gross open positions at any point in time in the case of Index Futures 
shall not exceed 33 1/3 (thirty three one by three) times the liquid net worth of a member. 
Exposure limits are in addition to the initial margin requirements.  
A  numerical  example  of  computation  of  capital  adequacy,  exposure  limits  and  initial 
margin requirements is given below; 

 

Page 12 of 156 

 

1. Beginning of day one  
Suppose that the position at the beginning of day one is as follows:  

Member’s Liquid Assets  Cash equivalent deposits 35,00,000  

Securities deposits (net of haircuts) 40,00,000 

Member’s Open Position  200 contracts long in the 3 month contract 
Futures Prices 

3 month contracts is Rs. 1,00,000  
1 month contract is Rs. 98,000 
5% 
Fifth day before expiry of one month contract 

Initial Margin 
Days to expiry 

The margin and capital adequacy calculations will be as follows:  
Initial margin = 5% * 200 * 1,00,000 = 10,00,000  
Total open position = 2,00,00,000  
Total liquid assets will be treated as 70,00,000 only since at least 50% of total liquid assets 
must be in cash equivalents (see Para 4(v)).  
Liquid net worth = 70,00,000 - 10,00,000 = 60,00,0000  
Both conditions of networth and exposure limit are satisfied as shown below:  
Condition 1. 60,00,000 > 50,00,000  
Condition 2. 60,00,000 * 331/3 = (20,00,00,000) > 2,00,00,000. 
 
2. Initiation of spread trade on day one  
Suppose that the member does a calendar spread trade by buying 300 contracts of 3 months 
futures and selling 300 contracts of 1 month futures.  
Since the near month contract of the spread is five days to expiry, the member will have the 
full benefit of spread margining:  
 
Margin on spread = 1% * 300 * 1,00,000 = 3,00,000  
Spread open position 300 * 1,00,000 * 1/ 3 = 1,00,00,000  
Adding the figures for the earlier long position we get: 
Total open position = 2,00,00,000 + 1,00,00,000 = 3,00,00,000  
Liquid net worth = 70,00,000 - 10,00,000 - 3,00,000 = 57,00,000  
Both conditions in para 4(ii) of the circular are satisfied as shown below:  
Condition 1. 57,00,000 > 50,00,000  
Condition 2. 57,00,000 * 331/3= 19,00,00,000 > 300,00,000 
 
1.2.1  Liquid Assets  

At least 50% of the total liquid assets shall be in the form of cash equivalents viz. 
cash,  bank  guarantee,  fixed  deposits,  T-bills  and  dated  government  securities. 
Liquid Assets for the purposes of initial margins as well as liquid net worth would 
include cash, fixed deposits, bank guarantees, Treasury bills, government securities 
or  dematerialized  securities  (with  prescribed  haircuts)  pledged  in  favour  of  the 
exchange / clearing corporation or bank guarantees as defined hereunder. Units of 
money market mutual funds and units of gilt funds may be accepted towards cash 
equivalent component of the liquid assets of a clearing member. The unit shall be 
valued on the basis of its Net Asset Value after applying a hair cut of 10% on the 
NAV and any exit load charged by the mutual fund. The valuation or the marking to 
market of such units shall be carried out on a daily basis.

1.2.2  Bank Guarantees  
The  clearing  corporation  /  house  would  set  an  exposure  limit  for  each  bank,  taking  into 
account all relevant factors including the following:  

a.  The Governing Council or other equivalent body of the clearing corporation / house 
shall lay down exposure limits either in rupee terms or as percentage of the trade 
guarantee fund that can be exposed to a single bank directly or indirectly. The total 
exposure would include guarantees provided by the bank for itself or for others as 
well as debt or equity securities of the bank which have been deposited by members 
as liquid assets for margins or net worth requirement.  

b.  Not  more  than  5%  of  the  trade  guarantee  fund  or  1%  of  the  total  liquid  assets 
deposited  with  the  clearing  house,  whichever  is  lower,  shall  be  exposed  to  any 
single bank which is not rated P1 (or P1+) or equivalent, by a RBI recognised credit 
rating agency or by a reputed foreign credit rating agency, and not more than 50% 
of  the  trade  guarantee  fund  or  10%  of  the  total  liquid  assets  deposited  with  the 
clearing house, whichever is lower, shall be exposed to all such banks put together.  
c.  The  exposure  limits  and  any  changes  thereto  shall  be  promptly  communicated  to 
SEBI. The clearing corporation shall also periodically disclose to SEBI its actual 
exposure to various banks. 

  
1.2.3  Securities 
Equity securities classified under Group I in the underlying cash market may be accepted 
towards liquid assets in the derivative markets. Securities classified under Group I shall be 
those as defined by SEBI from time to time. The equity securities shall be valued/marked 
to market on a daily basis after applying a haircut equivalent to the respective VaR of the 
equity  security.  The  list  of  acceptable  equity  securities  shall  be  updated  on  the  basis  of 
trading and mean impact cost on the 15th of each month. When a security is dropped from 
the list of acceptable equity securities, the existing deposits of that security shall continue 
to be counted towards liquid assets till the end of the month. Equity securities shall be in 
dematerialized form. 
 
Units of all mutual funds may also be accepted as the securities component of liquid assets. 
The unit shall be valued on the basis of its Net Asset Value (NAV) after applying a hair cut 
equivalent to the VaR of the units NAV and any exit load charged by the mutual fund. The 
valuation or the marking to market of such units shall be carried out on a daily basis. The 
valuation / marking to market of all securities, including debt securities, dated government 
securities and T-bills, shall be carried out daily, with appropriate haircuts. 
 
Debt securities shall be acceptable only if they are investment grade. Haircuts shall be at 
least 10% with daily mark to market.  
 
The  total  exposure  of  the  clearing  corporation  to  the  debt  or  equity  securities  of  any 
company shall not exceed 75% of the trade guarantee fund or 15% of the total liquid assets 
of the clearing corporation / house whichever is lower. Exposure for this purpose means the 
mark to market value of the securities less the applicable haircuts. All securities deposited 
for liquid assets shall be pledged in favour of the clearing corporation.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide A. P. (DIR Series) Circular no. 2 dated July 19, 2007 has 
permitted clearing corporations and clearing members – 

a.  to open and maintain demat accounts with foreign depositories and to acquire, hold, 

pledge and transfer the foreign sovereign securities, offered as collateral by FIIs; 

b.  to  remit  the  proceeds  arising  from  corporate  action,  if  any,  on  such  foreign 

sovereign securities; and 

c.  to liquidate such foreign sovereign securities if the need arises. 

Further, Reserve Bank of India vide RBI/2012-13/439 A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 90 
dated March 14, 2013 has permitted FIIs to use, in addition to already permitted collaterals, 
their investments in government securities and corporate bonds as collaterals in the F&O 
segment. 
 
In  light  of  the  above,  FIIs  are  permitted  to  offer  the  following  collaterals  -  government 
securities,  corporate  bonds,  cash  and  foreign  sovereign  securities  with  AAA  ratings,  for 
their transactions in F&O segments. In this regard, the stipulations specified by SEBI and 
RBI with regard to the acceptance of various collaterals shall be adhered to 
 
Clearing members are permitted to accept foreign sovereign securities with ‘AAA’ rating, 
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “sovereign  securities”)  as  collateral  from  FII  client  with  the 
following necessary safeguards: 

i.  Before  accepting  sovereign  securities  as  collateral  from  FII,  the  clearing 
member shall enter into a written agreement with the FII and also with the 
clearing corporation, containing, inter alia, the following terms:  

a. In  the  event  of  any  dispute  regarding  liquidation  or  return  of  the 
sovereign securities tendered as collateral, or any other incidental matter, 
the  courts  in  India  will  have  jurisdiction  to  decide  such  disputes. 
Alternatively, the agreement may contain an arbitration clause. 

b.The agreement shall also contain the right of the clearing corporation as 
well  as  the  clearing  member  to  liquidate  the  sovereign  securities 
tendered as collateral, in the event of default by clearing member or FII, 
as the case may be. 

The  clearing  member  shall  take  due  care  to  ensure  that  the  sovereign 
securities tendered as collateral are available for liquidation in the event of 
insolvency  of  the  FII  or  any  intermediary  or  any  other  person  located 
overseas through whom the securities are held. 
The  clearing  corporation  shall  also  take  due  care  to  ensure  that  sovereign 
securities tendered as collateral are available for liquidation in the event of 
insolvency  of  the  clearing  member  or  any  intermediary  or  other  person 
located overseas through whom the securities are held. 
The  clearing  corporation  shall  take  adequate  care  to  ensure  that  the 
sovereign  securities  accepted  by  it  as  margin  are  tendered  under  a 
mechanism which does not unduly hinder timely liquidation in the event of 
default by the clearing member.

The  clearing  corporation  shall  value  the  collateral  tendered  by  applying  due 
haircuts.  The  haircut  may  either  be  a  fixed  percentage  or  VaR  based.  A  higher 
haircut  may  be  considered  to  cover  the  expected  time  frame  for  liquidation.  A 
market determined price as obtained from an internationally recognized data vendor 
shall be considered for valuation. The prices shall be converted into rupee terms on 
a daily basis. The rupee value so used for conversion shall be the “RBI Reference 
rate”. The RBI reference rate shall be disclosed by the clearing corporation to the 
clearing members, so as to enable them to report the value of the margins collected 
from FIIs. 
 
The sovereign securities tendered as collateral shall be treated as part of the cash 
component of the liquid assets of the clearing member, and shall be subject to the 
condition that the value of the sovereign securities shall not be more than 10% of 
the total value of the cash component of the liquid assets of the clearing member. 
 
The  existing  procedure  for  acceptance  and  release  of  collateral  tendered  by 
domestic  investors  in  the  case  of  domestic  securities  shall  be  adopted  mutatis 
mutandis  for  the  sovereign  securities  tendered  by  FII,  except  to  the  extent 
specifically provided otherwise. 
 
Further,  Clearing  Corporations  while  enabling  the  framework  for  acceptance  of 
corporate bonds as collateral for transactions of any entity, shall ensure that:  
 

The  bonds  shall  have  a  rating  of  AA  or  above  (or  with  similar  rating 
nomenclature) by recognised credit rating agencies.  
The bonds shall be in dematerialized form.  
The bonds shall be treated as part of the non-cash component of the liquid 
assets of the clearing member and shall not exceed 10% of the total liquid 
assets of the clearing member.  
The  bonds  shall  have  a  fixed  percentage  based  or  VaR  based  haircut.  A 
higher  haircut  may  be  considered  to  cover  the  expected  time  frame  for 
liquidation. To begin with the haircut shall be a minimum of 10%.

Initial Margin Computation 

1.2.4 
 
The  Initial  Margin  requirements  are  based  on  worst  scenario  loss  of  a  portfolio  of  an 
individual client to cover 99% VaR over one day horizon across various scenarios of price 
changes and volatility shifts. For Index products, the price scan range is specified at three 
standard deviation (3 sigma) and the volatility scan range is specified at 4%.  
 
The Exponential Weighted Moving Average method (EWMA) shall be used to obtain the 
volatility estimate every day. For Index products the price scan range is specified at three 
standard deviation (3 sigma) and the volatility scan range is specified at 4%. The estimate 
at the end of day t (σt) is estimated using the previous volatility estimate, i.e., as at the end 
of t-1 day (t-1), and the return (rt) observed in the futures market during day t.  

 

Page 16 of 156 

 

 
The formula shall be as under:




t
 
where 
 is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates changes. The value of 
 is fixed at 0.94.  
 (sigma) means the standard deviation of daily returns in the index futures market.  
 
The margins for 99% VaR should be based on three sigma limits (three times the standard 
deviation). The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln (It/It-1) where It is the 
index futures price at time t. The plus/minus three sigma limits for a 99% VaR based on 
logarithmic returns would have to be converted into percentage price changes by reversing 
the logarithmic transformation. The percentage margin on short positions would be equal to 
100(exp (3t)-1) and the percentage margin on long positions would be equal to 100(1-
exp (-3t)). This implies slightly larger margins on short positions than on long positions. 
The derivatives exchange / clearing corporation may apply the higher margin on both the 
buy and sell side.  
 
On the first day of index futures trading the formula given above would require a value of 
t-1,  i.e.  the  estimated  volatility  at  the  end  of  the  day  preceding  the  first  day  of  index 
futures trading. This would be obtained as follows:  

a.  Calculate  the  standard  deviation  of  returns  in  the  cash  index  during  the  last  one 

year.  

b.  Set the volatility estimate at the beginning of that year equal to this average value.  
c.  Move forward through the year, one day at a time, using the formula above to get 

the estimated volatility at the end of that day using cash index prices.  

d.  The estimated volatility by this method at the end of the day preceding the first day 
of index futures trading would be the value of t-1 to be used in the formula given 
above at the end of the first day of futures trading. Thereafter each day’s estimate 
t becomes the t-1 for the next day.  

 
For the first six months of index futures trading, a parallel estimation of volatility would be 
done  using  the  cash  index  prices  and  the  index  futures  prices  and  the  higher  of  the  two 
volatility measures would be used to set margins, however, during the first six months, in 
no case shall the initial margin be less than 5%.  
 
The volatility estimated at the end of the day’s trading would be used in calculating the 
initial margin calls at the end of the same day. The volatility estimation and margin fixation 
methodology  should  be  clearly  made  known  to  all  market  participants  so  that  they  can 
compute what the margin would be for any given closing level of the index. Further, the 
trading software itself should provide this information on a real time basis on the trading 
workstation screen. 
 

 

Page 17 of 156 

 

There is also a minimum margin requirement. For index futures contracts it is specified that 
in no case the initial margin shall be less than 5% of the value of the contract. 

  

1.2.5  Margins for Calendar Spreads 

1.2.6  Exposure Limits 

A calendar spread is a situation in which a position at one maturity is hedged by an 
offsetting  position  at  a  different  maturity  on  the  same  underlying,  e.g.,  a  short 
position in six months contract hedged by a long position in nine month contract. 
The margin on calendar spreads shall be at a flat rate of 0.5% per month of spread 
on  the  far  month  contract  subject  to  a  minimum  margin  of  1%  and  a  maximum 
margin of 3% on the far side of the spread. 
 

It has been prescribed that the notional value of gross open positions at any point in 
time in the case of Index Futures shall not exceed 33 1/3 (thirty three one by three) 
times the liquid net worth of a member. Therefore, the exchanges would be required 
to ensure that 3% of the notional value of gross open position in index futures is 
collected/adjusted  from  the  liquid  networth  of  a  member  on  a  real  time  basis. 
Exposure limits are in addition to the initial margin requirements.  
 

1.2.7  Real Time Computation    

The  computation  of  Worst  Scenario  Loss  has  two  components.  The  first  is  the 
valuation  of  the  portfolio  under  sixteen  scenarios.  At  the  second  stage,  these 
Scenario Contract Values are applied to the actual portfolio positions to compute 
the portfolio values and the initial margin (Worst Scenario Loss). For computational 
ease,  exchanges  are  permitted  to  update  the  Scenario  Contract  Values  only  at 
discrete  time  points  each  day  and  the  latest  available  Scenario  Contract  Values 
would is applied to member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 
  
However,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  most  recent  scenario  are  applied  for 
computation  of  the  portfolio  values  and  the  initial  margin,  the  scenario  contract 
values  shall  be  updated  at  least  5  times  in  the  day,  which  may  be  carried  out  by 
taking the closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and the prices at 
11:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m., and at the end of the trading session. 
 

The positions of clients in both the cash and derivatives segments to the extent they 
offset each other shall be considered for the purpose of cross margining as per the 
following priority: 

a.  Index futures position and constituent stock futures position in derivatives 

segment, 

in cash segment, and 

b.  Index futures position in derivatives segment and constituent stock position 

c.  Stock  futures  position  in  derivatives  segment  and  the  position  in  the 

corresponding underlying in cash segment 
 

1.2.8  Cross Margining 

 

Page 18 of 156 

 

A basket of positions in index constituent stock/stock futures, which is a complete 
replica  of  the  index  in  the  ratio  specified  by  the  Exchange/Clearing  Corporation, 
shall  be  eligible  for  cross  margining  benefit.  The  positions  in  the  derivatives 
segment for the stock futures and index futures shall be in the same expiry month to 
be eligible for cross margining benefit. 
 
A spread margin of 25% of the total applicable margin on the eligible off-setting 
positions, as mentioned above, shall be levied in the respective cash and derivative 
segments. Cross margining benefit shall be computed at client level on an online 
real time basis and provided to the trading member/clearing member/custodian, as 
the case may be, who, in turn, shall pass on the benefit to the client. For institutional 
investors, however, the cross margining benefit shall be provided after confirmation 
of trades. 
 
To avail the facility of cross margining, a client may maintain two accounts with the 
trading  member/clearing  member,  namely  arbitrage  account  and  a  non-arbitrage 
account,  to  allow  converting  partially  replicated  portfolio  into  a  fully  replicated 
portfolio by taking opposite positions in two accounts. However, for the purpose of 
compliance and reporting requirements, the positions across both accounts shall be 
taken together and client shall continue to have unique client code. 
 

A  client  may  settle  through  a  trading  member/clearing  member/custodian,  as  the 
case  may  be,  who  is  clearing  in  both  the  segments  or  through  two  trading 
members/clearing members/custodians, one of whom is a trading member/custodian 
in the cash segment and the other is a clearing member in the derivatives segment. 
However, in course of time, a client will settle through only one clearing member 
who is a member in both the segments. 
 
In the event of default by a trading member/clearing member/custodian, as the case 
may  be,  whose  clients  have  availed  cross  margining  benefit, 
the  Stock 
Exchange/Clearing Corporation shall have the option to: 

a. Hold the positions in the cross margin account till expiry in its own name. 
b. Liquidate the positions/collateral in either segment and use the proceeds to 

meet the default obligation in the other segment. 

 
The Exchange/Clearing Corporation shall enter into agreement with client/clearing 
member/trading  member/custodian,  as  the  case  may  be,  clearly  laying  down  the 
inter-se distribution of liability / responsibility in the event of default. The exchange 
shall also specify the legal agreements between the clearing entities for the purpose 
of margin utilization in case of liquidation/default etc. 
 

The Exchange may offer a choice to the members to opt for payment of Mark to 
Market Margin (MTM) – 

a.  either before the start of trading the next day, i.e., T+0, or

1.2.10  Reporting and Disclosure  

 
If  the  member  opts  for  payment  of  MTM  by  T+1,  then  correspondingly  higher 
initial margin shall be collected by the clearing corporation/house before the start of 
the trading on the next day to cover the potential losses over the time elapsed in the 
collection  of  margins.  The  clearing  corporation/clearing  house  should  lay  down 
operational  guidelines  for  collection  of  margin  and  standard  guidelines  for  back 
office accounting at the level of clearing member and trading member to facilitate 
the detection of non-compliance at each level. The accounting guidelines shall be in 
conformity with the guidelines, if any, issued by SEBI from time to time. The initial 
margin (or the worst scenario loss) plus the calendar spread charge shall be adjusted 
against the available Liquid Net worth of the member who, in turn, shall collect the 
initial margin from their clients. 
 

The derivatives exchange and clearing corporation shall submit quarterly reports to 
SEBI regarding the functioning of the risk estimation methodology highlighting the 
specific  instances  where  price  moves  have  been  beyond  the  estimated  99%  VaR 
limits.  The  clearing  corporation  /  clearing  house  shall  disclose  the  details  of 
incidences  of  failures  in  collection  of  margin  and/or  the  settlement  dues  on  a 
quarterly  basis.  Failure  for  this  purpose  means  a  shortfall  for  three  consecutive 
trading days of 50% or more of the liquid net worth of the member.  
 
Any proposal for changes in the methodology to compute the initial margin should 
be  filed  with  SEBI  and  released  to  the  public  for  comments  along  with  detailed 
comparative  back  testing  results  of  the  proposed  methodology  and  the  current 
methodology. The proposal shall specify the date from which the new methodology 
will  become  effective  and  this  effective  date  shall  not  be  less  than  three  months 
after the date of filing with SEBI. At any time, up to two weeks before the effective 
date,  SEBI  may  instruct  the  derivatives  exchange  and  clearing  corporation/house 
not to implement the change, or the derivatives exchange and clearing corporation/ 
house may on its own decide not to implement the change.  
 
The  derivatives  exchange/segment  of  the  exchange/clearing  corporation/clearing 
house  of  the  exchange  may  choose  to  impose  more  stringent  requirements,  other 
than those prescribed above. 

 
1.3  Surveillance and Disclosures 
 
1.3.1  Unique client code 

The Exchange shall ensure that each client is assigned a client code which is unique 
across all members. The unique client code shall be assigned with the use of PAN 
number. 
 

1.3.2  Position Limits  
1.3.2.1  Market Level 

 

There are no market wide position limits specified for index futures contracts. 

 

Page 20 of 156 

 

 
1.3.2.2  Client Level/ NRI/Sub Accounts 

1.3.2.3  Trading Member/FII/Mutual Fund  

A  self-disclosure  requirement  similar  to  that  in  the  take-over  regulations  is 
prescribed as under:  
Any person or persons acting in concert who together own 15% or more of the open 
interest shall be required to report this fact to the exchange and failure to do so shall 
attract a penalty as laid down by the exchange / clearing corporation / SEBI. 
 

The  trading  member/FII/mutual  fund  position  limits  in  equity  index  futures 
contracts shall be higher of: 
• Rs.500 Crore 
or 
• 15% of the total open interest in the market in equity index futures contracts. 
 
This  limit  would  be  applicable  on  open  positions  in  all  futures  contracts  on  a 
particular underlying index. 
 
In addition to the position limits above, Mutual Funds/FIIs may take exposure in 
equity index derivatives subject to the following limits: 

a.  Short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) 
shall  not  exceed  (in  notional  value)  the  Mutual  Fund’s/FIIs  holding  of 
stocks. 

b.  Long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) 
shall not exceed (in notional value) the Mutual Fund’s/FIIs holding of cash, 
government securities, T-Bills and similar instruments. 

 

1.3.3  Monitoring of Position Limits 
1.3.3.1  NRI/Clients 

The Exchange shall monitor the NRI position limits. The NRI would be required to 
notify  the  names  of  the  Clearing  Member/s  through  whom  it  would  clear  its 
derivative trades to the Exchange. The Exchange would then assign a unique client 
code to the NRI. The Exchange shall monitor the NRI position limits in the manner 
similar to that specified for FIIs and sub-accounts. 

 
1.3.3.2  FII /Sub Accounts 
The  FII  shall  report  to  the  Clearing  Member  (Custodian)  the  extent  of  FII’s  holding  of 
stocks, cash, government securities, T-Bills and similar instruments before the end of the 
day.  The Clearing Member (Custodian) in turn shall report the same to the Exchange.  
 
The Exchange shall then monitor the FII and sub accounts position limits in equity index 
derivative contracts in the manner specified below: 

a.  The  FII  would  be  required  to  notify  the  names  of  the  Clearing  Member/s  and 
Custodian through whom it would clear its derivative trades to exchanges and their 
Clearing House / Clearing Corporation.  

 

Page 21 of 156 

 

b.  A  unique  code  would  be  assigned  by  the  exchanges  and  /  or  the  Clearing 
House/Clearing Corporation to each registered FII intending to trade in derivative 
contracts.  

c.  The FII would be required to confirm all its positions and the positions of all its 
sub-accounts to the designated Clearing Members online but before the end of each 
trading day.  

d.  The designated Clearing Member/s would at the end of each trading day submit the 
details of all the confirmed FII trades to the derivative Segment of the exchange and 
their Clearing House / Clearing Corporation.  

e.  The  exchanges  and  their  Clearing  House  /  Clearing  Corporation  would  then 
compute the total FII trading exposure and would monitor the position limits at the 
end of each trading day. The cumulative FII position may be disclosed to the market 
on a T + 1 basis, before the commencement of trading on the next day.  

f.  In the event of an FII breaching the position limits on any derivative contract on an 
underlying,  the  FII  would  not  be  permitted  by  the  exchanges  and  their  Clearing 
House / Clearing Corporation / Clearing Member/s to take any fresh positions in 
any derivative contracts in that underlying. However, they would be permitted to 
execute off-setting transactions so as to reduce their open position.  

g.  The FIIs while trading for each sub-account would also assign a unique client code 
with  a  prefix  or  suffix  of  the  code  assigned  by  the  exchange  and  their  Clearing 
House  /  Clearing  Corporation  to  the  FII.  The  FII  would  be  required  to  enter  the 
unique sub-account code before executing a trade on behalf of the sub-account.  
 

The sub-account position limits would be monitored by the FII itself, on the same lines as 
the trading member monitors the position limits of its client / customer. The FIIs would 
report any breach on position limits by the sub-account, to the derivative segment of the 
exchange  and  their  Clearing  House  /  Clearing  Corporation  and  the  FII  /  Custodian  / 
Clearing Member/s would ensure that the sub-account does not take any fresh positions in 
any derivative contracts in that underlying. However the sub-account would be permitted to 
execute off-setting transactions so as to reduce its open position.  
 
The exchanges may assign unique sub-account codes on the lines of unique client codes to 
each sub-account of a FII, which would enable the derivative segment of the exchange and 
their Clearing House/Clearing Corporation to monitor the position limits specified for sub-
accounts.  
 
The position limits would be computed on a gross basis at the level of a FII and on a net 
basis at the level of sub-accounts and proprietary positions. 
  
The  open  position  for  all  derivative  contracts  would  be  valued  as  the  open  interest 
multiplied with the closing price of the respective underlying in the cash market. 
 
1.3.3.3  Mutual Funds 

The Mutual Fund shall notify the names of the Clearing Member/s for each scheme 
through whom it would clear its derivative contracts to the Stock Exchange. The 
Stock  Exchange  would  then  assign  a  unique  client  code  to  each  scheme  of  the 

 

Page 22 of 156 

 

Mutual Fund. The Stock Exchange shall monitor the scheme-wise position limits in 
the manner similar to that prescribed for FIIs and their sub-accounts as mentioned 
above. The Mutual Funds will be considered as trading members like registered FIIs 
and  the  schemes  of  Mutual  Funds  will  be  treated  as  clients  like  sub-accounts  of 
FIIs. 

 
1.3.4  Surveillance System 

The surveillance systems of the exchanges should be designed keeping in view all 
the relevant aspects including  the following - 

a.  The  alerts  in  the  online  surveillance  system  should  be  so  designed  that 
indications  of  material  aberrations  from  normal  activity  are  automatically 
generated and thrown up by the system.  

b.  The  parameters  which  need  to  be  monitored    either  through  the  online 
system  or  otherwise  should  inter-alia  include  the  following  parameters  as 
suggested by the Advisory Committee on Derivatives: 

I.  Monitoring  of  open  interest,  cost  of  carry/impact  cost  and 

volatility. 

II.  Monitoring of closing prices.   
III. 

The  open  positions  in  the  derivative  market  should  be  seen  in 
conjunction  with  the  open  positions  in  the  cash  market.  i.e  the 
position deltas should be monitored. 
The timing of disclosure by corporates should be monitored as this 
could  influence  the  prices  of  the  contract  at  the  time  of 
introduction and expiry. 
Strike prices with large open positions should be monitored as this 
could  influence  the  prices  of  the  contract  at  the  time  of 
introduction and expiry. 
Strike  prices  with  large  open  positions  should  be  monitored,  as 
such strike prices could be a target price to be achieved in the cash 
market to derive maximum benefit from the derivative position. 

IV. 

V. 

VI. 

c.  The surveillance systems and processes should be able to  

I.  capture and process client level details. 
II.  develop databases of trading activity by brokers as well as clients. 
III.  generate trading pattern in individual products or group of products 
by a broker over a period of time or by a client / group of clients  
over a period of time. 

IV.  generate the pattern of trading in a product over a period of time 
giving  such  details  as  the  purchases/sales/positions/open  interest 
held by different brokers or clients/group of clients.  

V.  Monitor  proportion  of  trading  in  derivatives  market  vis-à-vis 
trading  in  the  underlying  in  the  cash  market  and  aberrations  as 
compared to historical data and as compared to market average 

VI.  Monitor large trades, call put ratio’s and exercise patterns 

d.  For integration of surveillance in cash and derivatives markets, the persons 
who  carry  out  monitoring/analysis  in  the  derivatives  market  should  have 
access to data of the underlying security in cash market and vice versa. The 

 

Page 23 of 156 

 

 

co-ordination  between  surveillance  and  derivatives  segment  should  ensure 
monitoring  of  positions  at  broker/client  level  across  cash  and  derivatives 
market  with  a  view  to  identifying  possible  fraudulent  or  manipulative 
activity.  

e.  Examination of derivatives trading details should be taken up on the basis of 

cash market surveillance also, and vice versa. 

f.  While  the  surveillance  system  may  be  able  to  generate  a  large  amount  of 
information, it is only the first step towards analysing market behaviour to 
identify potential problems. The exchange surveillance staff should be able 
to  carry  out  quick  and  effective  analysis  of  information  generated  by  the 
surveillance  system,  and  should  document  this  analysis  properly.  The 
documentation  should  be  properly  authenticated  and  verified  by  a 
designated authority of the stock exchange. 

g.  The  information  and  feedback  received  from  broker  inspections  is  vital 
input  for  effective  surveillance.    For  this  it  is  necessary  that  broker 
inspections are taken up in a rational manner keeping in view the level of 
trading  activity,  client  profile,  number  and  nature  of  complaints  received 
against  the  broker,  history  of  risk  management  related  defaults  and 
regulatory  violations  etc.  Information  obtained  through  broker  inspections 
should also be made available to the monitoring/surveillance departments of 
stock exchanges. 

h.  The  information  gathered  by  the  risk  management  departments/clearing 
corporations while enforcing the risk management measures and settlement 
processes  are  critical  inputs.    Such  information  could  include  pattern  of 
defaults  related  to  specific  scrips/contracts  and  special  risk  management 
measures taken keeping in view the market conditions.   

i.  The exchanges should call for information from brokers in a standard form, 
and  preferably  in  electronic  form,  to  facilitate  faster  analysis  as  well  as 
building  up  of  databases.  It  may  also  be  ensured  that  duly  authenticated 
information is submitted by the broker or his designated agent. 

j.  While  implementing  a  stock  watch  type  of  system  for  derivatives,  the 
system  should  be  designed  to  provide  online  access  to  relevant  historical 
data on derivatives trading for at least a year.  

k.  The underlying securities in the derivatives market may be listed on more 
than  one  exchange  and  brokers  dealing  in  such  securities/derivatives  may 
have  membership  in  more  than  one  exchange.  In  the  interest  of  better 
surveillance,  it  is  therefore  necessary  that  relevant  information  obtained 
through  surveillance  at  one  exchange  should  be  shared  with  other 
exchanges.  Exchanges  are,  therefore,  advised  to  share  information  on 
positions  in  underlying  stocks  and  their  derivatives  and  any  extraordinary 
movement  in  price/volume  or  concentration  periodically  or  upon  specific 
request by any stock exchange. 

l.  Exchanges  should  study  surveillance  practices  in  various  Global  Equity 
Derivative  Markets.  Surveillance  practices  in  commodities  and  bullion 
markets  could  also  be  studied  where  appropriate.  Case  studies  on  some 

Page 24 of 156 

market manipulations in various derivatives markets could be looked at in 
order to see what lessons could be drawn. 

Compliance with the above requirements may be indicated in the monthly reports 
on surveillance and investigations submitted by exchanges to SEBI.  
 

1.4  Eligibility Criteria for Derivative Exchange / Derivative Segment of 
the  Exchange,  Trading  Members,  Clearing  Corporation/House  for 
Equity Derivatives  
The exchanges fulfilling the eligibility criteria as prescribed in the Dr. L.C. Gupta 
Committee Report (Chapter 3 of the suggestive Byelaws) may apply to SEBI for 
grant  of  recognition  under  Section  4  of  the  Securities  Contract  Regulation  Act, 
1956. The derivatives exchange/segment should have a separate governing council 
and  representation  of  trading/clearing  members  shall  be  limited  to  maximum  of

The trading members shall be required to have qualified approved user and sales 
person who have passed a Certification Programme approved by SEBI. 
 
The  Dr.  L.C  Gupta  Committee  on  Derivatives  had  permitted  existing  stock 
exchanges  having  cash  trading  to  trade  in  derivative  contracts  through  a  separate 
segment with separate membership. 
 
The derivative segment of an exchange and its Clearing House/Corporation shall be 
separate from the cash segment in the following areas – 

a.  The  legal  framework  governing  trading,  clearing  and  settlement  of  the 
derivative  segment  should  be  separate  from  the  cash  market  segment.  In 
other words, the Regulations and / or Bye-laws of derivative segment, as the 
case may be for specific exchanges, shall be separate from the cash market. 
b.  Trade  Guarantee  Fund  (TGF)/Settlement  Guarantee  Fund  (SGF)  of  the 
derivative  segment  shall  be  separate  from  the  TGF/SGF  of  cash  market 
segment. 

c.  Membership  of  the  derivative  segment  shall  be  separate  from  the  cash 

market segment. 

d.  The  Governing  Council/Clearing  Council/Executive  Committees  of  the 

derivative segments shall be separate from the cash market segment. 

 
The  separation,  if  any,  as  regard  the  functional,  operational  and  administrative 
modalities  shall  be  at  the  discretion  of  the  Exchange.    The  cash  and  derivative 
segment  of  an  Exchange  may  have  common  personnel,  trading  terminal  and 
infrastructure. 
 
The quantum of members to be inspected may be linked to the cost and benefit of 
inspections and the level of activity of members. The Derivative Exchange/Segment 
shall  work  out  an  appropriate  policy  and  plan  for  selecting  members  to  be 
inspected.  The inspection strategy should lay down: 

a.  The criteria for identifying the top members (in terms of level of activity) to 

be taken up for compulsory inspection. 

b.  The  percentage  of  remaining  members  to  be  inspected  selected  on  a 

c.  Mechanisms should ensure that active members do not go un-inspected for 

sampling basis. 

several years in succession. 

 
 The  inspection  policy  and  plan  for  the  year  shall  be  submitted  to  SEBI  for 
approval.

2.2  Risk Management 
 
2.2.1 

Initial Margin Computation  
The Initial Margin requirements shall be based on worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an  individual  client  to  cover  a  99%  VaR  over  a  one  day  horizon.  For  Index 
products, the price scan range is specified at three standard deviation (3 sigma) and 
the  volatility  scan  range  is  specified  at  4%.  There  is  also  a  minimum  margin 
requirement.  For  index  options  a  short  option  minimum  charge  (as  explained 
below) of 3% of the notional value of all short index option has been prescribed. 
 
The  Initial  Margin  requirement  shall  be  netted  at  level  of  individual  client  and  it 
shall be on gross basis at the level of Trading/Clearing Member. The Initial margin 
requirement for the proprietary position of Trading/Clearing member shall also be 
on net basis.  

A  portfolio  based  margining  approach  shall  be  adopted  which  will  takes  an 
integrated  view  of  the  risk  involved  in  the  portfolio  of  each  individual  client 
comprising  of  his  positions  in  index  futures  and  index  options  contracts.  The 
parameters for such a model should include-  
1.  Worst Scenario Loss  
The  worst  case  loss  of  a  portfolio  would  be  calculated  by  valuing  the  portfolio 
under several scenarios of changes in the index and changes in the volatility of the 
index. The scenarios to be used for this purpose would be:

The  price  range  is  defined  to  be  three  standard  deviations  as  calculated  for  VaR 
purposes  in  the  index  futures  market  for  the  near  month  contract.  The  volatility 
range would be taken at 4%.  
 
While  computing  the  worst  scenario  loss,  it  shall  be  assumed  that  the  prices  of 
futures of all maturities on the same underlying index move up or down by the same 
amount.  
 
For the purpose of the calculation of option values, the exchanges may use any of 
the following standard Option Pricing Models – Black-Scholes, Binomial, Merton, 
Adesi-Whaley.  
 
The maximum loss under any of the scenario (considering only 35% of the loss in 
case  of  scenarios  15  and  16)  is  referred  to  in  this  circular  as  the  Worst  Scenario 
Loss.  Subject  to  the  additions  and  adjustments  mentioned  below,  the  Worst 
Scenario Loss is the margin requirement for the portfolio.  
2.  Real Time Computation  
The  computation  of  Worst  Scenario  Loss  has  two  components.  The  first  is  the 
valuation  of  each  option  contract  under  sixteen  scenarios  using  an  appropriate 
option  pricing  model.  The  second  is  the  application  of  these  Scenario  Contract 
Values to the actual positions in a portfolio to compute the portfolio values and the 
Worst  Scenario  Loss.  For  computational  ease,  exchanges  are  permitted  to  update 
the Scenario Contract Values only at discrete time points each day. However, the 
latest  available  Scenario  Contract  Values  would  be  applied  to  member/client 
portfolios on a real time basis. 
3.  Calendar Spread  
The margin for calendar spread would be the same as specified for the index futures 
contracts.  However,  the  margin  shall  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  delta  of  the 
portfolio in each month. Thus, a portfolio consisting of a near month option with a 
delta of 100 and a far month option with a delta of –100 would bear a spread charge 
equal to the spread charge for a portfolio which is long 100 near month futures and 
short  100  far  month  futures.  The  Calendar  Spread  Margin  would  be  charged  in 
addition to the Worst Scenario Loss of the portfolio.  
4.  Short Option Minimum Margin  
The Short Option Minimum Margin equal to 3% of the Notional Value of all short 
index options shall be charged, if sum of the Worst Scenario Loss and the Calendar 
Spread Margin is lower than the Short Option Minimum Margin. In this circular, 
Notional Value of option positions is calculated by applying the last closing price of 
the index futures contract. 
5.  Net Option Value  
The Net Option Value shall be calculated as the current market value of the option 
times  the  number  of  options  (positive  for  long  options  and  negative  for  short 
options) in the portfolio. This Net Option Value shall be added to the Liquid Net 
Worth of the clearing member. This means that the current market value of short 
options will be deducted from the Liquid Net Worth and the market value of long 
options will be added thereto. Thus, market to market gains and losses on option 

Page 30 of 156 

 

positions will get adjusted against the available Liquid Net Worth. Since the options 
are premium style, mark to market gains and losses will not be settled in cash for 
option positions. 
6.  Cash Settlement of Premium  
For option positions, the premium shall be paid in by the buyers in cash and paid 
out to the sellers in cash on T+1 day. 
7.  Unpaid Premium  
Until the buyer pays in the premium, the premium due shall be deducted from the 
available Liquid Net Worth on a real time basis. 
 

The notional value of gross open positions at any point in time in the case of all 
Short  Index  Option  Contracts  shall  not  exceed  33  1/3  (thirty  three  one  by  three) 
times the liquid net worth of a member.

3  STOCK FUTURES 
 
3.1  Product Design 
 
3.1.1  Underlying 

 
3.1.2  Eligibility Criteria 

The  stocks  listed  on  exchanges  which  conform  to  the  eligibility  criteria  are 
permitted. 

A stock on which stock option and single stock future contracts are proposed to be 
introduced shall conform to the following broad eligibility criteria:- 

a.  The  stock  shall  be  chosen  from  amongst  the  top  500  stock  in  terms  of 
average  daily  market  capitalization  and  average  daily  traded  value  in  the 
previous six months on a rolling basis. 

b.  The stock’s median quarter-sigma order size over the last six months shall 
be not less than Rupees10 Lakh. For this purpose, a stock’s quarter-sigma 
order  size  shall  mean  the  order  size  (in  value  terms)  required  to  cause  a 
change in the stock price equal to one-quarter of a standard deviation. 

c.  The market wide position limit (explained later in the circular) in the stock 
shall not be less than Rupees300 crores. Since market wide position limit for 
a stock is computed at the end of every month, the Exchange shall ensure 
that stocks comply with this criterion before introduction of new contracts. 
Further, the market wide position limit (which is in number of shares) shall 
be valued taking the closing prices of stocks in the underlying cash market 
on the date of expiry of contract in the month. 

 
In case circuit filter on a stock is reduced even once during the past six months, on 
account of surveillance action, then that stock should undergo a cooling off period 
of six months before the exchange decides to introduce derivatives on it. 
 
The  Exchange  shall  be  guided  by  the  following  for  the  purpose  of  calculating 
quarter sigma order size in a stock:-  

a.  Quarter sigma order size shall be calculated by taking four snapshots in a 
day  from  the  order  book  of  the  stock  in  the  past  six  months.  These  four 
snapshots  shall  be  randomly  chosen  from  within  four  fixed  ten-minutes 
windows spread through the day.  

b.  The  sigma  (standard  deviation)  or  volatility  estimate  shall  be  the  daily 
closing  volatility  estimate  which  is  also  used  for  day  end  initial  margin 
calculation in derivative contracts on a stock. For stocks on which derivative 
contracts  are  not  traded,  the  daily  closing  volatility  estimate  shall  be 
computed  in  the  manner  specified  by  Prof.  J.R  Varma  Committee  on  risk 
containment  measures  for  Index  Futures.  The  daily  closing  volatility 
estimate value shall be applied to the day’s order book snapshots to compute 
quarter sigma order size.  

 

Page 33 of 156 

 

 

c.  The quarter sigma percentage shall be applied to the average of the best bid 
and offer price in the order book snapshot to compute the order size to move 
price of the stock by quarter sigma.  

a.  The  median  order  size  to  cause  quarter  sigma  price  movement  shall  be 
determined separately for the buy side and the sell side. The average of the 
median order size for the buy and the sell side shall be taken as the median 
quarter sigma order size.  

 
The details of calculation methodology and relevant data shall be made available to 
the public at large on the website of the exchange.  
 
The  quarter  sigma  order  size  in  a  stock  shall  be  calculated  on  the  15th  of  each 
month, on a rolling basis, considering the order book snapshots in the previous six 
months.  Similarly,  the  average  daily  market  capitalization  and  the  average  daily 
traded value shall also be computed on the 15th of each month, on a rolling basis, to 
arrive at the list of top 500 stocks.  
 
The number of eligible stocks may vary from month to month depending upon the 
changes in quarter sigma order sizes, average daily market capitalization & average 
daily traded value calculated every month on a rolling basis for the past six months. 
Options and futures may be introduced on new stocks when they meet the eligibility 
criteria subject to SEBI approval.  
 
Exit criteria for stocks in equity derivatives 
The criteria for retention of stock in equity derivatives segment are as under: 

a.  The stock’s median quarter-sigma order size over last six months shall not 

be less than Rupees 5 lakh. 

b.  MWPL of the stock shall not be less than Rupees 200 crore. 
c.  The stock’s average monthly turnover in derivatives segment over last three 

months shall not be less than Rupees 100 crores. 

 
If a stock fails to meet these retention criteria for three months consecutively, then 
no  fresh  month  contract  shall  be  issued  on  that  stock.  However,  the  existing 
unexpired contracts may be permitted to trade till expiry and new strikes may also 
be introduced in the existing contract months. 
 
Further, once the stock is excluded from the F&O list, it shall not be considered for 
re-inclusion for a period of one year. 
 
A stock which is dropped from derivatives trading may become eligible once again. 
In  such  instances,  the  stock  is  required  to  fulfill  the  eligibility  criteria  for  three 
consecutive months (instead of one month as specified earlier) to be re-introduced 
for derivatives trading. Derivative contracts on such stocks may be re-introduced by 
the exchange subject to SEBI approval. 
 

Page 34 of 156 

 

The  Exchange  may  compulsorily  close  out  all  derivative  contract  positions  in  a 
particular  underlying  when  that  underlying  has  ceased  to  satisfy  the  eligibility 
criteria or the exchange is of the view that the continuance of derivative contracts 
on such underlying is detrimental to the interest of the market keeping in view the 
market  integrity  and  safety.  The  decision  of  such  forced  closure  of  derivative 
contracts shall be taken in consultation with other exchanges where such derivative 
contracts are also traded and shall be applied uniformly across all exchanges.

Single  Stock  Futures  contract  shall  have  maturity  of  three  months  and  three 
contracts  of  maturity  of  one-month,  two-month  and  three-month  would  be 
introduced  simultaneously.  Therefore,  at  any  point  in  time  at  least  three  Single 
Stock Futures contracts on a particular underlying would be available for trading. 

or 

The Stock Exchanges have the flexibility to offer: 

a.  Cash  settlement  (settlement  by  payment  of  differences)  for  both  stock 

b.  Physical  settlement  (settlement  by  delivery  of  underlying  stock)  for  both 

options and stock futures; or 

stock options and stock futures; or 

c.  Cash settlement for stock options and physical settlement for stock futures; 

d.  Physical settlement for stock options and cash settlement for stock futures. 

 
A  Stock  Exchange  may  introduce  physical  settlement  in  a  phased  manner.  On 
introduction,  however,  physical  settlement  for  all  stock  options  and/or  all  stock 
futures, as the case may be, must be completed within six months. The settlement 
mechanism  shall  be  decided  by  the  Stock  Exchanges  in  consultation  with  the 
Depositories. 
 
On  expiry  /  exercise  of  physically  settled  stock  derivatives,  the  risk  management 
framework  (i.e.,  margins  and  default)  of  the  cash  segment  shall  be  applicable. 
Settlements  of  cash  and  equity  derivative  segments  shall  continue  to  remain 
separate. 
 
The Stock Exchanges interested to introduce physical settlement should: 

a.  put in place proper systems and procedures for smooth implementation of 

physical settlement. 

b.  make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations 

for implementation of physical settlement. 

c.  bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of all categories of market 

participants, including the general public, and also to disseminate the 

d.  same on their websites. 

 
The Stock Exchanges interested to offer physical settlement should submit to SEBI 
for  approval,  a  detailed  framework  for  implementation  of  physical  settlement  of 
stock  derivatives.After  opting  for  a  particular  mode  of  settlement  for  stock 
derivatives,  a  Stock  Exchange  may  change  to  another  mode  of  settlement  after 
seeking prior approval of SEBI.

3.2.3  Exposure Limits    

Initial margin or worst scenario loss 
The Initial Margin requirements are based on worst scenario loss of a portfolio of 
an  individual  client  to  cover  99%  VaR  over  one  day  horizon  across  various 
scenarios of price changes and volatility shifts.  
 
In the case of Single Stock Futures, the initial margin would be computed as the 
worst scenario loss of a portfolio comprising of all the positions of a client in all the 
futures and options contracts. For Single Stock Futures, the price scan range would 
be 3.5 Standard Deviation (3.5 sigma) and in no case the initial margin for Single 
Stock  Futures  contract  shall  be  less  than  7.5%  of  the  value  of  the  Single  Stock 
Futures  contract.  The  SPAN  margining  system,  which  has  been  adopted  by  both 
BSE  &  NSE,  does  not  have  the  provision  to  provide  for  charging  a  minimum 
margin of 7.5% for futures contracts. However, in order to achieve the requirement 
of  minimum  margin  for  the  Single  Stock  Futures  contract,  the  price  scan  range 
would be adjusted so as to ensure that the initial margin for Single Stock Futures 
contracts does not fall below 7.5% in any scenario. The standard deviation would be 
calculated as per the methodology specified in the index futures.  
 
The  Initial  Margin  requirement  shall  continue  to  be  netted  at  level  of  individual 
client  and  shall  be  calculated  on  a  gross  basis  at  the  level  of  Trading/Clearing 
Member.  The  Initial  margin  requirement  for 
the  proprietary  position  of 
Trading/Clearing member shall be calculated on a net basis. 
 

The margin on calendar spread is calculated on the basis of delta of the portfolio 
consisting of futures and option contract in each month. Thus, a portfolio consisting 
of a near month option with a delta of 100 and a far month option with a delta of –
100 would bear a spread charge equal to the spread charge for a portfolio which is 
long 100 near month futures and short 100 far month futures. The Calendar Spread 
Margin is charged in addition to the Worst Scenario Loss of the portfolio. 
 
The margin on calendar spreads shall be at a flat rate of 0.5% per month of spread 
on  the  far  month  contract  subject  to  a  minimum  margin  of  1%  and  a  maximum 
margin of 3% on the far side of the spread. 
  

The  value  of  gross  open  positions  at  any  point  in  time  in  all  the  Single  Stock 
Futures contracts shall not exceed 20 (twenty) times the available liquid net worth 
of a member. Therefore, the exchanges would be required to ensure that higher of 
5% or 1.5 (standard deviation) of the notional value of gross open position in Single 
Stock Futures contracts is collected /adjusted from the liquid net worth of a member 
on  a  real  time  basis.  Exposure  limits  are  in  addition  to  the  initial  margin 
requirements. For the purpose of computing 1.5 standard deviations, the standard 
deviation of daily logarithmic returns of prices in the underlying stock in the cash 

 

Page 38 of 156 

 

3.2.4  Real Time Computation    

market in the last six months shall be computed. This value shall be applicable for a 
month and shall be re-calculated at the end of the month by once again taking the 
price data on a rolling basis for the past six months.  
 

The  computation  of  Worst  Scenario  Loss  has  two  components.  The  first  is  the 
valuation  of  the  portfolio  under  sixteen  scenarios.  At  the  second  stage,  these 
Scenario Contract Values are applied to the actual portfolio positions to compute 
the portfolio values and the initial margin (Worst Scenario Loss). For computational 
ease,  exchanges  are  permitted  to  update  the  Scenario  Contract  Values  only  at 
discrete  time  points  each  day  and  the  latest  available  Scenario  Contract  Values 
would is applied to member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 
  
However,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  most  recent  scenario  are  applied  for 
computation  of  the  portfolio  values  and  the  initial  margin,  the  scenario  contract 
values  shall  be  updated  at  least  5  times  in  the  day,  which  may  be  carried  out  by 
taking the closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and the prices at 
11:00  a.m.,  12:30  p.m.,  2:00  p.m.,  and  at  the  end  of  the  trading  session.  For  the 
purpose of computing worst scenario loss on a portfolio, the price scan range for 
stock option and single stock future contracts shall be linked to liquidity, measured 
in terms of impact cost for an order size of Rs.5 Lakh, calculated on the basis of 
order book snapshots in the previous six months. Accordingly, if the mean value of 
impact cost exceeds 1%, the price scanning range would be scaled up by square root 
of three. This would be in addition to the requirement of scaling up for the look-
ahead  period  i.e.  the  time  in  which  mark  to  market  margin  is  collected.  The 
guidance  for  computation  of  impact  cost  for  an  order  size  of  Rs.5  Lakhs  is  as 
under:- 
Impact  cost  shall  be  calculated  by  taking  four  snapshots  in  a  day  from  the  order 
book in the past six months. These four snapshots shall be randomly chosen from 
within four fixed ten-minutes windows spread through the day.  
The impact cost shall be the percentage price movement caused by an order size of 
Rs.5  Lakh  from  the  average  of  the  best  bid  and  offer  price  in  the  order  book 
snapshot. The impact cost shall be calculated for both, the buy and the sell side in 
each order book snapshot.  
The mean of the impact cost for both the buy and the sell side in each order book 
snapshot in the past six months shall be computed to determine the applicable price 
scan range in the stock. The details of calculation methodology and relevant data 
shall be made available to the public at large through the website of the Exchanges.  
The mean impact cost shall be calculated at 15th of each month on a rolling basis 
considering  the  order  book  snapshots  of  the  previous  six  months.  If  the  mean 
impact cost or a stock moves from less than or equal to 1% to more than 1%, the 
price scan range in such stock should be scaled up by square root of three and the 
scaling should be dropped when the impact cost drops to 1% or less. Such changes 
will be applicable on all existing open position within three days from the 15th of 
each month.

It is clarified that for stocks which have a mean value of impact cost greater than 
1%, in addition to the price scanning range, the minimum initial margin for single 
stock futures contracts shall also be scaled up by square root of three. In the absence 
of  trading  in  the  last  half  an  hour  the  theoretical  price  would  be  taken  for  the 
collection  of  MTM  margin.  The  Derivative  Exchanges/Segment  shall  define  the 
methodology  of  calculating  the  ‘theoretical  price’  at  the  time  of  making  an 
application for approval of the stock futures contract to SEBI and methodology for 
calculating the ‘theoretical price’ would also be disclosed to the market. In addition, 
the exchange shall also specify the methodology for arriving at the closing price at 
the time of expiry.

3.3.2.1  Market Level 

Same as that for index future contracts as specified in Section 1.3.1. 
 

The market wide position limit for single stock futures and stock option contracts 
shall be linked to the free float market capitalization and shall be equal to 20% of 
the number of shares held by non-promoters in the relevant underlying security (i.e., 
free-float holding). This limit would be applicable on aggregate open positions in 
all futures and all option contracts on a particular underlying stock. 
 
The Exchange is advised to enforce the market wide limits through administrative 
measures, in the manner detailed below: 

a.  At  the  end  of  each  day  the  Exchange  shall  test  whether  the  market  wide 
open interest for any scrip exceeds 95% of the market wide position limit for 
that  scrip.  If  so,  the  Exchange  shall  take  note  of  open  position  of  all 
client/TMs as at the end of that day in that scrip, and from next day onwards 
the  members/client  shall  trade  only  to  decrease  their  positions  through 
offsetting positions. While the Exchange will take this action only at end of 
day, they shall disclose real time information about the market wide open 
interest as a percentage of the market wide position limits. 

b.  At the end of each day during which the ban on fresh positions is in force 
for  any  scrip,  the  Exchange  shall  test  whether  any  member  or  client  has 
increased his existing positions or has created a new position in that scrip. If 
so, that client shall be subject to a penalty equal to a specified percentage (or 
basis points) of the increase in the position (in terms of notional value). The 
penalty  shall  be  recovered  before  trading  begins  next  day.  The  Exchange 
shall specify the percentage or basis points, which shall be set high enough 
to deter violations of the ban on increasing positions. 

c.  The normal trading in the scrip shall be resumed after the open outstanding 

position comes down to 80% or below of the market wide position limit. 

 
With  a  view  to  operationalise  implementation  of  monitoring  of  Market  Wide 
Position Limits across Exchanges, the following procedure shall be followed: 

 
At the latest on

data to other Exchanges and after correction, disseminate 
the final data on the web. 

The  above  data  shall  be  in  a  machine  readable,  open  format  (preferably  XML 
format).  
 
Further, the Exchange shall check on a monthly basis, whether a stock has remained 
subject to the ban on new position for a significant part of the month consistently 
for three months. If so, then the Exchange shall phase out derivative contracts on 
that underlying. 

3.3.2.2  Customer Level/ NRI/Sub Accounts 

The gross open position across all derivative contracts on a particular underlying 
stock should not exceed the higher of:  
1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares).  
or 
5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock 
(in terms of number of contracts).  
 

a.  These position limits would be applicable on the combined position in all 

derivative contracts on an underlying stock at an exchange. 

b.  This  requirement  may  not  be  monitored  by  the  exchange  on  a  real  time 
basis, but if during any investigation or otherwise, any violation is proved, 
penalties can be levied.

4.2  Risk Management 
 
4.2.1 
 

Initial Margin Computation:  

The Initial Margin requirements are based on worst scenario loss of a portfolio of 
an  individual  client  to  cover  99%  VaR  over  one  day  horizon  across  various 
scenarios of price changes and volatility shifts. For stock option contracts the price 
scan range is specified at three and a half standard deviation (3.5 sigma) and the 
volatility  scan  range  is  specified  at  10%.  There  is  also  a  minimum  margin 
requirement. A short option minimum charge of 7.5% of the notional value of all 
short stock option contracts has been prescribed. 

 

4.2.2  Portfolio Based Margining 

Same as that for index option contacts as given in section 2.2.2. 
 

4.2.3  Exposure Limits    

It has been prescribed that the notional value of gross open positions at any point in 
time in the case of Stock Option Contracts, the notional value of gross short open 
position at any point in time shall not exceed 20 (twenty) times the liquid net worth 
of  a  member.  Exposure  limits  are  in  addition  to  the  initial  margin  requirements. 
Therefore,  the  exchanges  are  required  to  ensure  that  5%  of  the  notional  value  of 
gross open position in the case of stock option contracts is collected /adjusted from 
the liquid net worth of a member on a real time basis. It is further clarified that the 
notional  value  of  the  options  contract  would  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the 
previous day’s closing value of the underlying.

d.  such bank shall abide by circulars and directions issued by RBI and SEBI in 

respect of dealing of such banks in the Exchange." 

 
5.2  Risk Management Measures 

 

 

5.2.1 

In exchange traded derivative contracts, the Clearing Corporation acts as a central 
counterparty  to  all  trades  and  performs  full  novation.  The  risk  to  the  clearing 
corporation  can  only  be  taken  care  of  through  a  stringent  margining  framework. 
Also,  since  derivatives  are  leveraged  instruments,  margins  also  act  as  a  cost  and 
discourage  excessive  speculation.  A  robust  risk  management  system  should 
therefore, not only impose margins on the members of the clearing corporation but 
also enforce collection of margins from the clients. 

Initial Margin 
The Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an individual client across various scenarios of price changes. The various scenarios 
of price changes would be so computed so as to cover a 99% VaR over a one day 
horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be fixed at 3.5 
standard deviation. The initial margin so computed would be subject to a minimum 
of  1.75%  on  the  first  day  of  currency  futures  trading  and  1  %  thereafter  for  US 
Dollar – Indian Rupee (US$-INR) contract, minimum of 2.80% on the first day of 
currency  futures  trading  and  2  %  thereafter  for  Euro-Indian  Rupee  (EUR-INR) 
contract, minimum of 3.20% on the first day of trading and 2% thereafter for Pound 
Sterling – Indian Rupee (GBP-INR) contract, minimum of 4.50% on the first day of 
trading and 2.30% thereafter  for Japanese Yen – Indian Rupee (JPY-INR) contract. 
The  initial  margin  shall  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  net  worth  of  the  clearing 
member on an online, real time basis. 
 

 

Page 50 of 156 

5.2.2  Formula for determining standard deviation 

The empirical tests of different risk management models in the Value at Risk (VaR) 
framework in the Re/$ exchange rate were examined. Data for the period January 2, 
1998 to April 7, 2008 was analyzed. GARCH-GED (Generalized Auto-Regressive 
Conditional  Heteroscedasticity  with  Generalized  Error  Distribution  residuals), 
GARCH-normal  and  GARCH-t  at  3  and  3.5  sigma  levels  were  found  to  perform 
well  even  at  1%  risk  level,  while  the  EWMA(Exponentially  Weighted  Moving 
Average) model used in J.P. Morgan’s Risk Metrics® methodology was found to 
work well at 1 % risk level only at 3.5 sigma levels. 

 

 

 

 

Given the computational ease of the EWMA model and given the familiarity of the 
Exchanges  with  this  particular  model  (it  is  currently  being  used  in  the  equity 
derivatives  market),  the  Committee,  after  considering  the  various  aspects  of  the 
different models, recommends the following:- 

The  exponential  moving  average  method  would  be  used  to  obtain  the  volatility 
estimate every day. The estimate at the end of time period t (σt) is estimated using 
the volatility estimate at the end of the previous time period. i.e. as at the end of  t-1 
time period (σt-1), and the return (rt) observed in the futures market during the time 
period t. The formula would be as under:  
 
(σt)2 = λ (σt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rt)2 

where 
λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates changes. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.  

σ (sigma) means the standard deviation of daily returns in the currency futures 
market.  

ii.  The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Ct/Ct-1) where Ct is 
the  Currency  futures  price  at  time  t.  The  plus/minus  3.5  sigma  limits  for  a 
99%  VAR  based  on  logarithmic  returns  would  have  to  be  converted  into 
percentage  price  changes  by  reversing  the  logarithmic  transformation.  The 
percentage  margin  on  short  positions  would  be  equal  to  100(exp  (3.5  σt)-1) 
and the percentage margin on long positions would be equal to 100(1-exp (-
3.5σt)).  This  implies  slightly  larger  margins  on  short  positions  than  on  long 
positions. The derivatives exchange/clearing corporation may apply the higher 
margin on both the buy and sell side.  

iii.  During the first time period on the first day of Currency futures trading, the 

sigma would be equal to 0.5%.  

iv.  The volatility estimation and margin fixation methodology should be clearly 
made  known  to  all  market  participants  so  that  they  can  compute  what  the 
margin  would  be  for  any  given  closing  level  of  the  currency  futures  price. 
Further, the trading software itself should provide this information on a real 
time basis on the trading workstation screen. 

i.

5.2.3  Portfolio based margining  

5.2.4  Real time computation 

5.2.5  Calendar spread margins 

A portfolio based margining approach shall be adopted to take an integrated view of 
the risk involved in the portfolio of each individual client comprising his positions 
in futures contracts across different maturities. The client-wise margins would be 
grossed  across  various  clients  at  the  Trading/Clearing  Member  level.  The 
proprietary positions of the Trading/Clearing Member would be treated as that of a 
client. 
 

The computation of worst scenario loss would have two components. The first is 
the valuation of the portfolio under the various scenarios of price changes. At the 
second stage, these scenario contract values would be applied to the actual portfolio 
positions  to  compute  the  portfolio  values  and  the  initial  margin.  The  exchanges 
shall update the scenario contract values at least 5 times in the day, which may be 
carried out by taking the closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and 
the prices at 11:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and at the end of the trading session. 
The  latest  available  scenario  contract  values  would  be  applied  to  member/client 
portfolios on a real time basis. 
 

A  currency  futures  position  at  one  maturity  which  is  hedged  by  an  offsetting 
position at a different maturity would be treated as a calendar spread. The calendar 
spread margin shall be at a value of Rs. 400 for a spread of 1 month; Rs 500 for a 
spread of 2 months, Rs 800 for a spread of 3 months and Rs 1000 for a spread or 4 
months or more for the US Dollar – Indian Rupee (US$-INR) contract; the calendar 
spread margin shall be at a value of Rs. 700 for a spread of 1 month; Rs 1000 for a 
spread of 2 months and Rs 1500 for a spread of 3 months or more for the Euro-
Indian Rupee (EUR-INR) contract; the calendar spread margin shall be at a value of 
Rs. 1500 for a spread of 1 month; Rs 1800 for a spread of 2 months and Rs 2000 for 
a spread of 3 months or more for the Pound Sterling – Indian Rupee (GBP-INR) 
contract; the calendar spread margin shall be at a value of Rs. 600 for a spread of 1 
month; Rs 1000 for a spread of 2 months and Rs 1500 for a spread of 3 months or 
more for the Japanese Yen – Indian Rupee (JPY-INR) contract. The benefit for a 
calendar  spread  would  continue  till  expiry  of  the  near  month  contract.  For  a 
calendar spread position, the extreme loss margin shall be charged on one third of 
the mark to market value of the far month contract. 
 

Extreme loss margin of 1% for the US Dollar – Indian Rupee (US$-INR) contract, 
0.3% for the Euro-Indian Rupee (EUR-INR) contract, 0.5% for the Pound Sterling – 
Indian Rupee (GBP-INR) contract and 0.7% for the Japanese Yen – Indian Rupee 
(JPY-INR) contract on the mark to market value of the gross open positions shall be 
deducted  from  the  liquid  assets  of  the  clearing  member  on  an  on  line,  real  time 
basis.  
 

5.2.6  Extreme Loss margin 

 

Page 52 of 156 

 

5.2.7  Liquid networth 

The initial margin and the extreme loss margin shall be deducted from the liquid 
assets  of  the  clearing  member.  The  clearing  member’s  liquid  net  worth  after 
adjusting  for  the  initial  margin  and  extreme  loss  margin  requirements  must  be  at 
least  Rs.  50  Lakhs  at  all  points  in  time.  The  minimum  liquid  networth  shall  be 
treated as a capital cushion for days of unforeseen market volatility.  
 

The liquid assets for trading in currency futures would be maintained separately in 
the currency futures segment of the clearing corporation. However, the permissible 
liquid assets, the applicable haircuts and minimum cash equivalent norms would be 
mutatis mutandis applicable from the equity derivatives segment.  
 

5.2.8  Liquid assets 

5.2.9  Mark to market settlement 

5.2.10  Margin collection and enforcement 

The  mark  to  market  gains  and  losses  shall  be  settled  in  cash  before  the  start  of 
trading on T+1 day. If mark to market obligations are not collected before start of 
the next day’s trading, the clearing corporation shall collect correspondingly higher 
initial margin to cover the potential for losses over the time elapsed in the collection 
of margins.  
 
The daily closing price of currency futures contract for mark to market settlement 
would be calculated on the basis of the last half an hour weighted average price of 
the futures contract. In the absence of trading in the last half an hour the theoretical 
price  would  be  taken.  The  eligible  exchanges  shall  define  the  methodology  for 
calculating the ‘theoretical price’ at the time of making an application for approval 
of  the  currency  futures  contract  to  SEBI.  The  methodology  for  calculating  the 
‘theoretical price’ would also be disclosed to the market.  
 

The client margins (initial margin, extreme loss margin, calendar spread margin and 
mark to market settlements) have to be compulsorily collected and reported to the 
Exchange  by  the  members.  The  Exchange  shall  impose  stringent  penalty  on 
members who do not collect margins from their clients. The Exchange shall also 
conduct regular inspections to ensure margin collection from clients. 
 

The Clearing Corporation should segregate the margins deposited by the Clearing 
Members  for  trades  on  their  own  account  from  the  margins  deposited  with  it  on 
client  account.  The  margins  deposited  on  client  account  shall  not  be  utilized  for 
fulfilling the dues which a Clearing Member may owe the Clearing Corporation in 
respect of trades on the member’s own account. The client’s money is to be held in 
trust for client purpose only. The following process is to be adopted for segregating 
the client’s money vis-à-vis the clearing member’s money: 
 
i 

At the time of opening a position, the member should indicate whether it is a 
client or proprietary position.  

5.2.11  Safeguarding client’s money 

 

Page 53 of 156 

ii  Margins across the various clients of a member should be collected on a gross 

basis and should not be netted off. 

iii  When a position is closed, the member should indicate whether it was a client 

or his own position which is being closed. 
In the case of default, the margins paid on the proprietary position would only 
be used by the Clearing Corporation for realising its dues from the member. 

iv 

 
5.2.12  Periodic risk evaluation report 

The  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Exchange  shall  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  atleast 
once in every six months, conduct back testing of the margins collected vis-à-vis 
the actual price changes. A copy of the study shall be submitted to SEBI along with 
suggestions on changes to the risk containment measures, if any.

5.3  Surveillance and Disclosures 
 

 
5.3.1  Unique client code 

 
5.3.2  Position limits 

 

 

 

The exchanges as first level regulators should have an online surveillance capability 
which  monitors  positions,  prices  and  volumes  in  real  time  so  as  to  deter  market 
manipulation.  

The Exchange shall ensure that each client is assigned a client code which is unique 
across all members. The unique client code shall be assigned with the use of PAN 
number. 

Position limits act as an important surveillance measure designed to prevent large 
concentrated positions which may affect market integrity. However, the regulation 
of position limits needs to be viewed differently in the currency futures market as 
compared  to  the  equity  derivatives  market.  In  the  equity  derivatives  market,  the 
maximum underlying shares available for trading is restricted to the extent of the 
free float market capitalization, whereas, there is no such constraint in the foreign 
exchange market.  
 
The two markets also differ in terms of participation and the extent of positions held 
by each participant. Large transactions are executed by banks and corporates who 
wish to hedge their underlying exposure. Therefore, the monitoring of limits has to 
be with respect to the overall open interest in the market. Open interest is a dynamic 
measure  which  changes  with  every  executed  trade.  Further,  the  objective  of  the 
position  limits  in  the  currency  futures  market  would  be  more  to  detect  market 
manipulation in the futures market rather than to address the threat of short squeeze 
in  the  underlying.  Therefore,  the  following  is  being  proposed  with  respect  to 
monitoring and enforcement of position limits in the currency futures market: 
 

a.  Ideally, position limits have to be monitored on an online, real-time basis. 
However,  the  exchanges  have  represented  that  open  interest  of  both  the 
participant and the market are dynamic and therefore, monitoring on a real-
time basis would be difficult. Therefore, to begin with, positions during the 
day  shall  be  monitored  based  on  the  total  open  interest  at  the  end  of  the 
previous day’s trade.  

b.  The above monitoring should be for both client level positions (based on the 

unique client code) and for trading member level positions.  

c.  The exchange shall treat violation of position limits as an input for further 
surveillance action. Upon detecting large open positions, the exchange shall 
conduct  detailed  analysis  based  on  the  overall  nature  of  positions,  the 
trading strategy, positions in the underlying market, the positions of related 
entities (concept of persons acting in concert would be applied), etc.  

Page 55 of 156 

 

 

 

 

d.  The violators of position limits shall be accountable for their large positions 
and should submit detailed information pertaining to their trading activities 
whenever the information is sought by the exchange. The clearing member 
would  be  accountable  for  positions  of  all  trading  members  and  clients  of 
trading members clearing through him. Similarly, the trading member would 
be accountable for the positions of his clients. The exchange may also call 
for information directly from the client itself. 

The following position limits would be applicable in the currency futures market: 
 
US Dollar – Indian Rupee (US$-INR) Contract 
 
Client Level: The gross open positions of the client across all contracts should not 
exceed 6% of the total open interest or 10 million USD whichever is higher. The 
Exchange  will  disseminate  alerts  whenever  the  gross  open  position  of  the  client 
exceeds 3% of the total open interest at the end of the previous day’s trade.

The surveillance systems of the exchanges should be designed keeping in view all 
the relevant aspects including the following - 

5.3.3  Surveillance system 

 

  

 

a.  The alerts in the online surveillance system should automatically generate 

material aberrations from normal activity.  

b.   The surveillance systems and processes should be able to  
1.  monitor open interest, cost of carry and volatility  
2.  monitor closing prices  

Page 57 of 156 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. 
4. 
5. 

capture and process client level details 
develop databases of trading activity by brokers as well as clients.  
generate trading pattern by a broker over a period of time or by a 
client/ group of clients  over a period of time 

c.  The  information  and  feedback  received  from  member  inspections  is  vital 
input  for  effective  surveillance.    For  this,  it  is  necessary  that  member 
inspections are taken up in a rational manner keeping in view the level of 
trading  activity,  client  profile,  number  and  nature  of  complaints  received 
against  the  member,  history  of  risk  management  related  defaults  and 
regulatory violations etc. Information obtained through member inspections 
should also be made available to the monitoring/surveillance departments of 
stock exchanges.  

d.  The  information  gathered  by  the  risk  management  departments/clearing 
corporations while enforcing the risk management measures and settlement 
processes  are  critical  inputs.    Such  information  could  include  pattern  of 
defaults related to specified contracts and special risk management measures 
taken keeping in view the market conditions.   

e.  The  exchanges  should  call  for  information  from  members  in  a  standard 
form, and preferably in electronic form, to facilitate faster analysis as well 
as building up of databases. It may also be ensured that duly authenticated 
information is submitted by the member or his designated agent. 

f.  While implementing a stock watch type of system for currency futures, the 
system  should  be  designed  to  provide  online  access  to  relevant  historical 
data on derivatives trading for at least a year.  

g.  In the interest of better surveillance, it is necessary that relevant information 
obtained through surveillance at one exchange should be shared with other 
exchanges.  Exchanges  are,  therefore,  advised  to  share  information  on 
positions  in  currency  futures  and  any  extraordinary  movement  in  price  / 
volume or concentration periodically or upon specific request by any stock 
exchange. The Clearing Corporations of the various eligible exchanges must 
meet  periodically,  say  once  a  week,  to  discuss  market  integrity  and  other 
surveillance issues.  

h.  Exchanges  should  study  surveillance  practices  in  various  Global  Forex 
Derivative  Markets.  Surveillance  practices  in  commodities  and  bullion 
markets  could  also  be  studied  where  appropriate.  Case  studies  on  some 
market manipulations in various derivatives markets could be looked at to 
see what lessons could be drawn. Periodical benchmarking, at least once in 
every six months, against international practices, systems performance etc., 
must be performed and documented.   

Page 58 of 156 

 

The  reporting  of  currency  derivative  transactions  to  the  media  and  the  newspapers 
should  be  in  a  uniform  format.  Accordingly,  the  Currency  Derivative  Exchanges/ 
Segments  and  their  Clearing  Corporations  may  be  asked  to  report  the  following 
details for the transactions in derivative contracts, to the media/newspapers, on a daily 
basis:  

a.  Contracts Description 
b.  Number of contracts traded  
c.  Notional Value  
d.  Open  
e.  High  
f.  Low  
g.  Close 
h.  Open Interest (in number of contracts)

5.4.2  Eligibility criteria for the Clearing Corporation of the currency futures segment  

A  Clearing  Corporation  in  the  currency  futures  segment  can  function  only  after 
obtaining  SEBI  approval.  To  be  eligible  for  such  approval,  it  should  satisfy  the 
following conditions: 
 

 

Page 60 of 156 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a.  The  Clearing  Corporation  should  be  a  company  incorporated  under  the 
Companies Act, 1956 and should be distinct from the exchange. However, 
in  case  of  an  exchange  operating  through  a  Clearing  House,  a  maximum 
time period of 6 months may be granted from the date of approval by SEBI, 
to the exchange, for fulfilling this condition.   

b.  The  Clearing  Corporation  must  perform  full  novation,  i.e.  the  clearing 
corporation  should  interpose  itself  between  both  legs  of  every  trade, 
becoming the legal counterparty to both or alternatively should provide an 
unconditional guarantee for settlement of all trades.  

c.  The  clearing  corporation  should  enforce  the  margin  requirements  and  the 

mark to market settlement as outlined above. 

d.  In  the  event  of  unusual  positions  of  a  member,  the  clearing  corporation 

should charge special margin over and above the normal margins. 

e.  The  clearing  corporation  must  establish  facilities  for  electronic  funds 
transfer (EFT) for swift movement of margin payments. In situations where 
EFT is unavailable, the clearing corporation should collect correspondingly 
larger initial margin to cover the potential for losses over the time elapsed in 
collection  of  mark  to  market  margin.  For  example,  if  two  days  lapse  in 
moving  funds,  then  the  value  at  risk  should  be  calculated  based  on  the 
prospective two-day loss. 

f.  In  the  event  of  a  member’s  default  in  meeting  his  liabilities,  the  Clearing 
Corporation should have processing capability to require either the prompt 
transfer of client positions and assets to another member or to close-out all 
open positions. 

 
The currency futures segment of the Clearing Corporation should be governed by a 
separate  Clearing  Council  which  should  not  have  any  member  representation.  A 
separate  settlement  guarantee  fund  should  be  created  and  maintained  for  meeting 
the  obligations  arising  out  of  the  currency  futures  segment.  A  separate  investor 
protection  fund  should  also  be  created  and  maintained  for  the  currency  futures 
market. 

 
5.4.3  Eligibility criteria for members in the currency futures segment 

 

The  membership  of  the  currency  futures  segment  shall  be  separate  from  the 
membership of the equity derivative segment or the cash segment of a recognized 
stock exchange. 
 
The trading member will be subject to a balance sheet net worth requirement of Rs. 
1 crore while the clearing member would be subject to a balance sheet net worth 
requirement of Rs 10 crores. Self clearing member shall have a minimum net worth 
of Rs. 5 crore. The definition of balance sheet net worth would be the same as that 

 

Page 61 of 156 

in the equity derivatives market. The clearing member would also be subject to a 
liquid net worth requirement of Rs. 50 lakhs as detailed above.  
 
The trading members and sales persons in the currency futures market must have 
passed  a  certification  programme  which  is  considered  adequate  by  SEBI.  The 
approved users and sales personnel of the trading member should have passed the 
certification  programme.  This  requirement  shall  not  be  applicable  in  respect  of  a 
trading member in the currency derivatives segment, which is a bank, for a period 
of one year from August 06, 2008. 
 

Before  the  start  of  the  currency  futures  segment,  the  exchange  shall  obtain  prior 
approval of SEBI. In the case of existing exchanges, where equity derivatives are 
permitted for trading, the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the derivatives segment 
of  the  exchange/clearing  corporation  may  be  made  applicable  for  the  currency 
futures  segment  also.  The  exchange/clearing  corporation  shall  make  suitable 
changes  to  that  effect.  Any  requirement  which  is  specific  to  the  currency  futures 
segment  shall  be  provided  for  after  seeking  SEBI’s  approval.  Further,  any 
amendments to the rules, regulations and byelaws shall be made after seeking SEBI 
approval. 

 

 

 

 

 

5.4.4  Regulatory and legal aspects 

The  currency  futures  segment  shall  also  prescribe  a  model  risk  disclosure 
document, model member-constituent agreement and know your client agreement. 
The model documents should be framed in a manner similar to that applicable in the 
equity derivatives market. 

Before the start of trading, the currency futures segment shall submit the proposal 
for approval of the contract to SEBI giving: 

a.  The  details  of  the  proposed  currency  futures  contract  to  be  traded  in  the 

exchange; 

b.  The economic purposes it is intended to serve; 
c.  Its likely contribution to market development; 
d.  The safeguards and the risk protection mechanisms adopted by the exchange 
to ensure market integrity, protection of investors and smooth and orderly 
trading; 

e.  The  infrastructure  of  the  exchange  and  surveillance  system  to  effectively 

monitor trading in such contracts. 

The trading members and clearing members of the currency futures segment should be 
registered as such with SEBI. This would be in addition to their registration as members 
of a segment of a stock exchange.   
A SEBI-RBI constituted committee would meet periodically to sort out issues, if any, 
arising out of overlapping jurisdiction of the currency futures market.

6.2  Risk Management Measures 

In exchange traded derivative contracts, the Clearing Corporation acts as a central 
counterparty  to  all  trades  and  performs  full  novation.  The  risk  to  the  clearing 
corporation  can  only  be  taken  care  of  through  a  stringent  margining  framework. 
Also,  since  derivatives  are  leveraged  instruments,  margins  also  act  as  a  cost  and 
discourage  excessive  speculation.  A  robust  risk  management  system  should 
therefore, not only impose margins on the members of the clearing corporation but 
also enforce collection of margins from the clients. 

Initial Margin 
The  Initial  Margin  requirement  would  be  based  on  a  worst  scenario  loss  of  a 
portfolio  of  an  individual  client  comprising  his  positions  in  options  and  futures 
contracts  on  the  same  underlying  across  different  maturities  and  across  various 
scenarios of price and volatility changes as given in table (below).

The price range for generating the scenarios would be 3.5 standard deviation and 
volatility  range  for  generating  the  scenarios  would  be  3%.  While  computing  the 
worst scenario loss, it shall be assumed that the prices of futures of all maturities on 
the underlying move up or down by the same amount.     

Page 64 of 156 

 

6.2.1 

 

 

 

 

The maximum loss under any of the scenario (considering only 35% of the loss in 
case  of  scenarios  15  and  16)  is  referred  to  in  this  circular  as  the  Worst  Scenario 
Loss.  
 
The  sigma  would  be  calculated  using  the  methodology  specified  for  currency 
futures  in  Para  5.2.2  and  would  be  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic 
returns of USD-INR futures price.  
 
For  the  purpose  of  calculation  of  option  values,  the  following  standard  option 
pricing models - Black-Scholes, Binomial, Merton - would be used.  
 
The  initial  margin  would  be  deducted  from  the  liquid  networth  of  the  clearing 
member on an online, real time basis. 
 

A portfolio based margining approach shall be adopted to take an integrated view of 
the risk involved in the portfolio of each individual client comprising his positions 
in options and futures contracts across different maturities. The client-wise margins 
would be grossed across various clients at the Trading/Clearing Member level. The 
proprietary positions of the Trading/Clearing Member would be treated as that of a 
client. 
 

6.2.2  Portfolio based margining  

6.2.3  Real time computation 

Same as that for currency future contracts as specified in Section 5.2.4. 
 

6.2.4  Calendar spread margins 

A  long  currency  option  position  at  one  maturity  and  a  short  option  position  at  a 
different maturity in the same series, both having the same strike price would be 
treated as a calendar spread. The margin for options calendar spread would be the 
same as specified for USD-INR currency futures calendar spread.  
 
The margin would be calculated on the basis of delta of the portfolio in each month. 
A portfolio consisting of a near month option with a delta of 100 and a far month 
option with a delta of –100 would bear a spread charge equal to the spread charge 
for  a  portfolio  which  is  long  100  near  month  currency  futures  and  short  100  far 
month  currency  futures.  Portfolio  would  mean  portfolio  consisting  of  futures  and 
/or options contract on a particular underlying. Option positions of different expiry, 
irrespective of their strike prices, shall also attract calendar spread margin.  
 

Premium would be paid in by the buyer in cash and paid out to the seller in cash on 
T+1 day.  
 
Until the buyer pays in the premium, the premium due shall be deducted from the 
available Liquid Net Worth on a real time basis. 
 

6.2.5  Settlement of Premium 

 

Page 65 of 156 

6.2.6  Extreme Loss margin 

6.2.7  Net Option Value  

Extreme loss margin equal to 1.5% of the Notional Value of the open short option 
position would be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on an on 
line, real time basis. Notional Value would be calculated on the basis of the latest 
available Reserve Bank Reference Rate for USD-INR. 
 

The Net Option Value is the current market value of the option times the number of 
options (positive for long options and negative for short options) in the portfolio. 
The  Net  Option  Value  would  be  added  to  the  Liquid  Net  Worth  of  the  clearing 
member.  Thus,  mark  to  market  gains  and  losses  would  not  be  settled  in  cash  for 
options positions.

futures and options contracts) shall not exceed 6% of the total open interest or USD 
10 million whichever is higher. The Exchange will disseminate alerts whenever the 
gross open position of the client exceeds 3% of the total open interest at the end of 
the previous day’s trade.

The notional coupon would be 7% with semi-annual compounding. 
 

The  Trading  Hours  would  be  from  9  a.m.  to  5.00  p.m  on  all  working days  from   
Monday to Friday. 

 

 

7.1.1  Underlying 

 
7.1.2  Coupon  

7.1.3  Trading Hours 

 
7.1.4  Size of the Contract 

The Contract Size would be Rs. 2 lakh. 

 
7.1.5  Quotation 

The Quotation would be similar to the quoted price of the GoI security. The day 
count convention for interest payments would be on the basis of a 360-day year, 
consisting of 12 months of 30 days each and half yearly coupon payment.  
 

7.1.6  Tenor of the Contract 

The maximum maturity of the contract would be 12 months. 
 

7.1.7  Available Contracts 

The Contract Cycle would consist of four fixed quarterly contracts for entire year, 
expiring in March, June, September and December. 
 

7.1.8  Delivery Month and Delivery Period 

7.1.9  Daily Settlement Price 

The  delivery  month  shall  be  the  last  month  of  the  expiring  contract,  i.e.,  March, 
June,  September  and  December  Exchanges  to  set  any  period  of  time  during  the 
delivery month as the delivery period for the deliverable grade securities.  
 

The  Daily  Settlement  Price  would  be  the  closing  price  of  the  10-year  Notional 
Coupon-bearing GoI security futures contract on the trading day. (Closing price = 
Weighted Average price of the futures for last half an hour). In the absence of last 
half an hour trading the theoretical price, to be determined by the exchanges, would 
be considered as Daily Settlement Price. The daily settlement price (DSP) shall be 
determined in the following manner: 
 

Step 1:  The DSP is the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the trades in 
the last 30 minute of trading, provided there are at least 5 trades for a minimum 
aggregate notional value of Rs. 10 crore.  Failing which, trades during the last 60 

Page 68 of 156 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes shall be used for the calculation of VWAP, subject to at least 5 trades for 
Rs.10 crore. Failing which trades during the last 120 minutes shall be used for the 
calculation of VWAP, subject to at least 5 trades for Rs.10 crore.  
 
Step 2:  If the DSP cannot be calculated as above, a theoretical price shall be used. 
This theoretical price shall be the minimum of the theoretical futures prices of all 
the  securities  in  the  delivery  basket  chosen  by  the  Exchange.  The  theoretical 
futures price of each security is the weighted average cash price of outright trades 
of that security during the day on the NDS Order Matching platform, adjusted for 
cost of carry, subject to at least 5 trades for Rs.10 crore. If there are not enough 
trades  as  required  above  or  there  is  a  material  market  event  during  the  trading 
hours, the theoretical futures price of each security shall be the FIMMDA / PDAI 
/ Bloomberg revaluation price(s) (published on the FIMMDA website on a daily 
basis:  URL  http://www.fimmda.org/default.asp?access=na),  adjusted  for  cost  of 
carry.  The cost of carry shall be computed for the period upto the last business 
day of the delivery month. 
 
If, however, the near quarter contract is liquid (5 trades for Rs. 10 crore during the 
last 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 120 minutes, as the case may be), the VWAP of the 
near quarter contract shall be adjusted for cost of carry to arrive at the theoretical 
price for subsequent quarter contracts. Further, if near quarter contract is illiquid 
while  the  next  quarter  contract  is  liquid,  then  the  VWAP  of  the  nearest  liquid 
quarter contract shall be used to derive the prices of the illiquid previous as well 
as the subsequent quarter contracts.  
 

 

 

 

 

7.1.10  Settlement Mechanism 

The cost of carry for the above purpose shall include the financing cost @ 91-day 
treasury bill rate and the coupon of the particular security. The exchanges will be 
required  to  disclose  the  model/methodology  used  for  arriving  at  the  theoretical 
price. 
 

The contract would be settled by physical delivery of deliverable grade securities 
using  the  electronic  book  entry  system  of  the  existing  Depositories  (NSDL  and 
CDSL) and Public Debt Office (PDO) of the RBI. The delivery of the deliverable 
grade securities shall take place from the first business day of the delivery month 
till the last business day of the delivery month. The owner of a short position in an 
expiring  futures  contract  shall  hold  the  right  to  decide  when  to  initiate  delivery. 
However,  the  short  position  holder  shall  have  to  give  intimation,  to  the  Clearing 
Corporation,  of  his  intention  to  deliver  two  business  days  prior  to  the  actual 
delivery date.   

 
7.1.11    Deliverable Grade Securities  

Exchanges shall select their own basket of securities from the eligible Deliverable 
Grade Securities, viz., GoI securities maturing at least 7.5 years but not more than 
15 years from the first day of the delivery month with a minimum total outstanding 
stock  of  Rs  10,000  crore.  Exchanges  shall  disclose  upfront  to  the  market 

 

Page 69 of 156 

 

7.1.12  Conversion Factor 

 

participants  the  composition  of  the  basket  of  deliverable  grade  securities  and  the 
associated conversion factors for each of the quarterly contracts. To the basket of 
deliverable  grade  securities  disclosed  upfront  by  the  Exchange  for  each  of  the 
quarterly contracts, additions, if any, shall be made not later than 10 business days 
before the first business day of the delivery month. 
 

The Conversion Factor for deliverable grade security would be equal to the price of 
the deliverable security (per rupee of the principal), on the first day (calendar day) 
of the delivery month, to yield 7% with semiannual compounding.  
 
For  deliveries  into  10-Year  Notional  Coupon-bearing  GoI  security  futures,  the 
deliverable security’s  remaining term to maturity shall be calculated in complete 
three-month  quarters,  always  rounded  down  to  the  nearest  quarter.  If,  after 
rounding, the deliverable security lasts for an exact number of 6-month periods, the 
first  coupon  shall  be  assumed  to  be  paid  after  6  months.  If,  after  rounding,  the 
deliverable security does not last for an exact number of 6-month periods (i.e. there 
are an extra 3 months), the first coupon would be assumed to be paid after 3 months 
and accrued interest would be subtracted.  

 
7.1.13  Invoice Price 

Invoice  Price  of  the  respective  deliverable  grade  security  would  be  the  futures 
settlement price times a conversion factor plus accrued interest. 
 

7.1.14  Delivery Schedule and Delivery Process/Mechanism 

Buyer and seller in Interest rate Futures on 10-year Notional Coupon bearing GoI 
security shall take and give securities respectively in the demat or PDO mode. The 
delivery schedule shall be as follows:  
 
T +0 day 
 
Delivery  notice:  It  is  the  day  when  the  selling  Clearing  Member  (CM)  sends  a 
notice  to  the  Clearing  Corporation  (CC)  expressing  his  intention  to  deliver  along 
with details of the security to be delivered.  CM shall send the notice before 6:00 
pm  IST  on  the  second  business  day  prior  to  the  day  he  wishes  to  deliver.  For 
example, if he wishes to deliver on 4th September 2009 and 2nd and 3rd are business 
days,  he  shall  give  notice  before  6  PM  on  2nd  September  2009.  Along  with  the 
notice,  he  shall  provide  the  notional  face  value  (equal  to  its  short  position  in  the 
expiring  contract),  security  ISIN,  coupon,  maturity  date,  issuance  date,  coupon 
convention, and other details as may be sought by the CC. Based on these details, 
the CC shall calculate the invoice price.  
 
Allocation:  The  CC  shall  identify  the  eligible  long  positions  for  allocation  and 
assign the deliveries to long position holders at client level starting with the highest 
vintage till the allocation is over. Vintage data shall be computed and maintained at 
client level for every contract and shall be tracked by the CC on end of day basis. 

 

Page 70 of 156 

 

For a given vintage, if the contracts to be allocated (Short) are less than the total 
long  positions,  the  allocation  to  such  long  position  holders  shall  be  done  on  a 
‘random’ basis. 
 
Based  on  the  client  level  allocations  as  above,  CC  shall  compute  CM  level 
deliverable/receivable  obligations  using  multilateral  netting  and  intimate  the 
identified long position holders, by 8 pm IST on the date of receipt of notice, the 
details of the securities that they would be receiving and the invoice price.   
 
The  seller  CM  shall  not  be  permitted  to  fulfill  an  individual  futures  contract  by 
delivering a mixed portfolio of deliverable security (for example, Rs.1,20,000 face 
value of one issue and Rs. 80,000 face value of another issue is not permissible). 
However, a selling CM making delivery for more than one futures contract, say two 
contracts,  may  deliver  two  deliverable  securities  for  two  different  contracts 
(Rs.2,00,000 face value of one issue for one contract and Rs.2,00,000 face value of 
another issue for the other contract). 
 
T + 2 day 
 
On the second business day following the receipt of the delivery notice, the CMs 
shall  discharge  their  obligations  and  the  CC  shall  complete  the  settlement 
accordingly.   
 

7.1.15  Last Trading Day 

Exchange to set any day of the delivery month as last trading day.   
 

7.1.16  Last Delivery Day 

Last business day of the delivery month. 
 

7.1.17  Initial Margin 

Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of an 
individual client across various scenarios of price changes. The various scenarios of 
price changes would be so computed so as to cover a more than 99% VaR over a 
one day horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be fixed 
at 3.5 standard deviation1.  Methodology A, as specified in 7.1.21, shall be adopted 
for  computation  of  initial  margin.  For  this  purpose,  the  yield  for  10-Year 
benchmark GoI security, as published by FIMMDA, shall be used.  

For the purpose of intra-day updation of VaR, the Exchanges shall use the yield of 
the benchmark 10-Year bond, from the NDS Order Matching platform. The initial 
margin so computed would be subject to a minimum of 2.33% of the value of the 
futures contract on the first day of trading in 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI 
security futures and 1.6% of the value of the futures contract thereafter. The initial 

 

                                                 
1 One tailed standard normal variate corresponding to 99 % confidence interval is 2.33.  However, simulation 
on the historical data showed that 99 % of data could be covered only with 3.5 times standard.deviation.   

 

Page 71 of 156 

 

7.1.18  Extreme Loss Margin 

margin shall be deducted from the liquid net worth of the clearing member on an 
online, real time basis.  
 

Extreme loss margin of 0.3% of the value of the gross open positions of the futures 
contract shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on an on 
line, real time basis. 

 
7.1.19  Calendar Spread Margin 

Interest rate futures position at one maturity hedged by an offsetting position at a 
different  maturity  would  be  treated  as  a  calendar  spread.    The  calendar  spread 
margin  shall  be  at  a  value  of  Rs.2000/-  per  month  of  spread.  The  benefit  for  a 
calendar spread would continue till expiry of the near month contract.  
 

7.1.20  Model for Determining Standard Deviation 

The Committee examined the results of empirical tests carried out using different 
risk management models in the Value at Risk (VaR) framework in the 10-year GoI 
security  yields.  Data  for  the  period  January  3,  2000  to  September  16,  2008  was 
analyzed.  GARCH  (1,1)-normal  and  GARCH  (1,1)-GED  (Generalized  Auto-
Regressive  Conditional    Heteroskedasticity)  at  3  and  3.5  sigma  levels  were  not 
found  to  perform  well  at  1%  risk  level,  as  the  actual  number  of  violations  were 
found to be statistically much higher than the expected number of violations. The 
EWMA  (Exponentially  weighted  moving  average)  model  used  by  J.P.Morgan’s 
Risk Metrics methodology was found to work well at 3 and 3.5 sigma levels at 5% 
risk level and not at 1% risk level.  
 
Given the computational ease of the EWMA model and given the familiarity of the 
Exchanges  with  this  particular  model  (it  is  currently  being  used  in  the  equity 
derivatives  market),  the  Committee,  after  considering  the  various  aspects  of  the 
different models, decided that EWMA method would be used to obtain the volatility 
estimate every day fixing the price scan range at 3.5 standard deviation. During the 
first time-period on the first day of trading in 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI 
security futures, the sigma would be equal to 0.8 %.  
 

The EWMA method would be used to obtain the volatility estimate every day. The 
estimate at the end of time period t (σyt) is arrived at using the volatility estimate at 
the end of the previous time period i.e. as at the end of  t-1 time period (σyt-1), and 
the return (ryt) observed in the futures market during the time period t. The formula 
would be as under:  
 
(σyt)2 = λ (σyt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (ryt)2 

7.1.21  Formula for Determining Standard Deviation 

 
Where 
 

 

Page 72 of 156 

 

λ(lambda)  is  a  parameter  which  determines  how  rapidly  volatility  estimates 
changes. The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.  

i. 

ii. 

σyt (sigma) is the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of yield of 
10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time t. 
 The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Yt/Yt-1) where Yt is 
the  yield  of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time t.  

For computing the margin, two methodologies can be considered.  

Methodology A.  The plus/minus 3.5 sigma limits2 for a 99% VAR based on 
logarithmic returns on yield of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security 
futures would have to be converted into  price volatility through the following  
formula : 

σpt=D*σyt* Yt 

 
where 
σpt is the standard deviation of percentage change in price at time t; 
 
D is Modified Duration3; 
 
Y4
t; and  
 
σyt (sigma) is the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of yield of 10-
year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time t. 

t is the yield of 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures at time 

The percentage margin on long position would be equal to 100 (D*3.5σyt* Yt) 
and the percentage margin on short position would be equal to 100 (D*(-3.5σyt)* 
Yt).  The Modified Duration for 10-Year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security 
futures shall be 10.  

                                                 
2 The one-tailed standard normal variate corresponding to 99% confidence interval is 2.33. However, since 
3.5 standard deviations cover 99 % of the historical data, σ  has been taken as 3.5 in all computations. .

iii.     The volatility estimation and margin fixation methodology should be clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin 
for  any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the 
trading software itself should provide this information on a real time basis on 
the trading workstation screen. 

i.  Client level:  The gross open positions of the client across all contracts should 
not exceed 6% of the total open interest or Rs 300 crores whichever is higher.  
The Exchange will disseminate alerts whenever the gross open position of the 
client  exceeds  3%  of  the  total  open  interest  at  the  end  of  the  previous  day’s 
trade. 

ii.  Trading Member level: The gross open positions of the trading member across 
all contracts should not exceed 15% of the total open interest or Rs. 1000 crores 
whichever is higher. 

iii.  Clearing Member level:  No separate position limit is prescribed at the level of 
clearing  member.    However,  the  clearing  member  shall  ensure  that  his  own 
trading position and the positions of each trading member clearing through him 
is within the limits specified above.   

iv.  FIIs:  In  case  of  Foreign  Institutional  Investors  registered  with  Securities  and 
Exchange  Board  of  India  the  total  gross  long  (bought)  position  in  cash  and 
Interest Rate Futures markets taken together should not exceed their individual 
permissible  limit  for  investment  in  government  securities  and  the  total  gross 
short (sold) position, for the purpose of hedging only, should not exceed their 
long position in the government securities and in Interest Rate Futures, at any 
point in time.

7.2  Risk Management Measures 
 
7.2.1 

Introduction 
In exchange traded derivative contracts, the Clearing Corporation acts as a central    
counterparty  to  all  trades  and  performs  full  novation.  The  risk  to  the  Clearing 
Corporation  can  only  be  taken  care  of  through  a  stringent  margining  framework. 
Also,  since  derivatives  are  leveraged  instruments,  margins  also  act  as  a  cost  and 
discourage  excessive  speculation.  A  robust  risk  management  system  should 
therefore, not only impose margins on the members of the Clearing Corporation but 
also enforce collection of margins from the clients. 

 Portfolio Based Margining  
The Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) methodology shall be adopted to 
take an integrated view of the risk involved in the portfolio of each individual client 
comprising his positions in futures contracts across different maturities. The client-
wise  margins  would  be  grossed  across  various  clients  at  the  Trading  /  Clearing 
Member level. The proprietary positions of the Trading / Clearing Member would 
be treated as that of a client. 

 
7.2.3  Real-Time Computation 

 

 
7.2.2 

The computation of worst scenario loss would have two components. The first is 
the valuation of the portfolio under the various scenarios of price changes. At the 
second stage, these scenario contract values would be applied to the actual portfolio 
positions  to  compute  the  portfolio  values  and  the  initial  margin.  The  exchanges 
shall update the scenario contract values at least 6 times in the day, which may be 
carried out by taking the closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and 
the  prices  at  11:00  a.m.,  12:30  p.m.,  2:00  p.m.,  3.30  p.m.  and  at  the  end  of  the 
trading  session.  The  latest  available  scenario  contract  values  would be applied to 
member/client portfolios on a real time basis. 

The initial margin and the extreme loss margin shall be deducted from the liquid 
assets  of  the  clearing  member.  The  clearing  member’s  liquid  net  worth  after 
adjusting  for  the  initial  margin  and  extreme  loss  margin  requirements  must  be  at 
least  Rs.  50  Lakhs  at  all  points  in  time.  The  minimum  liquid  networth  shall  be 
treated as a capital cushion for days of unforeseen market volatility.  

 

7.2.4  Liquid Networth 

 
7.2.5  Liquid Assets 

The  liquid  assets  for  trading  in  Interest  Rate  Futures  would  have  to  be  provided 
separately and maintained with the Clearing Corporation. However, the permissible 
liquid assets, the applicable haircuts and minimum cash equivalent norms would be 
mutatis mutandis applicable from the equity/currency derivatives segment. 

 
7.2.6  Mark-to-Market (MTM) Settlement 

The MTM gains and losses shall be settled in cash before the start of trading on T+1 
day. If MTM obligations are not collected before start of the next day’s trading, the 

 

Page 76 of 156 

 

Clearing  Corporation  shall  collect  correspondingly  higher  initial  margin  to  cover 
the potential for losses over the time elapsed in the collection of margins.  

The  daily  closing  price  of  interest  rate  futures  contract  for  mark  to  market 
settlement  would  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  last  half  an  hour  weighted 
average price of the futures contract. In the absence of trading in the last half an 
hour the theoretical price would be taken. The eligible exchanges shall define the 
methodology  for  calculating  the  ‘theoretical  price’  at  the  time  of  making  an 
application  for  approval  of  the  interest  rate  futures  contract  to  SEBI.  The 
methodology for calculating the ‘theoretical price’ would also be disclosed to the 
market.  

7.2.7  Margin Collection and Enforcement 

The client margins (initial margin, extreme loss margin, calendar spread margin and 
mark to market settlements) have to be compulsorily collected and reported to the 
Exchange  by  the  members.  The  Exchange  shall  impose  stringent  penalty  on 
members who do not collect margins from their clients. The Exchange shall also 
conduct regular inspections to ensure margin collection from clients. 

 
7.2.8  Safeguarding Client’s Money 

The Clearing Corporation should segregate the margins deposited by the Clearing 
Members  for  trades  on  their  own  account  from  the  margins  deposited  with  it  on 
client  account.  The  margins  deposited  on  client  account  shall  not  be  utilized  for 
fulfilling the dues which a Clearing Member may owe the Clearing Corporation in 
respect of trades on the member’s own account. The client’s money is to be held in 
trust for client purpose only. The following process is to be adopted for segregating 
the client’s money vis-à-vis the clearing member’s money: 
 

i  At the time of opening a position, the member should indicate whether it is a 

client or proprietary position.  

ii  Margins  across  the  various  clients  of  a  member  should  be  collected  on  a 

gross basis and should not be netted off. 

iii  When  a  position  is  closed,  the  member  should  indicate  whether  it  was  a 

client or his own position which is being closed. 

iv  In the case of default, the margins paid on the proprietary position would 
only  be  used  by  the  Clearing  Corporation  for  realizing  its  dues  from  the 
member. 

 
7.2.9  Periodic Risk Evaluation Report 

The  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Exchange  shall  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  atleast 
once in every six months, conduct back testing of the margins collected vis-à-vis 
the actual price changes. A copy of the study shall be submitted to SEBI along with 
suggestions on changes to the risk containment measures, if any.

7.3  Regulatory and Legal aspects 

 

7.3.1  Exchange:  

The Interest Rate Derivative contracts shall be traded on the Currency Derivative 
Segment  of  a  recognized  Stock  Exchange.  The  members  registered  by  SEBI  for 
trading in Currency/Equity Derivative Segment shall be eligible to trade in Interest 
Rate Derivatives also, subject to meeting the Balance Sheet networth requirement 
of Rs 1 crore for a trading member and Rs 10 crores for a clearing member. Before 
the  start  of  trading,  the  Exchange  shall  submit  the  proposal  for  approval  of  the 
contract to SEBI giving: 

i.  The details of the proposed interest rate futures contract to be traded in the 

exchange; 

ii.  The economic purposes it is intended to serve; 
iii. 
Its likely contribution to market development; 
iv.  The safeguards and the risk protection mechanisms adopted by the exchange

7.4  Miscellaneous Issues 
 
7.4.1  Banks Participation in Interest Rate Futures 

It is stated in the RBI Report on Interest Rate Futures that “…the current approval 
for  banks’  participation  in  IRF  for  hedging  risk  in  their  underlying  investment 
portfolio of government securities classified under the Available for Sale (AFS) and 
Held  for  Trading  (HFT)  categories  should  be  extended  to  the  interest  rate  risk 
inherent  in  their  entire  balance  sheet  –  including  both  on,  and  off,  balance  sheet 
items – synchronously with the re-introduction of the IRF.” 

 
7.4.2  Extending the Tenor of Short Sales  

In the RBI Report on Interest Rate Futures, it has been recommended that the time 
limit on short selling be extended so that term / tenor / maturity of the short sale is 
co-terminus with that of the futures contract and a system of transparent and rule-
based pecuniary penalty for SGL bouncing be put in place, in lieu of the regulatory 
penalty currently in force. 
 

 
In  case  there  is  a  failure  to  honour  the  settlement  obligation  by  the  CM,  the 
following action shall be followed: 
 

7.4.3  Penalties 

7.4.3.1  Selling CM fails to deliver the securities  

T +0  day: Selling CM gives intention to deliver the securities 
T+2  day:  Buying  CM  pays-in  funds  and  the  selling  CM  fails  to  deliver  the 
securities 

T+2 or T+3 day: CC shall conduct buy-in auction of the securities. 
In case of successful auction, the defaulting CM shall be debited by: 
the actual auction price, 
difference  in  invoice  price  and  auction  price,  if  the  auction  price  is  less  than  the 
invoice price, and 
a penalty of 2% of the face value of security short delivered.  

In  case  of  unsuccessful  auction,  transaction  shall  be  closed  out  wherein  the 
defaulting CM shall be debited by: 
invoice price, and 
a penalty of 5% of the face value of security short delivered. 
     
In respect of the seller in an auction failing to honour the auction obligations, he 
shall be debited by:  
invoice price, and 
a penalty of 3% of the face value of security short delivered 

 

Page 79 of 156 

 

 

 

 

 

These penalties shall be passed on to the buying CM, who shall pass it on to the 
buying client.  
 

7.4.3.2  Buying CM fails to pay-in funds 

T +0 day: Selling CM gives intention to deliver the securities 
T+2 day: Selling CM delivers securities and the buying CM fails to pay-in funds.  
The CC shall pay-out funds to the selling CM on T+2 day 

 
Further,  
  In case of a settlement shortage of Rs. 5 lakh or more, the trading facility of all 
trading  members  clearing  through  the  buying  CM  shall  be  withdrawn  in  the 
Currency Derivatives Segment and the securities pay-out to the buying CM shall 
be withheld. 

  If the buying CM is short for an amount of Rs. 2 lakh or more on six or more 
occasions  in  the  preceding  three  months,  the  trading  facility  of  all  the  trading 
members  clearing  through  the  buying  CM  shall  be  withdrawn  in  the  Currency 
Derivatives  Segment  and  the  securities  pay-out  to  the  buying  CM  shall  be 
withheld. 

  A  penalty  of  0.07%  per  day  shall  be  levied  on  the  amount  of  the  shortage. 

 
The trading facility shall be restored and securities withheld shall be released on 
the buying CM making good the shortage amount in all the above cases.  

Regulatory Penalty: In case a selling CM defaults in delivering securities 5 times 
during  a  period  of  preceding  6  months,  the  trading  facility  of  all  the  trading 
members clearing through the CM shall be withdrawn for 7 days.  
 

7.4.3.3  Margins and action on deliverable positions 

 

 

 

i  Margins on physical delivery positions: For positions marked for delivery, a 
margin equal to VaR of the futures on the invoice price plus 5% of face value 
along  with  mark  to  market  adjustments  shall  be  charged  both  to  the  buying 
client and selling client. The margins shall be levied from the intention day and 
shall be released on the completion of the settlement.  

 
ii  Margins from last trading day to last intention day: For positions from last 
trading  date  till  date  of  intention  in  cases  where  no  intention  is  provided,  a 
margin amount equal to VaR of the futures on the invoice price of the costliest 
security from the deliverable basket plus 5% of face value along with mark to 
market  adjustments  based  on  the  underlying  closing  prices  of  the  costliest 
security from the deliverable basket shall be charged on both buying client and 
selling client. The margins shall be levied from the last trading day till the day 
of receipt of intention to deliver. 

Page 80 of 156 

 

 

 

Action in case no intent to deliver is provided: In case no intent is provided by 
the  selling  CM  till  two  business  days  prior  to  the  last  delivery  date,  it  shall  be 
presumed  that  selling  CM  has  failed  to  deliver  the  security  and  the  auction 
mechanism, as specified for security shortages, shall be activated. The auction shall 
take place one business day prior to the last delivery date.

8  INTEREST RATE FUTURES ON 91-DAY GOVERNMENT 

OF INDIA (GOI) TREASURY-BILL (T-BILL) 

8.1  Product Design, Margins and Position Limits 
 
8.1.1  Underlying 

91 - day GoI T-bill.  
 

8.1.2  Trading hours 

9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  
 

8.1.3  Size of the contract 

Rs. 2 lakh.  

 
8.1.4  Quotation 

 

 

 

100 minus futures discount yield (i.e. for a yield of 5% the quote would be 100-
5=95). The value of 1 basis point change in the futures discount yield would be Rs.  
5.  
 

The maximum maturity of the contract would be 12 months. 

8.1.5  Tenor of the contract 

 
8.1.6  Contract months  

Three  serial  monthly  contracts  followed  by  three  quarterly  contracts  of  the  cycle 
March/June/September/December. 
 

8.1.7  Settlement mechanism 

The 91-day T-Bill future would be settled in cash in Indian Rupees. 
  

8.1.8  Contract value 

Rs.  2000 * (100 – 0.25 * y)  
where y is the futures discount yield. 
For example, for a futures discount yield of 5%, the contract value would be – 
2000 * (100 – 0.25*5) = Rs. 197,500 
 

8.1.9  Daily Contract Settlement value 

Rs. 2000 * (100 – 0.25 * yw)  
(Here yw is weighted average futures yield of last half an hour). 
In  the  absence  of  last  half  an  hour  trading,  theoretical  futures  yield  would  be 
considered for computation of Daily Contract Settlement Value. 

Page 82 of 156 

 

8.1.10  Expiry/Last trading day/Final settlement day 

The expiry / last trading day / final settlement day for the contract would be the last 
Wednesday  of  the  expiry  month.  If  any  expiry  day  is  a  trading  holiday,  then  the 
expiry/ last trading day/ final settlement day would be the previous trading day. 

 
8.1.11  Final Contract Settlement value 

Rs. 2000 * (100 – 0.25 * yf)  
(Here yf is weighted average discount yield obtained from weekly auction of 91-
day T-Bill on the day of expiry). 
The  methodology  of  computation  and  dissemination  of  the  weighted  average 
discount yield would be publicly disclosed by RBI.   

 

8.1.12  Initial margin 

The Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an individual client across various scenarios of price changes. The various scenarios 
of price changes would be so computed so as to cover a 99% VaR over a one day 
horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be fixed at 3.5 
standard deviation. The initial margin so computed would be subject to a minimum 
of 0.1 % of the notional value of the contract on the first day of trading in 91-day T-
bill futures and 0.05 % of the notional value of the contract thereafter (the notional 
value of the contract shall be Rs. 2,00,000). The initial margin shall be deducted 
from the liquid net worth of the clearing member on an online, real time basis.  

Extreme loss margin of 0.03 % of the notional value of the contract for all gross 
open positions shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on 
an on line, real time basis. 

 
8.1.13  Extreme Loss margin 

 
8.1.14  Calendar spread margin 

Interest rate futures position at one maturity hedged by an offsetting position at a 
different  maturity  would  be  treated  as  a  calendar  spread.    The  calendar  spread 
margin shall be at a value of ` 100/- for spread of one month, ` 150 for spread of 
two month, ` 200/- for spread of three month and ` 250/- for spread of four month 
and beyond.  The benefit for a calendar spread would continue till expiry of the near 
month  contract.  For  a  calendar  spread  position,  the  extreme  loss  margin  shall  be 
0.01% of the notional value of the far month contract. 
 

8.1.15  Formula for determining standard deviation 

 

The  exponential  moving  average  method  would  be  used  to  obtain  the  volatility 
estimate every day. The estimate at the end of time period t (σydt) is estimated using 
the volatility estimate at the end of the previous time period. i.e. as at the end of  t-1 
time period (σydt-1), and the return (rydt) observed in the futures market during the 
time period t. The formula would be as under:  
 
(σydt)2 = λ (σydt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rydt)2 

 

Page 83 of 156 

 

 

where 
λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates change. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.  

v. 

vi. 

σydt  (sigma)  means  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of 
discount yield of 91-day T-Bill futures at time t. 

 The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rydt = ln(Ydt/Ydt-1) where Ydt 
is  the  discount  yield    of  91-day  T-Bill  futures  at  time  t.  The  plus/minus  3.5 
sigma limits for a 99% VAR based on logarithmic returns on discount yield of 
91-day T-Bill futures would have to be converted into  price changes through 
the following formula : 

 σpt=D*σydt* Ydt 
 
where 
σpt means the standard deviation of percentage change in price at time t 
D means Modified Duration  
Ydt =Discount Yield for 91-day T-Bill futures at time t 
σydt  (sigma)  means  the  standard  deviation  of  daily  logarithmic  returns  of 
discount yield at  time t 

The  margin  on  long  position  would  be  equal  to  100  *  (D*3.5σydt*  Ydt) 
percentage  of  the  notional  value  of  the  futures  contract  and  the  margin  on 
short  position  would  be  equal  to  100  (D*-3.5σydt*  Ydt)  percentage  of  the 
notional value of the futures contract.  The Modified Duration for 91 day T-
Bill Futures shall be -0.25.  

vii.  The volatility estimation and margin fixation methodology should be clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin 
for  any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the 
trading software itself should provide this information on a real time basis on 
the trading workstation screen.  

viii.  During the first time-period on the first day of trading in 91-day T-bill futures, 

the sigma would be equal to 2.7 %.

position and the positions of each trading member clearing through him is within 
the limits specified above. 

8.1.16.4 FIIs:  In  case  of  Foreign  Institutional  Investors,  registered  with  Securities  and 
Exchange  Board  of  India,  the  total  gross  long  (bought)  position  in  cash  and 
Interest  Rate  Futures  markets  taken  together  should  not  exceed  their  individual 
permissible limit for investment in government securities and the total gross short 
(sold)  position,  for  the  purpose  of  hedging  only,  should  not  exceed  their  long 
position in the government securities and in Interest Rate Futures, at any point in 
time. 

 
8.2  Regulatory and Legal aspects 
8.2.1  Exchange 

The  Interest  Rate  Futures  on  91-day  T-Bill  shall  be  traded  on  the  Currency 
Derivative  Segment  of  a  recognized  Stock  Exchange.  Eligible  Stock  Exchanges

Notional  coupon  bearing  2-year  GoI  security  with  a  notional  coupon  of  7%  paid 
semi-annually and face value of Rs. 100.  
 

The trading hours would be from 9 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. 

 

9.1.1  Underlying 

9.1.2  Trading hours 

 
9.1.3  Size of the contract 

Rs. 2 lakh. 

 
9.1.4  Quotation 

The quotation would be similar to the quoted price of the GoI security.  
 

9.1.5  Tenor of the contract 

The maximum maturity of the contract would be 12 months. 
 

9.1.6  Contract months 

To begin with, three serial monthly contracts can be introduced. 
 

9.1.7  Settlement mechanism 

The futures on notional GoI security would be settled in cash in Indian Rupees. The 
settlement price of the notional bond would be determined on the basis of the yields 
of a basket of eligible bond(s) selected by the exchange with the yields of the bonds 
in  the  basket  to  be  determined  through  a  polling  process  carried  out  by  Fixed 
Income, Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) as detailed in Para 
9.1.17.  
 
Exchanges shall disclose upfront to the market participants the composition of the 
basket of securities for each of the contracts. Eligible bonds would comprise of GoI 
securities maturing at least 1.5 years but not more than 2.5 years from the expiry 
day. 
 

9.1.8  Contract Value 

The contract value would be: = Quoted price * 2000 
 

9.1.9  Daily Contract Settlement Value 

The Daily Contract Settlement Value would be: = 2000 * Pw 
 
(Here Pw is weighted average futures quote of last half an hour). 

 

Page 86 of 156 

 

In  the  absence  of  last  half  an  hour  trading,  theoretical  futures  price  would  be 
considered for computation of Daily Contract Settlement Value. Exchanges would 
be required to disclose the model/methodology used for arriving at the theoretical 
price. 

 
9.1.10  Expiry/Last trading day 

The  expiry  /  last  trading  day  for  the  contract  would  be  the  last  Thursday  of  the 
expiry month. If any expiry day is a trading holiday, then the expiry/ last trading 
day would be the previous trading day. 

 
9.1.11  Final Contract Settlement Value 

The Final Contract Settlement Value would be = 2000 * Pf  
 
where Pf is the settlement price of the notional bond. 
 

9.1.12  Initial Margin 

The Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an individual client across various scenarios of price changes. The various scenarios 
of price changes would be so computed so as to cover a 99% VaR over a one day 
horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be fixed at 3.5 
standard deviation. The initial margin so computed would be subject to a minimum 
of 0.35 % of the notional value of the contract on the first day of trading in Futures 
on 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security and 0.3 % 
of the notional value of the contract thereafter. The initial margin shall be deducted 
from the liquid net worth of the clearing member on an online, real time basis.  

Extreme loss margin of 0.1 % of the notional value of the contract for all gross open 
positions shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on an on 
line, real time basis. 

 
9.1.13  Extreme Loss margin 

 
9.1.14  Calendar spread margin 

2  Year  Notional  Coupon  Bearing  Government  of  India  (GoI)  Security  futures 
position at one maturity hedged by an offsetting 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing 
Government of India (GoI) Security futures position at a different maturity would 
be treated as a calendar spread.  The calendar spread margin shall be at a value of 
Rs. 300 for spread of one month and Rs. 450 for spread of two months.  The benefit 
for a calendar spread would continue till expiry of the near month contract.  
 

9.1.15  Formula for determining standard deviation 

 

The  exponential  moving  average  method  would  be  used  to  obtain  the  volatility 
estimate every day. The estimate of volatility (σt) for the time period t is estimated 
using the volatility estimate (σt-1) for the previous time period and the return (rt-1) 
observed in the futures market during the previous time period. The formula would 
be as under:  

 

Page 87 of 156 

 

(σt)2 = λ (σt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rt-1)2 

where 

λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates change. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.  

ix.  σt (sigma) means the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of futures 
price of 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security 
at time t. 

x.  The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Pt/Pt-1) where Pt is the 
futures price of 2 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) 
Security at time t. The plus/minus 3.5 sigma limits for a 99% VaR based on 
logarithmic returns would have to be converted into percentage price change 
by reversing the logarithmic transformation. The percentage margin on short 
positions would be equal to 100(exp(3.5σ)-1) and the percentage margin on 
long  positions  would  be  equal  to  100(1-exp(-3.5σ)).  This  implies  slightly 
larger  margins  on  short  positions  than  on  long  positions.  The  derivatives 
exchange/clearing corporation may apply the higher margin on both the buy 
and sell side. 

xi.  The volatility estimation and margin fixation methodology should be clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin 
for  any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the 
trading software itself should provide this information on a real time basis on 
the trading workstation screen.  

xii.  During  the  first  time-period  on  the  first  day  of  trading  in  2  Year  Notional 
Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security futures, the sigma would 
be equal to 0.10 %. 

9.1.16  Position Limits 

9.1.16.1 Client Level 

The gross open positions of the client across all contracts should not exceed 6% of the total 
open interest or Rs 300 crores whichever is higher.  The Exchange will disseminate alerts 
whenever the gross open position of the client exceeds 3% of the total open interest at the 
end of the previous day’s trade. 

9.1.16.2 Trading Member Level 

The gross open positions of the trading member across all contracts should not exceed 15% 
of the total open interest or Rs. 1000 crores whichever is higher.  

 

Page 88 of 156 

 

9.1.16.3 Clearing Member Level 

No  separate  position  limit  is  prescribed  at  the  level  of  clearing  member.    However,  the 
clearing member shall ensure that his own trading position and the positions of each trading 
member clearing through him is within the limits specified above. 

9.1.16.4 FIIs 

In case of Foreign Institutional Investors registered with Securities and Exchange Board of 
India the total gross long (bought) position in cash and Interest Rate Futures markets taken 
together should not exceed their individual permissible limit for investment in government 
securities and the total gross short (sold) position, for the purpose of hedging only, should 
not exceed their long position in the government securities and in Interest Rate Futures, at 
any point in time.

9.1.17  Settlement Mechanism 
 

a.  Polling  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Fixed  Income,  Money  Market  and 

Derivatives Association, i.e., FIMMDA; 

b.  The yields (Bid and Ask) of the GoI securities shall be polled from Primary 

Dealers (PDs) registered with the Reserve Bank of India; 

c.  Each poll shall involve ten PDs who would be selected at random from the 

universe of PDs; 

d.  Polling would be conducted at three instances, i.e., 11.00 am, 11.30 am and 

12.00 pm daily; 

e.  At  each  instance  of  polling,  for  each  bond,  out  of  the  ten  buy  yields,  two 
highest  and  two  lowest  yields  would  be  treated  as  outliers  and  would  be 
ignored.  Similarly  outliers  from  ten  sell  yields  would  be  identified  and 
ignored. 

f.  After rejecting the outliers in above step, there will be [6 * 2 * 3 * Number of 

Bonds in Basket] number of remaining yields. 

g.  Average settlement yield (Ys) is the simple average of the remaining yields. 

Ys will be rounded off to 4 decimal digits. 

h.  Ys  determined  in  above  step  would  be  used  to  calculate  present  value  of 
notional underlying bond on the basis of formula given below. This will be 
the final settlement price of the contract.

10 INTEREST  RATE  FUTURES  ON  5  YEAR  NOTIONAL 
COUPON  BEARING  GOVERNMENT  OF  INDIA  (GOI) 
SECURITY 

10.1  Product Design, Margins and Position Limits 

 

10.1.1  Underlying 

Notional  coupon  bearing  5-year  GoI  security  with  a  notional  coupon  of  7%  paid 
semi-annually and face value of Rs. 100.  
 

10.1.2  Trading hours 
 

The trading hours would be from 9 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. 
 

10.1.3  Size of the contract 
 

Rs. 2 lakh. 
 

10.1.4  Quotation 

The quotation would be similar to the quoted price of the GoI security.  
 

10.1.5  Tenor of the contract 
 

The maximum maturity of the contract would be 12 months. 
 

To begin with, three serial monthly contracts can be introduced. 

10.1.6  Contract months 

 

10.1.7  Settlement mechanism 

The futures on notional GoI security would be settled in cash in Indian Rupees. The 
settlement price of the notional bond would be determined on the basis of the yields 
of a basket of eligible bond(s) selected by the exchange with the yields of the bonds 
in  the  basket  to  be  determined  through  a  polling  process  carried  out  by  Fixed 
Income, Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) as detailed in Para 
10.1.17.  
 
Exchanges shall disclose upfront to the market participants the composition of the 
basket of securities for each of the contracts. Eligible bonds would comprise of GoI 
securities maturing at least 4.5 years but not more than 5.5 years from the expiry 
day. 
 

10.1.8  Contract Value 

The contract value would be: = Quoted price * 2000 
 

10.1.9  Daily Contract Settlement Value 

The Daily Contract Settlement Value would be: = 2000 * Pw 
 
(Here Pw is weighted average futures quote of last half an hour). 

 

Page 93 of 156 

 

In  the  absence  of  last  half  an  hour  trading,  theoretical  futures  price  would  be 
considered for computation of Daily Contract Settlement Value. Exchanges would 
be required to disclose the model/methodology used for arriving at the theoretical 
price. 
 

The  expiry  /  last  trading  day  for  the  contract  would  be  the  last  Thursday  of  the 
expiry month. If any expiry day is a trading holiday, then the expiry/ last trading 
day would be the previous trading day. 
 

10.1.10Expiry/Last trading day 

10.1.11Final Contract Settlement Value 

The Final Contract Settlement Value would be = 2000 * Pf  
 
where Pf is the settlement price of the notional bond. 
 

10.1.12Initial Margin 

The Initial Margin requirement shall be based on a worst case loss of a portfolio of 
an individual client across various scenarios of price changes. The various scenarios 
of price changes would be so computed so as to cover a 99% VaR over a one day 
horizon. In order to achieve this, the price scan range may initially be fixed at 3.5 
standard deviation. The initial margin so computed would be subject to a minimum 
of 0.7 % of the notional value of the contract on the first day of trading in Futures 
on 5 Year Notional Coupon Bearing GoI Security and 0.6 % of the notional value 
of the contract thereafter. The initial margin shall be deducted from the liquid net 
worth of the clearing member on an online, real time basis.  

 

10.1.13Extreme Loss margin 

10.1.14Calendar spread margin 

Extreme loss margin of 0.15 % of the notional value of the contract for all gross 
open positions shall be deducted from the liquid assets of the clearing member on 
an on line, real time basis. 
 

5 Year Notional Coupon GoI Security futures position at one maturity hedged by an 
offsetting  5  Year  Notional  Coupon  Bearing  GoI  Security  futures  position  at  a 
different  maturity  would  be  treated  as  a  calendar  spread.    The  calendar  spread 
margin shall be at a value of Rs. 400 for spread of one month and Rs. 600 for spread 
of two months.  The benefit for a calendar spread would continue till expiry of the 
near month contract.  
 

10.1.15Formula for determining standard deviation 

 

The  exponential  moving  average  method  would  be  used  to  obtain  the  volatility 
estimate every day. The estimate of volatility (σt) for the time period t is estimated 
using the volatility estimate (σt-1) for the previous time period and the return (rt-1) 
observed in the futures market during the previous time period. The formula would 
be as under:  

 

Page 94 of 156 

 

(σt)2 = λ (σt-1)2 + (1 - λ ) (rt-1)2 

where 

λ is a parameter which determines how rapidly volatility estimates change. 
The value of λ is fixed at 0.94.  

i.  σt (sigma) means the standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns of futures 
price of 5 Year Notional Coupon Bearing Government of India (GoI) Security 
at time t. 

ii.  The "return" is defined as the logarithmic return: rt = ln(Pt/Pt-1) where Pt is the 
futures price of 5 Year Notional Coupon Bearing GoI Security at time t. The 
plus/minus 3.5 sigma limits for a 99% VaR based on logarithmic returns would 
have to be converted into percentage price change by reversing the logarithmic 
transformation.  The  percentage  margin  on  short  positions  would  be  equal  to 
100(exp(3.5σ)-1) and the percentage margin on long positions would be equal 
to  100(1-exp(-3.5σ)).  This  implies  slightly  larger  margins  on  short  positions 
than  on  long  positions.  The  derivatives  exchange/clearing  corporation  may 
apply the higher margin on both the buy and sell side. 

iii.  The  volatility  estimation  and  margin  fixation  methodology  should  be  clearly 
made known to all market participants so that they can compute the margin for 
any  given  closing  level  of  the  interest  rate  futures  price.  Further,  the  trading 
software  itself  should  provide  this  information  on  a  real  time  basis  on  the 
trading workstation screen.  

iv.  During  the  first  time-period  on  the  first  day  of  trading  in  5  Year  Notional 

Coupon Bearing GoI Security futures, the sigma would be equal to 0.2 %. 

10.1.16Position Limits 

10.1.16.1 

Client Level 

The gross open positions of the client across all contracts should not exceed 6% of the total 
open interest or Rs 300 crores whichever is higher.  The Exchange will disseminate alerts 
whenever the gross open position of the client exceeds 3% of the total open interest at the 
end of the previous day’s trade. 

10.1.16.2 

Trading Member Level 

The gross open positions of the trading member across all contracts should not exceed 15% 
of the total open interest or Rs. 1000 crores whichever is higher.  

 

Page 95 of 156 

 

10.1.16.3 

Clearing Member Level 

No  separate  position  limit  is  prescribed  at  the  level  of  clearing  member.    However,  the 
clearing member shall ensure that his own trading position and the positions of each trading 
member clearing through him is within the limits specified above. 

10.1.16.4 

FIIs 

In case of Foreign Institutional Investors registered with Securities and Exchange Board of 
India the total gross long (bought) position in cash and Interest Rate Futures markets taken 
together should not exceed their individual permissible limit for investment in government 
securities and the total gross short (sold) position, for the purpose of hedging only, should 
not exceed their long position in the government securities and in Interest Rate Futures, at 
any point in time.

10.1.17Settlement Mechanism 

a.  Polling  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Fixed  Income,  Money  Market  and 

Derivatives Association, i.e., FIMMDA; 

b.  The yields (Bid and Ask) of the GoI securities shall be polled from Primary 

Dealers (PDs) registered with the Reserve Bank of India; 

c.  Each poll shall involve ten PDs who would be selected at random from the 

universe of PDs; 

d.  Polling would be conducted at three instances, i.e., 11.00 am, 11.30 am and 

12.00 pm daily; 

e.  At  each  instance  of  polling,  for  each  bond,  out  of  the  ten  buy  yields,  two 
highest  and  two  lowest  yields  would  be  treated  as  outliers  and  would  be 
ignored.  Similarly  outliers  from  ten  sell  yields  would  be  identified  and 
ignored. 

f.  After rejecting the outliers in above step, there will be [6 * 2 * 3 * Number of 

Bonds in Basket] number of remaining yields. 

g.  Average settlement yield (Ys) is the simple average of the remaining yields. 

Ys will be rounded off to 4 decimal digits. 

h.  Ys  determined  in  above  step  would  be  used  to  calculate  present  value  of 
notional underlying bond on the basis of formula given below. This will be 
the final settlement price of the contract.

11.5 Risk Management Framework 

After introduction of derivatives on a particular stock index, if that stock index fails 
to  meet  any  of  the  eligibility  criteria  for  three  months  consecutively,  no  fresh 
contract  shall  be  introduced  on  that  Index.  However,  the  existing  unexpired 
contracts would be traded till  expiry  and  new  strikes  may  be  introduced  on  those 
contracts.

12.1 Corporate Action Adjustments:  
 
Options  on  common  stock  trade  on  both  NSE  &  BSE  the  corporate  adjustment  for  the 
Option  on  the  same  underlying  should  be  uniform  across  markets.  While  a  uniform 
adjustment methodology could be adopted for certain corporate action, it would be difficult 
to specify any uniform policy for all corporate actions at this stage. For this purpose, it has 
been  decided  to  constitute  a  group  comprising  NSE,  BSE  and  other  knowledgeable 
persons,  which  would  decide  a  uniform  course  of  action  for  adjusting  stock  option 
contracts on corporate actions, taking into account best practices followed internationally, 
where a uniform criterion cannot be laid down at present. However, certain adjustments for 
Corporate Actions for Stock Options would be as follows:  

a.  The basis for any adjustment for corporate action shall be such that the value of the 
position  of  the  market  participants  on  cum  and  ex-date  for  corporate  action  shall 
continue to remain the same as far as possible. This will facilitate in retaining the 
relative status of positions viz. in-the-money, at-the-money and out-of-money. This 
will also address issues related to exercise and assignments.  

b.  Any adjustment for corporate actions shall be carried out on the last day on which a 

security is traded on a cum basis in the underlying cash market.  

c.  Adjustments shall mean modifications to positions and/or contract specifications as 
listed below such that the basic premise of adjustment laid down in para a. above is 
satisfied :  

1.  Strike Price  
2.  Position  
3.  Market Lot/Multiplier  

 
The adjustments shall be carried out on any or all of the above based on the nature of the 
corporate  action.  The  adjustments  for  corporate  actions  shall  be  carried  out  on  all  open, 
exercised as well as assigned positions. 
The corporate actions may be broadly classified under stock benefits and cash benefits. The 
various stock benefits declared by the issuer of capital are:  

  Bonus  
  Rights  
  Merger/De-merger  
  Amalgamation  
  Splits  
  Consolidations  
  Hive-off  
  Warrants, and  
  Secured Premium Notes (SPNs) among others.  
  Extraordinary dividends 

  

The methodology proposed to be followed for adjustment of various corporate actions to be 
carried out are as follows :  

 

Page 103 of 156 

 

 
Bonus, Stock Splits and Consolidations  
 
Strike Price: The new strike price shall be arrived at by dividing the old strike price by the 
adjustment factor as under.  
Market Lot / Multiplier: The new market lot/multiplier shall be arrived at by multiplying 
the old market lot by the adjustment factor as under.  
Position:  The  new  position  shall  be  arrived  at  by  multiplying  the  old  position  by  the 
adjustment factor as under.  
 
 
The adjustment factor for Bonus, Stock Splits and Consolidations is arrived at as follows: 
 
Bonus  
Ratio – A: B Adjustment factor: (A+B)/B  
 
Stock Splits and Consolidations  
Ratio – A: B Adjustment factor: A/B  
 
Right  
Ratio – A: B and Issue price of rights is S. 
Adjustment factor: (P-E)/P  
Where P = Spot price on last cum date 
           E = (P-S) x A / (A+B)  
 
Strike Price: The new strike price shall be arrived at by multiplying the old strike price by 
the adjustment factor as under.  
 
Market Lot / Multiplier: The new market lot/multiplier shall be arrived at by dividing the 
old market lot by the adjustment factor as under. 
 
The  above  methodology  may  result  in  fractions  due  to  the  corporate  action  e.g.  a  bonus 
ratio of 3:7. With a view to minimizing fraction settlements, the following methodology is 
proposed to be adopted:  

a.  Compute value of the position before adjustment  
b.  Compute value of the position taking into account the exact adjustment factor  
c.  Carry out rounding off for the Strike Price and Market Lot  
d.  Compute value of the position based on the revised strike price and market lot  

The difference between a and d above, if any, shall be decided in the manner laid down by 
the  group  by  adjusting  Strike  Price  or  Market  Lot,  so  that  no  forced  closure  of  open 
position is mandated. 
 
Dividends  which  are  below  10%  of  the  market  value  of  the  underlying  stock  would  be 
deemed to be ordinary dividends and no adjustment in the Strike Price would be made for 
ordinary  dividends.  For  extra-ordinary  dividends,  above  10%  of  the  market  value  of  the 
underlying stock, the Strike Price would be adjusted.

The Exchange may on a case to case basis carry out adjustments for other corporate actions 
as decided by the group in conformity with the above guidelines. 
 
Stock Exchanges to give notice of four weeks to the market for any change in the contract 
specifications and also in case of change in a constituent of an Index on which derivatives 
are available.  
 
Clause  16  of  the  Equity  Listing  Agreement  includes  that  the  company  on  whose  stocks, 
derivatives are available or whose stocks form part of an index on which derivatives are 
available, shall give a notice period of 30 days to stock exchanges for corporate actions like 
mergers, de-mergers, splits and bonus shares. 
  
All the following conditions shall be met in the case of shares of a company undergoing 
restructuring through any means for eligibility to re-introduce derivative contracts on that 
company from the first day of listing of the post restructured company/(s) ’s (as the case 
may be) stock (herein referred to as post restructured company) in the underlying market,  

a.  the  futures  and  options  contracts  on  the  stock  of  the  original  (pre  restructure) 

company were traded on any exchange prior to its restructuring;  

b.  the pre restructured company had a market capitalisation of at least Rs.1000 crores 

prior to its restructuring; 

c.  the post restructured company would be treated like a new stock and if it is, in the 
opinion  of  the  exchange,  likely  to  be  at  least  one-third  the  size  of  the  pre 
restructuring  company  in  terms  of  revenues,  or  assets,  or  (where  appropriate) 
analyst valuations; and  

d.  in the opinion of the exchange, the scheme of restructuring does not suggest that the 
post  restructured  company  would  have  any  characteristic  (for  example  extremely 
low free float) that would render the company ineligible for derivatives trading,  

 
If the above conditions are satisfied, then the exchange shall take the following course of 
action in dealing with the existing derivative contracts on the pre-restructured company and 
introduction of fresh contracts on the post restructured company: 
 

a.  In the contract month in which the post restructured company begins to trade, the 
Exchange  shall  introduce  near  month,  middle  month  and  far  month  derivative 
contracts on the stock of the restructured company.  

b.  In subsequent contract months, the normal rules for entry and exit of stocks in terms 
of  eligibility  requirements  would  apply.  If  these  tests  are  not  met,  the  exchange 
shall not permit further derivative contracts on this stock and future month series 
shall not be introduced.  

 
The Exchanges shall determine the manner of adjustment in derivative contracts at the time 
of corporate actions in conformity with the following principles:-  

a.  The basis for any adjustment for corporate action shall be such that the value of the 
position  of  the  market  participants  on  cum  and  ex-date  for  corporate  action  shall 
continue to remain the same as far as possible.

d.  The Exchanges shall ensure that the adjustment methodology for a corporate action 

Straight Through Processing (STP) is generally understood to be a mechanism that 
automates  the  end  to  end  processing  of  transactions  of  financial  instruments.  It 
involves  use  of  a  system  to  process  or  control  all  elements  of  the  work  flow  of  a 
financial transaction, what are commonly known as the Front, Middle, Back office 
and General Ledger. In other words, STP allows electronic capturing and processing 
of transactions in one pass from the point of order origination to final settlement. STP 
thus  streamlines  the  process  of  trade  execution  and  settlement  and  avoids  manual 
entry and re-entry of the details of the same trade by different market intermediaries 
and participants. Usage of STP enables orders to be processed, confirmed, settled in a 
shorter time period and in a more cost effective manner with fewer errors. Apart from 
compressing  the  clearing  and  settlement  time,  STP  also  provides  a  flexible,  cost 
effective 
through  online 
processing and access to enterprise data. 

infrastructure,  which  enables  e-business  expansion

To resolve the issue of inter-operability between the STP Service Providers, a STP 
Centralised  Hub  would  be  setup  in  consultation  with  the  stock  exchanges  and  the 
STP Service Providers. Currently this STP Centralised Hub has been setup and made 
operational by NSE. NSE has obtained the necessary approvals from Department of 
Telecommunications (DoT) as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Subsequently this 
STP Centralised Hub would be further developed jointly with BSE. 

In view of the aforesaid developments, it has been decided that all the institutional 
trades executed on the stock exchanges would be mandatorily processed through the 
STP System. An institutional trade for the purpose of STP shall mean a trade which 
is settled through a custodian. Institutional trades where electronic contract note in 
the prescribed format is issued, no physical contract note (for such a trade) shall be 
issued by the brokers. The system flow of the STP framework would be as follows:  

a.  A STP user intending to send an instruction would send the message to his 

STP service provider after digitally signing the same.  

b.  The  STP  service  provider  would  verify  the  signature  of  the  STP  user  and 

forward it to the  

i) Recipient STP user, if the recipient STP user is availing services of the 
same STP service provider; or the 
ii) STP centralized hub if the recipient STP user is not with the same STP 
service  provider.  In  such  a  case  the  STP  service  provider  would  be 
required to prepare a message as per the STP centralized hub prescribed 
message  format,  enclose  the  user’s  message,  digitally  sign  the  message 
and then send it to the STP centralized hub  

c.  On receipt of the message by the STP centralized hub, the STP centralized 

hub would  
i)  verify  the  signature  of  the  sending  STP  service  provider  only.  
ii) send an acknowledgment to the sending STP service provider. 

d.  The STP centralized hub would forward the message to the recipient STP 

service provider after digitally signing on the message.  

e.  The recipient STP service provider on receipt of the message from the STP 
centralized hub shall verify the signature of the STP centralized hub, verify 
if  the  recipient  STP  user  is  associated  with  itself  and  send  an  appropriate 
acknowledgment with digital signature to the STP centralized hub. The STP 
centralized hub would in turn forward the acknowledgment (received from 
the recipient STP service provider) duly signed to the sending STP service 
provider.  

f.  The  recipient  STP  service  provider  shall  forward  the  message  to  the 
recipient STP user. The recipient STP user would receive the message and 
verify the signature of the recipient STP service provider and sending STP 
user.  

To enable inter-operation, the STP centralized hub would provide a utility / client 
software to the STP service provider. The STP service provider’s point of interface 
with  the  STP  centralized  hub  would  be  through  this  utility  /  client  software.  The 

Page 107 of 156 

 

 

 

 

PKI (Public key infrastructure) system for the interface shall be implemented at a 
later stage. The block diagram of the entire STP System is enclosed in Annexure I. 
 
SEBI in order to regulate the STP service has issued the SEBI (STP centralised hub 
and  STP  service  providers)  Guidelines,  2004  (herein  referred  to  as  “STP 
Guidelines”)  which  also  prescribes  the  model  agreement  between  the  STP 
centralised hub and the STP service providers. 
 
The STP guidelines prescribes the eligibility criteria and conditions of approval for 
the  STP  centralised  hub  and  the  STP  service  providers,  obligations  and 
responsibilities of the STP centralized hub and the STP service providers and code 
of  conduct  for  the  STP  service  providers.  The  STP  centralised  hub  and  the  STP 
service  providers  shall  abide  by  these  Guidelines.  The  guidelines  are  given  as 
Annexure II. 
 
To prescribe contractual obligations between the STP centralised hub and the STP 
service  providers  and  to  facilitate  standardisation  of  service,  a  model  agreement 
between  the  STP  centralised  hub  and  the  STP  service  providers  has  also  been 
prescribed  by  SEBI  and  is  prescribed  as  Schedule  II  of  the  STP  Guidelines.  The 
agreement  between  the  STP  centralised  hub  and  the  STP  service  provider  shall 
include the provisions included in the model agreement. 
 
STP users shall be required to use IFN 515 messaging standard for issue of contract 
note, IFN 548 / 598 for confirmation of the contract note by the custodian / fund 
manager  to  the  broker  and  messaging  formats  IFN  540  to  547  for  settlement 
instructions and their confirmations between the fund manager and the custodians 
for settlement of such trades.  

The messaging formats prescribed for STP in India is based on the internationally 
accepted  ISO  15022  messaging  standards.  However  the  descriptors  for  each 
messaging  format  had  been  formulated  in  a  manner  to  describe  the  practices 
followed  in  the  Indian  securities’  market  (from  the  perspective  of  settlement 
obligation of a stock broker). However it has been observed that that there has been 
some confusion in certain sections of the market with respect to the intended use of 
the messaging format on account of the messaging descriptors.  

Accordingly it is clarified that the descriptors shall mean the following:  
a.  IFN 540: settlement instruction for a buy trade free of payment  
b.  IFN 541: settlement instruction for a buy trade against payment  
c.  IFN 542: settlement instruction for a sell trade free of payment  
d.  IFN 543: settlement instruction for a sell trade against payment  
e.  IFN  544:  confirmation  of  a  settlement  instruction  for  a  buy  trade  free  of 

f.  IFN  545:  confirmation  of  a  settlement  instruction  for  a  buy  trade  against 

payment (response to IFN 540)  

payment (response to IFN 541)

g.  IFN  546:  confirmation  of  a  settlement  instruction  for  a  sell  trade  free  of 

h.  IFN  547:  confirmation  of  a  settlement  instruction  for  a  sell  trade  against 

payment (response to IFN 542).  

payment (response to IFN 543)  

It is also clarified that in the IFN 515 message, if the trade is intended to be settled 
by  the  custodian  with  the  Clearing  Corporation  (by  accepting  the  settlement 
obligation),  then  it  shall  be  termed  as  "FREE"  and  if  the  trade  is  intended  to  be 
settled  by  the  broker  with  the  Clearing  Corporation  then  it  shall  be  termed  as 
"APMT" (meaning against payment) in the tag 22H of the IFN 515 message. 
 
In  order  to  integrate  the  Securities  Transaction  Tax  (STT)  in  the  STP  system,  it 
would  be  necessary  to  provide  for  necessary  fields  in  the  appropriate  messaging 
standards.  After  deliberation  with  the  STP  centralised  hub  and  the  STP  service 
providers, it has been decided to make the following modifications in the prescribed 
messaging formats: 

a.  Message  Types  that  shall  be  modified  are  IFN515,  IFN540,  IFN541, 

IFN542 and IFN543 

b.  A  Qualifier  shall  be  used  to  identify  Securities  Transaction  Tax  Amount: 

"COUN", Country, National Federal Tax.  

c.  The change in the ISO Structure for the impacted message types shall be as 

follows:

IFN542 and IFN543) 

e.  Securities  Transaction  Tax  block  will  be  mandatory  amount  block  in

SEBI  has  extended  the  facility  of  issuance  of  ECNs  as  a  legal  document  using 
Straight  Through  Processing  (STP)  to  the  equity  derivatives  segment  also. 
Accordingly a model contract note in electronic form (IFN 515 messaging format) 
and  confirmation  of  electronic  contract  note  (IFN  598  messaging  format)  are 
enclosed as Annexure III. The Exchanges are advised to modify/amend their bye-
laws, rules and regulations to;  

a.  Permit  issuance  of  electronic  contract  note  including  all  the  standard  pre-

printed terms and conditions as given in the physical contract note.  

b.  Permit signing of the electronic contract note with a digital signature so as to 
make  the  modified  format  of  the  electronic  contract  note  a  valid  legal 
document like the physical contract note.  

c.  Prescribe a standard format for the issuance of the electronic contract note.  

 
The  standard  terms  of  contract  as  are  required  to  be  mentioned  in  the  Contract 
Notes as per the Bye-laws and Regulations of exchanges, which are not contained 
in ECNs, shall be incorporated in the Client Broker Agreement or where applicable, 
the Tripartite Agreement between the stock broker, sub-broker and the client. 

The  guidelines  for  conduct  of  certification  examination  for  broker/dealers  and 
salespersons in the derivative market are given as Annexure IV.

schemes (LES) to enhance liquidity of illiquid securities in their equity derivatives 
segments subject to following conditions: 
 

1.  The Stock Exchange shall ensure that the LES, including any modification therein 

or its discontinuation, 

 

 

 

a.  has  the  prior  approval  of  its  Board  and  its  implementation  and 

outcome is monitored by the Board at quarterly intervals;

2.  The LES can be introduced in any of the following securities: 

a.  New securities permitted on the Stock Exchange after the date of this circular, 
b.  Securities in case of a new Stock Exchange / new Segment, and

Exchange, during the last 60 trading days, reaches 1% of market capitalization of 
the underlying, or six months from introduction of the scheme, whichever is earlier. 
 

4.  If a Stock Exchange introduces LES on securities eligible under Para 2 above, other 
Stock  Exchanges  may  introduce  LES  in  the  same  /  competing  securities  even  if 
those are not eligible under Para 2 above. Such LES of the other Stock Exchanges 
cannot be continued beyond the period of LES of the former stock Exchange. 
 

5.  The  incentives  under  LES  shall  be  transparent  and  measurable.  These  may  take 

either of the two forms:

Exchange chooses the form specified in Para ‘5b’ above, the shares, including the 
shares that may accrue on exercise of warrants or options, given as incentives under 
all LES, during a financial year, shall not exceed 25% of the issued and outstanding 
shares of the Stock Exchange as on the last day of the preceding financial year.

12.9 Requirement of Base Minimum Capital for Trading Member 

1.  Base  Minimum  Capital  (BMC)  is  the  deposit  given  by  the  member  of  the  exchange 
against  which  no  exposure  for  trades  is  allowed.  The  BMC  deposit  requirement  was 
prescribed to be commensurate with the risks, other than market risk, that the broker 
may bring to the system. It has been decided to realign the BMC requirements with the 
risk profiles of the stock brokers / trading members in cash / derivative segment of the 
stock exchange.  

2.  Accordingly, the requirement of BMC would be implemented in the following manner 

–  
a.  Stock brokers / trading members shall maintain the prescribed BMC based on their 

 

profiles –  

Categories 

Only Proprietary trading without Algorithmic trading (Algo) 
Trading only on behalf of Client (without proprietary trading) 
and without Algo 
Proprietary trading and trading on behalf of  Client without 
Algo 

 

Page 115 of 156 

BMC 
Deposit 
(in INR)
10 Lacs 
15 Lacs 

25 Lacs 

All Trading Members/Brokers with Algo 

50 Lacs 

 
Explanation:  The  profiling  of  members  may  be  explained  with  the  following 
example  –  A  scenario  may  arise,  wherein,  a  member  has  registration  as  a  “stock 
broker”  as  well  as  a  “trading  member”  and  is  engaged  as  a  principal  doing 
proprietary trading on cash segment and is also engaged as an agent and transacting 
only on behalf of the clients in the derivatives segment. Further, the member may 
not have availed facility for algorithmic trading. In such a case, the profile of such a 
member  shall  be  assessed  as  “Proprietary  trading  and  trading  on  behalf  of  client 
without Algo”. The applicable BMC deposit for such a member shall be INR 25 
Lacs. 

b. This  BMC  deposit  requirement  stipulated  in  the  table  above,  is  applicable  to  all 
stock  brokers  /  trading  members  of  exchanges  having  nation-wide  trading 
terminals.  

c.  For stock brokers / trading members of exchanges not having nation-wide trading 
terminals,  the  deposit  requirement  shall  be  40%  of  the  above  said  BMC  deposit 
requirements. 

d. The BMC deposit shall be maintained for meeting contingencies in any segment of 
the exchange. For members having registration for more than one segment of the 
same  exchange,  the  BMC  deposit  requirement  shall  not  be  additive  for  such 
number  of  segments  and  shall  be  the  highest  applicable  BMC  deposit,  across 
various segment. 

e.  No exposure shall be granted against such BMC deposit. The Stock Exchanges shall 
be permitted to prescribe suitable deposit requirements, over and above the SEBI 
prescribed norms, based on their perception and evaluation of risks involved. 

f.  Minimum 50% of the deposit shall be in the form of cash and cash equivalents. The 

existing guidelines on collateral composition shall continue to remain applicable.

13.4 ANNEXURE-IV 
 
GUIDELINES FOR CONDUCT OF CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION 
 

1.  Objective:  

2.  Curriculum:  

The examination should attempt to test the practical knowledge and skills required 
to operate in the derivatives market ensuring that the caliber of persons entering the 
market is kept high so that investors’ interests are best served. 
  

Any certification programme to be approved by SEBI should ensure that candidates 
have  a  basic  knowledge  of  financial  derivatives  and  an  understanding  of  various 
Acts  and  Rules,  Regulations  and  Byelaws  of  the  Exchange.  The  certification 
programme should at least cover the following: 

  Characteristics of financial derivatives including futures and options.  

  Principals of trading, hedging and investment strategies.  

  Principles of clearing, margining, delivery and settlement and exercise.  

  Risk management systems and procedures.  

  Basics  of  Stock  Index  composition  and  calculation,  including  contract 

specifications.  

  Existing regulatory and legal structure in the securities and futures market 
(including  SCRA,  SEBI  Act,  SEBI  (Stock  Broker  and  Sub-Broker) 
Regulations, 1992, Dr. L.C. Gupta Committee Report, Suggestive Byelaws 
and any other special regulatory requirements of the Derivatives market).  

  Rules,  Regulations  and  Byelaws  of  the  Exchange  (cash  segment  and 

derivatives segment).  

  Broker-Client relationship (Rights and obligations).  

  Accounting standards for derivatives.  

3.  Fully automated testing environment:  

the 

test  and 

The  administration  of 
its  subsequent  evaluation  should  be 
computerised.    The  test  should  be  online  computer  based  where  the  candidate  is 
required  to  answer  multiple  choice  questions  and  forward  them  electronically.  In 
such  an  environment  the  candidate’s  performance  is  also  known  instantaneously. 
Procedure for dispatch of Computerised test also avoid certain malpractices which 
may arise.  

4.  Nationwide access: 

 

Page 151 of 156 

 

 

The test should be conducted in all regions of the country including all metros. The 
test should progressively be conducted in other cities to provide wider access to the 
participants.  

5.  Flexibility of test dates:  

Test dates should be announced in advance and should be held atleast once every 
quarter.  Candidates  should  be  allowed  to  state  their  preference  of  date  and  test 
centre.  

6.  Random generation of questions and Degree of difficulty: 

The  certifying  institute  should  have  a  rich  database  of  questions  which  are 
randomly picked for each candidate taking the test. The questions may be graded on 
different levels of difficulty though uniformity should be maintained in selection of 
questions  from  each  level  for  each  candidate.  Thus  the  level  of  difficulty  of  a 
particular  test  for  a  particular  candidate  should  be  the  same  as  that  for  any  other 
candidate.  

7.  Administrative monitoring:  

The certifying institute should have adequate administrative capability to efficiently 
run  the  certification  programme.  Procedures  for  enquiries  and  registration  for  the 
certification  test  should  be  clearly  laid  down.  The  certificate  to  be  issued  to 
successful  candidates  should  carry  the  photograph  of  the  candidate.  The 
examination should be undertaken on a "no profit" basis. The institution applying 
for recognition to SEBI shall mention the procedure it expects to follow for sending 
the candidate’s scores to prospective employers. At present the examination should 
be kept at a ‘Basic Entry Level’ and later with the development of the market more 
advanced courses/modules may be added.
