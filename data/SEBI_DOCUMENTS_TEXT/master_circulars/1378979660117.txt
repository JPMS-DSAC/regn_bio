Notwithstanding anything stated in (a) above, an employee of 

an  AMC(s)  and/or  Trustees  may  apply  for  shares  and/or 

debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or  warrants  in  a  preferential 

offer,  in  cases  where  such  a  preferential  offer  is  being  made 

by  a  company  that  belongs  to  the  same  industrial  group  as 

the  company 

in  which  the  employee  already  has  an 

investment, provided that such a preferential offer is made to 

all  shareholders  and/or  debenture  holders  of  such 

companies.  Details  of  such  applications  made  shall  be 

intimated to the Compliance Officer.  

c. 

The  employees  of  the  AMC(s)  and/or  Trustees  including 

access person may apply for any rights offer of any company 

in  which  they  are  already  shareholders.  Applications  for 

additional  rights 

(over  and  above 

the  normal  rights 

entitlement) shares may be made by the employees including 

access  person  without  getting  the  clearance 

from  the 

Compliance  Officer.  An  employee  including  access  person 

may also sell and/or renounce his rights entitlement without 

getting the clearance from the Compliance Officer. However, if 

an  access  person  wishes 

to  purchase 

the 

“Rights 

renunciations”  he  shall  get  the  clearance  of  the  Compliance 

Officer  for  the  same.  Such  purchases  shall  be  done  only  at 

market prices. Details of any applications made in any rights 

issue, whether in the normal course, or through purchase of 

rights  renunciations,  shall  be  intimated  to  the  Compliance 

Officer.   

6.4.5.2 Investments through the secondary markets:  

a.  An  access  person  who  wishes  to  make  a  secondary  market 

transaction shall submit a written application to that effect to 

the Compliance Officer. Such an application shall specify the 

 56                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 
 

name  of  the  company  whose  securities  the  employee  wishes 

to buy and/or sell, type of security, and the number of shares 

and/or  debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or  warrants  and/or 

derivatives that the access person wishes to buy/sell.  

b.  The  Compliance  Officer  shall  clear  these  requests  if  the 

following conditions are met:  

1. 

If  the  shares  and/or  debentures  and/or  bonds  and/or 

warrants of the company or derivatives specified by the 

access  person  are  not  held  by  any  scheme  of  the 

Mutual  Fund  of  which  the  AMC  is  the  investment 

manager; 

2. 

If such shares and/or debentures and/or bonds and/or 

warrants of the company or derivatives specified by the 

employee  are  held  by  any  scheme  of  the  Mutual  Fund 

of  which  the  AMC  is  the  investment  manager,  there 

should  be  a  “cooling  off”  period  of  15  calendar  days. 

The  Compliance  Officer  shall  ensure  that  the  last 

transaction in that particular security was done by the 

Mutual Fund at least 15 calendar days prior to the date 

of the written application by the access person. In other 

words, an application for a purchase /sale transaction 

on a personal basis would be cleared only if the Mutual 

Fund has not transacted in that particular security for 

at least 15 calendar days. 

 

 

c.   The Compliance Officer shall keep a track of the transactions of the 

employees  and  transactions  of  the  Mutual  Fund  to  ensure  that 

there  is  no  conflict  of  interest  between  them  i.e.  the  Compliance 

Officer  should  track  whether  the  Mutual  Fund  has  transacted  in 

 57                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 
 

the  same  securities  either  before  or  after 

the  employee’s 

transaction(s).  

d.   The  Compliance  Officer  shall  maintain  a  record  of  all  requests  for 

pre clearance regarding the purchase or sale of a security, including 

the date of the request, the name of the access person, the details 

of the proposed transaction and whether the request was approved 

or denied and waivers given, if any, and its reasons.  

e.   No employee shall purchase any security (including derivatives) on 

a  “Carry  Forward”  basis  or  indulge  in  “Short  Sale”  of  any  security 

(including  derivatives)  i.e.  employees  who  effect  any  purchase 

transaction(s)  shall  ensure  that  they  take  delivery  of  the  securities 

purchased, before selling them. 

f. 

 Any  transaction  of  Front  Running  by  any  employee  directly  or 

indirectly  is  strictly  prohibited.  For  this  purpose,  “Front  Running” 

means any transaction of purchase and/or sale of a security carried 

by any employee whether for self or for any other person, knowing 

fully  well  that  the  AMC  also  intends  to  purchase  and/or  sell  the 

same security for its Mutual Fund operations. To ascertain that the 

employee  had  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  Mutual  Fund's  intended 

transactions, the Compliance Officer may take a declaration in this 

regard from the employee. Such declaration may be included in the 

application form itself.  

g.  Any  transaction  of  self  dealing  by  any  employee  either  directly  or 

indirectly,  whether  alone  or  in  concert  with  another  person  is 

prohibited.  For  this  purpose,  “Self  Dealing’  means  trading  in  the 

securities  based  on  price  sensitive  information  to  which  the 

employee has access by virtue of his office. Declaration to this effect

CHAPTER 9 

VALUATION 

9.1  Definitions190 

9.1.1  Non Traded Securities191  

9.1.1.1 When a security (other than Government Securities) is not traded 

on  any  Stock  Exchange  for  a  period  of  thirty  days  prior  to  the 

valuation date, the scrip shall be treated as a non traded security. 

9.1.2  Thinly Traded Securities 

9.1.2.1 Thinly traded equity/ equity related securities:192 

a.  When  trading  in  an  equity  and/or  equity  related  security 

(such  as  convertible  debentures,  equity  warrants  etc.)  in  a 

month is both less than `5 lacs and the total volume is less 

than  50,000  shares,  the  security  shall  be  considered  as 

thinly traded security and valued accordingly.  

 
b.  In  order  to  determine  whether  a  security  is  thinly  traded  or 

not, the volumes traded in all recognized Stock Exchanges in 

India may be taken into account.  

c.  For example, if the volume of trade is 1,00,000 and value is 

`4,00,000, the shares do not qualify as thinly traded. Also if 

the  volume  traded  is  40,000,  but  the  value  of  trades  is  `6, 

00,000, the shares do not qualify as thinly traded.

d.  Where  a  Stock  Exchange 

identifies  the  thinly  traded 

securities  by  applying  the  above  parameters 

for  the 

preceding  calendar  month  and  publishes  or  provides  the 

required  information  along  with  the  daily  quotations,  the 

same can be used by the Mutual Funds. 

e.  If  the  shares  are  not  listed  on  the  Stock  Exchanges  which 

provide  such  information,  then  Mutual  Funds  shall  make 

their  own  analysis  in  line  with  the  above  criteria  to  check 

whether  such  securities  are  thinly  traded  or  not  and  then 

value them accordingly. 

9.1.3  Thinly traded Debt Securities193  

9.1.3.1 A  debt  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  shall  be 

considered  as  a  thinly  traded  security  if,  on  the  valuation  date, 

there  are  no  individual  trades  in  that  security  in  marketable  lots 

(currently  applicable)  on  the  principal  Stock  Exchange  or  any 

other Stock Exchange.  

 
9.2  Valuation of Securities  

9.2.1  Traded Securities:194 

 

 

9.2.1.1 When a security (other than debt securities) is not traded on any 

Stock Exchange on a particular valuation day, the value at which 

it was traded on the selected Stock Exchange, as the case may be, 

on  the  earliest  previous  day  may  be  used  provided  such  date  is 

not more than thirty days prior to valuation date. 

9.2.1.2 When  a  debt  security  (other  than  Government  Securities)  is  not 

traded  on  any  Stock  Exchange  on  any  particular  valuation  day, 

,

the value at which it was traded on the principal Stock Exchange 

or any other Stock Exchange, as the case may be, on the earliest 

previous  day  may  be  used  provided  such  date  is  not  more  than 

fifteen  days  prior  to  valuation  date.  When  a  debt  security  (other 

than  Government  Securities)  is  purchased  by  way  of  private 

placement,  the  value  at  which  it  was  bought  may  be  used  for  a 

period of fifteen days beginning from the date of purchase. 

9.2.2  Non-Traded /and/or Thinly Traded Securities:195  

9.2.2.1 AMCs  shall  value  non  traded  and/or  thinly  traded  securities  “in 

good faith” based on the Valuation norms prescribed below:  

9.2.3  Non-traded/ and/or thinly traded equity securities: 

9.2.3.1 Based  on  the  latest  available  Balance  Sheet,  Net  Worth  shall  be 

calculated as follows: 

a.  Net  Worth  per  share  =  [Share  Capital+  Reserves  (excluding 

Revaluation  Reserves)  –  Miscellaneous expenditure  and Debit 

Balance  in  Profit  and  Loss  Account]  /  Number  of  Paid  up 

Shares.  

 

b.  Average  Capitalization  rate  (P/E  ratio)  for  the  industry  based 

upon  either  BSE  or  NSE  data  (which  shall  be  followed 

consistently  and  changes, 

if  any,  noted  with  proper 

justification  thereof)  shall  be  taken  and  discounted  by  75  per 

cent i.e. only 25 per cent. Of the industry average P/E shall be 

taken  as  Capitalization  rate  (P/E  ratio).  Earnings  per  share 

(EPS) of the latest audited annual accounts shall be considered 

for this purpose.

c.  The value as per the Net Worth value per share and the capital 

earning  value  calculated  as  above  shall  be  averaged  and 

further discounted by 10 per cent. for illiquidity so as to arrive 

at the fair value per share.  

d. 

In  case  the  EPS  is  negative,  EPS  value  for  that  year  shall  be 

taken as zero for arriving at capitalised earning. 

e. 

In  case  where  the  latest  Balance  Sheet  of  the  company  is  not 

available within nine months from the close of the year, unless 

the accounting year is changed, the shares of such companies 

shall be valued at zero.  

f. 

In  case  an  individual  security  accounts  for  more  than  5  per 

cent.  of the total assets of the  scheme,  an independent  valuer 

shall  be  appointed  for  the  valuation  of  the  said  security.  To 

determine  if  a  security  accounts  for  more  than  5  per  cent.  of 

the  total  assets  of  the  scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  by  the 

procedure above and the proportion which it bears to the total 

net assets of the scheme to which it belongs will be compared 

on the date of valuation196.  

g. 

In case trading in an equity security is suspended up to thirty 

days,  then  the  last  traded  price  shall  be  considered  for 

valuation of that security. If an equity security is suspended for 

more than thirty days, then the AMC(s) or Trustees shall decide 

the  valuation  norms  to  be  followed  and  such  norms  shall  be 

documented and recorded.

9.2.4.1 A thinly traded debt security as defined above  shall be  valued as 

per the norms for non traded debt security. 

a.  Valuation197  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 

maturity of upto 60198 days: 

1.  All money market and debt securities, including floating rate 

securities,  with  residual  maturity  of  upto  60  days  shall  be 

valued at the weighted average price at which they are traded 

on the particular valuation day. When such securities are not 

traded on a particular valuation day they  shall be  valued  on 

amortization  basis.  It  is  further  clarified  that  in  case  of 

floating  rate  securities  with  floor  and  caps  on  coupon  rate 

and  residual  maturity  of  upto  60  days  then  those  shall  be 

valued on amortization basis taking the coupon rate as floor. 

b.  Valuation  of  money  market  and  debt  securities  with  residual 

maturity of over 60199 days: 

1.  All money market and debt securities, including floating rate 

securities,  with  residual  maturity  of  over  60  days  shall  be 

valued at weighted average price at which they are traded on 

the  particular  valuation  day.  When  such  securities  are  not 

traded  on  a  particular  valuation  day  they  shall  be  valued  at 

benchmark yield/ matrix of spread over risk free benchmark 

yield obtained from agency(ies) entrusted for the said purpose 

by AMFI. 

2.  The  approach  in  valuation  of  non  traded  debt  securities  is 

based  on  the  concept  of  using  spreads  over  the  benchmark 

rate to arrive at the yields for pricing the non traded security.

3.  The  Yields  for  pricing the  non  traded debt  security  would  be 

arrived at using the process as defined below.  

Step  1:  A  Risk  Free  Benchmark  Yield  is  built  using  the 

government securities as the base. Government securities are 

used  as  the  benchmarks  as  they  are  traded  regularly;  free  of 

credit  risk;  and  traded  across  different  maturity  spectrums 

every week.  

 
Step 2: A Matrix of spreads (based on the credit risk) are built 

for  marking  up  the  benchmark  yields.  The  matrix  is  built 

based  on  traded  corporate  paper  on  the  wholesale  debt 

segment  of  an  appropriate  stock  exchange  and  the  primary 

market issuances. The matrix is restricted only to investment 

grade corporate paper.  

 
Step  3:  The  yields  as  calculated  above  are  Marked-

up/Marked-down for ill-liquidity risk  

 
Step 4: The Yields so arrived are used to price the portfolio. 

 
9.3  Methodology:  

9.3.1  Construction of Risk Free Benchmark200 

9.3.1.1 Using Government of India dated securities; the Benchmark shall 

be constructed as below: 

 

a.  Government of India dated securities will be grouped into various 

duration buckets such as 0.164-0.25 yrs201, 0.25- 0.5 yrs202, 0.5-

1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, 5-6 years and 6 years and 

the  volume  weighted  yield  would  be  computed  for  each  bucket.

These  duration  buckets  may  be  changed  to  reflect  the  market 

value  more  closely  by  any  agency  suggested  by  AMFI  giving 

benchmark yield/ matrix of spreads over benchmark yield.  

b.  The  benchmark  as  calculated  above  will  be  set  at  least  weekly, 

and  in  the  event  of  any  significant  movement  in  prices  of 

Government Securities on account of any event impacting interest 

rated  on  any  day  such  as  a  change in  the Reserve  Bank  of  India 

(RBI)   policies,  the  benchmark  will  be  reset  to reflect  any  change 

in the market conditions.  

9.3.2  Building a Matrix of Spreads for Marking-up the Benchmark Yield203  

9.3.2.1 Mark  up  for  credit  risk  over  the  risk  free  benchmark  YTM  as 

calculated  in  9.3.1  above,  will  be  determined  using  the  trades  of 

corporate  debentures/bonds  of  different  ratings.  All  trades  on 

appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  fortnight  prior  to  the 

benchmark  date  will  be  used  in  building  the  corporate  YTM  and 

spread  matrices.  Initially  these  matrices  will  be  built  only  for 

corporate  securities  of  investment  grade.  The  matrices  are 

dynamic and the spreads will be computed every week. The matrix 

will be built for all duration buckets for which the benchmark GOI 

matrix is built to effectively link the corporate matrix with the GOI 

securities matrix. Accordingly:  

a.  All  traded  paper  (with  minimum  traded  value  of  `1  crore)  will  be 

classified by their ratings and grouped into 7 duration buckets; for 

rated securities, the most conservative publicly available rating will 

be used;  

b. For  each  rating  category,  average  volume  weighted  yield  will  be 

obtained both from trades  on the appropriate stock exchange and 

from the primary market issuances;

c. Where  there  are  no  secondary  trades  on  the  appropriate  stock 

exchange  in  a  particular  rating  category  and  no  primary  market 

issuances during the fortnight under consideration, then trades on 

appropriate  stock  exchange  during  the  30  day  period  prior  to  the 

benchmark date will be considered for computing the average YTM 

for such rating category;  

d. If  the  matrix  cannot  be  populated  using  any  or  all  of  the  above 

steps,  then  credit  spreads  from  trades  on  appropriate  stock 

exchange of the relevant rating category over the AAA trades will be 

used to populate the matrix;  

e. In each rating category, all outliers will be removed for smoothening 

the YTM matrix;  

f.  Spreads  will  be  obtained  by  deducting  the  YTM  in  each  duration 

category from the respective YTM of the GOI securities;  

g. In  the  event  of  lack  of  trades  in  the  secondary  market  and  the 

primary  market  the  gaps  in  the  matrix  would  be  filled  by 

extrapolation. If the spreads cannot be extrapolated for the reason 

of practicality, the gaps in the matrix will be filled by carrying the 

spreads from the last matrix. 

h. Accordingly,  all  Mutual  Funds  shall  provide  transaction  details  of 

various  types  of  debt  securities  like  NCDs,  Mibor  linked  floaters 

and  CPs  on  daily  basis  in  the  prescribed  format  enclosed  at 

Annexure  3  to  the  agency  recommended  by  AMFI.  Submission  of 

data  would  help  in  daily  matrix  generation,  would  improve 

uniformity  and  accuracy  of  valuation  in  the  Mutual  Funds 

industry204.  

9.3.3  Mark-up/Mark-down Yield 

9.3.3.1 The  Yields  calculated  would  be  marked-up/marked-down  to 

account  for  the  illiquidity  risk,  promoter  background,  finance 

company  risk  and  the  issuer  class  risk.  As  the  level  of  illiquidity

cognizance of the differential interest rate risk of the securities. 

This structure will be reviewed periodically.  

b.  Adjustments for Internally Rated Securities206  

1.  To value an un-rated security, the fund manager shall assign 

an  internal  credit  rating,  which  will  be  used  for  valuation. 

Since un-rated instruments tend to be more illiquid than rated 

securities,  the  yields  would  be  marked  up  by  adding 

discretionary discount as under:

9.4  Valuation of securities with Put/Call Options:208  

9.4.1  The option embedded securities would be valued as follows:  

 

 

 

 

 

9.4.1.1 Securities with call option  

a.  The securities with call option shall be valued at the lower of the 

value  as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and 

valuing the security to call option. In case there are multiple call 

options, the  lowest  value  obtained  by  valuing  to  the  various  call 

dates and valuing to the maturity date is to be taken as the value 

of the instrument.  

9.4.1.2 Securities with Put option 

a.  The securities with put option shall be valued at the higher of the 

value  as  obtained  by  valuing  the  security  to  final  maturity  and 

valuing the security to put option. In case there are multiple put 

options, the highest value obtained by valuing to the various put

9.7  Guidelines  for  Identification  and  Provisioning  for  Non 

Performing Assets (Debt Securities)211 

9.7.1  Definition of a Non Performing Asset (NPA)  

9.7.1.1  An  ‘asset’  shall  be  classified  as  NPA  if  the  interest  and/or 

principal amount have not been received or remained outstanding 

for one quarter from the day such income and/or installment was 

due.  

9.7.2  Effective date for classification and provisioning of NPAs  

9.7.2.1 The definition of NPA may be applied after a quarter past due date 

of the interest.  

9.7.3  Treatment of income accrued on the NPA and further accruals 

9.7.3.1 After  the  expiry  of  the  1st  quarter  from  the  date  the  income  has 

fallen  due,  there  will  be  no  further  interest  accrual  on  the  asset. 

In  short,  from  the  beginning  of  the  2nd  quarter  there  will  be  no 

further accrual on income.  

9.7.3.2 On classification of the asset as NPA from a quarter past due date 

of  interest,  all  interest  accrued  and  recognized  in  the  books  of 

accounts of the Mutual Fund till the date shall be provided for.

9.7.4  Provision for NPAs – Debt Securities 

9.7.4.1 Both  secured  and  unsecured 

investments,  once  they  are 

recognized      as  NPAs,  call  for  provisioning  in  the  same  manner 

and where these are related to close ended schemes, the phasing 

would be such that to ensure full provisioning prior to the closure 

of the scheme or the scheduled phasing which ever is earlier.  

9.7.4.2 The value of the asset shall be provided in the following manner or 

earlier  at  the  discretion  of  the  Mutual  Fund.  Mutual  Funds  will 

not  have  discretion  to  extend  the  period  of  provisioning.  The 

provisioning against the principal amount or installments shall be 

made at the following rates irrespective of whether the principal is 

due for repayment or not. 

a.  10  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  shall  be  provided  for 

after  6  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  3  months  form  the 

date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

b.  20  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  should  be  provided  for 

after  9  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  6  months  from  the 

date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

c.  Another  20  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  shall  be 

provided  for  after  12  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  9 

months from the date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

d.  Another  25  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  shall  be 

provided  for  after  15  months  past  due  date  of  interest  i.e.  12 

months from the date of classification of the asset as NPA.  

e.  The  balance  25  percent  of  the  book  value  of  the  asset  shall  be 

provided for after 18 months past due  date of the interest  i.e. 15 

months from the date of classification of the assets as NPA.  

 97                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.7.4.3 Book value for the purpose of provisioning for NPAs shall be taken 

as a value determined as per the prescribed valuation method.  

9.7.4.4 This can be explained by an illustration:  

a.  Let us consider that interest income is due on a half yearly basis 

and  the  due  date  falls  on  30.06.2000  and  the  interest  is  not 

received  till  1st  quarter  after  due  date  i.e.  30.09.2000.  The 

provisioning will be done in the following phased manner:   

10% provision  01.01.2001 

20% provision  01.04.2001 
20% provision  01.07.2001 
25% provision  01.10.2001 
25% provision  01.01.2002 

6 months past due date of 
interest i.e. 3 months from the 
date of classification of asset 
as NPA (01.10.2000) 
  
  
  
  

b.  Thus, one and half years past the due date of income or one year 

and  three  months  from  the  date  of  classification  of  the  ‘asset’  as 

an NPA, the ‘asset’ will be fully provided for. If any installment is 

fallen  due,  during  the  period  of  interest  default, the  amount  of 

provision  shall  be  the  installment  amount  or  above  provision 

amount, whichever is higher.  

9.7.5  Reclassification of assets 

9.7.5.1 Upon reclassification of assets as ‘performing assets’:  

a.  In case a company has fully cleared all the arrears of interest, the 

interest provisions can be written back in full.  

b.  The  asset  will  be  reclassified  as  performing  on  clearance  of  all 

interest arrears and if the debt is regularly serviced over the next 

two quarters.  

c.  In  case  the  company  has  fully  cleared  all  the  arrears  of  interest, 

the interest not credited on accrual basis shall be credited at the 

time of receipt.  

 98                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 
 

 

d.  The provision made for the principal amount can be written back 

in the following manner  

1.  100%  of  the  asset  provided  for  in  the  books  will  be  written 

back  at  the  end  of  the  2nd  quarter  where  the  provision  of 

principal was made due to the interest defaults only.  

2.  50%  of  the  asset  provided  for  in  the  books  will  be  written 

back  at  the  end  of  the  2nd  quarter  and  25%  after  every 

subsequent  quarter  where  both  installments  and  interest 

payment were in default earlier.  

3.  Explanation:  The  words  “2nd  quarter”  wherever  appear,  shall 

mean 2nd calendar quarter.212 

e.  An  asset  is  reclassified  as  'standard  asset'  only  when  both,  the 

overdue  interest  and  overdue  installments  are  paid  in  full  and 

there  is  satisfactory  performance  for  a  subsequent  period  of  6 

months.  

9.7.6  Receipt of past dues: 

9.7.6.1 When  the  Mutual  Fund  has  received  income/  principal  amount 

after their classifications as NPAs:  

a.  For the next 2 quarters, income shall be recognized on cash basis 

and thereafter on accrual basis. The asset will be continued to be 

classified as NPA for these two quarters.  

b.  During this period of two quarters although the asset is classified 

as NPA no provision needs to be made for the principal if the same 

is not due and outstanding. 

c.  If part payment is received towards principal, the asset continues 

to  be  classified  as  NPA  and  provisions  are  continued  as  per  the 

norms  set  at  9.7.4  above  any  excess  provision  will  be  written 

back.

9.7.7  Classification of Deep Discount Bonds as NPAs 

9.7.7.1 Investments in Deep Discount Bonds can be classified as NPAs, if 

any two of the following conditions are satisfied:  

a. 

If  the  rating  of  the  Bond  comes  down  to  Grade  ‘BB’  (or  its 

equivalent) or below  

b. 

If  the  company  is  defaulting  in  their  commitments  in  respect  of 

other assets, if available.  

c.  Full Net worth erosion.  

9.7.7.2 Provision should be made as per the norms set at 9.7.4 above as 

soon as the asset is classified as NPA.  

9.7.7.3 Full provision can be made if the rating comes down to Grade ‘D’ 

(or its equivalent). 

9.7.8  Reschedulement of an asset 

9.7.8.1 In  case  a  company  defaults  in  payment  of  either  interest  or 

principal  amount  and  the  Mutual  Fund  has  accepted  a 

rescheduling  of  the  schedule  of  payments,  then  the  following 

practice shall be adhered to:  

a. 

In case it is a first reschedulement and only payment of interest 

is  in  default,  the  classification  of  the  asset  as  NPA  shall  be 

continued and existing provisions shall not be written back. This 

practice shall be continued for two quarters of regular servicing of 

the  debt.  Thereafter,  this  be  classified  as  ‘performing  asset’  and 

the interest provided can be written back. 

b. 

If  the  reschedulement  is  done  due  to  default  in  interest  and 

principal amount, the asset shall continue as NPA for a period of 

4  quarters,  even  though  the  asset  is  continued  to  be  serviced 

during  these  4  quarters  regularly.  Thereafter,  the  asset  can  be 

classified  as  ‘performing  asset’  and  all  the  interest  provided  till 

such date shall be written back.

c. 

If  the  reschedulement  is  done  for  a  second/  third  time  or 

thereafter,  the  characteristics  of  NPA  should  be  continued  for 

eight quarters of regular servicing of the debt. The provision shall 

be written back only after the asset is reclassified as ‘performing 

asset’. 

9.7.9  Disclosure in the Half Yearly Portfolio Reports 

9.7.9.1 Mutual Funds  shall  make  scrip  wise  disclosures  of  NPAs  on  Half 

Yearly basis along with the Half Yearly Portfolio Disclosure in the 

format prescribed213. 

9.7.9.2 The  total  amount  of  provisions  made  against  the  NPAs  shall  be

proportion to the assets of the Mutual Fund scheme. In the list of 

investments  and  asterisk  mark  shall  be  given  against  such 

investments  which  are  recognized  as  NPAs.  Where  the  date  of 

redemption  of  an  investment  has  lapsed,  the  amount  not

provided, that where an investment is redeemable by installments, 

that  will  be  shown  as  an  investment  until  all  installments  have 

become overdue.

9.8.1.1 Methodology for  Valuation  -  unlisted  equity  shares  of  a  company 

shall be valued "in good faith" as below:  

a.  Based  on  the  latest  available  audited  balance  sheet,  Net  Worth 

shall be calculated as the lower of item (1) and (2) below:  

1.  Net  Worth  per  share  =  [Share  Capital  +  Free  Reserves 

(excluding  revaluation  reserves)  -  Miscellaneous  expenditure 

not  written  off  or  deferred  revenue  expenditure,  intangible 

assets and accumulated losses] / Number of Paid up Shares.  

2. 

 After  taking  into  account  the  outstanding  warrants  and 

options,  Net  Worth  per  share  shall  again  be  calculated  and 

shall be = [Share Capital + consideration on exercise of Option 

and/or  Warrants  received/receivable  by  the  Company  +  Free 

Reserves  (excluding  Revaluation  Reserves)  -  Miscellaneous 

expenditure  not  written  off  or  deferred  revenue  expenditure, 

intangible  assets  and  accumulated  losses]  /  Number  of  Paid 

up Shares plus Number  of Shares that would be  obtained  on 

conversion  and/or  exercise  of  Outstanding  Warrants  and 

Options. 

3.  The lower of (1) and (2) above shall be used for calculation of 

Net Worth per share and for further calculation in (c) below. 

b.  Average capitalisation rate (P/E ratio) for the industry based upon 

either BSE or NSE data (which shall be followed consistently and 

changes,  if  any,  noted  with  proper  justification  thereof)  shall  be 

taken and discounted by 75 per cent. i.e. only 25 per cent of the 

industry  average  P/E  shall  be  taken  as  capitalisation  rate  (P/E 

ratio).  Earnings  per  share  (EPS)  of  the  latest  audited  annual 

accounts will be considered for this purpose.  

c.  The  value  as  per  the  Net  Worth  value  per  share  and  the  capital 

earning  value  calculated  as  above  shall  be  averaged  and  further 

 102                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds  

 

 
 

 

discounted by 15 per cent for illiquidity so as to arrive at the fair 

value per share. 

9.8.1.2 The above valuation methodology shall be subject to the following 

conditions:  

a.  All calculations shall be based on audited accounts.  

b. 

If the latest Balance Sheet of the company is not available within 

nine  months  from  the  close  of  the  year,  unless  the  accounting 

year is changed, the shares of such companies shall be valued at 

zero.  

c. 

If  the  Net  Worth  of  the  company  is  negative,  the  share  would  be 

marked down to zero.  

d. 

In case the EPS is negative, EPS value for that year shall be taken 

as zero for arriving at capitalised earning.  

e. 

In  case an  individual  security  accounts  for  more  than  5  per  cent 

of the total assets  of the scheme, an independent valuer shall be 

appointed for the valuation of the said security. To determine if a 

security  accounts  for  more  than  5  per  cent  of  the  total  assets  of 

the  scheme,  it  shall  be  valued  in  accordance  with  the  procedure 

as mentioned above on the date of valuation. 

9.8.2  At the discretion of the AMCs and with the approval of the Trustees, 

unlisted equity shares may be valued at a price lower than the value 

derived using the aforesaid methodology.
