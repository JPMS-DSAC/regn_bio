SECTION – 1: ANNUAL SYSTEMS AUDIT 

1.1   Annual System Audit for Stock Exchanges1 
 

1.  Considering  the  importance  of  systems  audit  in  a  highly  technology 
driven securities market, it has been decided that exchanges shall conduct 
audit  of  their  systems  by  a  reputed  independent  auditor  on  an  annual 
basis. The systems audit should be comprehensive encompassing audit of 
systems  and  processes  related  to  examination  of  Trading  Systems, 
Clearing and Settlement Systems (Clearing Corporation/Clearing House), 
Risk  Management,  Databases,  Disaster  Recovery  Sites,  Business 
Continuity  Planning,  Security,  Capacity  Management  and  Information 
Security Audit. 

2.  Accordingly, Stock Exchanges are advised to get the above systems audit 
conducted  on  an  annual  basis  and  such  Systems  Audit  Report  and 
Compliance Status be placed before the Governing Board of the exchange. 
The  systems  audit  report  /  findings  along  with  comments  of  Stock 
Exchanges should be communicated to SEBI.  

 

 

 

 
 
1.2  Annual System Audit for Depositories2 
 

1.  Regulation 35 of the SEBI (Depositories and Participant) Regulations, 1996 
requires  that  “Every  depository  shall  cause  an  inspection  of  its  controls, 
systems,  procedures  and  safeguards  to  be  carried  out  annually  and 
forward a copy of the report to the Board”. 

2.  In  this  context,  it  is  advised  that  the  Systems  Audit  of  the  depository 
should  be  carried  out  once  every  year  and  such  Systems  Audit  Report 
along with the compliance status should be placed before the Governing 
Board of the depository. Such report should include security audit as well. 
The systems audit report / findings along with comments of Depositories

Execution  of  Power  of  Attorney  (PoA)  by  the  Client  in  favour  of  the 
Stock Broker/ Stock Broker and Depository Participant3 

1.  A Power of Attorney is executed by the client in favour of the stock broker 
/stock  broker  and  depository  participant  to  authorize  the  broker  to 
operate  the  client’s  demat  account  and  bank  account  to  facilitate  the 
delivery of shares and pay–in/ pay–out of funds. 

2.  Generally,  the  PoA  is  taken  from  the  clients  who  want  to  avail  internet 
based trading services. For offering internet based trading services, a stock 
broker  requires  necessary  authorizations  for  seamless  trading,  collection 
of margins as well as settlement of funds and securities. Further, some of 
the stock brokers also obtain authorizations from their clients to offer non-
internet based services. 

3.  It  has  come  to  SEBI’s  notice  that  the  clients  are  compelled  to  give 
irrevocable  power  of  attorney  to  manage  clients’  demat  account(s)  and 
bank account(s) so that the clients are able to pay funds or deliver shares 
to their brokers on time. In some cases, the PoA even allows a broker to 
open  and  close  accounts  on  behalf  of  the  client  and  to  trade  on  client’s 
account without the consent of the client. 

4.  In order to standardize the norms to be followed by stock brokers / stock 
broker and depository participants while obtaining PoA from the clients, 
guidelines have been finalized based on discussions in Secondary Market 
Advisory  Committee  of  SEBI  (SMAC)  and  feedback  from  market 
participants, investor associations, major stock exchanges and depositories 
on discussion paper on the captioned subject put on SEBI website. It has 
been decided that the guidelines as set out in para 7, 8 and 9 shall be made 
applicable to stock brokers / stock broker and depository participants. 

5.  Standardizing  the  norms  for  PoA  must  not  be  construed  as  making  the 
PoA  a  condition  precedent  or  mandatory  for  availing  broking  or 
depository participant services. PoA is merely an option available to the 
client for instructing his broker or depository participant to facilitate the 
delivery  of  shares  and  pay-in/pay-out  of  funds,  etc.  No  stock  broker  or 
depository participant shall deny services to the client if the client refuses 
to execute a PoA in their favour.
