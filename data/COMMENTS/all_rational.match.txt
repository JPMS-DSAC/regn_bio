reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt:24.  The  rationale  and  advantages  of  the  STT  regime  have  been  amplified  in  the  earlier

reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-introduction  of  the  STT  regime  (on  entry  and  redemption  for  each  investor)  will  ensure

reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt- 
reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-In an endeavor to provide a level playing field to the participants in the securities 
reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-market while not compromising on the protection of investor interests, it has been 
reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-decided to bring about certain changes in the Guidelines that are felt necessary. The

reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-continuous  listing  requirement.  This  gave  rise  to  a  situation  that  securities 
reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-were bound to get delisted if the public shareholding reduced from the levels 
reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-required to be maintained for the purpose of continuous listing.

reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt:While  the  rationale  of  mandating  levels  for  continuous  listing  is  based  on

reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-delisting was resulting in delisting of securities even while a huge residue of

reports_for_public_comments/1593416996354.txt:The  rationale  for  an  SSE  is  multipronged.  Most  importantly,  the  public  provision  of  essential

reports_for_public_comments/1593416996354.txt-providers  by  channeling  greater  capital  to  them.  To  take just three examples  – education, health

reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt:Rationale:  Three  clear  working  days’  notice  would  actually  result  in  dissemination  of 
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-information to shareholders and other investors at least 4 days before record date and at 
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-least 3 days before share starts trading on an ex-rights basis. It, therefore, gives enough 
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-time for shareholders and investors to trade in the shares.  Notice of 3 clear working days 
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-would enable execution and settlement of any trades consequent to decision on terms of

reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt:Rationale:  A  public  advertisement  process  adds  time  and  cost  to  the  rights  issue 
reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-process.  All  material  information  is  communicated  to  shareholders/  investors  through

reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-communicate  with  their shareholders,  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Hence, the  requirement to

reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-and can be value enhancing, there have been concerns about some such transactions 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-being questionable or against the interest of minority shareholders or even bordering 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-on  fraud  or  ill-intent,  particularly  in  the  recent  past.    There  have  also  been  cases 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-observed  where  an  entity  has  complied  with  the  letter  of  the  law,  while  ignoring  its

reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-included  within  the  purview  of  ‘related  parties’.    The  Working  Group  noted  that  in 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-several  jurisdictions  such  as  the  United  Kingdom  (“U.K.”),  Italy  and  Korea, 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-shareholders with a holding above certain thresholds are deemed to be related parties 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt:of such company. In such jurisdictions, the rationale for such inclusion is that a person 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-with significant shareholding could influence the decisions of a company. The Working 
reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-Group deliberated that in the Indian context also, there may be a shareholder who is

committee_reports/1288588001441.txt-
committee_reports/1288588001441.txt-would appear to be no role for credit rating. 
committee_reports/1288588001441.txt-

annual_reports/part-1_p.txt-the primary markets if (i) they had a track record of distributable profits in terms of section
annual_reports/part-1_p.txt-205 of the Companies Act for atleast 3 out of the immediately preceding 5 years and a pre-

annual_reports/part-1_p.txt-or (ii) if their project was appraised by a bank or a financial institution which had financed
annual_reports/part-1_p.txt:atleast 10 per cent of the project cost. The rationale underlying the second norm was that an
annual_reports/part-1_p.txt-appraisal  of  the  project  by  a  bank/FIs  would  give  an  indication  of  its  soundness  to  the
annual_reports/part-1_p.txt-prospective  investors.  Further,  financing  the  project  to  the  extent  of  10  per  cent,  would

annual_reports/part-1_p.txt: The underlying rationale for this entry norm is that under the book-building procedure, the

all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-regulatory environment in which they operate has become more and more complex and 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-litigation  prone.  On  the  contrary,  the  tax  treatment  of  Foreign  Portfolio  investors,

all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-could result in India’s hedge  fund industry potentially growing at 20% per annum from its 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-current low base. Ultimately their assets under management could surpass $25 Billion or INR

all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt:24.  The  rationale  and  advantages  of  the  STT  regime  have  been  amplified  in  the  earlier 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-section. In order to simplify and bring ease of compliance and remove ambiguity in taxes, the 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-introduction  of  the  STT  regime  (on  entry  and  redemption  for  each  investor)  will  ensure 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-smooth payment and collection of taxes. This proposal will ensure stable cash flows for the 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-government and since they are source based, it represents a superior tax policy, which is a 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1516356419898.txt-win-win for the fund manager, the investors and the Government.

all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-Given that Crowdfunding is still in nascent stages and most of the jurisdictions around the world have 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-taken a guarded view by allowing it in a restricted manner, do you think India is ready for crowdfunding or 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-is it premature to introduce such risky investment channel ? 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-Are the Accredited Investors mentioned in paragraph 9.1.4 suitable to participate in the risky investments 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-of crowdfunding? Is there a need to expand or reduce the categories of investors or expand or reduce

all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-Is  the  limit  of  investors  upto  200  besides  QIBs  or  employees  of  the  company  under  a  scheme  of

all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-Given that the companies coming for crowdfunding lack any significant track record, are the conditions 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-and requirements mentioned in paragraph 9.2 enough to fend off fraudulent issuers? Specify changes, if

all_reports_for_public_comments/1403005615257.txt-Due to the lack of history and track record, it is important that the issuers provide future projections of

all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-8.  While  AIFs  have  provided  much  needed  long  term  and  stable  private  capital,  the  tax  and 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-regulatory  environment  in  which  they  operate  has  become  more  and  more  complex  and 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-litigation prone. On the contrary, the tax treatment of Foreign Portfolio investors, investing 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-in  listed  securities,  has  tended  towards  greater  certainty.    For  instance,  two  Government

all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt:24. The rationale and advantages of the STT regime have been amplified in the earlier section. 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-In  order  to  simplify  and  bring  ease  of  compliance  and  remove  ambiguity  in  taxes,  the 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-introduction of the STT regime (on entry and redemption for each investor) will ensure smooth 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-payment and collection of taxes. This proposal will ensure stable cash flows for the government 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-and since they are source based, it represents a superior tax policy, which is a win-win for the 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1480591844782.txt-fund manager, the investors and the Government.

all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-In an endeavor to provide a level playing field to the participants in the securities

all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-decided to bring about certain changes in the Guidelines that are felt necessary. The

all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-current  provisions  of  the  Guidelines  is  linked  to  the  crossing  of  the 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-continuous  listing  requirement.  This  gave  rise  to  a  situation  that  securities 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-were bound to get delisted if the public shareholding reduced from the levels 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-required to be maintained for the purpose of continuous listing.  
all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt-
all_reports_for_public_comments/1292328051155.txt:While  the  rationale  of  mandating  levels  for  continuous  listing  is  based  on

all_reports_for_public_comments/1593416996354.txt:The  rationale  for  an  SSE  is  multipronged.  Most  importantly,  the  public  provision  of  essential

all_reports_for_public_comments/1593416996354.txt-significant  role  in  closing  the gap.  The SSE is meant to serve these private  and non-profit sector 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1593416996354.txt-providers  by  channeling  greater  capital  to  them.  To  take just three examples  – education, health

all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-Suggestion: To reduce the notice period under Regulation 42 of LODR to 3 clear working 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-days (instead of 7 clear working days), and the requirement to determine issue price prior

all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt:Rationale:  Three  clear  working  days’  notice  would  actually  result  in  dissemination  of 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-information to shareholders and other investors at least 4 days before record date and at 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-least 3 days before share starts trading on an ex-rights basis. It, therefore, gives enough 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-time for shareholders and investors to trade in the shares.  Notice of 3 clear working days 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-would enable execution and settlement of any trades consequent to decision on terms of

all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt:Rationale:  A  public  advertisement  process  adds  time  and  cost  to  the  rights  issue

all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-communicate  with  their shareholders,  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Hence, the  requirement to 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-give  a  newspaper  advertisement  can  be  replaced  with  requirement  to  intimate  the

all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-entitlement of shareholder may be less than one share. In such cases, shareholder 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-receives CAF with zero entitlement but is eligible to apply in the current process. 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-In the proposed system also, similar process would be adopted.

all_reports_for_public_comments/1558440996303.txt-friendly  and  enables  faster  completion  of  the  post  issue  process.  As  a  result  of  these

all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt- 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-The corporate governance standards have continuously been strengthened and there

all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt:is recognised that related party transactions can per se have sound economic rationale 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-and can be value enhancing, there have been concerns about some such transactions 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-being questionable or against the interest of minority shareholders or even bordering

all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-Further, the Working Group  discussed whether certain significant shareholders in  a 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-listed entity who do not form part of the ‘promoter’ or ‘promoter group’ should also be 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-included  within  the  purview  of  ‘related  parties’.    The  Working  Group  noted  that  in 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-several  jurisdictions  such  as  the  United  Kingdom  (“U.K.”),  Italy  and  Korea, 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-shareholders with a holding above certain thresholds are deemed to be related parties 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt:of such company. In such jurisdictions, the rationale for such inclusion is that a person 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-with significant shareholding could influence the decisions of a company. The Working 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1580134104191.txt-Group deliberated that in the Indian context also, there may be a shareholder who is

all_reports_for_public_comments/1534161636024.txt-December 14, 2017. This Report sets out the recommendations of the Committee in respect of the 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1534161636024.txt-first  Term  of  Reference:  Review  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Settlement  of

all_reports_for_public_comments/1534161636024.txt-Board’s  Settlement  mechanism  as  well  as  the  enforcement  mechanism  as  a  whole.  The 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1534161636024.txt-Committee’s  approach  to  the  recommendations  has  been  driven  by  the  primary  objective  of 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1534161636024.txt-enhancing settlement as a tool of enforcement. In this regard, the Committee believes that there 
all_reports_for_public_comments/1534161636024.txt-are certain recommendations which may require implementation by authorities other than SEBI.

press_releases/d92db87d7d760855fd937e1ea5298ad1.txt-In order to facilitate development of a vibrant primary market for corporate bonds in India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has notified Regulations for Issue and Listing of Debt Securities to provide for simplified regulatory framework for issuance and listing of non-convertible debt securities (excluding bonds issued by Governments) issued by any company, public sector undertaking or statutory corporations.  The Regulations  will not apply to  issue and listing of, securitized debt instruments  and  security receipts for which separate regulatory regime is in place.
press_releases/d92db87d7d760855fd937e1ea5298ad1.txt:The Regulations provide for rationalized disclosure requirements for public issues and flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments and decide on the mode of offering, without diluting the areas of regulatory concern. In case of public issues, while the disclosures specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 1956 shall be made, the Regulations require additional disclosures about the issuer and the instrument such as nature of instruments, rating rationale, face value, issue size, etc.
press_releases/d92db87d7d760855fd937e1ea5298ad1.txt-While the requirement of filing of draft offer documents with SEBI for observations has been done away with, emphasis has been placed on due diligence, adequate disclosures, and credit rating as the cornerstones of transparency. Regulations prescribe certifications to be filed by merchant bankers in this regard. The Regulations emphasize on the role and obligations of the debenture trustees, execution of trust deed, creation of security and creation of debenture redemption reserve in terms of the Companies Act.
press_releases/d92db87d7d760855fd937e1ea5298ad1.txt-The Regulations enable electronic disclosures. The draft offer document needs to be filed with the designated stock exchange through a SEBI registered merchant banker who shall be responsible for due diligence exercise in the issue process and the draft offer document shall be  placed on the websites of the stock exchanges for a period of seven working days inviting comments. The documents shall be downloadable in PDF or HTML formats. The requirements for advertisements have also been simplified.
press_releases/d92db87d7d760855fd937e1ea5298ad1.txt-While listing of securities issued to the public is mandatory, the issuers may also list their debt securities issued on private placement basis subject to compliance of simplified regulatory requirements as provided in the Regulations. The Regulations provide an enabling framework for listing of debt securities issued on a private placement basis, even in cases where the equity of the issuer is not listed. NBFCs and PFIs are exempted from mandatory listing. However, they may list their privately placed debt securities subject to compliance with the simplified requirements and Listing Agreement. A rationalized listing agreement for debt securities is under preparation.
press_releases/d92db87d7d760855fd937e1ea5298ad1.txt-The full text of theSEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulationsis available on the website at:www.sebi.gov.in

press_releases/6ccc5d481589bc51d47cbb571f7f6c9a.txt-The major stock exchanges viz. BSE and NSE and the depositories viz. NSDL and CDSL are directed to ensure that all the above directions are strictly enforced.

press_releases/6ccc5d481589bc51d47cbb571f7f6c9a.txt-In the recent past, there was an unprecedented increase in price and trading interest in the share of Eltrol (which has recently changed its name to “Shree Mahaganga Sugar Mills Ltd.”), on BSE. During the period from March 1, 2005 to September 23, 2005, the price of the share of Eltrol (face value Re.1/-), duly adjusted for corporate actions, on BSE, opened at Rs.0.47 touched a high of Rs. 3.52 on September 1, 2005, a low of Rs. 0.43 on March 2, 2005 and closed at Rs.1.85 on September 29, 2005. Thus, during the 128 trading days from March 1, 2005 to September 1, 2005, the price of the share on BSE has shown a rise of 649%. Upon examination, SEBI found that there is no identifiable promoter of Eltrol. The directors of the company who claim to be professional directors do not appear to have any knowledge about the industry in which the company is purportedly operating. The directors of the company are engaged in courier business which has no apparent relation with engineering or sugar business that Eltrol is purportedly engaged in.

press_releases/6ccc5d481589bc51d47cbb571f7f6c9a.txt:The past financial performance of the company has been dismal and the company has accumulated losses. The company has not declared any dividend for the past many years. The company has discontinued production activities and is purportedly exploring entering into new business areas. The company has made preferential allotment to two NBFCs namely Oudh Finance & Investment Private Limited and Basmati Securities Pvt. Ltd. at a premium of Rs.6.50 per share (face value of Re.1/-). The source of funds of these NBFCs is not known and probably these NBFCs have taken Fixed Deposits from the public, the repayment of which could be imperiled by the unwise if not blatantly manipulative action of the promoters / management of these NBFCs. In any case, the rationale for the two NBFCs to invest in Eltrol shares at such a huge premium needs further probe. That apart, Eltrol has apparently diverted the money received through preferential allotment to stock brokers for indulging in stock market operations and has tried to hide this fact by claiming that the funds have been invested in the assets of the company. The issue of working capital funds belonging to corporates being diverted for stock market operations which activity is not in consonance with the regular business activities of corporates has been a major concern for SEBI in the recent past. The activities of Eltrol as detailed above confirm the concerns of SEBI in this regard.

press_releases/6ccc5d481589bc51d47cbb571f7f6c9a.txt-Besides the above, SEBI found that there were various other announcements by the company such as announcement of bonus issue, taking over of another company etc. probably made with a view to paint a rosy picture. During this period, various major trading clients at BSE were found to have made off-market transfers to certain common entities indicating that all these entities were connected with / related to each other. In view of the above, SEBI is initiating investigations into the matter and in the meanwhile, SEBI has, under Sections 11B, 11D and 11(4)(b) of SEBI Act, 1992, issued ex-parte ad interim directions with immediate effect as above.

press_releases/9d723fd7bc211ea5f75d85c1bdb17645.txt-As the commodities markets operate in a different eco-system, have legacy issues and need domain knowledge for efficient regulation, SEBI needs to conduct a thorough due diligence and gap analysis before articulating its vision for the commodity derivatives segment. SEBI should concentrate more on studying the risks and the structure of the market, including various aspects like contract design, warehouse receipts and quality control of underlying commodities in the initial period. The emphasis during this period should be on avoiding any crisis in the market. Market development may be visited only after fully understanding the strengths and weaknesses of commodities markets.

press_releases/2a7dc3a2b6af229b81c835e3985e460d.txt:A country witnesses currency exposure when locals hold a large amount of unhedged foreign currency denominated debt. However, India's capital controls continue to be guided by concerns about debt and its maturity, rather than its currency denomination. Even though there is foreign appetite for rupee denominated debt, India has placed many restrictions on foreign investment in rupee denominated bonds. These include caps on the total as well as limits by investor class, maturity and issuer and have been implemented through a complicated mechanism for allocation and reinvestment. This paper presents the logic and rationale for why these restrictions fail to meet the objectives of economic policy today. It recommends removal of quantitative restrictions on foreign holding of Indian rupee denominated debt and suggests ways to move to a more efficient framework.
