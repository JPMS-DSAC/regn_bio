Despite the statutory requirement, large number of Sub-brokers in the Securities Market are unregistered. The issue was discussed during annual meeting of the Stock Exchanges held in SEBI on March 19, 1997. It was decided in the meeting that transfer deed bearing rubber stamps on the reverse thereof other than those of clearing members of the stock exchanges/clearing house/clearing corporations, SEBI registered sub-brokers and remisiers registered with the stock exchanges shall be treated as bad delivery in stock exchanges. This shall apply to all transfer deeds dated June 1, 1997 and thereafter.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT   NO.SMD/OPG/AA/1020/96 March 14, 1996         The Executive Director/President All Stock Exchanges         Dear Sir,     SUB: REGISTRATION OF SUB-BROKER      As you are aware, sub-brokers are required to obtain certificate of registration from Securities and Exchange Board of India in accordance with regulations made under section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 without which they are not permitted to buy, sell or deal in securities. The applications from sub-brokers were invited in May, 1992 through recognised Stock Exchanges for registration with SEBI. A large number of applications were received and registration granted to approximately 1200 applicants fulfilling the requirements.     It is felt that a large number of sub-brokers still are not registered with SEBI and therefore carrying out their activities without any valid legal sanction. SEBI at its end has started returning all incomplete applications directly to the applicants. Those who were already in the business of sub-broking and had applied for registration before 21st May, 1992 are being advised to re-submit their applications complete in all respects within two months failing which it shall be construed that they are acting as sub-brokers without holding certificates of registration in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992. The applicants who had applied after 21st May, 1992, are being advised to stop the business of sub-broking immediately which can be re-started after they are duly registered with SEBI.      We have devised guidelines for making applications complete in all respects. A copy of the same is being enclosed for your perusal. Co-operation from the Stock Exchanges will help us immensely in registering and regulating this class of capital market intermediaries.     ... 2/-          -: 2 :-          We request you to keep sufficient stock of Form 'B' (application form for registration as sub-broker) and Form 'C'(recommendation letter to be given by the member with whom the sub-broker is affiliated), for free distribution amongst applicants. We are enclosing a copy of these forms. In September, 1993, we had sent a copy of model agreement advising you to circulate the same amongst your members. This agreement between broker and sub-broker specifies the scope of their rights and liabilities. A copy of the same is once again being enclosed with a request that sufficient number of copies may be kept available and supplied to desirous applicants.     We advise you to bring the contents of this letter to the notice of your members by suitable display on your notice board. Applicants who had applied earlier and not heard anything from SEBI may be advised in their own interest to make fresh application complete in all respects in accordance with attached guidelines. Doing business with unregistered sub-broker, in future, will be viewed seriously and penal action taken.     Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter.         Yours faithfully,     sd/-      O. P.

circulars/1300871294528.txt:    RMB (Compendium) Series Circular No. 1 (2001- 2002) July 17, 2001  To All Registered Category I Merchant Bankers Dear Sirs, Sub: Amendments to the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines,2000The Board in its meeting held on December 22, 2000 considered the recommendations of the Primary Market Advisory Committee in respect of the modifications/ amendments to the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000. The Board approved certain amendments to the said Guidelines. Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines. Therefore, pre- issue share capital of an unlisted company held by Venture Capital Funds and Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board shall not be subject to lock in as per the Guidelines. However, the provisions of the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 and the SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors), Regulations 2000 and any amendment thereto, in this regard, shall be applicable. Section C : This section lays down the revised requirements for filing the post issue monitoring reports with the Board for both book built portion and fixed price portion. Section D : Clause (b) to sub-rule (2) of Rule 19 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 has been amended vide Government notification no. G.S.R. 415(E) dated June 7, 2001, providing for public offer of atleast 10% instead of 25% subject to certain conditions. Hence clause 8.3.4 granting sector wise exemption stands deleted. Further, unlisted companies which have allotted shares to holders of securities in a listed company pursuant to a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation sanctioned by the appropriate High Court, have been approaching the Board for seeking exemption from making a public offer for listing their shares. Exemptions, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions are already being granted by way of communication to the Stock Exchanges. For the sake of greater transparency, the requirements in this regard are stated in this section. Section E The requirements related to issue of research reports by an issuer company in respect of public issues and rights issues have been laid down. Section F : The restriction of a minimum public issue size of Rs 25 crore in case of an Initial Public Offer through the book building route has been removed. It is again clarified that in terms of clause 11.3.5 (iv) of the Guidelines, for the under-subscribed portion of the fixed price portion in a book building issue, the issuer company has the option to allocate it to any category as it deems fit. Alternately, the issuer company has the option to let the under-subscribed portion lapse.

Please note that the Supreme Court has until further orders stayed temporarily the trading in the shares of the respondent company in all stock exchanges. Yours faithfully, sd/-    S.T. GERELA DIVISION CHIEF Encl : as above   S.C. 608 JUDGEMENTS TODAY 1995 (7) JT 1995(7) S.C. 602 M/s Rishyashiringa Jewellery Ltd., & Anr. Vs The Stock Exchange, Bombay & Ors. Civil Appeal No.9723 of 1995 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 8420 of 1995) J.S. VERMA & K. VENKATASWAMI JJ. Dt. 31.10.1995 CORPORATE LAW  Companies Act, 1956: Section 73(1a) - Enlistment of shares in the recognised Stock Exchanges - Meaning of the word ‘each’ in the expression "If the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange" used in sub-section (1A) of Section 73 - Whether the entire allotment of shares is rendered void by virtue of Section 73(1A) because of the objection of the application by one of the several Stock Exchanges mentioned in the prospectus - Held yes - Appeal dismissed.  HELD … Sub-section (1A) of Section 73 requires that where a prospectus stated that an application under sub-section (1) has been made for permission for the shares or debentures offered thereby to be dealt in one or more recognised stock exchanges, such prospectus shall state the name of the stock exchange, or as the case may be, each such stock exchange’. In other words, if the application is made only to one stock exchange than the name of that stock exchange is to be mentioned and where the prospectus states that application has been made to more than one recognised stock exchanges then it shall state the name of each such stock exchange, i.e., every such stock exchange or in other words, all the stock exchanges to which the application has been made. The second part of sub-section (1A) of Section 73 then provides the consequence of refusal of the permission by saying that any allotment made on an application in pursuance of such prospectus shall be void "If the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange", as the case may be, before the expiry of ten weeks from the date of the closing of the subscription list. This means that any allotment made shall be void if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange where the application is made only to one stock exchange or each such stock exchange "where the application is made to more than one stock exchange". The expression "each such stock exchange" here must mean the same as in the earlier part of sub-section )1A) of Section 73, i.e., each and every or in other words, all such stock exchanges. Thus where the prospectus held out that enlistment of shares would be in more than one stock exchange the consequence envisaged in sub-section (1A) of Section 73 ensues to render void the entire allotment of shares unless the permission is granted by each and everyone or all of the stock exchanges named in the prospectus for enlisting the shares. This is the plain meaning of sub-section (1A) of Section 73. In short, unless permission is granted by each or everyone of all the stock exchanges named in the prospectus for listing of shares to which application is made by the company, the consequence is to render the entire allotment void. In other words, if the permission has not been granted by any one of the several stock exchanges named in the prospectus for listing of shares the consequence by virtue of sub-section (1A) of Section 73 is to render the entire allotment void and the grant of permission by one of them is inconsequential. This construction also promotes the object of insertion of sub-section (1A) in Section 73 by amendment of the law made to overcome the effect of the decision of this Court in Allied International Products Ltd. [Para 14]   WORDS AND PHRASES ‘Every’ the true meaning of ‘every’ is each one of all".  Case Referred: Union of India V. Allied International products Ltd. & Anr., 1970 (3) SCC 594 [Para 6] Books and Articles Referred: Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases. [para]  J.S. VERMA, J.: 1. Leave granted. 2. The short but ticklish question which arises for decision in the present case is the meaning of the word ‘each’ in the expression "if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange" used in sub-section (1A) of Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. This is the real question for decision in the present appeal. 3. Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 in so far as it is material is as under: 73(I) Every company intending to offer shares or debentures to the public for subscription by the issue of a prospectus shall, before such issue, make an application to one or more recognised stock exchanges for permission for the shares or debentures intending to be so offered to be dealt with in the stock exchange or each such stock exchange. (1A) Where a prospectus, whether issued generally or not, states that an application under sub-section (1) has been made for permission for the shares or debentures offered thereby to be dealt, in one or more recognised stock exchanges, such prospectus shall state the name of the stock exchange or, as the case may be, each such stock exchange, and any allotment made on an application in pursuance of such prospectus shall, whenever made, be void, if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange, as the case may be, before the expiry of ten weeks from the date of the closing of the subscription lists:Provided that where an appeal against the decision of any recognised stock exchange refusing permission for the shares or debentures to be dealt in on that stock exchange has been preferred under section 22 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), such allotment shall not be void until the dismissal of the appeal." (emphasis supplied) 4. The material facts which give rise to the above question are only a few. On 31.5.1994 the appellant company issued a prospectus offering to the public for subscription 27,40,000 equity shares of Rs.10/- each in terms of the prospectus, intimating that "applications have been made to the Stock Exchanges at Coimbatore, Bombay and Madras for permission to deal in and for an official quotation in respect of the Equity Shares of the Company now being offered in terms of this prospectus." The date of closing the subscription mentioned in the prospectus was 19.7.1994. The period of ten weeks from the date of closing of the subscription list prescribed in Section 73(1A) for grant of permission by the Stock Exchange expired on 27.9.1994. The allotment of shares was finalized on 16.9.1994. Permission was granted by the Madras Stock Exchange on 28.10.1994 . However, in spite of reminders issued on 18.8.1994 and 12.9.1994 by the Bombay Stock Exchange to the company to complete the required formalities, the necessary compliance was not made by the company which resulted in rejection of the company’s application by the Bombay Stock Exchange on 28.9.1994. The city-wise break up of allotment of the shares shows that the number of shares allotted were 17,44,600 in Bombay; 2,45,400 in Coimbatore and 2,89,900 in Madras. 5. In this context,. The effect of rejection of the application by the Bombay Stock Exchange on the allotment of shares arises for consideration under sub-section (1A) of Section 73. The question is: Whether the entire allotment of shares is rendered void by virtue of Section 73 (1A) because of the rejection of the application by the Bombay Stock Exchange to render ineffective even the grant of permission by the Coimbatore Stock Exchange within the specified period? 6. In substance the contention of Shri F.S. Nariman is, that the consequence of rendering void the allotment made under Section 73 (1A) envisaged by the provision cannot render ineffective the permission granted by the Coimbatore Stock Exchange within the prescribed period. The reply of Shri Harish Salve is that the consequence of rendering the entire allotment void is clearly envisaged where rejection of the application for permission is by any such stock exchange to which application has been made. Shri Salve referred to the legislative history which led to the insertion of sub-section (1A) to overcome the consequence of the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Allied International Products Ltd. & Anr. 1970 (3) SCC 594, by the amendment of law in this manner. It is, therefore, necessary at this stage to refer to the decision of this Court in Allied International Products’s case (supra).  7. In Allied International Product’s case (supra) a similar question arose for decision prior to insertion of sub-section (1A) in Section 73 when applications were made for permission to several stock exchanges but only one out of them granted the permission to enter the company’s share. That question arose in the context of Section 73(1), as it then stood, which was as under: "(1) Where a prospectus, whether issued generally or not, states that application has been made or will be made for permission for the share or debentures offered thereby to be dealt in on a recognised stock exchanges, any allotment made on "an application in pursuance of the prospectus shall, pursuance of the prospectus shall, whenever made, be void, if the permission has not been applied for before the tenth day after the first issue of the prospectus, or, if the permission has not been granted before the expiry of four weeks from the date of the closing of the subscription lists or such longer period not exceeding seven weeks as may, within the said four weeks, be notified to the applicant for permission by or on behalf of the stock exchange".8. It was held by this Court as follows: "…. If application are made to several Exchanges, some within the period of ten days after the first issue of the prospectus, and some beyond, or that one or more applications but not all, is or are defective, and the error is not rectified, it would be unreasonable to hold that because some of the applications made beyond the tenth day after the first issue of the prospectus, or are defective, are liable to be rejected, the applications properly made before some of the Exchanges are also ineffective and the allotment made may be invalid."(at page 601) 9. This is precisely the effect of the argument of Shri Nariman even after the change has been made by insertion of sub-section (1A). It has, therefore, to be seen whether inspite of this change in the law subsequent to the decision of this Court in Allied International Products’s case (supra) the position in law remains unaltered. 10. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for making the amendment in the Companies Act clearly states as under: "6. Under the present Bill some other practices prevalent in the corporate sector, in so far as they may prove injurious or undesirable, are also sought to be checked. The provisions contained in the Bill designed for this purpose deal with the following:- Failure to enlist shares with all the Stock Exchanges mentioned in a prospectus. In legislating on this point, it is proposed to make an incidental amendment to Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.11. In the notes on clauses the portion relevant for this amendment is as under: "Clause 7:- Sub-clauses (I) and (iii) Section 73 prescribes certain time limit for enlistment with the stock exchanges. It also contemplates that enlistment has to be done in all the stock exchanges mentioned in the prospectus and in case of failure to do so, the money received in respect of allotment of shares on the basis of the prospectus should be refunded within a specified time. In the recent judgment in Union of India Vs. Allied International Products Ltd., the Supreme Court has held that if the stock exchange had intimated that it would give further consideration to an application, the time limit contemplated by the by the section will not operate. It has also held that if any one of the stock exchanges mentioned in the prospectus approved the application for enlistment, it would mean sufficient compliance with the provisions of section 73 and allotment made in pursuance of that prospectus would be valid. It has been felt that the decision of the Supreme Court referred to above is likely to lead to complications in as much as the investing public as well as under-writing institutions are likely to lose the protection hitherto enjoyed by them. Hence section 73 is being amended suitably."(emphasis supplied) 12. It is, therefore, clear that the effect of the decision of this Court in Allied International Products Ltd., in this behalf was sought to be overcome by making a suitable amendment in Section 73 since it was visualized that the said decision is likely to lead to complications in as much as the investing public as well as underwriting institutions were likely to lose the intended protection enjoyed by them. In other words the effect of the decision in Allied International Products Ltd. that even if any of the stock exchanges mentioned in the prospectus approved the application for enlistment it would mean sufficient compliance with the provisions of Section 73 and the allotment made in pursuance of that prospectus would be valid was sought to be overcome by amending Section 73 to provide that enlistment has to be done in all the stock exchanges mentioned in the prospectus and in the case of failure to do so the money received in respect of allotment of shares on the basis of the prospectus should be refunded within a specified time. Thus the consequence of rendering the entire allotment of shares void was required to ensure if the enlistment contemplated in all the stock exchanges mentioned in the prospectus does not materialize. There can be no doubt that the clear object of insertion of sub-section (1A) in Section 73 was to overcome the decision in Allied International Products Ltd. by amending the law in this manner. The question is whether this object has been achieved by the language used in sub-section (1A) of Section 73. 13. The meaning and true purport of the word ‘each’ in the relevant expression in Section 73 (1A) is to be determined for this purpose. In Collins Dictionary of the English Language, the meaning of ‘each’ is given as "every" (one) of two or more considered individually", and ‘every’ means "each one (of the class specified), without exception". In Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases the true meaning of ‘every’ is "each one of all".  14. The meaning of the word ‘each’ in the expression " if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange" in sub-section (1A) of Section 73 is now to be determined. Sub-section (1A) of Section 73 requires that where a prospectus states that an application under sub-section (1) has been made for permission for the shares or debentures offered thereby to be dealt in one or more recognised stock exchanges, ‘such prospectus shall state the name of the stock exchange or, as the case may be, each such stock exchange’. In other words, if the application is made only to one stock exchange then the name of that stock exchange is to be mentioned and where the prospectus states that application has been made to more than one recognised stock exchanges then it shall state the name of each such stock exchange, i.e., every such stock exchange or in other words, all the stock exchanges to which the application has been made. The second part of sub-section (1A) of Section 73 then provides the consequence of refusal of the permission by saying that any allotment made on an application in pursuance of such prospectus shall be void "if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange", as the case may be, before the expiry of ten weeks from the date of the closing of the subscription list. This means that any allotment made shall be void if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange where the application is made only to one stock exchange or each such stock exchange where the application is made to more than one stock exchange". The expression "each such stock exchange" here must mean the same as in the earlier part of sub-section (1A) of Section 73, i.e., each every or in other words, all such stock exchanges. Thus, where the prospectus held out that enlistment of shares would be in more than one stock exchange the consequence envisaged in sub-section (1A) of Section 73 ensues to render void the entire allotment of shares unless the permission is granted by each and everyone or all of the stock exchanges named in the prospectus for enlisting the shares. This is the plain meaning of sub-section (1A) of Section 73. In short, unless permission is granted by each or everyone of all the stock exchanges named in the prospectus for listing of shares to which application is made by the company, the consequence is to render the entire allotment void. In other words, if the permission has not been granted by any one of the several stock exchanges named in the prospectus for listing of shares the consequence by virtue of sub-section (1A) of Section 73 is to render the entire allotment void and the grant of permission by one of them is inconsequential. This construction also promotes the object of insertion of subsection (1A) in Section 73 by amendment of law made to overcome the effect of the decision of this Court in Allied International Products Ltd., The contention of Shri Nariman, learned counsel for the appellant is, therefore, untenable.   15. Consequently, the appeal fails and is dismissed. No costs.   **********

circulars/39723295e419fc20963782434d20614f.txt:As you know, we have been issuing standard observations (generally as Annexure II) at the time of communicating scheme specific observations to mutual funds in accordance with Regulation 29(2) to ensure a minimum level of disclosures in the offer documents. Due to amendments to regulations and with a view to improve the disclosure standards, these observations are revised from time to time. Therefore, it is essential that the mutual funds are aware of these latest observations while revising their existing scheme offer documents and memoranda i.e. abridged offer documents. A copy of these observations is enclosed.
circulars/39723295e419fc20963782434d20614f.txt-We have also put these observations on SEBI website, www.sebi.gov.in so that you may refer to them while revising any scheme offer document in the future. We may revise these observations from time to time and in that case the date of revision will also be mentioned. A copy of the revised offer document and memorandum along with a fresh due diligence certificate in accordance with requirements of standard offer document must be filed with SEBI for the purpose of records only. The same due diligence certificate shall be reproduced in the offer document by the mutual funds. Other requirements as specified in our aforesaid circular letter dated February 9, 2001 shall also be complied with.

circulars/1300866021976.txt:  SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-46/2001September 27, 2001The Executive Directors/Managing Directors of all the Stock Exchanges Dear Sir, Sub : Delay in transfer of shares by companies In the meeting of stock exchanges held on August 14, 2001, the matter relating to 'Delay in transfer of shares by the Companies' was deliberated and the following decisions were taken for speedy redressal of grievances pertaining to a) Pending transfer of Shares, b) Dealing with objection memos in future and c) Duplicate share certificates. A) Pending Transfer of Share i.In case the transfer deed and the share certificates are with the company awaiting transfer beyond 30 days and in cases where the same are returned by the company to the investor with a company objection including due to signature difference (other than court cases where injunction has been ordered), companies shall effect the transfer of shares on obtaining from the transferee the proof of purchases duly acknowledged by the stock exchange/broker. If so desired, a company may also obtain indemnity bond from the transferee. Before effecting transfer, the company shall within 10 days of the date of such direction, send letters under registered post AD/Speed Post AD to the transferor(s) asking for their confirmations/no-objection, so as reach the company within 15 days from the date of receipt of the letter by the transferor. If the confirmation is received /no-objection is not received within 15 days from the transferor(s), the transfer would be effected immediately thereafter. The valid objection, if any should be accompanied by correspondingly old prohibitory order from a competent authority. Immediately after effecting the transfer of shares, the benefits (i.e. Bonus, rights, dividend) held back by the company shall be handed over to the transferee. If such benefits have been passed on to the transferor, the concerned stock exchange shall arbitrate through the brokers of the transferor and the transferee to determine the rightful claimant. Keeping in view the provisions of Section 206 A of the Companies Act and Section 27 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, in such cases, the Stock Exchanges should entertain claims for resolving through arbitration even if they are beyond the stipulated time of 4 months. ii.In respect of complaints (other than court cases where injunction has been ordered) where the original transfer deeds have been lost in the process of rectification on account of company objection, companies shall transfer the shares as per the first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 108 of the Companies Act on obtaining from the transferee the proof of purchases duly acknowledged by the stock exchange/broker on an indemnity bond from the transferee. Before effecting transfer, the company shall within 10 days of the date of such direction, send letters under registered post AD /Speed post AD to the transferor(s) asking for their confirmations/no -objection, so as reach the company within 15 days from the date of receipt of the letter by the transferor. If the confirmation is received/no objection is not received within 15 days, the transfer would be effected immediately thereafter. The valid objection, if any, by the transferor shall be accompanied by correspondingly old prohibitory order from a competent authority. Immediately after effecting the transfer of shares, the benefits (i.e. Bonus, rights, dividend) held back by the company shall be handed over to the transferee. If such benefits have been passed on to the transferor, the concerned stock exchange shall arbitrate through the brokers of the transferor and the transferee to determine the rightful claimant. Keeping in view the provisions of the Section 206 A of the Companies Act and Section 27 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, in such cases, the Stock Exchanges should entertain claims, even if they are beyond the stipulated time. iii.In respect of companies where shares and transfer deeds are lying with the investor or introducing broker-member(IM), and IM has already paid/replaced shares to buyer/broker due to bad delivery on account of objection memo raised by the company, but there was a delay on the part of the company in raising objection beyond the stipulated time period of 1 month, shares shall be tranferred by the company to the investor/IM, as applicable, provided no objection certificate of the buyer/buying broker is provided. B.Procedure for dealing with Company objections in future i.In respect of complaints where shares and transfer deeds are lying with the investor of introducing the broker-member (IM) and IM has already paid/replaced shares to buyer /broker due to bad delivery on account of objection memo raised by the company, but there was a delay on the part of the company in raising objection beyond the stipulated time period of 1 month. In such cases the company would be liable to compensate the aggrieved party for the opportunity losses during the intervening period. ii.In cases of company objection due to signature difference (Other than court cases where injunction is ordered), companies shall effect the transfer of shares by following the procedure mentioned below. Before effecting transfer, the company shall within 10 days of receipt of shares from the transferee, send letters under registered post AD/ Speed Post AD to the transferor(s) asking for their confirmations/no-objection, so as to reach the company within 15 days from the date of receipt of the letter by the transferor. If the confirmation is received/no objection is not received within 15 days, the transfer would be effected immediately thereafter. The valid objection, if any, should be followed/accompanied by a prohibitory order from a competent authority and should reach the company within 30 days thereafter, failing which the transfer would be effected. Immediately, after effecting the transfer of shares, the benefits (i.e. Bonus, rights, dividend) held back by the company shall be handed over to the transferee. If such benefits have been passed on to the transferor, the concerned stock exchange shall arbitrate through the brokers of the transferor and the transferee to determine the rightful claimant. Keeping in view the provisions of Section 206 A of the Companies Act and Section 27 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, In such cases, the Stock Exchanges are hereby advised to entertain claims even if they are beyond the stipulated time. iii.In cases where transfer deed and the share certificates are with the company and the company has not effected transfer of shares, within the stipulated time period of one month, without communicating the investor any valid objection. In such cases the company would be liable to compensate the opportunity losses occurred to the investor(buyer). In addition, the company shall transfer the shares immediately and keeping in view the provisions of Section 206A of the Companies Act and Section 27 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, provide all benefits (i.e. bonus shares, dividend) which accrued to the investor during the intervening period on account of such delay. iv.Once a share certificate is returned by a transfer agent as a "company Objection" keeping in view the provisions of Section 206 A of the Companies Act and Section 27 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, all benefits must be held in abeyance by the company till such time the transfer actually takes place or a valid no objection is received from the Transferee on his receiving replacement. v.Every time an introducing broker replaces a bad delivery share or pays for the share to the receiving broker/buyer investor as per market norms, a No Objection Certificate to transfer the shares in the name of introducing member from the receiving broker/buyer investor shall be given to the introducing member broker/seller investor, as applicable, through the Bad Delivery Cell mechanism. C.Duplicate Share Certificate Where the investor has complained about issuing of duplicate share certificate(s) by the company on the basis of allegedly forged/stolen documents furnished by a third party, the company shall verify and satisfy itself of the claim of the investor, within 15 days of receipt of the claim and take steps including invoking of indemnity bond to issue shares and corresponding benefits to the rightful owner ÿ in terms of section 84 of the Companies Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Issue of Share Certificates) Rules, 1960.The above decisions would be applicable in respect of all companies/organisations (i.e. entities) whose shares are listed on any of the Stock Exchanges and are in physical form. You are requested to take effective steps to implement the above decisions. Further, a separate circular is being issued for amendment of listing agreement with respect to item no. B(i) and B(iii).

circulars/1300791340291.txt:    DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT E-mail : mdrao@sebi.gov.in SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-52/2001December 20, 2001The Executive Directors/Managing Directors of all the Stock Exchanges Dear Sir, Sub: Committee on Model Rule and Bye-laws of Stock Exchanges. The Committee constituted by SEBI for examining the existing Articles and Memorandum of Association, Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of Stock Exchanges and framing a uniform set of Rules and Bye-laws to be followed by all the stock exchanges of the country has submitted its report and the Model Rules for Stock Exchanges.  Some of the Model Rules have already been implemented by the Stock Exchanges through SEBI Circulars and directives. For some rules suitable provisions already exist in SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 1957 or in the GOI directives/Circulars and SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 etc. Some of the Model Rules are new amongst which some are related to corporatisation of Stock Exchanges and can be implemented only after all exchanges are corporatised. Some of the Rules may not be applicable in the same way for all stock exchanges. Besides, on account of the nature and constitution of stock exchanges, some of the new Model Rules can not be implemented as suggested. The Model Rules have been divided into 4 Parts. Part 'A' given in the Annexure contains rules which have already been implemented under SEBI directives etc. Reference of Model Rules, Subject matter and the  corresponding Circulars issued by SEBI/GOI etc. have been made. It may be seen that while there may be a variation in language in the Model Rules, for most of Rules in Part A, however the basic principle underlying the Model Rules and the relevant SEBI Circular/GOI notification etc. is the same. Such rules have been identified with asterisks in Part A. In respect of Rules No. 5.5 (Compliance Officer), 6.8.1 (Special Authorisation by the Governing Board- Buy back of Membership), 7.20 (Declaration of Defaulter automatically), 7.34 (Apportionment of Consideration Realised/Other Realisation of Receivables) and 8.3.6 (Ethics Committee), SEBI Regulations/Circulars already issued in this regard will prevail. Part 'B' gives reference to the rules in Model Rules and the subject matter, which are to be introduced by the stock exchanges.  Part 'C' gives reference to Model Rules. However introduction of these will have to await corporatisation/demutualisation of the stock exchanges.  Part 'D' gives reference to the Model Rules, which are related to the basic legal structure of the various stock exchanges and may require an amendment to the existing SEBI Act, 1992, SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 1957 and other relevant Rules, Regulations and laws etc. In order to bring about uniformity among stock exchanges and taking into account uniformity already brought about by SEBI through the directives/circulars so far issued to the stock exchanges, you are advised to implement the Rules under Part 'B'. In the case of Rules in Part 'A', the proposed rules may be adopted in case there is a material difference between these rules and the existing similar rules of the exchange. The Model Rules along with the Committee Report are enclosed for adoption after necessary approvals from the General Body/Governing Board of the Exchanges. However if there are any difficulties in implementation of these Rules, such difficulties may be brought to the notice of SEBI. A compliance report in this regard may be submitted to SEBI within 2 months. The Exchanges will be suitably advised for introduction of Rules under Part 'C' and 'D' Yours faithfully,     S.V.

The membership criteria and responsibilities would be significantly different between the various types of members. The provisions of the relevant legislations/regulations may be reviewed and appropriate amendments made thereto, if necessary, for the purpose. As it is necessary to avoid multiplicity of regulators for entities taking limited purpose membership for trading on their own behalf in the proposed trading and clearing platforms, the responsibility of regulating their activity in corporate bonds through trading platforms will vest with SEBI while the primary regulation of these institutions will continue to vest with their respective primary regulators.

annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt:The SEBI(Depositories and Participants)(Amendment) Regulations, 1997 In  February  1997, the SEBI (Depositories and Participants)  Regulations, 1997 were amended to restrict foreign ownership  of  a depository, whether as sponsors or participants to 20%  of  its  equity. The regulations were also amended to permit  non-banking  finance companies with a minimum net  worth  of  Rs.  50 crore in addition to the net worth specified by  any  other  authority to act as participants in a  depository  on  behalf of other beneficial owners. 
annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt-The National Securities Depository Limited Following  the  notification of the SEBI  (Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations, 1996, NSDL, a company  sponsored  by  the  IDBI, the UTI and the NSE was granted a certificate  of  registration as a depository on June 7, 1996.  NSDL  was  granted  a  certificate  of  commencement  of  business   on  October    31,   1996.   NSDL   began   the    process    of  dematerialisation of securities with three participants  and  three securities eligible for dematerialisation. As of March 31, 1997, 28 participants had been registered by  SEBI  as  participants in NSDL. Of these  10 were  banks,  2  were  financial institutions, 3 non bank custodians, 11 were  stock  brokers  and 2 other non bank finance companies.  All  the  major  custodians of securities who act  on  behalf  of  FIIs,  mutual  funds and financial institutions  had  become  participants in NSDL. For a security to be declared eligible  for dematerialisation in NSDL, the issuer (and his registrar  and  transfer  agent in case there is one) has  to  sign  an  agreement   with  NSDL.  This  agreement   lays   down   the  obligations and responsibilities of the issuer and NSDL with  respect  to  each other, in addition to those prescribed  in  the  Depositories  Act  and  the SEBI  regulations.  As  the  Depositories Act permits investors to hold securities  which  are  eligible  for  dematerialisation  in  a  depository  in  physical  form outside the depository, it is important  that  the issuer or the issuer's registrar and transfer agent have  been  required  to reconcile the holdings of a  security  in  physical  form with those held in dematerialised form  on  a  daily basis. As  of  March  31, 1997, issuers had signed agreements  with  NSDL  in respect of 43 securities. The market capitalisation  of  securities for which issuers had established  electronic  connectivity  with NSDL at the end of 1996-97 stood  at  Rs.  44,973  crore.  As of March 31, 1997, the  market  value  of  dematerialised securities stood at Rs. 502 crore. These were  held on behalf of 1,957 beneficial owners. At  present, only the capital market segment of the NSE  and  the   National   Securities  Clearing  Corporation   Limited  (NSCCL),   which  acts  as  the  clearing  corporation   for  securities traded on the capital market segment of  the  NSE  are  integrated with the depository. Only trades  which  are  executed on the dematerialised securities trading segment on  the NSE can be cleared by NSCCL for settlement by electronic  book  entry within NSDL. The Depositories Act, 1996  amended  the  Indian Stamp Act, 1899, to exempt transfers  of  equity  shares  through electronic book entry from payment of  stamp  duty. 
annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt-Custodians of securities The  SEBI (Custodians of Securities) Regulations, 1996  were  notified  in May 1996. The regulations prescribe eligibility  criteria  and  a  code  of conduct to  be  followed  by  the  custodians  for  the  first  time.  Custodians,  as  service  providers to institutional investors are an integral part of  the  securities  markets,  and it is  important  that  their  interactions  and interfaces with stock exchanges,  clearing  corporations, clearing houses, stock brokers, registrars and  investing institutions be streamlined and uniform. With this  in  view,  SEBI  prescribed uniform norms and practices  for  custodians  of securities in October 1996 after  discussions  with   custodians,   stock  exchanges   and   other   market  participants.    The   SEBI   (Custodian   of    Securities)  Regulations, 1996 were amended giving power to SEBI to  give  existing  custodians  time  upto  5  years  to  raise  their  networth to Rs.50 crore. 
annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt:The SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 India has a vast pool of entrepreneurial talent, which needs to be channelled and nurtured. Venture capital funds have an important role to play in providing entrepreneurs with risk capital, and in many cases, management expertise and mentoring from venture capitalists. SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996, have been crafted with the objective of helping venture capital funds to foster entrepreneurship in India. The regulations were notified in December 1996. At the end of March 1997, 13 venture capital funds had applied for registration with SEBI. In terms of these regulations, venture capital funds may be set up as companies or trusts. A considerable deterrent to the use of the trust structure for venture capital funds was the inability of trusts to vote. This has been removed with the amendment to the Companies Act, 1956, which permits venture capital funds set up as trusts to vote their shares. The regulations permits venture capital funds to raise funds only from institutional and high networth individuals, and to ensure this, the minimum amount that may be raised from any one investor has been kept at Rs. 5 lakh. The regulations aim to provide a lot of flexibility to venture capital funds to facilitate the growth of this segment of the market. The only investment restrictions that have been prescribed is that at least 80% of the funds raised by a venture capital fund.

The stress test, which will be conducted every day, will determine the Minimum Required Corpus (MRC) of Core SGF. This will be a dynamic process which will form the basis for replenishing the Core SGF every month.

press_releases/a24e25a1f75e3a29cb04cf59e366712b.txt:                                                                                SEBI Board MeetingThe SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions:1.  Instant Access Facility (IAF) in Mutual Funds and use of e-wallet for investment in Mutual FundsWith an objective to channelize households’ savings into capital market and to promote digitalization in mutual funds, SEBI Board after deliberation has decided the following:a) Mutual Funds / Asset Management Companies (AMCs) can offer instant access facility (through online mode) of upto INR 50,000 or 90% of folio value, whichever is lower, to resident individual investors in liquid schemes by applying lower of Previous Day NAV or Prospective NAV. For providing such facility AMCs would not be allowed to borrow. Liquidity is to be provided out of the available funds from the scheme and AMCs to put in place a mechanism to meet the liquidity demands. This facility can also be used for investment in mutual funds through tie-ups with Payments Banks provided necessary approvals are taken from RBI. Presently, any scheme providing this facility would reduce the limit to INR 50,000, immediately and other than liquid schemes providing this facility would completely stop this facility within one month from the date of circular.b) Investment of upto INR 50,000 per Mutual Fund per financial year can be made using e-wallets. However, redemptions of such investments can be made only to a bank account of the unit holder. E-wallet issuers must not offer any incentive such as cash back etc., directly or indirectly for investing in mutual fund scheme through them. E-wallet’s balance loaded through cash or debit card or net banking, can only be used for subscription to mutual funds schemes and balance loaded through credit card, cash back, promotional scheme etc. should not be allowed for subscription to MF schemes. Further, this limit of INR 50,000 would be an umbrella limit for investment by an investor through e-wallet and/or cash, per mutual fund per financial year.2. Amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012While presenting the Union Budget for the FY 2016-2017, the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister,  made an announcement for permitting new derivative products in the commodity derivatives market. In pursuance thereof, SEBI vide circular dated September 28, 2016, permitted launch of 'options' in commodity derivatives market. In this regard, to enable the Commodity Derivatives Exchanges to organize trading of ‘options', the Board, after undertaking due public consultation process, has approved a proposal to amend the relevant provisions of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012. Detailed guidelines for trading in 'option' on commodity derivatives exchanges will be issued by SEBI.3. Inclusion of RBI registered systemically important NBFCs in the category of QIBsPresently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI. They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for the FY 2017-18, proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs since it would strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for inclusion of systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI having a net worth of more than Rs. 500 crore in the category of QIBs. As NBFCs are well regulated entities, classifying such NBFCs under the definition of QIBs will give Issuers access to a larger pool of funds.4. Exemption under SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009, relating to preferential allotments, to be extended to Scheduled Banks and Financial InstitutionsPresently, SEBI (ICDR) Regulations prohibit the issuer from making preferential issue to any person who has sold any equity shares of the issuer during the six months preceding the relevant date. It also provides that the entire pre-preferential allotment shareholding of the allottees, if any, shall be locked-in from the relevant date upto a period of six months from the date of trading approval. Mutual Funds and Insurance Companies are, however, exempted from both the said requirements.Recently, many instances have been there where it has been observed that the Banking sector is exposed to the risk of significantly high Non-Performing Assets (NPA) and the Banks have been advised by the Reserve Bank of India to reduce the NPA and to initiate stringent actions to recover the dues from the borrowers. As a result, it is expected that many Banks will go aggressively for recovering their dues and in order to achieve this objective, the Banks may opt for CDR / SDR or bilateral restructuring. In order to carry out actions for recovery from a borrower which may be a listed Company, Banks or Financial Institutions have sold equity shares of the issuer during the preceding six months of the relevant date. Such Banks/Financial Institutions may also be one of the allottees of the specified securities of the company pursuant to CDR approved scheme under preferential issue route. The Board considered and approved the proposal for extending such relaxation to the Scheduled Banks and Public Financial Institutions as is already being extended to Mutual Funds and Insurance Companies.  5.  Strengthening the Monitoring of Utilisation of Issue ProceedsPresently, the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009, require mandatory appointment of ‘Monitoring Agency’ if the issue size of specified securities exceeds Rs. 500 Cr. The purpose for the same is to ensure adequate supervision of the utilization of the funds raised. SEBI Board considered and approved certain proposals to further strengthen the monitoring of issue proceeds raised in IPOs/FPOs/Rights Issues. Key proposals approved by Board are as under:• Mandatory appointment of Monitoring Agency where the issue size (excluding offer for sale component) is more than Rs. 100 crore. • Frequency of submission of Monitoring Agency Report has been enhanced from half-yearly to quarterly.• Introduction of maximum timeline of 45 days for submission of Monitoring Agency Report from the end of the quarter in conjunction with the submission of the quarterly results.• Mandating the disclosure of the Monitoring Agency Report on Company’s website in addition to submitting it to Stock Exchange(s) for wider dissemination.• Introduction of new requirement, i.e., comments of Board of Directors and Management on the findings of Monitoring Agency.6.  Framework for consolidation and re-issuance of debt securities issued under the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 The Board considered and approved the following proposals contained in the agenda for laying down a framework for consolidation and re-issuance of debt securities, one of the ways to increase liquidity in the secondary market.a) Maximum of 12 ISINs maturing per financial year may be allowed for debt securities and within the bucket of these 12 ISINs, the issuer can issue both secured and unsecured Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs)/bonds and no separate category of ISINs may be provided to them. Additionally, the issuer may issue five ISINs per financial year for structured debt instruments of a particular category (say bonds with call option or bonds with both call and put option);b) The above restrictions will not be applicable on debt instruments which are used for raising regulatory capital such as Tier I, Tier II bonds, bonds for affordable housing and the capital gains tax bonds issued under section 54EC of the Income Tax Act, 1961; c) In order to resolve the issue of bunching of liabilities, the issuer can as a one-time exercise make a choice of having bullet maturity payment or the issuer can make staggered payment of the maturity proceeds within that financial year;d) Active consolidation, i.e consolidation, of existing outstanding debt securities may be made recommendatory at present, which may be reviewed at a later stage. Such active consolidation can be done through switches and conversion; and e) There should not be any clause prohibiting consolidation and re-issuance in the Articles of Association of the issuer/company. 7.  Amendment to SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor ) Regulations, 2014 The SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor) Regulations, 2014 shall be amended as follows:a) An express provision shall be inserted in the regulations to prevent Resident Indians/NRIs or the entities which are beneficially owned by Resident Indians/NRIs from subscribing to Offshore Derivative Instruments.8.   Amendments to the SEBI (Debenture Trustee) Regulations, 1993A Consultative Paper was placed on the SEBI website on proposed amendments to SEBI (Debenture Trustee) Regulations, 1993 (DT Regulations) for comments. The Board approved the amendments to the DT Regulations, 1993 after taking into consideration the public comments. The amendments are aimed to achieve the following objectives:I. To streamline the existing provisions in the DT Regulations with the provisions as  mentioned in the Companies Act 2013, Companies (Share Capital and Debentures)  Rules, 2014 and on account of amendment to the other SEBI Regulations. II. To fortify the existing provisions in the DT Regulations to enable the debenture  trustees to perform the task of securing the interest of the investors.9. Integration of broking activities in Equity Markets and Commodity Derivatives Markets under single entityConsequent to merger of FMC with SEBI, commodity derivatives brokers are also being regulated by SEBI. However, as per extant Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957  (SCR Rules) and SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992 (Stock Brokers Regulations), a stock broker / clearing member dealing in commodity derivatives cannot deal in other securities or vice versa, except by setting up of a separate entity. In this regard, the Board approved the proposal to remove this restriction by amending Stock Brokers Regulations and also to recommend to Government of India for amending SCR Rules accordingly.The integration of the stock brokers in equity and commodity derivative markets while having many synergies in terms of trading and settlement mechanism, risk management, redressal of investor grievances, etc. would benefit the investors, brokers, Stock Exchanges and SEBI as the same would help to:• enhance the economic efficiency in terms of meeting the operational as well as compliance obligations at a Member level resulting in ease of doing business • provide for efficient use of capital for the investors • widen the market penetration leading to greater financial inclusion for participants across all market segments.• facilitate effective regulatory oversight by Stock Exchanges and SEBI

press_releases/2be8cf1faedfcfc766954bb9aa8de8bc.txt-The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors.
press_releases/2be8cf1faedfcfc766954bb9aa8de8bc.txt:Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector. This will  not only reduce the paper-work and bring down cost of operations for the investors as well as for the intermediaries, but will also save the investors from the hassle of getting KYC done again by the intermediaries regulated by other financial sector regulators.

press_releases/c084758cd0c29bea13d8e4faa64475bb.txt:The SEBI Board met today and took the following decisions:A. Steps to Re-energise Mutual Fund IndustrySEBI Board took note of the lack of penetration of mutual fund products, inadequate distribution network, need for greater alignment of the interest of various stakeholders, regulation of distributors and issues concerning investor protection, and has approved some immediate steps as given below and has decided to develop a long term policy including financial inclusion and tax issues for mutual funds to deal with the public policy objectives of achieving sustainable growth of the mutual fund industry and mobilisation of household savings for the growth of the economy.I. Increase in penetration of mutual fund products and energising distribution network1. To accord flexibility and bring cost effectiveness, fungibility of Total Expense Ratio (TER) is allowed.2.  To energize the distribution system and to increase the 'feet-on-street' in distribution, it was decided to:i.  Simplify the distributors' registration process and increase base of mutual fund distributors by including postal agents, retired officials from government, banks, retired teachers etc. for distribution of simple products.ii.  Introduce varied levels of certification and registration depending on products & services offered.iii.  Reduce fees for NISM certification and AMFI registration.II. Improve reach of MF products in smaller cities/ towns (beyond top 15 cities)1. To improve the geographical reach of mutual funds and, bring in long term money from smaller towns, AMCs are allowed to charge additional TER (upto 30bps) depending upon the extent of new inflows from locations beyond top 15 cities. AMCs will be able to charge 30 bps if the new inflows from these cities/ towns are minimum 30% of the total inflows. In case of lesser inflows the proportionate amount will be allowed as additional TER.2. Mutual funds shall make complete disclosures in the half yearly report of Trustees to SEBI regarding the actual efforts of the mutual funds to increase penetration and the details of opening of new branches especially beyond top 15 cities.III.    Alignment of interest of investors, distributors and AMCs1.  In order to have greater and more focused investor education, it was decided that the industry should set apart a portion of the asset management fees annually for the investor education campaign.2.  To avoid differential treatment in the same scheme to different classes of investors, it was decided that all new investors will be subjected to single expense structure under a single plan. However, to be fair to direct investors and promote direct investment, it was decided to have a separate plan for direct investments, with a lower expense ratio.3.  Brokerage and transaction cost chargeable to the scheme for execution of trade to be capped to the extent of 12 bps in case of cash market transactions and 5 bps in case of F&O transactions.4.  In order to help enhance the reach of mutual fund products amongst small investors, who may not be tax payers and may not have PAN/bank accounts such as farmers, small traders/businessmen/workers, cash transactions in mutual fund schemes to the extent of Rs. 20,000/- will be allowed subject to compliance with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) requirements as allowed in case of some other financial products.5.  To enable the mutual fund industry to be in line with all other industries where service tax is borne by the end user, it is decided that the service tax payable on investment management fees should be charged to the scheme.6.  It has been decided that for transaction cost of Rs 100/- per transaction of Rs 10,000 and above (or Rs 150/- for first time investor in mutual fund), the option to "opt out" regarding transaction charges shall be on product basis at the discretion of AMC/distributor.IV.  Investor protection – issues of mis-selling and churning1.  In order to encourage long term holding and to reduce churn and align the interests of the AMCs/ distributors with that of the investors, it was decided that (a) the entire exit loads would be credited to the scheme while the AMCs will be able to charge an additional TER to extent of 20 bps. This will not result in any additional cost to the investors. (b) claw back of additional TER (in the case of inflows from cities beyond top 15 cities) would be provided to the extent the investments are redeemed  within a period of 1 year.2.  To tackle the issue of mis-selling, the Board decided as follows:i.  Create a system of identification of actual sales personnel of distributors, ii.  Evolve a system of 'product labeling' iii.  Inclusion of mis-selling as a 'fraudulent and unfair trade practice' in SEBI Regulations.V.  Strengthening regulatory framework for mutual Funds1.  AMCs to make monthly portfolio disclosures on their website.2. In order to provide fair treatment to existing investors of mutual fund schemes, it was decided to harmonize applicability of NAV across various schemes based on the day on which the funds are available for utilization, for an amount equal to or more than Rs. 2 lakhs.3.  Setting up in the near future of a Self-Regulatory Organisation for  regulation of distributors.4.  AMCs to disclose half yearly financial results of mutual funds on their websites and an advertisement in this regard would be published in at least one national and one regional newspaper.5.  Additional disclosures like gross inflows, net inflows, average assets under management, ratio of AUM/ gross inflows distributor wise, by the AMCs.VI.  Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme (RGESS)The Board welcomed the Government's recent announcement of a new scheme called RGESS and decided that SEBI should make a recommendation to the Government suggesting that RGESS may also provide for investments in equity schemes of mutual funds which have  the securities allowed under RGESS as the underlying.VII. Long Term MeasuresThe Board also felt that like other sectors of the economy where long term policies have been developed, there is a  need to develop a policy for mutual funds taking into account its importance in mobilizing domestic savings for the growth of the economy. The policy would include all aspects - including enhancing the reach and promoting financial inclusion, tax treatment, obligation of various stakeholders, etc.  Mutual Fund Advisory Committee of SEBI would recommend long-term policy measures after wider consultation with all the stakeholders in a reasonable time frame. B. Reforms in the Primary MarketSEBI Board undertook a comprehensive review of the extant regulatory framework in the primary market and approved a host of reforms to revitalise the markets, details of which are as under:-I. For enhancing the participation of retail investorsWith a view to increase the reach of IPOs to investors across the country and affording minimum allotment to a larger number of applicants, the following measures have been approved:-1.  To widen the distribution network of IPOs, in addition to the existing channels, the nationwide broker network of stock exchanges at more than 1000 locations will be made available for distributing IPOs in electronic form. Investors can approach any of the brokers in these locations for applying in IPOs, either physically or electronically. The facility of ASBA will also be extended to applicants coming through this mode. Stock exchanges shall provide for download of application forms on their website and shall also facilitate investors to view the status of their applications on their website, similar to secondary market transactions. The brokers uploading the electronic applications form will be adequately compensated by the issuer companies.2.  To further reduce the time taken from issue closure to listing, the reach of ASBA would be enhanced by mandating all ASBA banks to provide the facility in all their branches in a phased manner. Suitable incentive structure to issuers/brokers/banks will be put in place to encourage use of ASBA by retail individual investors.3.  The share allotment system will be modified to ensure that every retail applicant, irrespective of his application size, gets allotted a minimum bid lot, subject to availability of shares in aggregate. The system will satisfy more number of smaller applicants in the oversubscribed issues. The minimum application size for all investors is also being increased to Rs. 10,000-Rs.15,000, as against the existing Rs. 5,000-Rs. 7,000. II.   For facilitating capital raising by issuersIn order to achieve faster completion and simplification of fund raising process, lower the cost of fund-raising, encourage professional/ first generation entrepreneurs, rationalise disclosures in further capital offering documents and enable compliance with minimum public shareholding requirements under SCRR, the following reforms have been approved:-1.  Requirement of average free float market capitalisation reduced from Rs. 5000 Cr. to Rs. 3000 Cr. to facilitate further public offerings (FPOs) and rights issues through fast-track route.2.  To encourage professionals and technically qualified entrepreneurs who are unable to meet the requisite 20% contribution by themselves as promoters will be allowed to meet the same with the contribution of SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds such as SME Funds, Infrastructure Funds, PE funds, VCFs, etc., subject to a cap of 10%. 3.  To facilitate companies to reach minimum public shareholding requirements prescribed under SCRR, additional routes including Rights and Bonus Issue will be permitted. SEBI will also specify other options which may enable (non-compliant) listed entities to reach minimum public shareholding requirements prescribed under SCRR, 1957, subject to appropriate checks and balances.  Further, modifications, if any, as may be necessary, to the existing methods, will also be carried out to make them more operable. 4.  To allow more flexibility to the issuers, changes upto 20% in the amount proposed to be raised as given in the objects of the issue at the RHP stage, as against the existing 10%, will not necessitate re-filing with SEBI. 5.  To facilitate QIPs even in a falling market, issuers will be allowed to offer a maximum discount of 5% to the price calculated as per the SEBI Regulations. 6.  To provide updated information to investors, listed entities shall file a comprehensive annual disclosure statement in addition to the existing requirements on the lines of 20F filing prescribed by the US SEC. Such filings, updated by the prospectus, shall also serve as a reference in the offer documents for further capital offerings. III.  For enhancing market integrity and Investor confidenceTo ensure quality public offerings, instill discipline amongst issuers/market intermediaries, make the issue process more transparent, provide a level playing field for all market participants and enhance investor confidence, the following reforms have been approved:-1.  To improve the quality of public offerings and enhance investor protection, the eligibility criteria for the issuers coming through the “profitability route” is being redesigned. Now, only issuers with a minimum average pre-tax operating profit of Rs. 15 Crore will be able to come through this route. However, other issuers will continue to access the capital market through either the SME platform or  compulsory book building route with increased QIB participation of 75%, as against the existing 50%.2.  In order to protect the interest of investors who may not always be in a position to assess the risks associated with a business model due to complexities involved therein and to ensure that only reasonably credible issuers with adequate disclosures in their offer documents are allowed to access the public issuances route, SEBI will be putting in a place a framework for rejection of draft offer documents.  SEBI will also put in place necessary framework for faster clearances of offer documents. This will help reduce repeated queries and resultant delays in dealing with DRHPs by SEBI.3.  Additional mechanisms for monitoring of issue proceeds will be put in place within the extant legal framework.4.  To avoid any misleading signals to retail investors about the extent of subscription in the issue, no withdrawal or lowering the size of bids shall be permitted for non-retail investors at any stage. 5.  The price band alongwith relevant financial information shall be published atleast 5 working days prior to opening of the issue, as against the current provision of 2 working days in the case of IPOs.  This will provide more time to the market to analyse the issue.6.  To bring more transparency in capital raising, 'General Corporate Purposes' as an object of the issue would not exceed 25% of the issue size. Presently, there is no cap on this item.7.  Listed entities shall frame employee benefit schemes only in accordance with SEBI (ESOS and ESPS) Guidelines, 1999.  Entities whose schemes are not in conformity with the same would be given time to align with the said Guidelines.  Further, such schemes will be restrained from acquiring their shares from the secondary market. C. Regulations on Investment Advisors1.  The Board approved the SEBI (Investment Advisors) Regulations, 2012 (“Investment Advisors Regulations”) thereby providing a framework for registration and regulation of Investment Advisors (“IA”). The Investment Advisors Regulations have been framed based on consultation with RBI, IRDA, PFRDA and comments received from the public on the concept paper disseminated for this purpose. 2.  All individuals, body corporate and partnership firms engaged in the business of providing investment advice to investors for consideration are required to be registered and regulated under these Regulations. Any person who holds himself as an investment advisor shall also fall under the purview of these Regulations. Investment advice given without any consideration through media at large and widely available to the public shall not be considered as investment advice.3.  The banks or body corporates which also offer distribution, execution or referral services will be required to offer investment advisory services through a subsidiary or a Separately Identifiable Department or Division (SIDD).

press_releases/bf59158db0fbe3c68cc8762c02bdfb5d.txt:                                                                                             SEBI Board MeetingThe SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions:1. Restructuring in stressed companies With a view to facilitate turnaround of listed companies in distress which will benefit their shareholders and lenders, the Board has approved the following proposals:  Presently, relaxations from preferential issue requirements under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 and from open offer obligations under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011  are available for lenders undertaking restructuring of listed companies in distress through Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme in terms of the guidelines of RBI. It has been represented to SEBI that where the lenders have acquired shares and propose to divest the same to a new investor, they are facing difficulties as the new investor would need to make a mandatory open offer which would reduce the funds available for investment in the company. Hence, they have requested for exemptions to these investors. Accordingly, it has been decided to extend the aforesaid relaxations to the new investors acquiring shares in distressed companies pursuant to such restructuring schemes. However, such relaxations shall be subject to certain conditions like approval by the shareholders of the companies by special resolution and lock-in of their shareholding for a minimum period of three years. Further, it has also been decided to extend the said relaxations to the lenders under other restructuring schemes undertaken in accordance with guidelines of RBI. 2.    Resolution plans approved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016The Board has also approved the proposal to provide exemption from open offer obligations, under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, for acquisitions pursuant to resolution plans approved by NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. 3. Extension of Lock-in-relaxation to Category II Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)Presently, in case of an IPO, there are relaxed rules for lock-in provision to Category I AIFs. The Board approved the proposal for extending such relaxation to Category II AIFs also. This would bring about uniformity, ease of doing business and expand the investor base available for capital raising.4. Consultation paper on Easing of access norms for investment by FPIs FPI regime, which commenced from June 01, 2014, has been put in place with the objectives to rationalize various foreign portfolio investment routes, simplify the procedures to attract more foreign funds.  SEBI proposes to carry out appropriate amendment (s) to SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 and issue necessary circular/guidelines etc. issued thereunder, to further ease the access norms for investments by FPIs in Indian securities market. Some of the proposed changes are as follows:1. Expansion of eligible jurisdictions for grant of FPI registration to category I FPIs by including countries having diplomatic tie-ups with India.2. Simplification of broad based requirements. 3. Rationalization of fit and proper criteria. 4. Permitting FPIs operating under the Multiple Investment Managers (MIM)structure and holding FVCI registration to appoint multiple custodians.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for initiation of public consultation process before implementing the aforesaid proposed changes to SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 and necessary circular/guidelines etc. issued thereunder.5. Offshore Derivative Instruments (ODI)The Board has decided to levy a "Regulatory Fee" of US$1000 on each ODI subscriber, to be collected and deposited by the ODI issuing FPI of such ODI subscriber, once every three years, starting from April 1, 2017. SEBI shall amend SEBI (FPI) Regulations, 2014 to implement the decision taken by the Board.The Board has decided to prohibit ODIs from being issued against derivatives, except on those which are used for hedging purposes. SEBI will issue a circular in this regard.6. Growth and Development of Equity Derivatives Market in IndiaA paper was presented to the Board on "Growth and Development of Equity Derivatives Market in India". It was decided to have stakeholder consultation on the need to review the derivatives market framework including product suitability for investors so as to further strengthen the framework in line with the emerging trends and global best practices.7. SEBI Annual Report 2016-17The Board considered and approved the SEBI Annual Report 2016-17. In compliance with Section 18(2) of SEBI Act, 1992, the same Annual Report would be submitted to the Central Government.

press_releases/130add1bba3b4d1df2922b9cea02735d.txt:SEBI would like to reiterate that there is no change in its policy of FII investments in India except by way of strengthening the "know your client" regime. This is felt necessary in the interest of the efficacy of the market. With effect from 3rd February, 2004, overseas derivative instruments such as Participatory Notes (PNs) against underlying Indian securities can be issued only to regulated entities and further transfers, if any, of these instruments can also be to other regulated entities only. FIIs/sub accounts are required to ensure that no further down stream issuance of such derivative instruments is made. In order to give effect to this decision, necessary amendments to the Regulations are being notified. To discharge regulatory responsibilities, SEBI would need to be in a position to ascertain, if circumstances so warrant, details of the ultimate investors investing through PNs etc. in the Indian market. The FIIs issuing such derivative instruments are therefore required to exercise due diligence and maintain complete details of the investors, based strictly on "know your client" principles.

Amendments to the SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015In order to augment the governance of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) registered with SEBI and mitigate the issues of conflict of interest, SEBI Board has approved certain changes in the SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, which, inter alia, include the following:I. Enhanced eligibility requirement for CRAs :a. Minimum net worth requirement of a CRA shall be increased from existing Rs. 5 Crores to Rs. 25 Croresb. The promoter of a CRA shall maintain a minimum shareholding of 26% in the CRA for a minimum period of three years from the date of grant of registration by the Board.c. The foreign CRA should be incorporated in a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) member jurisdiction and registered under their law only shall be eligible to promote a CRA in India.II. Restriction on Crossholdings amongst CRAs:a. No CRA registered with SEBI  (CRA) shall: i. directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of shareholding and/ or voting rights in any other CRA andii. have representation on the Board of any other CRA.b. A shareholder holding 10% or more shares and/ or voting rights in a  CRA shall not hold 10% or more shares and/ or voting rights, directly or indirectly, in any other CRA. However, this restriction shall not apply to holdings by pension funds, Insurance schemes, and mutual fund schemes. c. Acquisition of shares and/ or voting rights in a CRA by another CRA beyond 10% shall be permitted only if such acquisition results in change in control with  prior approval of SEBI.III. Withdrawal of ratings by CRAs:a. CRAs shall be permitted to withdraw the ratings subject to the CRA having rated the instrument continuously for a stipulated period and in the manner as may be specified by SEBI from time to time.IV. Segregation of activities other than the rating of financial instruments and economic/ financial research from CRA : CRAs shall segregate their activities other than the rating of financial instruments and economic/ financial research to a separate legal entity.V. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015 shall be amended to include a. disclosure of financial results on the Exchange(s) by issuers of listed debt in line with the corresponding requirements for issuers of listed equityIssuers of listed debt shall disclose on the Exchange(s) within forty – five days of end of the first three quarters and sixty days of end of the last quarter, the below mentioned financial results in the format as prescribed in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (excluding notes and detailed sub-classification): I) Statement of Profit and Loss on a quarterly and year-to-date basis II) Statement of Assets and Liabilities/ Balance Sheet on a half-yearly basisb. Disclosure of annual consolidated financial results to the Exchange(s) in case of issuers having only listed debtI) Issuers of listed debt shall disclose their audited annual consolidated financial results on the Exchange(s) within sixty days from the end of the financial year.2. Additional methods for listed entities to achieve minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirements The Board has decided to introduce two additional methods-Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) and Sale of shares up to 2% held by promoters/promoter group in open market subject to certain conditions for listed companies to comply with the MPS requirement. The Board has approved necessary amendments to SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009.QIP offers a quick solution to listed entities enabling them to meet MPS requirements apart from meeting their funding requirements. Also, sale of a certain small percentage of shares through open market will facilitate quicker and cheaper compliance for listed entities where promoters hold shares marginally above the threshold limit.Rule 19A of the SCRR stipulates that every listed company shall maintain a public shareholding of atleast  25%. Listed public sector companies have been provided additional time till August 21, 2018 to comply with the requirements. Accordingly, listed entities that have a public shareholding of less than 25% are required to adopt any of the certain methods to comply with the MPS requirements, such as Issuance of shares to public through prospectus; Offer for Sale to public through prospectus; Sale of shares held by promoters through secondary market in terms of SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/05/2012 dated February 01, 2012; Institutional Placement Programme; Rights issue to public shareholders; Bonus shares to public shareholders; and any other method as may be approved by SEBI under case to case basis. 3. Issuance of refund orders/allotment letters/share certificates through electronic mode under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements Regulations), 2009As per present requirements, refund orders, allotment letters and share certificates are dispatched by way of registered post or certificate of posting, as may be applicable.As a green initiative, the Board approved the proposal of inclusion of electronic mode as a valid method of communicating the allotment advice/credit of shares/unblocking of funds in addition to the present methods. This would be in tune with the digital initiatives of the Government and would reduce printing costs for the issuer company leading to faster communication and ease of doing business.  4. Norms for Shareholding and Governance in Mutual FundsThe Board after deliberation on the issue of potential conflict in case of sponsor and it’s associates or any shareholder of a Mutual Fund having stake or Board representation in Asset Management Company (AMC) and Trustee Companies of another Mutual Fund, decided the following:I.

Any existing non-conformity with the aforesaid requirements may be aligned within a reasonable time.5.

Integration of trading in commodity derivatives market with other segments of securities market at exchange levelHon’ble Union Finance Minister, while presenting the Union budget for the FY 2017-2018, proposed that the commodities and securities derivative markets will be further integrated by integrating the participants, brokers, and operational frameworks. For the sake of smoother implementation of the above budget announcement regarding integration between commodity derivatives and rest of the securities markets, it was decided that the integration would be achieved in two phases. In Phase-I, it was proposed to have integration at Intermediary level. In Phase-II, necessary steps would be taken to enable a single exchange to operate various segments such as equity, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, interest rate futures & debt etc.With regards to Phase-I, all necessary steps required to enable integration of commodity derivatives market with rest of the securities markets at intermediary’s level have been taken by SEBI.In order to implement phase II i.e. to permit trading of commodity derivatives and other segments of securities market on single exchange,   the Board approved the proposal to remove the restrictions by making suitable amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporation) Regulations, 2012 (“SECC Regulations”). The amendments to the SECC Regulations would be effective from October 1, 2018.MumbaiDecember 28, 2017

press_releases/987abb42404948e7965d0508be70477d.txt:SEBI took over the Regulation of the Commodity Derivatives market on September 28, 2015 as a result of merger of FMC with SEBI. The merger of two Regulators is an unique and rare event across the world. It was also a heartening moment for SEBI as an organization that Government had reposed faith in its regulatory capacity while entrusting regulation of a new sector.  Taking over the Regulation of the new sector and bringing it at par with the Regulation  of the securities market was a lengthy process which involved Gap Analyses, widespread consultation with stakeholders, amendment to various Regulations, integration of trade data with our integrated surveillance system, upgrading the risk management framework, improving governance system of Exchanges and laying down an elaborate mechanism for investor grievance redressal and arbitration, capacity building and necessary organizational restructuring.
