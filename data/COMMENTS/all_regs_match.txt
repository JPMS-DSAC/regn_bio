The State Bank of India Act, 1955,  the  State  Bank  of  India  (Subsidiary Banks)  Act,  1959,  the  Industrial  Development Bank of India, 1964 and the  Banking  Companies  (Acquisition and Transfer of  Undertakings)  Act,  1980  were amended through this Ordinance to facilitate  the  dematerialisation and transfer by electronic book  entry  of  the  shares of the SBI, its subsidiaries and the  IDBI.  The  Ordinance  also amends the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 to  exempt  transfer  of  units of mutual funds through electronic  book  entry in a depository.

Extensive discussion were then held with  the  stock  exchanges, market participants and investors on  this  issue. In addition to the views expressed at these meetings,  SEBI  also  had  the  benefit of  written  comments  on  the  Consultative  Paper submitted by chambers  of  commerce  and  industry,  market participants and investors. Based  on  the  above, the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations,  1996  were  notified in May 1996. These regulations  provide  for the following:

./annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt-The National Securities Depository Limited Following  the  notification of the SEBI  (Depositories  and  Participants)  Regulations, 1996, NSDL, a company  sponsored  by  the  IDBI, the UTI and the NSE was granted a certificate  of  registration as a depository on June 7, 1996.  NSDL  was  granted  a  certificate  of  commencement  of  business   on  October    31,   1996.   NSDL   began   the    process    of  dematerialisation of securities with three participants  and  three securities eligible for dematerialisation. As of March 31, 1997, 28 participants had been registered by  SEBI  as  participants in NSDL. Of these  10 were  banks,  2  were  financial institutions, 3 non bank custodians, 11 were  stock  brokers  and 2 other non bank finance companies.  All  the  major  custodians of securities who act  on  behalf  of  FIIs,  mutual  funds and financial institutions  had  become  participants in NSDL. For a security to be declared eligible  for dematerialisation in NSDL, the issuer (and his registrar  and  transfer  agent in case there is one) has  to  sign  an  agreement   with  NSDL.  This  agreement   lays   down   the  obligations and responsibilities of the issuer and NSDL with  respect  to  each other, in addition to those prescribed  in  the  Depositories  Act  and  the SEBI  regulations.  As  the  Depositories Act permits investors to hold securities  which  are  eligible  for  dematerialisation  in  a  depository  in  physical  form outside the depository, it is important  that  the issuer or the issuer's registrar and transfer agent have  been  required  to reconcile the holdings of a  security  in  physical  form with those held in dematerialised form  on  a  daily basis. As  of  March  31, 1997, issuers had signed agreements  with  NSDL  in respect of 43 securities. The market capitalisation  of  securities for which issuers had established  electronic  connectivity  with NSDL at the end of 1996-97 stood  at  Rs.  44,973  crore.  As of March 31, 1997, the  market  value  of  dematerialised securities stood at Rs. 502 crore. These were  held on behalf of 1,957 beneficial owners. At  present, only the capital market segment of the NSE  and  the   National   Securities  Clearing  Corporation   Limited  (NSCCL),   which  acts  as  the  clearing  corporation   for  securities traded on the capital market segment of  the  NSE  are  integrated with the depository. Only trades  which  are  executed on the dematerialised securities trading segment on  the NSE can be cleared by NSCCL for settlement by electronic  book  entry within NSDL. The Depositories Act, 1996  amended  the  Indian Stamp Act, 1899, to exempt transfers  of  equity  shares  through electronic book entry from payment of  stamp  duty. 
./annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt:Custodians of securities The  SEBI (Custodians of Securities) Regulations, 1996  were  notified  in May 1996. The regulations prescribe eligibility  criteria  and  a  code  of conduct to  be  followed  by  the  custodians  for  the  first  time.  Custodians,  as  service  providers to institutional investors are an integral part of  the  securities  markets,  and it is  important  that  their  interactions  and interfaces with stock exchanges,  clearing  corporations, clearing houses, stock brokers, registrars and  investing institutions be streamlined and uniform. With this  in  view,  SEBI  prescribed uniform norms and practices  for  custodians  of securities in October 1996 after  discussions  with   custodians,   stock  exchanges   and   other   market  participants.    The   SEBI   (Custodian   of    Securities)  Regulations, 1996 were amended giving power to SEBI to  give  existing  custodians  time  upto  5  years  to  raise  their  networth to Rs.50 crore. 
./annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt:The SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 India has a vast pool of entrepreneurial talent, which needs to be channelled and nurtured. Venture capital funds have an important role to play in providing entrepreneurs with risk capital, and in many cases, management expertise and mentoring from venture capitalists. SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996, have been crafted with the objective of helping venture capital funds to foster entrepreneurship in India. The regulations were notified in December 1996. At the end of March 1997, 13 venture capital funds had applied for registration with SEBI. In terms of these regulations, venture capital funds may be set up as companies or trusts. A considerable deterrent to the use of the trust structure for venture capital funds was the inability of trusts to vote. This has been removed with the amendment to the Companies Act, 1956, which permits venture capital funds set up as trusts to vote their shares. The regulations permits venture capital funds to raise funds only from institutional and high networth individuals, and to ensure this, the minimum amount that may be raised from any one investor has been kept at Rs. 5 lakh. The regulations aim to provide a lot of flexibility to venture capital funds to facilitate the growth of this segment of the market. The only investment restrictions that have been prescribed is that at least 80% of the funds raised by a venture capital fund.

./annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt: In terms of the rules announced by the Central Board of Direct Taxation on July 18, 1995, venture capital funds are exempt from taxation provided that they invest in accordance with the rules in certain sectors of the economy, and such investment, among other requirements, is for a minimum period of three years. The SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 impose no such “lock in” of investment or restrictions on industrial sectors in which investment has to be made. However, to avail of the tax benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961, venture capital funds registered with SEBI are required to meet with the requirements of the rules and obtain an exemption from the income tax authorities. Foreign investors may invest fully in domestic venture capital funds, whether set up as trusts or companies. This investment is governed by the Guidelines for Overseas Venture Capital Investment issued by the government on September 20, 1995. The initial investment in the domestic venture capital fund by an overseas investor may be made with the approval of the FIPB and the RBI. Subsequent investment by the venture capital fund after it obtains SEBI registration into investee ventures does not require any further approval. The guidelines impose a three year “lock in” on investment by venture capital funds with foreign investment. Such funds may invest in only upto 40% of the equity capital of an investee venture, and not more than 5% of the corpus of such funds may be invested in one single investee venture. This limit is to be raised to 10% following the announcement by the Finance Minister in the Budget Speech for 1997-98.  
./annual_reports/2b961d546277dbbc6ccd6f69464b102b.txt:Substantial acquisitions of shares and take-overs The SEBI (Substantial Acquisitions of Shares and Take-overs) Regulations, 1994 were notified in November 1994. The regulations were aimed at making the take-over process more transparent, and to protect the interests of minority shareholders. A committee was set up under the chairmanship of Justice P N Bhagwati, former Chief Justice of India to examine the deficiencies in the 1994 regulations and to make them more fair, transparent and unambiguous, and to protect the interests of investors and all parties concerned in the acquisition process. The committee had a wide representation from chambers of commerce and industry, investor associations, stock exchanges, market participants, legal experts and professional bodies. The report of the committee was widely circulated, and was one of the most debated reports on the securities markets in the country. After discussions on the comments on the report and the draft regulations framed by the committee, the SEBI (Substantial Acquisitions of Shares and Take-overs) Regulations, 1997 were notified in February 1997. The 1997 regulations aim at:

./annual_reports/5e17329d5ee307e129bf739da3e9123e.txt-A major step in this direction was taken with the establishment of a depository - the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL). The development of mutual funds which are important investment vehicles in a mature securities market, was given a major impetus, with the revision of the mutual fund regulations which now provide greater operational flexibility to the fund managers and increase their accountability and supervision. Far reaching changes were made to the SEBI regulations for substantial acquisition of shares and take- overs. The take-over regulations were revised based on the recommendations of the committee appointed by SEBI under the chairmanship of Justice P N Bhagwati, former Chief Justice of India. The new regulations, while enhancing the level of investor protection and transparency recognise the new freedom in the corporate sector as an outcome of the reforms. The regulations for the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were liberalised to provide greater flexibility and widening the scope of their investment in Indian securities markets.
./annual_reports/5e17329d5ee307e129bf739da3e9123e.txt:Five new regulations were notified by SEBI, during the year. These were the SEBI (Custodian of Securities) Regulations, 1996 notified on May 16, 1996; the SEBI (Depository and Participants) Regulations, 1996 notified on May 16, 1996; the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 notified on December 4, 1996; the revised SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 notified on December 9, 1996; and the revised SEBI (Substantial Acquisitions of Shares and Take- overs) Regulations, 1997 notified on February 20, 1997. Besides, the regulations for Foreign Institutional Investors were also amended to give effect to the liberalisation in policy on foreign portfolio investment. Changes were also made to the SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 and the SEBI (Underwriters) Regulations, 1993. A list of all rules and regulations notified under the SEBI Act is given as an Annexure to this Report.
./annual_reports/5e17329d5ee307e129bf739da3e9123e.txt-While introducing these and other reforms and policy changes, SEBI has followed an open, transparent, consultative and participative approach. SEBI has kept in close touch with investors, market participants and professionals. This feedback, as well as expert advice has helped SEBI formulate regulations which have conceptual underpinnings and address market needs.

April 1996 saw the highest net investment of US$ 433.6 million by FIIs for any given month since they began investing.

The High Court while interpreting section 11(2)(i) of the SEBI Act held that the expression “persons associated with the securities market” is not limited to intermediaries but includes “investors” also.

The appellant company was supposed to keep the lead manager well informed about the risk factors especially the financial crisis. If in such circumstances, the lead managers just like an ordinary prudent businessman wanted to withdraw, they have a right to withdraw their consent to act as lead managers in terms of the MoU between the lead manager and the appellant company on account of suppression of the facts and several mis-statements in the prospectus.

The Forum ordered the company and SEBI to pay compensation of Rs.1,000 to the complainant. SEBI preferred an appeal to the State Commission. The State Commission admitted the appeal and finally held that the complainant is not a consumer to SEBI under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and SEBI is a statutory body discharging statutory duties for which no consideration is paid by the complainant and SEBI does not render any service for consideration and complaint against SEBI was dismissed.

If both the Houses agree in making any modification, then such rule or regulation will operate only in its modified form. If both the Houses agree that such rule or regulation is not to be made, it ceases to be operative. These provisions clearly show that regulations are legislative in nature and statutory in character, and bear the seal of approval by Parliament, after they are made for their continued existence.

During 1996-97, 391 brokers were registered with SEBI making the total number of stock brokers registered with SEBI to 8,867 as on March 31, 1997. Exchange wise details of stock brokers registered with SEBI are given in the Table 28 below. Figure 12 below illustrates the number of stock brokers and the level of corporatisation of membership of stock exchanges.From the table, the trend towards corporatisation can be seen. Corporate membership has gone up from 1,917 (23% of the total membership) as on March 31, 1996 to 2,360 (27% of total membership) as on March 31, 1997. The trend towards corporatisation of membership is expected to continue further in 1997-98 considering the one time exemption from capital gains tax proposed in the Budget for 1997-98. As of March 31, 1997, the majority of members of the NSEI and the OTCEI were corporate bodies. Other exchanges which are large in terms of number of members, such as Mumbai, Calcutta, Jaipur and Uttar Pradesh, had comparatively lower rates of corporatisation of members.
./annual_reports/ed121c015cf43c543bd137a60437394c.txt-Sub-brokersIndividual investors invariably transact securities through sub-brokers. It is therefore absolutely imperative to regulate this class of intermediaries. SEBI’s efforts in registering and regulating them have not been very successful so far. As on March 31, 1997 only 1,798 sub brokers are registered with SEBI.

./circulars/1300873423859.txt:     Circular No. FITTC/CUST/11/2001May 18, 2001To All Custodians of Securities   Dear Sir / Madam, Sub: Activities of Custodians of SecuritiesIn order to ensure efficient custodial operations and to facilitate offsite supervision the following decisions have been taken: A. Review of Custodial operations Regulation 14 of SEBI (Custodian of Securities) Regulations, 1996 stipulates an annual review of the systems, procedures & controls of the custodian by an expert. This review covers the systems and procedures being followed by the custodian to meet its obligations towards its clients, regulators and other relevant bodies. A copy of the review report is required to be filed with SEBI. It has been decided that henceforth the report for a particular calendar year would be filed by 31st March of the following year along with ‘Action Taken Report’, if any.  Further, it is reiterated that this review report should also cover the aspect of reporting of FII transactions to SEBI and RBI as stipulated vide Regulation 16 of the SEBI (FII) Regulations, 1995. B.Monthly market value of investments With a view to have a more realistic assessment of the institutional investments it is proposed that custodians should provide the market value of the securities held in custody with them on a monthly basis. The market value on the last day of each month may be submitted in the enclosed format (Annexure A). This format may be submitted by the seventh day of the following month. The value of securities as on April 30, 2001 may be submitted by May 25, 2001.   C.Discontinuation of reporting of FII investment data in dBase Currently the custodians are reporting the FII equity and debt investment figures in dBase and text formats. It has been decided that the equity trade reports in dBase format be discontinued from May 21, 2001. Thereafter, the custodians may report the figures only in text mode. Debt reporting would however continue in the dBase format.   D.Reporting of Trades There are occasions when SEBI is closed on account of holiday, but the exchanges being a nationwide trading network are open for trading. For such occasions, custodians are requested to submit separate reports - one would be the normal report and the other for the holiday. Care must be taken not to submit a consolidated report, but different reports with proper reporting dates. E. Submission of company information for unlisted securities. The SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 permit FIIs to invest in unlisted securities. Currently the custodians are reporting trades for unlisted securities under 'no ISIN' or custodian generated codes. With a view to have a proper scrip identification, it would be necessary to have ISINs for such securities also. To generate ISINs, information in the enclosed format (Annexure B) is required to be submitted to SEBI. Information on scrips where investment has already been made in the past should be submitted within 10 days of issue of this circular. Information with respect to new unlisted scrips should be submitted within 10 days from the date of reporting of the transaction. A copy of this circular is also available on our web page ‘Foreign Institutional Investors’ at our web site: www.sebi.gov.in. Yours faithfully,   P.

./circulars/1299664883820.txt:    To All Registered  Merchant Bankers   Dear Sirs,  Sub: Amendments to the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection){ DIP} Guidelines,2000   SEBI, in its constant endeavor to enhance the level of investors’ protection, to increase the transparency and efficiency of the primary market, to strengthen the disclosure and eligibility norms for issuer companies and to rationalize and simplify various operational procedures in the primary market so as to facilitate raising of resources by the issuer companies, has taken several initiatives, in this regard, based on the recommendations of the committees set up by SEBI.  The recommendations of these committees were also made available at SEBI Website for soliciting public comments.   The SEBI Board, after considering the recommendations of the Committees and public comments thereon, has approved certain modifications to be incorporated in the captioned Guidelines.   Accordingly, SEBI, under the provision of Section 11(1) of SEBI Act, is hereby issuing the amendments to SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000; incorporating the modifications approved by the SEBI Board, as stated above.  The amendments are detailed in the Annexure and are categorized under various sections as specified below:   Section A   Review of Eligibility Norms  The existing eligibility norms of the issuers have been reviewed interalia with an  objective to strengthen the existing norms, to facilitate entry of mid-cap, small-cap new entrepreneurs to the primary market without exposing the public to undue risk, to maintain quality of issuer companies and also to keep fly by night issuers at bay.  Accordingly amendments to SEBI(DIP) guidelines have been carried out . The amendments inter-alia include introduction of Net Tangible Assets and minimum number of allottees as additional criterion, appraisal route as an alternative to the mandatory book building route etc. Details of the amendments are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section B    Review of Book Building guidelines  Book building is a facility given to issuer companies  and merchant bankers to ascertain the demand and indicative price before the actual opening of the issue. SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue. It is extensively used in international IPOs as stabilization tool for post listing price of the newly issued shares. It is being introduced in the Indian Capital Market in the initial public offerings using book building method. It is expected to boost investors’ confidence by arresting the speculative forces which work immediately after the listing and thus results in short-term volatility in post listing price. The amendments carried out in SEBI (DIP) guidelines in this regard, have been detailed under this section in the Annexure.    Section D   Review of disclosure requirements in the offer documents  The existing disclosure requirements in the offer documents are reviewed on an ongoing basis by SEBI and based on the review, the amendments are carried out in SEBI (DIP) guidelines. The amendments under this section interalia include full disclosure about the promoters including their photograph, PAN number etc, classification of risk factors, use of standard financial units etc.  Details of the amendments are given under this section in the Annexure.     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIACORPORATION FINANCE DEPARTMENTDIVISION OF ISSUES & LISTINGMittal Court, ‘A’ Wing, Ground Floor  Nariman Point, MUMBAI - 400 021.

./circulars/1300791840482.txt:  CHIEF GENERAL MANAGER MUTUAL FUNDS DEPARTMENT MFD/CIR/11/ 354/ 2001 December 20, 2001All Mutual Funds Registered with SEBI Unit Trust of India AMFI Dear Sirs, Sub: Independent Directors on Boards of AMCs and Trustee Companies.As you are aware, the concept of independent directors on the Boards of asset management companies (AMCs) and trustee companies has been introduced in SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 for better corporate governance, to bring about transparency in the operations of mutual funds and to protect the interests of investors. With a view to implement the regulations in this regard in letter and spirit, the following clarifications are being issued.  1.According to Regulation 16(5), an independent trustee should not be associated in any manner with the sponsor. It is clarified that relatives (as defined in the Companies Act) of sponsor or directors of the sponsor company or relatives of associate directors of the AMCs and trustee companies shall be considered as associate directors. 2.The nominees of the companies who are stakeholders in the sponsor company or AMC (even if they are not deemed sponsors by virtue of holding less than 40% of net worth of AMC), shall be considered as associate directors. 3.A person who is an "associate" in accordance with definition in the Regulations cannot be appointed as independent director even after he ceases to be an "associate" unless a cooling off period of three years has elapsed from the date of his disassociation. For the sake of clarity and to avoid any ambiguity, an example is given here. Supposing an employee of the sponsor or their associate companies or AMC or trustee company resigns on December 1, 2001, then he cannot be appointed as an independent director till December 1, 2004. During this intervening period, he can be appointed only as associate director. However, once he is taken as an associate director, say on December 2, 2001, he cannot be considered as "independent" from December 2, 2004. There must be a cooling off period of 3 years from the date he ceases to be an associate director. 4. The clarifications in Clauses 1-3 above shall be followed in case of directors of trustee companies and AMCs.Please classify your existing directors of AMC and trustee company as "associates" or "independent" in the light of the aforesaid clarifications and inform us if the composition of directors does not comply with the requirement of 50% or 2/3rd independent directors of AMC or trustee company. In future also, whenever the composition falls below the requirements due to resignation or any other reason please inform us immediately and also the steps proposed to be taken by you to ensure compliance with the Regulations. Your attention is drawn to Regulation 18(25)(A)(i) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 which requires the trustees to be discerning in the appointment of the directors on the Board of the asset management company. Further, under Regulations 18(27)(iii) and (v), the independent directors of the trustee or asset management company are required to pay specific attention to the selection and nomination of individuals to fill the vacancies of independent directors. Considering the above clarifications and provisions in the Regulations, the format for sending the bio-data of directors of AMCs and trustees to SEBI has been revised and is enclosed herewith. You are advised to use this format in the future while sending the bio-data of the new directors of AMC or trustee company for our information or approval as the case may be. New directors should also be informed about their responsibilities and rights as specified in the Regulations. This circular is being issued in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.    Yours faithfully,     P. K.

Despite the statutory requirement, large number of Sub-brokers in the Securities Market are unregistered. The issue was discussed during annual meeting of the Stock Exchanges held in SEBI on March 19, 1997. It was decided in the meeting that transfer deed bearing rubber stamps on the reverse thereof other than those of clearing members of the stock exchanges/clearing house/clearing corporations, SEBI registered sub-brokers and remisiers registered with the stock exchanges shall be treated as bad delivery in stock exchanges. This shall apply to all transfer deeds dated June 1, 1997 and thereafter. We had earlier circulated the guidelines for filing the applications for registration by the sub-brokers vide our letter no SMD/OPG/AA/1020/96 dated March 14,1996 (copy enclosed for ready reference).As referred in our aforesaid letter you are requested to keep sufficient Stocks of Form ‘B’(application form for registration as Sub-broker) and Form’C’(recommendation letter to be given by the member with whom the Sub-broker is affiliated),for free distribution amongst applicants. In September 1993,we had prescribed a model agreement to be entered between broker and the sub-broker. The model agreement has now been revised based upon suggestions received from the market participants. A copy of the revised agreement is enclosed The salient features of the revised model agreement are as under : 1.The registered sub-broker can transact only through the member broker who had recommended his application for registration by signing form C. If the Sub-broker is desirous of doing business with more than one broker, he will have to obtain separate registration in each case.   1.It will be mandatory for the sub-broker to disclose the name of all other sub-brokers/brokers where he is having direct or indirect interest. 1.It shall be the responsibility of the broker to report the default if any of his sub-broker to all other brokers with whom sub-broker is affiliated.     1.The earlier stipulation of keeping the deposits received from sub-brokers with the stock exchange has now been removed.     1.The agreement can be terminated by giving the notice in writing of not less than 6 months by either party.     1.Sub-brokers are obligated to enter into agreements and maintain the database of their clients / investors on the pattern of format forwarded to the stock exchanges by our circular No.SMD/POLICY/CIR/5-97 dated April 11 1997.It is clarified that the sub-broker already registered with SEBI have to maintain database of their client/investor. We advise you to bring the content of this letter to the notice of your members.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT   NO.SMD/OPG/AA/1020/96 March 14, 1996         The Executive Director/President All Stock Exchanges         Dear Sir,     SUB: REGISTRATION OF SUB-BROKER      As you are aware, sub-brokers are required to obtain certificate of registration from Securities and Exchange Board of India in accordance with regulations made under section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 without which they are not permitted to buy, sell or deal in securities. The applications from sub-brokers were invited in May, 1992 through recognised Stock Exchanges for registration with SEBI. A large number of applications were received and registration granted to approximately 1200 applicants fulfilling the requirements.     It is felt that a large number of sub-brokers still are not registered with SEBI and therefore carrying out their activities without any valid legal sanction. SEBI at its end has started returning all incomplete applications directly to the applicants. Those who were already in the business of sub-broking and had applied for registration before 21st May, 1992 are being advised to re-submit their applications complete in all respects within two months failing which it shall be construed that they are acting as sub-brokers without holding certificates of registration in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992. The applicants who had applied after 21st May, 1992, are being advised to stop the business of sub-broking immediately which can be re-started after they are duly registered with SEBI.      We have devised guidelines for making applications complete in all respects. A copy of the same is being enclosed for your perusal. Co-operation from the Stock Exchanges will help us immensely in registering and regulating this class of capital market intermediaries.     ... 2/-          -: 2 :-          We request you to keep sufficient stock of Form 'B' (application form for registration as sub-broker) and Form 'C'(recommendation letter to be given by the member with whom the sub-broker is affiliated), for free distribution amongst applicants. We are enclosing a copy of these forms. In September, 1993, we had sent a copy of model agreement advising you to circulate the same amongst your members. This agreement between broker and sub-broker specifies the scope of their rights and liabilities.

./circulars/54bf9076ff763f5fd1372b9688c48b3a.txt:As you are aware, Regulation 49(3) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 lays down parameters for determining sale price and repurchase price of mutual funds units applicable for investors. It has been observed that mutual funds are using two different methods for calculating the sale and repurchase price of mutual fund units. While some of the mutual funds are using either of the two methods for sale as well as repurchase prices, others are using one formula for sale price and another for repurchase price. It leads to minor variation in the amount payable to investors or number of units allotted to them and may also create confusion in their minds because of different practices being followed in the mutual funds industry. You would appreciate that there should be one method for such calculations to be followed by all mutual funds on a uniform basis and which is easily understood by the investors.
./circulars/54bf9076ff763f5fd1372b9688c48b3a.txt-After a detailed discussion with the mutual funds industry, it has now been decided that a uniform method shall be used by all mutual funds to calculate the sale and repurchase price. It must be clarified in the offer documents that the loads shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be added to NAV to calculate sale price and will be subtracted from NAV to calculate repurchase price. In other words the following formulae shall be used:

./circulars/1300874255863.txt:  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA  Mittal Court, B Wing, First Floor, 224, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021MFD/CIR No.4/216/2001May 08, 2001  All Mutual Funds registered with SEBI / Unit Trust of India / AMFI Dear Sirs, Re: Investment/Trading in Securities by Employees of Asset Management Companies and Mutual Fund Trustee Companies. Sub-regulation (9) of Regulation 25 of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 stipulates that the asset management company (AMC) shall file with the trustees the details of transactions in securities by the key personnel of the asset management company. Also, clause (b) of Regulation 23 requires the trustees to furnish to SEBI a certificate stating that they have satisfied themselves that there have been no instances of self dealing or front running by any of the trustees, directors and key personnel of the asset management company. There is a need to lay down the procedures and code of conduct for such transactions so that there is no conflict of interest between the transactions of employees and the mutual fund and interests of unitholders are not affected adversely. Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) and the SEBI Advisory Committee on Mutual Funds made certain recommendations on investment/trading in securities by employees of Asset Management Companies and Mutual Fund Trustee Companies. After examining these recommendations, it has been decided that all mutual funds should take steps to implement the guidelines as enclosed herewith. These guidelines specify the minimum requirements that have to be followed. The asset management companies and mutual fund trustee companies have the option to set more stringent norms for investment/trading in securities by their employees. These guidelines are being issued in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 77 of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. All mutual funds shall report Implementation of the guidelines to SEBI by May 22, 2001. Further, the boards of AMCs and trustee companies shall ensure the compliance of the guidelines on a continuous basis and shall report any violations and remedial action taken by them in the periodical reports submitted to SEBI.   Yours faithfully,   P.K. Nagpal GENERAL MANAGER MUTUAL FUNDS DEPARTMENT   Encl.: As above. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA MUTUAL FUNDS DEPARTMENTGuidelines for Investment/Trading in Securities by Employees of Asset ManagementCompanies and Mutual Fund Trustee Companies Applicability These guidelines shall be applicable to all employees of Asset Management Companies (AMCs) and Mutual Fund Trustee Companies (TCs) and should form a part of the code of conduct for employees adopted by each AMC/TC. The objectives and principles of these Guidelines are: 1.To ensure that all personal securities transactions are conducted consistent with these guidelines and in such manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse of an individual’s position of trust and responsibility.  2.The employees of AMCs and TCs especially access persons should not take undue advantage of any price-sensitive information that they may have about any company. Access Person for the purpose of these guidelines would mean the Head of the AMC (designated as CEO/Managing Director/President or by any other name), the Fund Managers, Dealers, Research Analysts, all employees in the Fund Operations Department, Compliance Officer and Heads of all divisions/departments or any other employee as decided by the AMC/TC. 3.To guide employees of AMCs and TCs in maintaining a high standard of probity that one would expect from an employee in a position of responsibility. GENERAL 1.0. Employees Covered : The Guidelines shall cover all employees of AMCs and TCs and shall be implemented with immediate effect. New employees shall be bound by these Guidelines from the date of joining the AMC/TC.1.1. Investments Covered : These Guidelines cover transactions for purchase or sale of any securities such as shares, debentures, bonds, warrants, derivatives and units of mutual fund schemes. These Guidelines do not apply to the following investments by the employees:i.Investments in fixed deposits with banks/financial institutions/companies, life insurance policies, provident funds (including public provident fund) or investment in savings schemes such as National Savings Certificates, National Savings Schemes, Kisan Vikas Patra, or any other similar investment. ii.investments of a non-financial nature such as gold, real estate etc, where there is no likely conflict between the Mutual Fund’s interest and the employees’ interest. iii.investments in government securities, money market instruments and money market mutual fund schemes. 1.2. Type of Holdings : These Guidelines cover transactions for sale or purchase of securities made in the employees’ name, either individually or jointly, and in the name of the employees’ spouse and/or dependent children and transactions as a member of HUF. Further, no employee shall pass on information to anybody inducing him to buy/sell securities which are being bought/sold by the Mutual Fund of which the AMC is the investment manager. Investments in securities shall broadly be classified into investments through (a) primary markets and (b) secondary markets.1.3. Prior approval of personal investment transactions: All access persons except Compliance Officer must apply in the form prescribed by the AMC/TC to the Compliance Officer of the AMC for prior approval of transactions for sale or purchase of securities other than those expressly stated to be exempt under these guidelines. The Compliance Officer must apply to the Head of the AMC. The decision of the Compliance Officer shall be final and shall be binding on the employee. In these guidelines, in the case of the Compliance Officer’s own transactions for purchase or sale of securities or disclosure or any other related matter, the term "Compliance Officer" wherever it appears, should be read as "Head of the AMC." The Compliance Officer may coordinate with the Fund Management Department of the Mutual Fund, wherever necessary, for the purpose of clearing requests of investment/trading in securities by the employees.4.The approval of Compliance Officer for carrying out a transaction of sale or purchase of a security by the access person shall be valid for not more than 10 calendar days from the date of approval. 1.5. If a transaction approved by Compliance Officer has not been effected within the period not exceeding 10 calendar days from the date of its approval, the access person shall be required to obtain prior approval once again from Compliance Officer for effecting the transaction.6.All employees should refrain from profiting from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of any security within a period of 60 calendar days from the date of their personal transaction. However, in cases where it is done, the employee shall provide a suitable explanation to the Compliance Officer, which shall be reported to the Board of AMC/TC at the time of review. INVESTMENTS IN SHARES / DEBENTURES / BONDS / WARRANTS/DERIVATIVES 2.1. Investments through the primary markets 2.1.1. An employee including access person is permitted to apply to a public issue of shares / debentures / bonds / warrants of any company, so long as the application is made in the normal course of the public issue. Such an application may be made without seeking the clearance from the Compliance Officer. Employees of AMCs and TCs are prohibited from applying in any reserved quota such as promoters’ quota, employees’ quota etc. Employees shall not participate in any private placement of equity by any Company. 2.1.2. Notwithstanding what is stated in 2.1.1. above, an employee of an AMC/TC may apply for shares / debentures / bonds / warrants in a preferential offer, in cases where such a preferential offer is being made by a company that belongs to the same industrial group as that of one in which the employee already has an investment, provided that such a preferential offer is made to all shareholders/debentureholders of such companies. Details of such applications made should be intimated to the Compliance Officer. 2.1.3. The employees of the AMCs/TCs including access person may apply for any rights offer of any company in which they are already shareholders. Applications for additional rights (over and above the normal rights entitlement) shares may be made by the employees including access person without getting the clearance from the Compliance Officer. An employee including access person may also sell/renounce his rights entitlement without getting the clearance from the Compliance Officer. However, if an access person wishes to purchase the "rights renunciations", he should get the clearance of the Compliance Officer for doing the same. Such purchases of rights renunciations should be done only at market prices. Details of any applications made in any rights issue, whether in the normal course, or through purchase of rights renunciations, shall be intimated to the Compliance Officer.  2.2. Investments through the secondary markets 2.2.1. An access person who wishes to make a secondary market transaction shall submit a written application to that effect to the Compliance Officer. Such an application shall specify the name of the company whose securities the employee wishes to buy/sell, type of security, and the number of shares/debentures/bonds/warrants/derivatives that the access person wishes to buy/sell. 2.2.2. The Compliance Officer shall clear these requests if the following conditions are met: (i) if the shares/debentures/bonds/warrants of the company or derivatives specified by the access person are not held by any Scheme of the Mutual Fund of which the AMC is the investment manager; (ii)if such shares/debentures/bonds/warrants of the company or derivatives specified by the employee are held by any Scheme of the Mutual Fund of which the AMC is the investment manager, there should be a "cooling off" period of 15 calendar days. The compliance officer shall ensure that the last transaction in that particular security was done by the Mutual Fund at least 15 calendar days prior to the date of the written application by the access person. In other words, an application for a purchase / sale transaction on a personal basis would be cleared only if the Mutual Fund has not transacted in that particular security for at least 15 calendar days.  The Compliance Officer will keep a track of the transactions of the employees and transactions of the Mutual Fund so as to ensure that there is no conflict of interest - whether the Mutual Fund has transacted the same securities either before or after the employee’s transactions. 3.The Compliance Officer shall maintain a record of all requests for pre-clearance regarding the purchase or sale of a security, including the date of the request, the name of the access person, the details of the proposed transaction and whether the request was approved or denied and waivers given, if any, and its reasons. 2.2.4. No employee shall purchase any security (including derivatives) on a "carry forward" basis or indulge in "short sale" of any security (including derivatives).5.Employees who effect any purchase transactions shall ensure that they take delivery of the securities purchased, before selling them. 6.Any transaction of front running by any employee directly or indirectly is strictly prohibited. For this purpose, ‘front running’ means any transaction of purchase /sale of a security carried by any employee whether for self or for any other person, knowing fully well that the AMC also intends to purchase/sell the same security for its mutual fund operations. For the purpose of ascertaining that the employee had no prior knowledge of the Mutual Fund's intended transactions, the Compliance Officer may take a declaration in this regard from the employee. Such declaration may be included in the application form itself. 7.Any transaction of self-dealing by any employee either directly or indirectly, whether alone or in concert with another person is prohibited. For this purpose, ‘self dealing’ means trading in the securities based on information which is price sensitive in nature and to which he has access by virtue of his office. Declaration to this effect may be taken from the employee while clearing the proposals for investment. 2.2.8. On no account shall the employees insist or even suggest to the brokers concerned to charge reduced brokerage, or accept any contract with a reduced brokerage charge.INVESTMENTS IN UNITS OF MUTUAL FUND SCHEMES 3.Access persons as well as other employees do not require prior permission of the Compliance Officer for purchase or sale of units of mutual fund schemes. However, details of each such transaction, excluding transactions in money market mutual fund schemes shall be reported by them to the Compliance Officer within 7 calendar days from the date of transaction. 3.1. In case of investments in the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of any scheme of any mutual fund, the employees may report only at the time of first installment of the SIP.3.2. Notwithstanding anything mentioned earlier, employees shall not purchase or sell/tender for repurchase/redemption units of any scheme, including money market mutual fund scheme of the Mutual Fund of which the AMC is the investment manager or of which TC is the Trustee in the following cases: (a) there is a likelihood of a change in the investment objectives of the Fund concerned and this has not been communicated to the investors; (b) there is a likelihood of a rights/bonus issue in the Fund concerned, and this has not been communicated to the investors; (c) the Fund concerned is contemplating to issue dividend to the unitholders and this has not been communicated to Page 7 of 8the investors; (d) there is a likelihood of a change in the accounting policy, or a significant change in the valuation of any asset, or class of assets, and the same has not been communicated to the investors; (e) there is a likelihood of conversion of a close ended scheme to an open ended scheme and vice versa and this has not been communicated to the investors.PERIODIC DISCLOSURES 4.0. All access persons shall submit in the form prescribed by the Mutual Fund of which the AMC is the investment manager, details of their personal transactions of purchase or sale of securities to the Compliance Officer. These details shall be submitted as follows:a.details of transactions effected for purchase/sale of securities including transactions in rights entitlements through the secondary market within 7 calendar days from the date of transaction; b.details of allotment received against application for public and rights issues within 7 calendar days from the date of receipt of the allotment advice; c.a statement of holding in securities as on March 31 within 30 calendar days from the end of every financial year ending March 31. 1.All employees other than access persons shall submit in the form prescribed by the Mutual Fund, to the Compliance Officer: a.The details of each of their transactions for purchase or sale of securities including allotment in public and rights issues within 7 calendar days. b.a statement of holding in securities as on March 31 within 30 calendar days from the end of every financial year ending March 31.

The Board approved certain amendments to the said Guidelines. Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines. Therefore, pre- issue share capital of an unlisted company held by Venture Capital Funds and Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board shall not be subject to lock in as per the Guidelines. However, the provisions of the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 and the SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors), Regulations 2000 and any amendment thereto, in this regard, shall be applicable. Section C : This section lays down the revised requirements for filing the post issue monitoring reports with the Board for both book built portion and fixed price portion. Section D : Clause (b) to sub-rule (2) of Rule 19 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 has been amended vide Government notification no. G.S.R. 415(E) dated June 7, 2001, providing for public offer of atleast 10% instead of 25% subject to certain conditions. Hence clause 8.3.4 granting sector wise exemption stands deleted. Further, unlisted companies which have allotted shares to holders of securities in a listed company pursuant to a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation sanctioned by the appropriate High Court, have been approaching the Board for seeking exemption from making a public offer for listing their shares. Exemptions, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions are already being granted by way of communication to the Stock Exchanges. For the sake of greater transparency, the requirements in this regard are stated in this section. Section E The requirements related to issue of research reports by an issuer company in respect of public issues and rights issues have been laid down. Section F : The restriction of a minimum public issue size of Rs 25 crore in case of an Initial Public Offer through the book building route has been removed. It is again clarified that in terms of clause 11.3.5 (iv) of the Guidelines, for the under-subscribed portion of the fixed price portion in a book building issue, the issuer company has the option to allocate it to any category as it deems fit. Alternately, the issuer company has the option to let the under-subscribed portion lapse.

The recommendations of the Committee were considered by the SEBI Board in its meeting held on December 22, 2000. The Board approved the requirement of quantitative continuous listing conditions as a measure of investor protection as it would ensure availability of floating stock on a continuous basis. It was also decided to delete the requirement of minimum number of shareholders in proportion to capital offered. Accordingly, the stock exchanges are directed to amend their Listing Agreement as under 1.The existing clause 40A shall be substituted by following –  "40A – Conditions for continued listing (i) The company agrees that in the event of the application for listing being granted by the Exchange, the company shall maintain on a continuous basis, the minimum level of non-promoter holding at the level of public shareholding as required at the time of listing.ii.Where the non-promoter holding of an existing listed company as on April 01, 2001 is less than the limit of public shareholding as required at the time of initial listing, the company shall within one year raise the level of non-promoter holding to at least 10%. In case the company fails to do so, it shall buy back the public share holding in the manner provided in the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations 1997. iii.The company agrees that it shall not make preferential allotment or an offer to buy back its securities, if such allotment or offer result in reducing the non-promoter holding below the limit of public shareholding specified under the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, as applicable at the time of initial listing or the limit specified in sub-clause (ii) for the existing listed company, as the case may be. iv.The conditions stipulated in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply to the companies referred to BIFR. (v) The company agrees that the following shall also be the condition for continued listing.a.When any person acquires or agrees to acquire 5% or more of the voting rights of any securities, the acquirer and the company shall comply with the relevant provisions of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997. b.When any person acquires or agrees to acquire any securities exceeding 15% of the voting rights in any company or if any person who holds securities which in aggregate carries less than 15% of the voting rights of the company and seeks to acquire the securities exceeding 15% of the voting rights, such person shall not acquire any securities exceeding 15% of the voting rights of the company without complying with the relevant provisions of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997." 2.SEBI vide its circular No. SMD/RCG/JJ/1819/96 dated May 15, 1996 and circular No. SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-30/98 dated October 16, 1998 had introduced the requirement of at least 5 public shareholders for every Rs. 1 lakh capital issued. This requirement is being withdrawn. You are advised to modify the listing agreement as above and monitor the level of non promoter holding on a half yearly basis from the returns submitted by the companies in specified formats.   Yours faithfully,     P K BINDLISH Deputy General Manager Secondary Market, Depository Research & Publications Dept.

In certain cases, interpretational issues have arisen as to the scope of the term ‘shares’ occurring in the above clause, that is whether the term refers to the shares of a venture capital undertaking in which the VCF/FVCI had initially invested (and which subsequently gets listed) or to the shares of any other listed company.
./circulars/d1499d7891359c6bd96e29f4e00eb0d9.txt:4. The purpose behind providing exemption under regulation 3(1)(ia) was to facilitate disinvestment by venture capital fund or foreign venture capital investors of shares held by them in a venture capital undertaking in favour of the promoter of such venture capital undertaking. However, the wordings in the definitions of ‘venture capital undertaking’ found in regulation 2(m) of the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 and regulation 2(n) of the SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) Regulations, 2000 excluded companies whose securities are listed in recognised stock exchanges in India and thereby caused confusion. 
./circulars/d1499d7891359c6bd96e29f4e00eb0d9.txt-5. On examination of the issue and in light of the underlying purpose of regulation 3(1)(ia) of the Takeovers Regulations, it is clarified that the expression ‘venture capital undertaking’ referred to in regulation 3(1)(ia) is not restricted by the aforesaid definitions in the VCF and FVCI Regulations in so far as they require that the shares of VCU should not be listed. It is further clarified that the transfer of shares referred to in regulation 3(1)(ia) is a transfer of the shares of an unlisted venture capital undertaking held by a VCF or FVCI, which subsequently got listed, in favour of the promoter of the Venture Capital Undertaking pursuant to an agreement between them. Any transfer by a VCF or FVCI to a promoter of a venture capital undertaking of shares of some other listed company will not be entitled to exemption under regulation 3(1)(ia). This exemption is also not intended to cover transfer of shares of an unlisted venture capital undertaking by a VCF or FVCI to its promoters, as it is anyway exempted under regulation 3(1)(k).
./circulars/d1499d7891359c6bd96e29f4e00eb0d9.txt:6. This circular is issued under regulation 5 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 to remove difficulties in the interpretation of regulation 3(1)(ia) of the said regulations.

./circulars/1300876271269.txt:  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA  Mittal Court, B Wing, First Floor, 224, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021MFD/CIR/14 /088 / 2001March 28, 2001All Mutual Funds Registered with SEBI/ Unit Trust of India Dear Sirs, As you are aware, SEBI issued guidelines for the valuation of securities and identification and provisioning for non-performing assets (debt securities) vide circular no MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 dated September 18, 2000. Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has made a representation for certain modification in the guidelines. After examining the matter, the following modifications have been made in the guidelines issued vide aforesaid circular:     Guidelines For Valuation of Securities1.Thinly Traded Equity / Equity Related Securities     The definition for Thinly Traded Equity / Equity Related Securities given in Section 2(i) of the Guidelines (Pg. 1) shall be replaced by the following definition: "When trading in an equity/equity related security (such as convertible debentures, equity warrants, etc.) in a month is both less than Rs. 5 lacs and the total volume is less than 50,000 shares, it shall be considered as a thinly traded security and valued accordingly". For example, if the volume of trade is 100,000 and value is Rs. 400,000, the share does not qualify as thinly traded. Also if the volume traded is 40,000, but the value of trades is Rs. 600,000, the share does not qualify as thinly traded. Further it is clarified that in order to determine whether a security is thinly traded or not, the volumes traded in all recognised stock exchanges in India may be taken into account. 2.Thinly Traded Debt Security     The definition for Thinly Traded Debt Security given in first paragraph of Section 2(ii) of the Guidelines (Pg. 1) shall be replaced by the following definition : "A debt security (other than Government Securities) that has a trading volume of less than Rs. 15 crores for a period of thirty days prior to the valuation date shall be considered as a thinly traded security based upon information provided by the stock exchanges on the volume of trading of debt securities". In order to determine whether a security is thinly traded or not the volumes traded in all recognised stock exchanges in India may be taken into account.       3.Non-Traded / Thinly Traded Equity/ Equity Related Securities      For the sake of clarification, in sub-clause(g) of clause (i) of the Guidelines (Pg. 2), the following sentence is now added, " To determine if a security accounts for more than 5% of the total assets of the scheme, it should be valued by the procedure above and the proportion which it bears to the total net assets of the scheme to which it belongs would be compared on the date of valuation".     4.Non Traded / Thinly Traded Debt Securities of upto 182 days to maturity     The valuation model given in clause (ii)(a) of the Guidelines (Pg. 2) shall be substituted by the following : "As the money market securities are valued on the basis of amortization (cost plus accrued interest till the beginning of the day plus the difference between the redemption value and the cost spread uniformly over the remaining maturity period of the instruments) a similar process should be adopted for non-traded debt securities with residual maturity of upto 182 days, in the absence of any other standard benchmarks in the market. Debt securities purchased with residual maturity of upto 182 days are to be valued at cost (including accrued interest till the beginning of the day) plus the difference between the redemption value (inclusive of interest) and cost spread uniformly over the remaining maturity period of the instrument. In case of a debt security with maturity greater than 182 days at the time of purchase, the last valuation price plus accrued interest should be used     instead of purchase cost. All other non traded Non Government debt instruments shall be valued using the method suggested in (ii)(b) hereof". 5.Government Securities The valuation method given in clause (ii)(c) of the Guidelines (Pg. 6) pertaining to valuation of government securities not traded for more than 30 days or one which would qualify as a thinly traded security is now deleted. Such securities shall be valued at yield to maturity based on the prevailing market rate, in accordance with item (cc) of Clause 2 of the Eighth Schedule of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.      Guidelines For Identification and Provisioning For Non Performing Assets (Debt Securities)For Mutual Funds)     Reclassification of assets In sub-clause(4)of clause (E) of the Guidelines (Pg. 3), it is clarified that the words "2nd quarter" wherever appear, shall mean 2nd calendar quarter.   These guidelines effective immediately are being issued in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.   Yours faithfully,     P.

The Exchanges also forward the correspondences of the Brokers / Sub-brokers or correspond on behalf of Brokers / Sub-brokers without quoting the SEBI Registration Number of the concerned Broker / Sub-broker. As a result, it becomes difficult to file the correspondences in the right file and process them. It is also observed that the demand drafts forwarded by Brokers/ Sub-brokers towards payment of fees under the SEBI (Stock brokers and Sub brokers) Regulations, 1992 either directly or through the concerned stock exchange do not provide important details required for expeditiously crediting the drafts  to the account of the concerned Broker / Sub-broker.

./circulars/1300878103381.txt:     Circular No. FITTC/CUST/11/2001May 18, 2001To All Custodians of Securities   Dear Sir / Madam, Sub: Activities of Custodians of SecuritiesIn order to ensure efficient custodial operations and to facilitate offsite supervision the following decisions have been taken: A. Review of Custodial operations Regulation 14 of SEBI (Custodian of Securities) Regulations, 1996 stipulates an annual review of the systems, procedures & controls of the custodian by an expert. This review covers the systems and procedures being followed by the custodian to meet its obligations towards its clients, regulators and other relevant bodies. A copy of the review report is required to be filed with SEBI. It has been decided that henceforth the report for a particular calendar year would be filed by 31st March of the following year along with ‘Action Taken Report’, if any.  Further, it is reiterated that this review report should also cover the aspect of reporting of FII transactions to SEBI and RBI as stipulated vide Regulation 16 of the SEBI (FII) Regulations, 1995. B.Monthly market value of investments With a view to have a more realistic assessment of the institutional investments it is proposed that custodians should provide the market value of the securities held in custody with them on a monthly basis. The market value on the last day of each month may be submitted in the enclosed format (Annexure A). This format may be submitted by the seventh day of the following month. The value of securities as on April 30, 2001 may be submitted by May 25, 2001.   C.Discontinuation of reporting of FII investment data in dBase Currently the custodians are reporting the FII equity and debt investment figures in dBase and text formats. It has been decided that the equity trade reports in dBase format be discontinued from May 21, 2001. Thereafter, the custodians may report the figures only in text mode. Debt reporting would however continue in the dBase format.   D.Reporting of Trades There are occasions when SEBI is closed on account of holiday, but the exchanges being a nationwide trading network are open for trading. For such occasions, custodians are requested to submit separate reports - one would be the normal report and the other for the holiday. Care must be taken not to submit a consolidated report, but different reports with proper reporting dates. E. Submission of company information for unlisted securities. The SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 permit FIIs to invest in unlisted securities. Currently the custodians are reporting trades for unlisted securities under 'no ISIN' or custodian generated codes. With a view to have a proper scrip identification, it would be necessary to have ISINs for such securities also. To generate ISINs, information in the enclosed format (Annexure B) is required to be submitted to SEBI. Information on scrips where investment has already been made in the past should be submitted within 10 days of issue of this circular. Information with respect to new unlisted scrips should be submitted within 10 days from the date of reporting of the transaction. A copy of this circular is also available on our web page ‘Foreign Institutional Investors’ at our web site: www.sebi.gov.in. Yours faithfully,   P.

./circulars/01c50b5ad2d4c32158ebef98c62fd54a.txt-I am directed to inform you that all the Stock Brokers in your Exchange may be asked to calculate the fees payable by them on the basis indicated by the Expert Committee and pay the fees in addition to payment already made, if any for the year 1992-93 to SEBI before February 15, 1993. The Brokers would have to give the break-up of turn-over indicating the basis of calculation. To the extent that such turn-over forms part of the transactions reported to the Stock Exchange, the turn-over would have to be verified by the Stock Exchanges. The member broker would be responsible for reporting the correct turn-over for transactions not reported to the Stock Exchange. I draw your attention to the provisions of Rule 4 & Regulation 10 of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Rules & Regulations, 1992, under which a broker is liable to be penalised for non-payment of registration fees.

A Registrar to an Issue who; despite the receipt of three warning letters or penalty point advices, does not show improvement or fails to make up the deficiencies, may be subjected to action for default in terms of Regulation 22 or 23 as the case may be.5.Memorandum of Understanding: (Valid Agreement)In terms of Rule 4(b), before taking up any assignment to act as RTI, every RTI must invariably enter into a valid agreement with the company making the issue (issuer) clearly setting out their mutual rights, liabilities and obligations relating to the issue and more specifically, the inter-se responsibilities for redressal of investor grievances after the closure of the Issue. SEBI shall endeavour to provide a draft of the Agreement in due course. The RTI may adapt the draft and incorporate such clauses as may be considered necessary for defining his rights and obligations vis-a-vis the issuer. While doing so, it must, be ensured that neither party should reserve for itself any .rights, which would have the effect of diminishing in any way its liabilities and obligations under the Companies Act, 1956 and SEBI (RTI and STA) Rules and Regulations,1993. The Registrars should ensure that such an agreement provides for retention of issue records atleast for a period of six months from the last date of despatch of letters of allotment / share certificates/refund orders to enable the investors to approach the Registrar for redressal of their complaints.  : : 3 : :C. STOCKINVEST In November 1992, SEBI had issued a circular to the Registrars to Issue outlining the procedure to be followed by them while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest. Subsequent to the issue of the said circular, there have been certain modifications to the stockinvest scheme. Accordingly, the revised outline of the procedure to be followed while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest is given in Annexure A. D. BULK MAILING OF REGISTERED LETTERS, ARTICLES ETC.: RTIs are aware that all share/debenture certificates refund orders, interest/dividend warrants etc. are required to be sent by Registered Post. In order to mitigate the problems faced by all parties concerned and evolve a time saving facility for bulk mailing of these articles, SEBI had arranged a meeting of the Registrars to the Issue based in Bombay with the Controller (Mail Planning and Operations) of the Bombay G.P.O. in October 1991, when the Controller explained the procedure for bulk mailing of Registered articles. The procedure as explained by him is set out below for the benefit of all Registrars. 1. The Registrars to the Issues should tender bulk registered mail to the 2.The registration number contained in the certificate of registration should be quoted in all the correspondence with SEBI, Government authorities, Stock Exchanges and its clients..2/-designated post offices. 2. The department (i.e. the Office of the Chief Postmaster General) will grant permission for computerised Registered Journals by the parties concerned with a separate code for each mailer and a separate pre-fix for each issue/company.3. The Registrars to the Issue should prepare PIN code number wise list and accordingly club articles to be mailed (this is already being done in case of mail posted by certain Consultancy Services). 4. In case of very large bulk registered mailers, facility of accepting, sorting and bagging at their premises will be arranged by postal authorities. The department will also arrange to provide for necessary manpower, canvas bags, stamps, seals etc. The mailer will provide for transport for taking the bags to the Railway Station/Airport. 5. The Registrars to the Issue should intimate their bulk mailing programme to the designated post offices or mailing centres at least a .week or 10 days in advance and obtain necessary permission for the same. These post offices of bulk mailing centres will also act as nodal agencies for bulk booking as also for providing related assistance of manpower, etc. RTIs may note that for the purpose of ensuring despatch of refund orders etc. by Registered Post only, issuers are made to declare in the prospectus that adequate funds will be made available to the Registrars for the purpose. RTIs shall therefore ensure mailing of articles by Registered Post as per the extant Postal Rules. :: 4 ::E. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS1.The Registrars should take proper care and evolve a suitable system whereby multiple applications can be weeded out and eliminated.2.Instances of multiple applications should be brought to the notice of the Companies (Issuers) as also the lead managers for necessary action. 3.Registrars shall ascertain from bank schedules whether each application form was accompanied by a separate cheque as required in terms of instructions printed on the reverse of application forms. In case a bunch of applications have been submitted with a single cheque, such fact should also be brought to the notice of the lead manager for appropriate action.4.In order to prevent fraudulent encashment of refund orders by third parties, the applicant is now being given an opportunity to provide information in the relative application form as to his savings bank/ current account number and name of the bank with whom such account is held. For the purpose, the application form shall contain suitable provision. The Registrars to the issue shall note to capture these details while processing the application forms and incorporate the same in the refund order.5.With the introduction of collection agents for collection of applications and with the reduction in the number of mandatory collection centres from 57 to 30, It has been provided that - .a) applications accompanied by stockinvest received by collection agents shall be sent directly to the registrars to the issue along with the schedules within one week from the date of closure of the Issue ; b) investors from places other than those where the mandatory centres and ,authorised collection centres are located, can forward their applications along with stockinvests directly to the Registrars to the Issue by Registered Post with acknowledgement due. The Registrars shall note to maintain proper records of all applications received through post by them.  F. BASIS OF ALLOTMENT IN CASE OF OVERSUBSCRIPTIONWherever the prospectus provides for basis of allotment to be decided on a proportionate basis, the Registrars shall follow the procedure as given in Annexure B for deciding the basis, of allotment.Please acknowledge receipt of this circular.Yours faithfully,Sd/- V.H..PANDYASR.EXECUTIVE DIRECTOREncl: as above.ANNEXURE "A"Procedure for handling of applications accompanied by stockinvest 1. Registrars shall receive applications for subscription to shares, debentures etc. accompanied by stockinvest alongwith separate schedules from the controlling branches of bankers to the issues, authorised collection agents wherever provided and directly from investors residing in places other than 30 mandatory centres. 2. Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

Registrars may ensure that the stockinvests are used by the purchaser(s) within 10 days of issue.. (For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvests are drawn in the name of the issuer company only. 14. Registrars shall regularly maintain a proper record of applications received with stockinvests, giving, inter-alia, the name of the investor, station code, number and value of stockinvest attached, utilised and returned to enable the Registrars to reply to the Investors' queries promptly. The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.

./circulars/1300791340291.txt:    DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER SECONDARY MARKET DEPARTMENT E-mail : mdrao@sebi.gov.in SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-52/2001December 20, 2001The Executive Directors/Managing Directors of all the Stock Exchanges Dear Sir, Sub: Committee on Model Rule and Bye-laws of Stock Exchanges. The Committee constituted by SEBI for examining the existing Articles and Memorandum of Association, Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of Stock Exchanges and framing a uniform set of Rules and Bye-laws to be followed by all the stock exchanges of the country has submitted its report and the Model Rules for Stock Exchanges.  Some of the Model Rules have already been implemented by the Stock Exchanges through SEBI Circulars and directives. For some rules suitable provisions already exist in SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 1957 or in the GOI directives/Circulars and SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 etc. Some of the Model Rules are new amongst which some are related to corporatisation of Stock Exchanges and can be implemented only after all exchanges are corporatised. Some of the Rules may not be applicable in the same way for all stock exchanges. Besides, on account of the nature and constitution of stock exchanges, some of the new Model Rules can not be implemented as suggested. The Model Rules have been divided into 4 Parts. Part 'A' given in the Annexure contains rules which have already been implemented under SEBI directives etc. Reference of Model Rules, Subject matter and the  corresponding Circulars issued by SEBI/GOI etc. have been made. It may be seen that while there may be a variation in language in the Model Rules, for most of Rules in Part A, however the basic principle underlying the Model Rules and the relevant SEBI Circular/GOI notification etc. is the same. Such rules have been identified with asterisks in Part A. In respect of Rules No. 5.5 (Compliance Officer), 6.8.1 (Special Authorisation by the Governing Board- Buy back of Membership), 7.20 (Declaration of Defaulter automatically), 7.34 (Apportionment of Consideration Realised/Other Realisation of Receivables) and 8.3.6 (Ethics Committee), SEBI Regulations/Circulars already issued in this regard will prevail. Part 'B' gives reference to the rules in Model Rules and the subject matter, which are to be introduced by the stock exchanges.  Part 'C' gives reference to Model Rules. However introduction of these will have to await corporatisation/demutualisation of the stock exchanges.  Part 'D' gives reference to the Model Rules, which are related to the basic legal structure of the various stock exchanges and may require an amendment to the existing SEBI Act, 1992, SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 1957 and other relevant Rules, Regulations and laws etc. In order to bring about uniformity among stock exchanges and taking into account uniformity already brought about by SEBI through the directives/circulars so far issued to the stock exchanges, you are advised to implement the Rules under Part 'B'. In the case of Rules in Part 'A', the proposed rules may be adopted in case there is a material difference between these rules and the existing similar rules of the exchange. The Model Rules along with the Committee Report are enclosed for adoption after necessary approvals from the General Body/Governing Board of the Exchanges. However if there are any difficulties in implementation of these Rules, such difficulties may be brought to the notice of SEBI. A compliance report in this regard may be submitted to SEBI within 2 months. The Exchanges will be suitably advised for introduction of Rules under Part 'C' and 'D' Yours faithfully,     S.V.

In most of the cases, the same quantity and in few cases substantially the same quantity of the original trade was closed out /reversed during the day at a price which was significantly above or below the price at which the first/original transaction was executed, without significant variations in the traded price of the underlying. The entities /brokers have indulged in non genuine trade transactions to create false and misleading appearance of trading and for booking profit/losses on such transactions. The findings of the preliminary examination brought out prima facie violation of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade practices relating to securities market) Regulations by the client entities and of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub brokers) Rules and Regulations, 1992 by brokers. The findings brought out the need for immediate and appropriate action at this juncture to check such abuses in future and accordingly an ad-interim order has been passed to ensure orderly development of the options market and the directions therein are accordingly based.

SEBI had clarified on December 23, 2008 that no such order or letter has been issued by SEBI to Shri P.S. Saminathan on December 19, 2008. SEBI conducted investigations in the matter of PSTL relating to the forged SEBI letter and possible manipulation in the scrip. Investigations, conducted so far, prima facie reveal that the forgery was done to manipulate the stock price of PSTL and Shri Nirmal N. Kotecha, one of the promoters and the largest shareholder of PSTL, was one of the major beneficiaries of the said manipulation and appeared to have largely masterminded the forgery. Shri Nirmal N. Kotecha was also found to be using large number of front accounts including his related persons/ entities to manipulate the securities market and to route the funds through several layers in order to hide the source and flow of funds, and this prima facie appears to be a money laundering activity. These acts of Shri Nirmal N. Kotecha are detrimental to the interest of genuine investors in the securities market and pose a threat to the efficient functioning of securities market.

The FII Division of SEBI has reviewed the developments and studied the option of permitting hedge funds to operate within the regulatory framework of the SEBI (FII) Regulations, 1995., subject to additional safeguards, if warranted.

For providing such facility AMCs would not be allowed to borrow. Liquidity is to be provided out of the available funds from the scheme and AMCs to put in place a mechanism to meet the liquidity demands. This facility can also be used for investment in mutual funds through tie-ups with Payments Banks provided necessary approvals are taken from RBI. Presently, any scheme providing this facility would reduce the limit to INR 50,000, immediately and other than liquid schemes providing this facility would completely stop this facility within one month from the date of circular.b) Investment of upto INR 50,000 per Mutual Fund per financial year can be made using e-wallets. However, redemptions of such investments can be made only to a bank account of the unit holder. E-wallet issuers must not offer any incentive such as cash back etc., directly or indirectly for investing in mutual fund scheme through them. E-wallet’s balance loaded through cash or debit card or net banking, can only be used for subscription to mutual funds schemes and balance loaded through credit card, cash back, promotional scheme etc. should not be allowed for subscription to MF schemes. Further, this limit of INR 50,000 would be an umbrella limit for investment by an investor through e-wallet and/or cash, per mutual fund per financial year.2. Amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012While presenting the Union Budget for the FY 2016-2017, the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister,  made an announcement for permitting new derivative products in the commodity derivatives market. In pursuance thereof, SEBI vide circular dated September 28, 2016, permitted launch of 'options' in commodity derivatives market. In this regard, to enable the Commodity Derivatives Exchanges to organize trading of ‘options', the Board, after undertaking due public consultation process, has approved a proposal to amend the relevant provisions of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012. Detailed guidelines for trading in 'option' on commodity derivatives exchanges will be issued by SEBI.3. Inclusion of RBI registered systemically important NBFCs in the category of QIBsPresently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI. They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for the FY 2017-18, proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs since it would strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for inclusion of systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI having a net worth of more than Rs. 500 crore in the category of QIBs. As NBFCs are well regulated entities, classifying such NBFCs under the definition of QIBs will give Issuers access to a larger pool of funds.4. Exemption under SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009, relating to preferential allotments, to be extended to Scheduled Banks and Financial InstitutionsPresently, SEBI (ICDR) Regulations prohibit the issuer from making preferential issue to any person who has sold any equity shares of the issuer during the six months preceding the relevant date. It also provides that the entire pre-preferential allotment shareholding of the allottees, if any, shall be locked-in from the relevant date upto a period of six months from the date of trading approval. Mutual Funds and Insurance Companies are, however, exempted from both the said requirements.Recently, many instances have been there where it has been observed that the Banking sector is exposed to the risk of significantly high Non-Performing Assets (NPA) and the Banks have been advised by the Reserve Bank of India to reduce the NPA and to initiate stringent actions to recover the dues from the borrowers. As a result, it is expected that many Banks will go aggressively for recovering their dues and in order to achieve this objective, the Banks may opt for CDR / SDR or bilateral restructuring. In order to carry out actions for recovery from a borrower which may be a listed Company, Banks or Financial Institutions have sold equity shares of the issuer during the preceding six months of the relevant date. Such Banks/Financial Institutions may also be one of the allottees of the specified securities of the company pursuant to CDR approved scheme under preferential issue route. The Board considered and approved the proposal for extending such relaxation to the Scheduled Banks and Public Financial Institutions as is already being extended to Mutual Funds and Insurance Companies.  5.  Strengthening the Monitoring of Utilisation of Issue ProceedsPresently, the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009, require mandatory appointment of ‘Monitoring Agency’ if the issue size of specified securities exceeds Rs. 500 Cr. The purpose for the same is to ensure adequate supervision of the utilization of the funds raised. SEBI Board considered and approved certain proposals to further strengthen the monitoring of issue proceeds raised in IPOs/FPOs/Rights Issues. Key proposals approved by Board are as under:• Mandatory appointment of Monitoring Agency where the issue size (excluding offer for sale component) is more than Rs. 100 crore. • Frequency of submission of Monitoring Agency Report has been enhanced from half-yearly to quarterly.• Introduction of maximum timeline of 45 days for submission of Monitoring Agency Report from the end of the quarter in conjunction with the submission of the quarterly results.• Mandating the disclosure of the Monitoring Agency Report on Company’s website in addition to submitting it to Stock Exchange(s) for wider dissemination.• Introduction of new requirement, i.e., comments of Board of Directors and Management on the findings of Monitoring Agency.6.  Framework for consolidation and re-issuance of debt securities issued under the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 The Board considered and approved the following proposals contained in the agenda for laying down a framework for consolidation and re-issuance of debt securities, one of the ways to increase liquidity in the secondary market.a) Maximum of 12 ISINs maturing per financial year may be allowed for debt securities and within the bucket of these 12 ISINs, the issuer can issue both secured and unsecured Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs)/bonds and no separate category of ISINs may be provided to them. Additionally, the issuer may issue five ISINs per financial year for structured debt instruments of a particular category (say bonds with call option or bonds with both call and put option);b) The above restrictions will not be applicable on debt instruments which are used for raising regulatory capital such as Tier I, Tier II bonds, bonds for affordable housing and the capital gains tax bonds issued under section 54EC of the Income Tax Act, 1961; c) In order to resolve the issue of bunching of liabilities, the issuer can as a one-time exercise make a choice of having bullet maturity payment or the issuer can make staggered payment of the maturity proceeds within that financial year;d) Active consolidation, i.e consolidation, of existing outstanding debt securities may be made recommendatory at present, which may be reviewed at a later stage. Such active consolidation can be done through switches and conversion; and e) There should not be any clause prohibiting consolidation and re-issuance in the Articles of Association of the issuer/company. 7.  Amendment to SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor ) Regulations, 2014 The SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor) Regulations, 2014 shall be amended as follows:a) An express provision shall be inserted in the regulations to prevent Resident Indians/NRIs or the entities which are beneficially owned by Resident Indians/NRIs from subscribing to Offshore Derivative Instruments.8.   Amendments to the SEBI (Debenture Trustee) Regulations, 1993A Consultative Paper was placed on the SEBI website on proposed amendments to SEBI (Debenture Trustee) Regulations, 1993 (DT Regulations) for comments. The Board approved the amendments to the DT Regulations, 1993 after taking into consideration the public comments. The amendments are aimed to achieve the following objectives:I. To streamline the existing provisions in the DT Regulations with the provisions as  mentioned in the Companies Act 2013, Companies (Share Capital and Debentures)  Rules, 2014 and on account of amendment to the other SEBI Regulations. II. To fortify the existing provisions in the DT Regulations to enable the debenture  trustees to perform the task of securing the interest of the investors.9. Integration of broking activities in Equity Markets and Commodity Derivatives Markets under single entityConsequent to merger of FMC with SEBI, commodity derivatives brokers are also being regulated by SEBI. However, as per extant Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957  (SCR Rules) and SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992 (Stock Brokers Regulations), a stock broker / clearing member dealing in commodity derivatives cannot deal in other securities or vice versa, except by setting up of a separate entity. In this regard, the Board approved the proposal to remove this restriction by amending Stock Brokers Regulations and also to recommend to Government of India for amending SCR Rules accordingly.The integration of the stock brokers in equity and commodity derivative markets while having many synergies in terms of trading and settlement mechanism, risk management, redressal of investor grievances, etc. would benefit the investors, brokers, Stock Exchanges and SEBI as the same would help to:• enhance the economic efficiency in terms of meeting the operational as well as compliance obligations at a Member level resulting in ease of doing business • provide for efficient use of capital for the investors • widen the market penetration leading to greater financial inclusion for participants across all market segments.• facilitate effective regulatory oversight by Stock Exchanges and SEBI

Besides the companies themselves have recorded poor or lack lustre financial performance and have not bothered to file up to date financial statements with CSE. Such acts by the brokers pose a serious risk to the stability and settlement system of the stock exchange besides raising the spectre that innocent investors may get drawn by the artificial trading volumes generated by these brokers and may in the process be beguiled into investing in the shares of these fundamentally weak companies at unjustifiable market prices, only to be left adrift.

./press_releases/c084758cd0c29bea13d8e4faa64475bb.txt:The SEBI Board met today and took the following decisions:A. Steps to Re-energise Mutual Fund IndustrySEBI Board took note of the lack of penetration of mutual fund products, inadequate distribution network, need for greater alignment of the interest of various stakeholders, regulation of distributors and issues concerning investor protection, and has approved some immediate steps as given below and has decided to develop a long term policy including financial inclusion and tax issues for mutual funds to deal with the public policy objectives of achieving sustainable growth of the mutual fund industry and mobilisation of household savings for the growth of the economy.I. Increase in penetration of mutual fund products and energising distribution network1. To accord flexibility and bring cost effectiveness, fungibility of Total Expense Ratio (TER) is allowed.2.  To energize the distribution system and to increase the 'feet-on-street' in distribution, it was decided to:i.  Simplify the distributors' registration process and increase base of mutual fund distributors by including postal agents, retired officials from government, banks, retired teachers etc. for distribution of simple products.ii.  Introduce varied levels of certification and registration depending on products & services offered.iii.  Reduce fees for NISM certification and AMFI registration.II. Improve reach of MF products in smaller cities/ towns (beyond top 15 cities)1. To improve the geographical reach of mutual funds and, bring in long term money from smaller towns, AMCs are allowed to charge additional TER (upto 30bps) depending upon the extent of new inflows from locations beyond top 15 cities. AMCs will be able to charge 30 bps if the new inflows from these cities/ towns are minimum 30% of the total inflows. In case of lesser inflows the proportionate amount will be allowed as additional TER.2. Mutual funds shall make complete disclosures in the half yearly report of Trustees to SEBI regarding the actual efforts of the mutual funds to increase penetration and the details of opening of new branches especially beyond top 15 cities.III.    Alignment of interest of investors, distributors and AMCs1.  In order to have greater and more focused investor education, it was decided that the industry should set apart a portion of the asset management fees annually for the investor education campaign.2.  To avoid differential treatment in the same scheme to different classes of investors, it was decided that all new investors will be subjected to single expense structure under a single plan. However, to be fair to direct investors and promote direct investment, it was decided to have a separate plan for direct investments, with a lower expense ratio.3.  Brokerage and transaction cost chargeable to the scheme for execution of trade to be capped to the extent of 12 bps in case of cash market transactions and 5 bps in case of F&O transactions.4.  In order to help enhance the reach of mutual fund products amongst small investors, who may not be tax payers and may not have PAN/bank accounts such as farmers, small traders/businessmen/workers, cash transactions in mutual fund schemes to the extent of Rs. 20,000/- will be allowed subject to compliance with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) requirements as allowed in case of some other financial products.5.  To enable the mutual fund industry to be in line with all other industries where service tax is borne by the end user, it is decided that the service tax payable on investment management fees should be charged to the scheme.6.  It has been decided that for transaction cost of Rs 100/- per transaction of Rs 10,000 and above (or Rs 150/- for first time investor in mutual fund), the option to "opt out" regarding transaction charges shall be on product basis at the discretion of AMC/distributor.IV.  Investor protection – issues of mis-selling and churning1.  In order to encourage long term holding and to reduce churn and align the interests of the AMCs/ distributors with that of the investors, it was decided that (a) the entire exit loads would be credited to the scheme while the AMCs will be able to charge an additional TER to extent of 20 bps. This will not result in any additional cost to the investors. (b) claw back of additional TER (in the case of inflows from cities beyond top 15 cities) would be provided to the extent the investments are redeemed  within a period of 1 year.2.  To tackle the issue of mis-selling, the Board decided as follows:i.  Create a system of identification of actual sales personnel of distributors, ii.  Evolve a system of 'product labeling' iii.  Inclusion of mis-selling as a 'fraudulent and unfair trade practice' in SEBI Regulations.V.  Strengthening regulatory framework for mutual Funds1.  AMCs to make monthly portfolio disclosures on their website.2. In order to provide fair treatment to existing investors of mutual fund schemes, it was decided to harmonize applicability of NAV across various schemes based on the day on which the funds are available for utilization, for an amount equal to or more than Rs. 2 lakhs.3.  Setting up in the near future of a Self-Regulatory Organisation for  regulation of distributors.4.  AMCs to disclose half yearly financial results of mutual funds on their websites and an advertisement in this regard would be published in at least one national and one regional newspaper.5.  Additional disclosures like gross inflows, net inflows, average assets under management, ratio of AUM/ gross inflows distributor wise, by the AMCs.VI.  Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme (RGESS)The Board welcomed the Government's recent announcement of a new scheme called RGESS and decided that SEBI should make a recommendation to the Government suggesting that RGESS may also provide for investments in equity schemes of mutual funds which have  the securities allowed under RGESS as the underlying.VII. Long Term MeasuresThe Board also felt that like other sectors of the economy where long term policies have been developed, there is a  need to develop a policy for mutual funds taking into account its importance in mobilizing domestic savings for the growth of the economy. The policy would include all aspects - including enhancing the reach and promoting financial inclusion, tax treatment, obligation of various stakeholders, etc.  Mutual Fund Advisory Committee of SEBI would recommend long-term policy measures after wider consultation with all the stakeholders in a reasonable time frame. B. Reforms in the Primary MarketSEBI Board undertook a comprehensive review of the extant regulatory framework in the primary market and approved a host of reforms to revitalise the markets, details of which are as under:-I. For enhancing the participation of retail investorsWith a view to increase the reach of IPOs to investors across the country and affording minimum allotment to a larger number of applicants, the following measures have been approved:-1.  To widen the distribution network of IPOs, in addition to the existing channels, the nationwide broker network of stock exchanges at more than 1000 locations will be made available for distributing IPOs in electronic form. Investors can approach any of the brokers in these locations for applying in IPOs, either physically or electronically. The facility of ASBA will also be extended to applicants coming through this mode. Stock exchanges shall provide for download of application forms on their website and shall also facilitate investors to view the status of their applications on their website, similar to secondary market transactions. The brokers uploading the electronic applications form will be adequately compensated by the issuer companies.2.  To further reduce the time taken from issue closure to listing, the reach of ASBA would be enhanced by mandating all ASBA banks to provide the facility in all their branches in a phased manner. Suitable incentive structure to issuers/brokers/banks will be put in place to encourage use of ASBA by retail individual investors.3.  The share allotment system will be modified to ensure that every retail applicant, irrespective of his application size, gets allotted a minimum bid lot, subject to availability of shares in aggregate. The system will satisfy more number of smaller applicants in the oversubscribed issues. The minimum application size for all investors is also being increased to Rs. 10,000-Rs.15,000, as against the existing Rs. 5,000-Rs. 7,000. II.   For facilitating capital raising by issuersIn order to achieve faster completion and simplification of fund raising process, lower the cost of fund-raising, encourage professional/ first generation entrepreneurs, rationalise disclosures in further capital offering documents and enable compliance with minimum public shareholding requirements under SCRR, the following reforms have been approved:-1.  Requirement of average free float market capitalisation reduced from Rs. 5000 Cr. to Rs. 3000 Cr. to facilitate further public offerings (FPOs) and rights issues through fast-track route.2.  To encourage professionals and technically qualified entrepreneurs who are unable to meet the requisite 20% contribution by themselves as promoters will be allowed to meet the same with the contribution of SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds such as SME Funds, Infrastructure Funds, PE funds, VCFs, etc., subject to a cap of 10%. 3.  To facilitate companies to reach minimum public shareholding requirements prescribed under SCRR, additional routes including Rights and Bonus Issue will be permitted. SEBI will also specify other options which may enable (non-compliant) listed entities to reach minimum public shareholding requirements prescribed under SCRR, 1957, subject to appropriate checks and balances.  Further, modifications, if any, as may be necessary, to the existing methods, will also be carried out to make them more operable. 4.  To allow more flexibility to the issuers, changes upto 20% in the amount proposed to be raised as given in the objects of the issue at the RHP stage, as against the existing 10%, will not necessitate re-filing with SEBI. 5.  To facilitate QIPs even in a falling market, issuers will be allowed to offer a maximum discount of 5% to the price calculated as per the SEBI Regulations. 6.  To provide updated information to investors, listed entities shall file a comprehensive annual disclosure statement in addition to the existing requirements on the lines of 20F filing prescribed by the US SEC. Such filings, updated by the prospectus, shall also serve as a reference in the offer documents for further capital offerings. III.  For enhancing market integrity and Investor confidenceTo ensure quality public offerings, instill discipline amongst issuers/market intermediaries, make the issue process more transparent, provide a level playing field for all market participants and enhance investor confidence, the following reforms have been approved:-1.  To improve the quality of public offerings and enhance investor protection, the eligibility criteria for the issuers coming through the “profitability route” is being redesigned. Now, only issuers with a minimum average pre-tax operating profit of Rs. 15 Crore will be able to come through this route. However, other issuers will continue to access the capital market through either the SME platform or  compulsory book building route with increased QIB participation of 75%, as against the existing 50%.2.  In order to protect the interest of investors who may not always be in a position to assess the risks associated with a business model due to complexities involved therein and to ensure that only reasonably credible issuers with adequate disclosures in their offer documents are allowed to access the public issuances route, SEBI will be putting in a place a framework for rejection of draft offer documents.  SEBI will also put in place necessary framework for faster clearances of offer documents. This will help reduce repeated queries and resultant delays in dealing with DRHPs by SEBI.3.  Additional mechanisms for monitoring of issue proceeds will be put in place within the extant legal framework.4.  To avoid any misleading signals to retail investors about the extent of subscription in the issue, no withdrawal or lowering the size of bids shall be permitted for non-retail investors at any stage. 5.  The price band alongwith relevant financial information shall be published atleast 5 working days prior to opening of the issue, as against the current provision of 2 working days in the case of IPOs.  This will provide more time to the market to analyse the issue.6.  To bring more transparency in capital raising, 'General Corporate Purposes' as an object of the issue would not exceed 25% of the issue size. Presently, there is no cap on this item.7.  Listed entities shall frame employee benefit schemes only in accordance with SEBI (ESOS and ESPS) Guidelines, 1999.  Entities whose schemes are not in conformity with the same would be given time to align with the said Guidelines.  Further, such schemes will be restrained from acquiring their shares from the secondary market. C. Regulations on Investment Advisors1.  The Board approved the SEBI (Investment Advisors) Regulations, 2012 (“Investment Advisors Regulations”) thereby providing a framework for registration and regulation of Investment Advisors (“IA”). The Investment Advisors Regulations have been framed based on consultation with RBI, IRDA, PFRDA and comments received from the public on the concept paper disseminated for this purpose. 2.  All individuals, body corporate and partnership firms engaged in the business of providing investment advice to investors for consideration are required to be registered and regulated under these Regulations. Any person who holds himself as an investment advisor shall also fall under the purview of these Regulations. Investment advice given without any consideration through media at large and widely available to the public shall not be considered as investment advice.3.  The banks or body corporates which also offer distribution, execution or referral services will be required to offer investment advisory services through a subsidiary or a Separately Identifiable Department or Division (SIDD). Such a SIDD will be required to be clearly segregated from other activities.4.  Financial Planners will be required to be registered as investment advisors.5.  Only the act of giving advice will be regulated under this regulation, whereas the regulation of selling of products, if any, would be solely under the purview of the product regulators.6.  The investment advisor shall not obtain any remuneration or compensation from any person other than from the client being advised. However, for a bank or body corporate having a distribution, referral or execution business, it would be necessary to keep the investment advisory services segregated from such activities and to make disclosures to the clients being advised about any remuneration or compensation received by it and any of its associates for the distribution, referral or execution services.7.  The investment advisors registered under the regulations shall use the words “investment advisors” in their name.8.  Exemptions have been provided to certain persons from registration under these Regulations, as under:a.   Persons giving general comments in good faith in regard to trends in the financial or securities market or the economic situation provided such comments do not specify any particular securities or investment product.b.  Persons providing advice exclusively in areas like insurance and pension products provided they are regulated by sectoral regulators. c.  Professionals such as lawyers, Chartered Accountants etc., providing advice incidental to their professional services. d.  Stock Brokers, Sub-brokers, Portfolio Managers and Merchant Bankers registered with SEBI providing investment advice incidental to their primary activity. Such intermediaries under SEBI are however required to comply with obligations under these Regulations such as acting in fiduciary responsibility, risk profiling etc. e.  AMFI registered distributors providing investment advice incidental to their primary activity.f.  The Fund Manager of a Mutual Fund or Alternative Investment Fund.9.  The Representatives of body corporate or a bank who provides advice on behalf of a bank or a body corporate need to be qualified and certified.10.  The regulations provide for code of conduct, fiduciary duties, record keeping, risk profiling of the clients and also deal with the issue of suitability and appropriateness of the advice.11.  Requirements relating to experience, qualification, certification and net worth/ net assets have been prescribed for a person to act as an investment advisor. Initially, SEBI will directly register and regulate the Investment Advisors. D. Amendment of SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 20081.  The Board approved the amendments to Schedule I of SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 which lays down the Disclosure Requirement in the offer documents/ memorandum in connection with the Public issue &  listing of non-convertible debt as well as  privately placed debt securities which are listed or sought to be listed, respectively.2.  The amendments have been carried out based on the discussions held with issuers, merchant bankers, rating agencies and law firms. Major amendments are highlighted below: a. Following additional disclosures have to be made:i.     Particulars of trustee, auditor, arrangers, registrar and rating agency
./press_releases/c084758cd0c29bea13d8e4faa64475bb.txt-ii.      Details of changes in capital structure over the last five yearsiii.      Details of corporate guarantee and commercial paper issued, if anyiv.      Details of default and delay in payment on borrowings over the last five yearsv.      Details of whether debt security is backed by guarantee or letter of comfort, where applicablevi.      Copy of consent letter from debenture trusteeFollowing requirements have been standardized:i.          Format for presenting financial information

Restructuring in stressed companies With a view to facilitate turnaround of listed companies in distress which will benefit their shareholders and lenders, the Board has approved the following proposals:  Presently, relaxations from preferential issue requirements under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 and from open offer obligations under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011  are available for lenders undertaking restructuring of listed companies in distress through Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme in terms of the guidelines of RBI. It has been represented to SEBI that where the lenders have acquired shares and propose to divest the same to a new investor, they are facing difficulties as the new investor would need to make a mandatory open offer which would reduce the funds available for investment in the company. Hence, they have requested for exemptions to these investors. Accordingly, it has been decided to extend the aforesaid relaxations to the new investors acquiring shares in distressed companies pursuant to such restructuring schemes. However, such relaxations shall be subject to certain conditions like approval by the shareholders of the companies by special resolution and lock-in of their shareholding for a minimum period of three years. Further, it has also been decided to extend the said relaxations to the lenders under other restructuring schemes undertaken in accordance with guidelines of RBI. 2.    Resolution plans approved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016The Board has also approved the proposal to provide exemption from open offer obligations, under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, for acquisitions pursuant to resolution plans approved by NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. 3. Extension of Lock-in-relaxation to Category II Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)Presently, in case of an IPO, there are relaxed rules for lock-in provision to Category I AIFs. The Board approved the proposal for extending such relaxation to Category II AIFs also. This would bring about uniformity, ease of doing business and expand the investor base available for capital raising.4. Consultation paper on Easing of access norms for investment by FPIs FPI regime, which commenced from June 01, 2014, has been put in place with the objectives to rationalize various foreign portfolio investment routes, simplify the procedures to attract more foreign funds.  SEBI proposes to carry out appropriate amendment (s) to SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 and issue necessary circular/guidelines etc. issued thereunder, to further ease the access norms for investments by FPIs in Indian securities market. Some of the proposed changes are as follows:1. Expansion of eligible jurisdictions for grant of FPI registration to category I FPIs by including countries having diplomatic tie-ups with India.2. Simplification of broad based requirements. 3. Rationalization of fit and proper criteria. 4.

./press_releases/594b4a064d1df19ce6f3126c2debf6a0.txt-In the report, it has been suggested that the SEBI should focus on the strengthening of the supervision of securities market intermediaries including fund managers. One of the challenges faced by the authorities is the sheer number of the intermediaries operating in the securities market. Onsite inspections of brokers are primarily a responsibility of the stock exchanges. The stock exchanges have developed a risk based approach to determine the intensity of the inspections. Theme-based inspections have been carried out by SEBI in respect of market intermediaries, mutual funds, depositories, stock exchanges, etc. 
./press_releases/594b4a064d1df19ce6f3126c2debf6a0.txt:In respect of mutual funds, SEBI has taken several steps to re-energise mutual fund industry to increase product penetration especially in smaller cities/towns, regulation of distributors and issues concerning investor protection, develop a long-term policy for the sustainable growth of the industry and mobilization of household savings for the growth of the economy and increase household savings through mutual funds. The comprehensive guidelines for registration and supervision of mutual funds are issued by SEBI by way of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 and circulars issued there under. The supervision system of mutual funds is a two-tier system, i.e., supervision by trustees on one hand and SEBI on the other hand. Mutual funds are required to periodically report their operations/activities to SEBI and a risk-based approach is followed for periodic inspections.

The Government of India has set up Quality Review Board (QRB) for reviewing the quality of auditors. The Companies Act, 2013 contains provisions for establishment of an independent quasi-judicial agency, the National Financial Reporting Authority, to oversee the functions of Auditors and to ensure scrutiny and compliance with accounting and auditing standards. The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) is an overarching body to oversee the accounting profession. SEBI has set up a Forensic Accounting Cell on February 7, 2012 to improve quality of financial information disclosed and to assist in detection of financial irregularities. To enhance the quality of financial reporting done by listed entities, SEBI has set up a Qualified Audit Report Review Committee (QARC) on which ICAI, Stock Exchanges and others are represented.

Amendments to the SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015In order to augment the governance of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) registered with SEBI and mitigate the issues of conflict of interest, SEBI Board has approved certain changes in the SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, which, inter alia, include the following:I. Enhanced eligibility requirement for CRAs :a. Minimum net worth requirement of a CRA shall be increased from existing Rs. 5 Crores to Rs. 25 Croresb. The promoter of a CRA shall maintain a minimum shareholding of 26% in the CRA for a minimum period of three years from the date of grant of registration by the Board.c. The foreign CRA should be incorporated in a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) member jurisdiction and registered under their law only shall be eligible to promote a CRA in India.II. Restriction on Crossholdings amongst CRAs:a. No CRA registered with SEBI  (CRA) shall: i. directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of shareholding and/ or voting rights in any other CRA andii. have representation on the Board of any other CRA.b. A shareholder holding 10% or more shares and/ or voting rights in a  CRA shall not hold 10% or more shares and/ or voting rights, directly or indirectly, in any other CRA. However, this restriction shall not apply to holdings by pension funds, Insurance schemes, and mutual fund schemes. c. Acquisition of shares and/ or voting rights in a CRA by another CRA beyond 10% shall be permitted only if such acquisition results in change in control with  prior approval of SEBI.III. Withdrawal of ratings by CRAs:a. CRAs shall be permitted to withdraw the ratings subject to the CRA having rated the instrument continuously for a stipulated period and in the manner as may be specified by SEBI from time to time.IV. Segregation of activities other than the rating of financial instruments and economic/ financial research from CRA : CRAs shall segregate their activities other than the rating of financial instruments and economic/ financial research to a separate legal entity.V. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015 shall be amended to include a. disclosure of financial results on the Exchange(s) by issuers of listed debt in line with the corresponding requirements for issuers of listed equityIssuers of listed debt shall disclose on the Exchange(s) within forty – five days of end of the first three quarters and sixty days of end of the last quarter, the below mentioned financial results in the format as prescribed in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (excluding notes and detailed sub-classification): I) Statement of Profit and Loss on a quarterly and year-to-date basis II) Statement of Assets and Liabilities/ Balance Sheet on a half-yearly basisb. Disclosure of annual consolidated financial results to the Exchange(s) in case of issuers having only listed debtI) Issuers of listed debt shall disclose their audited annual consolidated financial results on the Exchange(s) within sixty days from the end of the financial year.2. Additional methods for listed entities to achieve minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirements The Board has decided to introduce two additional methods-Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) and Sale of shares up to 2% held by promoters/promoter group in open market subject to certain conditions for listed companies to comply with the MPS requirement. The Board has approved necessary amendments to SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009.QIP offers a quick solution to listed entities enabling them to meet MPS requirements apart from meeting their funding requirements. Also, sale of a certain small percentage of shares through open market will facilitate quicker and cheaper compliance for listed entities where promoters hold shares marginally above the threshold limit.Rule 19A of the SCRR stipulates that every listed company shall maintain a public shareholding of atleast  25%. Listed public sector companies have been provided additional time till August 21, 2018 to comply with the requirements. Accordingly, listed entities that have a public shareholding of less than 25% are required to adopt any of the certain methods to comply with the MPS requirements, such as Issuance of shares to public through prospectus; Offer for Sale to public through prospectus; Sale of shares held by promoters through secondary market in terms of SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/05/2012 dated February 01, 2012; Institutional Placement Programme; Rights issue to public shareholders; Bonus shares to public shareholders; and any other method as may be approved by SEBI under case to case basis. 3. Issuance of refund orders/allotment letters/share certificates through electronic mode under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements Regulations), 2009As per present requirements, refund orders, allotment letters and share certificates are dispatched by way of registered post or certificate of posting, as may be applicable.As a green initiative, the Board approved the proposal of inclusion of electronic mode as a valid method of communicating the allotment advice/credit of shares/unblocking of funds in addition to the present methods. This would be in tune with the digital initiatives of the Government and would reduce printing costs for the issuer company leading to faster communication and ease of doing business.  4. Norms for Shareholding and Governance in Mutual FundsThe Board after deliberation on the issue of potential conflict in case of sponsor and it’s associates or any shareholder of a Mutual Fund having stake or Board representation in Asset Management Company (AMC) and Trustee Companies of another Mutual Fund, decided the following:I. A sponsor of a mutual fund, its associate and/or its group company, and its AMC through the schemes, or otherwise collectively, may not be allowed to:a. have 10% or more stake in AMCs / Trustee Companies of any other mutual funds.b. have representation on the board of the AMC / Trustee Company of any other mutual funds.II.  Any shareholder holding 10% or more stake in an AMC / Trustee Company of a mutual fund, may not be allowed to:a. have 10% or more stake in AMCs / Trustee Companies of any other mutual funds.b. have representation on the board of the AMC / Trustee Company of any other mutual funds.III. Any existing non-conformity with the aforesaid requirements may be aligned within a reasonable time.5. Proposed framework for listing of Security Receipts issued by ARCs under SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008i. Hon'ble Union Finance Minister in his budget speech of 2017-18 announced that :“Listing  and  trading  of  Security  Receipts  issued  by  a  securitization company  or  a  reconstruction  company  under  the  SARFAESI  Act  will  be permitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance capital flows into  the  securitization  industry  and  will  particularly  be  helpful  to  deal  with bank NPAs.”ii. With respect to the above, SEBI Board approved the framework for listing of Security Receipts (SR's), issued by Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), under SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 (SDI Regulations). iii. A separate chapter detailing the framework for listing of SR's will be added to the SDI Regulations.6. Amendments to the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 and SEBI (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014In order to facilitate growth of Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) and Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs), SEBI Board, has approved certain changes in the captioned regulations, which, inter alia, include the following:i. Allowing REITs to invest at least 50% stake in Holdcos/SPVs and similarly allowing Holdco to invest at least 50% stake in SPVs, subject to certain safeguards including the following: • The existing requirement of REITs to have ultimate holding interest of not less than 26% in the underlying SPV(s), shall remain unchanged.• REIT manager in consultation with the trustee, shall appoint at least such number of directors on the Board of Holdco/SPVs, in proportion to the shareholding/interest in the Holdco and/or SPV• In case of any inconsistencies between any shareholder/partnership agreement and the obligations cast upon REIT in the Regulations, the provisions of the REIT Regulations shall prevailii.

Consultation Paper for "Amendments to the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013"1. In order to specify uniform standards and to address the gaps or overlaps in legal or regulatory standards governing all the intermediaries/persons engaged in providing investment advisory services, SEBI had issued two consultation papers on October 07, 2016 and June 22, 2017 seeking public comments on the clarifications/amendments to SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013.2. Based on the feedback received from the consultation process and the meetings with various stakeholders, it was felt that there is a need to prevent the conflict of interest between advising for investing in financial products and selling of financial products. Considering the same, SEBI Board has approved the consultation paper to  seek public comments on following proposals:i) There should be clear segregation between the two activities of the entity i.e. providing investment advice and distribution of the investment products/ execution of investment transactions.ii) Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs), while distributing their mutual fund products can explain the features of products to client, and shall ensure the principle of ‘appropriateness’ of products to the client. The consultation paper will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.9. Fees Payable by Stock Brokers Trading in "Options" in Commodity DerivativesOn introduction of Options contract in Commodity Derivatives, SEBI Board has decided to amend the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992, such that the manner of calculation of turnover fees for Options contracts in Commodity Derivatives shall be computed the same way as computed for Options contract in Equity Derivatives. 10. Integration of trading in commodity derivatives market with other segments of securities market at exchange levelHon’ble Union Finance Minister, while presenting the Union budget for the FY 2017-2018, proposed that the commodities and securities derivative markets will be further integrated by integrating the participants, brokers, and operational frameworks. For the sake of smoother implementation of the above budget announcement regarding integration between commodity derivatives and rest of the securities markets, it was decided that the integration would be achieved in two phases. In Phase-I, it was proposed to have integration at Intermediary level. In Phase-II, necessary steps would be taken to enable a single exchange to operate various segments such as equity, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, interest rate futures & debt etc.With regards to Phase-I, all necessary steps required to enable integration of commodity derivatives market with rest of the securities markets at intermediary’s level have been taken by SEBI.In order to implement phase II i.e. to permit trading of commodity derivatives and other segments of securities market on single exchange,   the Board approved the proposal to remove the restrictions by making suitable amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporation) Regulations, 2012 (“SECC Regulations”). The amendments to the SECC Regulations would be effective from October 1, 2018.MumbaiDecember 28, 2017

As per Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act, 1992, no person shall sponsor or carry on any Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) operating in the securities market unless he obtains a certificate of registration from SEBI in accordance with the Regulations. Contravention of the provision would amount to an offence punishable u/s 24 of the SEBI Act, 1992 with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both. lThe SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999, had come into force w.e.f. October 15, 1999. The last date to submit an application for grant of registration in terms of the said Regulations had expired on December 14, 1999. The total number of applications received for grant of certificate of registration under the Regulations as on March 13, 2000 is 33. Therefore, having regard to the interest of investors who had invested in the CIS and also requests received from some entities, it has been decided to grant an opportunity to the applicants by extending the last date for filing of an application for registration till March 31, 2000. lAs per the provisions of Regulation 71 an existing collective investment entity can be granted provisional registration subject to, inter-alia, the following conditions:  a.the entity shall get the existing schemes rated by a credit rating agency within one year from the date of grant of provisional registration. b.the entity shall get the existing schemes audited by an auditor within a period of one year from the date of grant of provisional registration. c.the entity shall get the existing schemes appraised by an appraising agency within a period of one year from the date of grant of provisional registration. d.the entity shall create a trust and appoint trustees in the manner specified in Chapter IV of the Regulations within a period of one year from the date of grant of provisional registration. e.the entity shall not dispose of the scheme property except for meeting the obligations arising under the offer document of the scheme. lGrant of provisional registration does not entitle a collective investment entity to launch any new schemes or raise moneys from the investors even under the existing schemes. lOnly those collective investment entities which are granted the certificate of registration (as distinct from provisional registration) by SEBI can launch new schemes or raise moneys from the investors under the existing schemes within the framework of the Regulations. lTill date no entity has been granted registration by SEBI. lIn case an existing collective investment entity does not make an application for grant of registration by March 31, 2000 or is not desirous of obtaining provisional registration from SEBI, it has to compulsorily wind up the existing schemes and make payment to the investors. The last date for making such payment to the investors pursuant to the winding up of schemes is May 28, 2000. lA list of existing collective investment entities which fail to make an application for grant of registration by March 31, 2000 would be issued in due course. Members of the public are hereby cautioned that they should not invest in the collective investment schemes of any entity which has not been granted certificate of registration by SEBI.
