(2) Allowing non-promoter shareholders to offer shares through OFS Non-promoter shareholders having (shareholding) more thatn 10% or such percentage as specified by SEBI from time to time shall be eligible to use OFS. (3)  Expanding the list of eligible companies OFS mechanism shall be made available for shareholders of top 200 companies by market capitalization. V.   Common KYC in Financial Sector The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors. Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the <mark>amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector.

        <td>Creating a core fund (called Core Settlement Guarantee Fund), within the SGF, against which no exposure is given and which is readily and unconditionally available to meet settlement obligations of clearing corporation in case of clearing member(s) failing to honour settlement obligation. Aligning stress testing practices of clearing corporations with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). Capturing in stress testing, the risk due to possible default in institutional trades. Harmonising default waterfalls across clearing corporations. Limiting the liability of non-defaulting members in view of the Basel capital adequacy requirements for exposure towards Central Counterparties (CCPs). Ring-fencing each segment of clearing corporation from defaults in other segments. Bringing in uniformity in the stress testing and the risk management practices of different clearing corporations especially with regard to the default of members. SEBI has from time to time put in place various risk containment measures to address the risks involved in the securities market. One such measure prescribed was norms for Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) at Stock Exchanges including corpus, contribution, management, usage and recoupment of the fund corpus (vide circular no SMD/POLICY/SGF/CIR-13/97). In order to promote and sustain an efficient and robust global financial infrastructure, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) updated the standards applicable for systemically important financial market infrastructures (central counterparties, payment systems, trade repositories and securities settlement systems) with the PFMIs. SEBI as a member of IOSCO is committed to the adoption and implementation of the new CPSS-IOSCO standards of PFMIs. As required under PFMIs, to provide greater legal basis for settlement finality, netting and rights of FMIs over collateral, Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges And Clearing Corporations) (Amendment) Regulations, 2013 were notified on September 02, 2013. Vide circular dated September 04, 2013, SEBI required FMIs under its regulatory purview to comply with the PFMIs applicable to them. These new guidelines will align stress testing practices of clearing corporations with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). The new stress testing norms will also capture the risk posed due to possible default in institutional trades. The stress test, which will be conducted every day, will determine the Minimum Required Corpus (MRC) of Core SGF. This will be a dynamic process which will form the basis for replenishing the Core SGF every month. PFMIs require CCs to maintain sufficient resources to cover losses due to major defaults in the market so as to avoid any systemic risk. While margins of defaulting member/s form primary layer of defence for CC against default of a member, a next layer of defence by way of a dedicated pool of resources is generally maintained by CCs to effect settlement guarantee. The current practice followed by CCs in India for quantifying such resources is to also include margins of all members. As margins are against positions, there are difficulties felt in estimating the correct value of resources readily available to meet settlement shortages in case of default by member/s. The new guidelines will remove these difficulties by creating the Core SGF as a second layer of defence, against which no exposure is allowed and thus will always be available in sufficiently liquid form.  Availability of such a liquid fund will make the whole risk management system much safer as the CCs will have better capability to deal with extreme stress situations where the defaulters' funds are not sufficient to meet their obligations. The new system will substantially reduce the possibility of such stresses leading to systemic risk. Broadly the contribution to Core SGF will be from the following sources: At least 50% of MRC from CC At least 25% of MRC from Stock Exchange (SE) Upto 25% of MRC from clearing members (CMs) Penalties levied by CC will also be credited to Core SGF. As per the present default waterfall of CCs, residual losses after exhausting resources available in other layers of the waterfall are to be allocated to the non-defaulting clearing members. Thus, effectively under such circumstances there is no limit to the liability of non-defaulting members in the event of extreme loss. As per Basel capital adequacy requirements, many members are required to make capital provisions towards counterparty exposure including towards CCPs which becomes difficult to quantify in case of an unlimited liability. The circular has provisions regarding manner for limiting the liability of non-defaulting members. The new guidelines will also harmonise default waterfall across CCs and will adequately ring-fence each segment of CC from defaults in other segments. The default waterfall in case of default in any segment will generally follow the following order - 1- Monies of defaulting member 2- Insurance, if any 3- CC resources (equal to 5% of MRC) 4- Core SGF 5- CC resources 6- CC/Stock Exchange contribution to Core SGFs of other segments 7- Capped contribution of non defaulting members 8- Pro-rata haircut to pay-outs (for details refer to circular) Norms for contribution to Core SGF as well as default waterfall have been specified with a view that all the stakeholders (CC, SE and CMs) are incentivised to adequately monitor the risks brought into the system. Based on deliberations in the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI and further discussions with CCs, SEs and <mark>market participants</mark>, it has been decided to issue these norms related to core settlement guarantee fund, stress testing and default procedures specified in the present Circular which would bring greater clarity and uniformity as well as align the same with international best practices.

However,  other  such participants were of the view that it may not be possible to prepare an exhaustive list of such rights which would address all situations. 10. Further,  control  is  also  defined  under  other  laws  in  India.  Certain  Acts  such  as Companies Act, 2013, Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 and FDI Policy and have a similar definition of control as under Takeover Regulations. The Companies Act, 2013 defines “control” as: “control”  shall  include  the  right  to  appoint  majority  of  the  directors  or  to  control  the management or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or  in  concert,  directly  or  indirectly,  including  by  virtue  of  their  shareholding  or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements or in any other</td>

        <td>Dear Sir / Madam, Sub: Revised Warehousing Norms in the Commodity Derivatives Market for Agricultural and Agri-processed Commodities Traded on the National Commodity Derivatives Exchanges 1.  Warehousing infrastructure and its ancillary services play a  critical role in the delivery mechanism of the Commodity Derivatives Market. A robust & credible warehousing  infrastructure  is  sine  qua  non  for  an  effective  Commodity Derivatives Market that can inspire confidence amongst the <mark>market participants</mark> and  other  stake  holders.  At  the  time  of  the  merger  of  Forward  Market Commission  (FMC)  with  SEBI,  with  a  view  to  ensuring  good  delivery  of commodities  on  expiry  of  the  futures  contract,  SEBI  decided  to  fasten  the responsibility of settlement of the futures contact, including good delivery on the commodity derivatives exchanges. With this objective necessary amendments were  carried  out  by  inserting  Regulation  44D(2)  in  Securities  Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 ("SECC  Regulations"),    by  providing  that  every  commodity  derivatives exchange (in short, exchange) shall ensure guarantee for settlement of trades including good delivery. 2.  It is therefore, incumbent upon the commodity derivatives exchanges to  have in place comprehensive framework of norms for adherence by the Warehouse Service  Providers  (WSP),  warehouse,  assayers  and  other  allied  service providers engaged by them so as to exercise a robust mechanism, for ensuring good delivery as mandated under the SECC Regulations. In order to facilitate good delivery by the commodity derivatives exchanges by providing therein with a  set  of  minimum  standards  and  norms  for  compliance  by  the  accredited warehouses, the existing norms for exchange accredited WSPs, warehouses and assayers have been reviewed.</td>

Investment by Mutual Funds in Hybrid Instruments 1) SEBI Board noted that units of REITs/InvITs are hybrid instruments. However, the features are more like equity securities and the concentration and liquidity risks require to be addressed. 2) In light of the above, the Board decided that the following investment restrictions will be applicable: (i) A Mutual Fund scheme shall not invest more than 5% of its NAV in units of a single issuer of REITs and InvITs. Such limit of 5% shall not be applicable for investments in case of index fund or sector or industry specific scheme pertaining to REITs and InvITs. (ii) A Mutual Fund scheme shall not invest more than 10% of its NAV in units of REITs and InvITs. Such limit of 10% shall not be applicable for investments in case of index fund or sector or industry specific scheme pertaining to REITs and InvITs. (iii) No Mutual Fund under all its schemes should own more than 10% of units issued by a single issuer of REITs and InvITs. 3) Applicability (i) The aforesaid isanvestment restrictions shall be applicable to all fresh investments by all schemes or an existing scheme. (ii) Any existing scheme intending to invest in units of REITs/InvITs shall abide by the provisions of Regulation 18 (15A) of <mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>regulation of Listed Entities 1. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges.

In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI.

Further,  the  definition  of “fugitive economic offender”, “list regulations” and “postal ballot” have been inserted in the regulations, and the word “listing agreement” wherever occurring has been replaced by the word “listing regulations”. Rationale: SEBI had earlier issued a discussion paper  on  March  28,  2018  soliciting  public comments  for  reviewing  the  SEBI  Takeover Regulations.  The  amendments  are  mainly aimed at simplifying the language, removing redundant  provisions  and inconsistencies, updating the references to the Companies Act, 2013  and  other  new  SEBI  Regulations,  and incorporating  the  relevant  circulars,  FAQs, informal guidance in the regulations. 5.
