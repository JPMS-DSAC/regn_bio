        <td>The  Committee  discussed  and  considered  several  issues  which  were  initially raised  before  it  but  it  did  not  restrict  itself  only  to  those  issues.    Other  issues which arose while the deliberations of the Committee were going on were also considered by it. Further, the Committee also had an intensive and wide ranging interaction with a variety of <mark>market participants</mark> such as parties who made hostile bids as also those who responded to such bids, Financial Institutions, Regional Investors Association, etc. to understand their perspective and obtain the benefit of their opinions on the various issues considered by the Committee. The  incredibly  large  variety  of  views  of  number  of  participants  compelled  the Committee  to  extend  its  original  time  schedule.    This,  combined  with  an  ever increasing  number  of  contemporary  issues  raised  in  various  fora  called  for serious consideration and necessarily involved that more time would be required by the Committee for completion of its deliberations and submission of its Report. However, the Committee noted with satisfaction that while its Report was awaited with eagerness, there was a general feeling that it would contribute greatly to the value  of  the  Report  if  all  participants  were  heard  and  the  report  took  into consideration  their  views  and  opinions.    This  would  go  a  long  way  in guaranteeing  that  the  Regulations,  while  having  a  strong  base,  would  also  be inherently flexible so as to be able to meet the challenges thrown up by vibrant pulsating economy and ever changing scenario.  It is with this objective in mind that  the  Committee  has  drafted  this  Report  and  the  amendments  to  the Regulations.</td>

        <td>"This is a key component in devising a regulatory system which is both effective in pursuit of its objectives, and also which wins the respect and perhaps even the approval of the regulated community", Sir Davies said. Skilled regulatory resources are scarce anywhere, and particularly in developing countries. It is therefore absolutely crucial that those resources are deployed where they can make most impact, and where the need is greatest. Stressing the need for international regulatory cooperation, Sir Davies said that "it is no longer adequate for a regulator in any country to focus on domestic standards only. Any regulator must ensure that its practices are compatible with internationally agreed codes." The Governor of Maharashtra, His Excellency Shri Mohammed Fazal, said that "the role of SEBI is of prime importance to safeguard the interests of the common investor who is totally ignorant about the business environment and global trends and hence cannot assess the future of the industries". Appreciating the "metamorphosis from physical to electronic transactions", as a "welcome development", the Governor said that "this is a healthy step towards gaining the confidence of small investors for which SEBI needs to be congratulated". Tracing the growth of the securities market in India in general and SEBI in particular, Chairman, SEBI, Shri G.N. Bajpai said that "we need <mark>regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures". Explaining further on the need for regulation, Shri Bajpai said "regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combined the elements of regulation and development. ." On liberalization versus regulation, the Chairman said that " there is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalization does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. ". "Reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI", Shri Bajpai said. "These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated", he added. Shri Bajpai also highlighted the reforms in the securities market in India viz. the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992 and issuance of Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines by SEBI, thereby the market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation, establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities and introduction of nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS). "A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the participants are safe and market integrity is protected", Shri Bajpai said and gave examples of Reduction of Trading Cycle to T+2, dematerialization of stocks, introduction of derivatives, establishment of Settlement Guarantee Fund, setting up of the Central Listing Authority etc. On the future initiatives of SEBI, Shri Bajpai spoke about the setting up of a national institute to build a cadre of professionals to man the specialized functions in the securities market, corporatisation and demutualization of exchanges, introduction if market wide straight through processing from trade initiation to settlement, migration to T+1 rolling settlement, continuous review and upgradation of accounting standards, disclosures, corporate governance practices in the interest of investors, continuous review and amendment</mark><mark>market participants</mark><mark>market participants</mark>, while protecting investors in securities. The aim is to make Indian securities market a model for other jurisdictions to follow and make SEBI the most dynamic and respected regulator globally."</td>

        <td>On July 12, 2005 i.e. the date of listing on stock exchanges, the above five entities (other than Rajan Vasudev Dapki) together sold 8,39,500 shares valuing Rs.5.15 crores. The average sale price works out to Rs.61.40 per share. Reckoning the issue price of Rs.45/- per share, the total profit earned by the five entities on sale of 8,39,500 shares works out to Rs. 1,37,67,800/-. A similar modus operandi as above has been adopted by Sugandh who received 150 shares each from 1315 dematerialized accounts aggregating to 197250 shares in off market transactions. It in turn had, on July 08, 2005 transferred 196050 shares to the dematerialized account of 3 entities Sujal Leasing and Finance P. Ltd., Ritaben R Thakkar and Veenaben Y Thakkar. The above three entities sold 1,94,250 shares at an average sale price of Rs.61.61 per share on NSE for a total sale value of Rs. 1,19,68,708.45. The total profit earned by the three entities on sale of 1,94,250 shares works out to Rs. 32,26,492.50 reckoning the issue price of Rs.45/- as cost of acquisition of these shares. It appears that the above profit has been earned by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Sugandh would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants. Further probe is required for examining the systemic fault, if any, of the registrar Karvy-RTI i.e. Karvy Computershares P Ltd. and the lead managers DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd. and Enam Financial Consultants P Ltd. in identifying and weeding out the benami applications. Also, the role of Karvy-DP that opened the dematerialized accounts of 6315 entities being benamis of Roopalben Panchal and 1315 entities being benamis of Sugandh probably without taking adequate steps to ascertain the genuineness of these entities while acting as a facilitator in what appears to be an act of either gross negligence or active collusion ill behoves them as a SEBI registered <mark>market participant</mark><mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Markets) Regulations</mark>, 2003.

As it is necessary to avoid multiplicity of regulators for entities taking limited purpose membership for trading on their own behalf in the proposed trading and clearing platforms, the responsibility of regulating their activity in corporate bonds through trading platforms will vest with SEBI while the primary regulation of these institutions will continue to vest with their respective primary regulators. Appropriate approvals may be considered by concerned regulators to enable free participation on the trading platform through limited membership by the concerned entities for the purpose of their proprietary trading. The major holders of corporate bonds like banks, FIs, PDs, PFs, Insurance companies are not regulated by SEBI. Hence, SEBI will have to write to all concerned regulators who will advise their regulated agencies to trade on the designated order matching system. SEBI can in the interest of market will mandate a particular exchange to begin with to set up an order matching system. The same exchange which provides the centralized data base should ideally have order matching system. This system or platform should be separate from that of equity and derivative platforms already existing. The trades should be settled through novation and settlement guarantee fund, and as in the case of equities, the clearing agency of the exchange should be connected to the depositories for electronic transfer of bonds. At a later date when trading picks up and the market deepens, SEBI can examine whether there is a scope for other trading platforms to be set up. Also the chosen exchange should examine the scope of introducing T+1 settlement only for corporate debt, if it has to compete effectively with the OTC/telephone market. In the case of NDS also settlement is mostly on T+1 basis, if not on T+0 (i.e same day). SEBI can announce the plan through a comprehensive press release first, to put the market on notice. 14</td>

However, the total investment in HFCs cannot exceed 30% of the net assets of the scheme. II.          Review of the Debt Limit Allocation Mechanism for FIIs Regarding the review of the debt limit allocation mechanism for FIIs, the Board took note of the following: (i)    With effect from January 01, 2014, the FIIs shall be allowed to re-invest during the calendar year to the extent of 50% of their debt holdings at the end of the previous calendar year. (ii)  The utilization period for Government Debt and Corporate Debt limits will be reduced to 30 days and 60 days respectively. (iii)  In the FII Debt limit, the unutilised limit in respect of Corporate Debt infra long term bonds category may be availed by the FIIs/Sub Accounts without obtaining prior SEBI approval till the overall FII investments reaches 90% of the limit, after which the auction mechanism shall be initiated for allocation of remaining limits. III.          Suggestions to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for Foreign Portfolio   Investments such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. With a view to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for foreign portfolio investments, SEBI will prepare a draft guideline based on the guidance of the Working Group on Foreign Investment in India (WGFII), for consideration of the Government so that uniform guidelines are made for various categories of investors such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. IV.          Expansion of asset classes which can be held in demat form (i)  There have been demands for dematerialization of assets/records other than securities, such as, Warehouse receipts, Fixed Deposits with banks and corporates, Insurance Policies, Investment products of Post Office, etc. (ii) Under Regulation 7(c) of <mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>market participants</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations</mark>, 1996 (D&P Regulations) lay down various obligations on the part of Issuers or their agents such as entering into agreement with the Depositories, carrying out reconciliation of share capital, carrying out timely dematerialization of shares, maintaining proper records etc. It has been seen in the past that there are instances of non compliance such as lack of reconciliation of issued or listed capital and actual share capital by the Issuer company and its appointed RTA. (ii) In order to enable appropriate action by SEBI in such cases (currently possible under the Depositories Act), the Board approved proposal to suitably amend the D&P Regulations to enable SEBI to take appropriate action against non-compliant issuers or their agents under the D&P Regulations and to empower Depositories to take appropriate action against such issuer or agent as per their Bye-laws.</td>
