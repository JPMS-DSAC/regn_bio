The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8.

Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively.

The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

Avoid commission driven malpractices such as: (a) recommending inappropriate products solely because the intermediary is getting higher commissions therefrom. (b) encouraging over transacting and churning of mutual fund investments to earn higher commissions, even if they mean higher transaction costs and tax for investors. 10. Avoid making negative statements about any AMC or scheme and ensure that comparisons if any, are made with similar and comparable products. 11. Ensure that all investor related statutory communications (such as changes in fundamental attributes, exit/entry load, exit options, and other material aspects) are sent to investors reliably and on time. 12. Maintain confidentiality of all investor deals and transactions. 13. When marketing various schemes, remember that a client’s interest and suitability to their financial needs is paramount, and that extra commission or incentive earned should never form the basis for recommending a scheme to the client. 14. Intermediaries will not rebate commission back to investors and avoid attracting clients through temptation of rebate/gifts etc. 15. A focus on financial planning and advisory services ensures correct selling, and also reduces the trend towards investors asking for passback of commission. 16.

The amendments inter-alia include introduction of Net Tangible Assets and minimum number of allottees as additional criterion, appraisal route as an alternative to the mandatory book building route etc. Details of the amendments are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section B    Review of Book Building guidelines  Book building is a facility given to issuer companies  and merchant bankers to ascertain the demand and indicative price before the actual opening of the issue. SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue. It is extensively used in international IPOs as stabilization tool for post listing price of the newly issued shares.

        <td>On July 12, 2005 i.e. the date of listing on stock exchanges, the above five entities (other than Rajan Vasudev Dapki) together sold 8,39,500 shares valuing Rs.5.15 crores. The average sale price works out to Rs.61.40 per share. Reckoning the issue price of Rs.45/- per share, the total profit earned by the five entities on sale of 8,39,500 shares works out to Rs. 1,37,67,800/-. A similar modus operandi as above has been adopted by Sugandh who received 150 shares each from 1315 dematerialized accounts aggregating to 197250 shares in off market transactions. It in turn had, on July 08, 2005 transferred 196050 shares to the dematerialized account of 3 entities Sujal Leasing and Finance P. Ltd., Ritaben R Thakkar and Veenaben Y Thakkar. The above three entities sold 1,94,250 shares at an average sale price of Rs.61.61 per share on NSE for a total sale value of Rs. 1,19,68,708.45. The total profit earned by the three entities on sale of 1,94,250 shares works out to Rs. 32,26,492.50 reckoning the issue price of Rs.45/- as cost of acquisition of these shares. It appears that the above profit has been earned by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares.

        <td>Though the various parties involved in the different stages of the entire chain of events might claim their part as genuine, the same cannot be countenanced at this juncture of the proceedings, where the materiality of circumstances and the manner in which the entire modus operandi was executed have the ingredients of a manipulative assemblage to scupper the process of IPO allotment. It appears that unfair gain has been made by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani, Manojdev Seksaria and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Purshottam Budhwani would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants. The entire gameplan, craftily designed, masterminded and executed by a coterie of operators acting in concert, in a tout ensemble through the mechanism of front entities of name-lenders seeking to impart a veneer of acceptability to a deal which is otherwise sham in an agonistic aggression in the market through predatory cornering is a clear abuse of the very process of IPO, meant to shore up the participation of retail investors. What is equally reprehensible is the unjust enrichment by a few masquerading in the retail category at the cost of genuine retail investors, who have been crowded out by the "hyperplasia" engineered and induced by the machinations of a few to monopolise the retail segment through colorable devices and make-believe arrangements. The entire gamut of elaborate game-plan of queering the pitch in the market is driven by base cupidity to wangle a patently unfair gain.
