        <td> 400 021.RRTI Circular No. 1 (93-94) November 5, 1993To All Registered Registrars to an Issue   Dear Sirs, With the passing of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and notification of the Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents Rules and Regulations, 1993, no person shall act either as a Registrar to an Issue and/or Share Transfer Agent unless he is registered with SEBI under Section 12 of the Act. SEBI has granted Certificates of Registration to certain Registrars to an Issue (RTI) and Share Transfer Agents (STA) in terms of Rule 4, and Regulation 8 of <mark>SEBI (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Rules & Regulations, 1993 either to act both as Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents (Category I) or only as Registrars to an Issue/ Share Transfer Agents (Category II). In terms of the powers conferred on it under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992, SEBI will, from time to time, issue operational guidelines/ instructionsto the Registered Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents by means of circulars. This is the first circular in the series on Registrars to an Issue function and accordingly has been numbered as RRTI Circular No. 1. (General instructions so far issued by SEBI to the Registrars to an Issue have been consolidated and included in this Circular). Further circulars on RTI function would bear continuous serial numbers, valid for the relevant financial year. All Registered Registrars to an Issue should ensure compliance with the instructions contained in such circulars. Circulars on Share Transfer Agents function shall constitute a different series and shall be numbered as RSTA Circulars.A. REGISTRATION:1.The registration granted pursuant to Chapter II of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Regulations</mark><mark>employees</mark> of the Registrars should be framed to prevent insider trading, in the light of SEBI Insider Trading Regulations, 1992.4.Regulations 22 and 23 provide for penalty of suspension/ cancellation of registration for persistent defaults by the Registrars to an Issue. However, in order to give an opportunity to the Registrars to an Issue to make up the deficiencies in their functioning and to strengthen their machinery, SEBI may issue warning letters or penalty point advices by which the Registrars to an Issue would be forewarned in respect of their omissions. A Registrar to an Issue who; despite the receipt of three warning letters or penalty point advices, does not show improvement or fails to make up the deficiencies, may be subjected to action for default in terms of Regulation 22 or 23 as the case may be.5.Memorandum of Understanding: (Valid Agreement)In terms of Rule 4(b), before taking up any assignment to act as RTI, every RTI must invariably enter into a valid agreement with the company making the issue (issuer) clearly setting out their mutual rights, liabilities and obligations relating to the issue and more specifically, the inter-se responsibilities for redressal of investor grievances after the closure of the Issue. SEBI shall endeavour to provide a draft of the Agreement in due course. The RTI may adapt the draft and incorporate such clauses as may be considered necessary for defining his rights and obligations vis-a-vis the issuer. While doing so, it must, be ensured that neither party should reserve for itself any .rights, which would have the effect of diminishing in any way its liabilities and obligations under the Companies Act, 1956 and SEBI (RTI and STA) Rules and Regulations,1993. The Registrars should ensure that such an agreement provides for retention of issue records atleast for a period of six months from the last date of despatch of letters of allotment / share certificates/refund orders to enable the investors to approach the Registrar for redressal of their complaints.  : : 3 : :C. STOCKINVEST In November 1992, SEBI had issued a circular to the Registrars to Issue outlining the procedure to be followed by them while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest. Subsequent to the issue of the said circular, there have been certain modifications to the stockinvest scheme. Accordingly, the revised outline of the procedure to be followed while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest is given in Annexure A. D. BULK MAILING OF REGISTERED LETTERS, ARTICLES ETC.: RTIs are aware that all share/debenture certificates refund orders, interest/dividend warrants etc. are required to be sent by Registered Post. In order to mitigate the problems faced by all parties concerned and evolve a time saving facility for bulk mailing of these articles, SEBI had arranged a meeting of the Registrars to the Issue based in Bombay with the Controller (Mail Planning and Operations) of the Bombay G.P.O. in October 1991, when the Controller explained the procedure for bulk mailing of Registered articles. The procedure as explained by him is set out below for the benefit of all Registrars. 1. The Registrars to the Issues should tender bulk registered mail to the 2.The registration number contained in the certificate of registration should be quoted in all the correspondence with SEBI, Government authorities, Stock Exchanges and its clients..2/-designated post offices. 2. The department (i.e. the Office of the Chief Postmaster General) will grant permission for computerised Registered Journals by the parties concerned with a separate code for each mailer and a separate pre-fix for each issue/company.3. The Registrars to the Issue should prepare PIN code number wise list and accordingly club articles to be mailed (this is already being done in case of mail posted by certain Consultancy Services). 4. In case of very large bulk registered mailers, facility of accepting, sorting and bagging at their premises will be arranged by postal authorities. The department will also arrange to provide for necessary manpower, canvas bags, stamps, seals etc. The mailer will provide for transport for taking the bags to the Railway Station/Airport. 5. The Registrars to the Issue should intimate their bulk mailing programme to the designated post offices or mailing centres at least a .week or 10 days in advance and obtain necessary permission for the same. These post offices of bulk mailing centres will also act as nodal agencies for bulk booking as also for providing related assistance of manpower, etc. RTIs may note that for the purpose of ensuring despatch of refund orders etc. by Registered Post only, issuers are made to declare in the prospectus that adequate funds will be made available to the Registrars for the purpose. RTIs shall therefore ensure mailing of articles by Registered Post as per the extant Postal Rules. :: 4 ::E. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS1.The Registrars should take proper care and evolve a suitable system whereby multiple applications can be weeded out and eliminated.2.Instances of multiple applications should be brought to the notice of the Companies (Issuers) as also the lead managers for necessary action. 3.Registrars shall ascertain from bank schedules whether each application form was accompanied by a separate cheque as required in terms of instructions printed on the reverse of application forms. In case a bunch of applications have been submitted with a single cheque, such fact should also be brought to the notice of the lead manager for appropriate action.4.In order to prevent fraudulent encashment of refund orders by third parties, the applicant is now being given an opportunity to provide information in the relative application form as to his savings bank/ current account number and name of the bank with whom such account is held. For the purpose, the application form shall contain suitable provision. The Registrars to the issue shall note to capture these details while processing the application forms and incorporate the same in the refund order.5.With the introduction of collection agents for collection of applications and with the reduction in the number of mandatory collection centres from 57 to 30, It has been provided that - .a) applications accompanied by stockinvest received by collection agents shall be sent directly to the registrars to the issue along with the schedules within one week from the date of closure of the Issue ; b) investors from places other than those where the mandatory centres and ,authorised collection centres are located, can forward their applications along with stockinvests directly to the Registrars to the Issue by Registered Post with acknowledgement due. The Registrars shall note to maintain proper records of all applications received through post by them.  F. BASIS OF ALLOTMENT IN CASE OF OVERSUBSCRIPTIONWherever the prospectus provides for basis of allotment to be decided on a proportionate basis, the Registrars shall follow the procedure as given in Annexure B for deciding the basis, of allotment.Please acknowledge receipt of this circular.Yours faithfully,Sd/- V.H..PANDYASR.EXECUTIVE DIRECTOREncl: as above.ANNEXURE "A"Procedure for handling of applications accompanied by stockinvest 1. Registrars shall receive applications for subscription to shares, debentures etc. accompanied by stockinvest alongwith separate schedules from the controlling branches of bankers to the issues, authorised collection agents wherever provided and directly from investors residing in places other than 30 mandatory centres. 2. Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

Registrars may ensure that the stockinvests are used by the purchaser(s) within 10 days of issue.. (For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvests are drawn in the name of the issuer company only. 14. Registrars shall regularly maintain a proper record of applications received with stockinvests, giving, inter-alia, the name of the investor, station code, number and value of stockinvest attached, utilised and returned to enable the Registrars to reply to the Investors' queries promptly. The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

        <td> 400 021.RRTI Circular No. 1 (93-94) November 5, 1993To All Registered Registrars to an Issue   Dear Sirs, With the passing of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and notification of the Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents Rules and Regulations, 1993, no person shall act either as a Registrar to an Issue and/or Share Transfer Agent unless he is registered with SEBI under Section 12 of the Act. SEBI has granted Certificates of Registration to certain Registrars to an Issue (RTI) and Share Transfer Agents (STA) in terms of Rule 4, and Regulation 8 of <mark>SEBI (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Rules & Regulations, 1993 either to act both as Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents (Category I) or only as Registrars to an Issue/ Share Transfer Agents (Category II). In terms of the powers conferred on it under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992, SEBI will, from time to time, issue operational guidelines/ instructionsto the Registered Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents by means of circulars. This is the first circular in the series on Registrars to an Issue function and accordingly has been numbered as RRTI Circular No. 1. (General instructions so far issued by SEBI to the Registrars to an Issue have been consolidated and included in this Circular). Further circulars on RTI function would bear continuous serial numbers, valid for the relevant financial year. All Registered Registrars to an Issue should ensure compliance with the instructions contained in such circulars. Circulars on Share Transfer Agents function shall constitute a different series and shall be numbered as RSTA Circulars.A. REGISTRATION:1.The registration granted pursuant to Chapter II of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Regulations</mark><mark>employees</mark> of the Registrars should be framed to prevent insider trading, in the light of SEBI Insider Trading Regulations, 1992.4.Regulations 22 and 23 provide for penalty of suspension/ cancellation of registration for persistent defaults by the Registrars to an Issue. However, in order to give an opportunity to the Registrars to an Issue to make up the deficiencies in their functioning and to strengthen their machinery, SEBI may issue warning letters or penalty point advices by which the Registrars to an Issue would be forewarned in respect of their omissions. A Registrar to an Issue who; despite the receipt of three warning letters or penalty point advices, does not show improvement or fails to make up the deficiencies, may be subjected to action for default in terms of Regulation 22 or 23 as the case may be.5.Memorandum of Understanding: (Valid Agreement)In terms of Rule 4(b), before taking up any assignment to act as RTI, every RTI must invariably enter into a valid agreement with the company making the issue (issuer) clearly setting out their mutual rights, liabilities and obligations relating to the issue and more specifically, the inter-se responsibilities for redressal of investor grievances after the closure of the Issue. SEBI shall endeavour to provide a draft of the Agreement in due course. The RTI may adapt the draft and incorporate such clauses as may be considered necessary for defining his rights and obligations vis-a-vis the issuer. While doing so, it must, be ensured that neither party should reserve for itself any .rights, which would have the effect of diminishing in any way its liabilities and obligations under the Companies Act, 1956 and SEBI (RTI and STA) Rules and Regulations,1993. The Registrars should ensure that such an agreement provides for retention of issue records atleast for a period of six months from the last date of despatch of letters of allotment / share certificates/refund orders to enable the investors to approach the Registrar for redressal of their complaints.  : : 3 : :C. STOCKINVEST In November 1992, SEBI had issued a circular to the Registrars to Issue outlining the procedure to be followed by them while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest. Subsequent to the issue of the said circular, there have been certain modifications to the stockinvest scheme. Accordingly, the revised outline of the procedure to be followed while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest is given in Annexure A. D. BULK MAILING OF REGISTERED LETTERS, ARTICLES ETC.: RTIs are aware that all share/debenture certificates refund orders, interest/dividend warrants etc. are required to be sent by Registered Post. In order to mitigate the problems faced by all parties concerned and evolve a time saving facility for bulk mailing of these articles, SEBI had arranged a meeting of the Registrars to the Issue based in Bombay with the Controller (Mail Planning and Operations) of the Bombay G.P.O. in October 1991, when the Controller explained the procedure for bulk mailing of Registered articles. The procedure as explained by him is set out below for the benefit of all Registrars. 1. The Registrars to the Issues should tender bulk registered mail to the 2.The registration number contained in the certificate of registration should be quoted in all the correspondence with SEBI, Government authorities, Stock Exchanges and its clients..2/-designated post offices. 2. The department (i.e. the Office of the Chief Postmaster General) will grant permission for computerised Registered Journals by the parties concerned with a separate code for each mailer and a separate pre-fix for each issue/company.3. The Registrars to the Issue should prepare PIN code number wise list and accordingly club articles to be mailed (this is already being done in case of mail posted by certain Consultancy Services). 4. In case of very large bulk registered mailers, facility of accepting, sorting and bagging at their premises will be arranged by postal authorities. The department will also arrange to provide for necessary manpower, canvas bags, stamps, seals etc. The mailer will provide for transport for taking the bags to the Railway Station/Airport. 5. The Registrars to the Issue should intimate their bulk mailing programme to the designated post offices or mailing centres at least a .week or 10 days in advance and obtain necessary permission for the same. These post offices of bulk mailing centres will also act as nodal agencies for bulk booking as also for providing related assistance of manpower, etc. RTIs may note that for the purpose of ensuring despatch of refund orders etc. by Registered Post only, issuers are made to declare in the prospectus that adequate funds will be made available to the Registrars for the purpose. RTIs shall therefore ensure mailing of articles by Registered Post as per the extant Postal Rules. :: 4 ::E. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS1.The Registrars should take proper care and evolve a suitable system whereby multiple applications can be weeded out and eliminated.2.Instances of multiple applications should be brought to the notice of the Companies (Issuers) as also the lead managers for necessary action. 3.Registrars shall ascertain from bank schedules whether each application form was accompanied by a separate cheque as required in terms of instructions printed on the reverse of application forms. In case a bunch of applications have been submitted with a single cheque, such fact should also be brought to the notice of the lead manager for appropriate action.4.In order to prevent fraudulent encashment of refund orders by third parties, the applicant is now being given an opportunity to provide information in the relative application form as to his savings bank/ current account number and name of the bank with whom such account is held. For the purpose, the application form shall contain suitable provision. The Registrars to the issue shall note to capture these details while processing the application forms and incorporate the same in the refund order.5.With the introduction of collection agents for collection of applications and with the reduction in the number of mandatory collection centres from 57 to 30, It has been provided that - .a) applications accompanied by stockinvest received by collection agents shall be sent directly to the registrars to the issue along with the schedules within one week from the date of closure of the Issue ; b) investors from places other than those where the mandatory centres and ,authorised collection centres are located, can forward their applications along with stockinvests directly to the Registrars to the Issue by Registered Post with acknowledgement due. The Registrars shall note to maintain proper records of all applications received through post by them.  F. BASIS OF ALLOTMENT IN CASE OF OVERSUBSCRIPTIONWherever the prospectus provides for basis of allotment to be decided on a proportionate basis, the Registrars shall follow the procedure as given in Annexure B for deciding the basis, of allotment.Please acknowledge receipt of this circular.Yours faithfully,Sd/- V.H..PANDYASR.EXECUTIVE DIRECTOREncl: as above.ANNEXURE "A"Procedure for handling of applications accompanied by stockinvest 1. Registrars shall receive applications for subscription to shares, debentures etc. accompanied by stockinvest alongwith separate schedules from the controlling branches of bankers to the issues, authorised collection agents wherever provided and directly from investors residing in places other than 30 mandatory centres. 2. Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

Registrars may ensure that the stockinvests are used by the purchaser(s) within 10 days of issue.. (For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvests are drawn in the name of the issuer company only. 14. Registrars shall regularly maintain a proper record of applications received with stockinvests, giving, inter-alia, the name of the investor, station code, number and value of stockinvest attached, utilised and returned to enable the Registrars to reply to the Investors' queries promptly. The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

The representations received from the companies in information technology sector emphasized that they are knowledge intensive companies rather than capital intensive, as large part of the total valuation of these companies emanates from intangibles such as manpower, brand equity, portfolio of services etc. and only a small portion of valuation is due to capital and fixed assets. It was also submitted that in case of these companies, with high valuations but low capital requirements, the compliance with Rule 19(2)(b) SC(R)R would result in huge offer size. The capital so raised may be in excess of their requirements.

The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

        <td>The Board, in its meeting held on September 23, 2016, had deliberated the concerns related to private equity funds entering into compensation agreements to incentivize promoters, directors and key managerial personnel of listed investee companies which could potentially lead to unfair practices. Accordingly, it approved the proposal for initiation of public consultation process in this regard.  The said consultation paper was issued on October 04, 2016 inviting public comments. Subsequently, comments/ suggestions have been received from the public. Based on the consultative paper and the comments received thereon, the SEBI Board today approved the proposal to amend Listing Regulations to enforce disclosures and shareholder approval for all such agreements including existing agreements that extend beyond the date of the amendment. The revised norms for such disclosures and shareholder approvals are as under: i)          No <mark>employee</mark> including key managerial personnel, director or promoter of a listed entity shall enter into any agreement for himself or on behalf of any other person, with any shareholder or any other third party with regard to compensation or profit sharing unless prior approval has been obtained from the Board as well as public shareholders.</td>

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c.

Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, <mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs. According to Ind AS 28, the consolidation of interest in joint ventures can be done by using "Equity Method", wherein the share of investor in the net worth of investee can be directly taken as value of investment in the books of investor and the difference between old value and new value will be credited/debited to Other Comprehensive income as the investment in equity shares has been classified as "Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income".
