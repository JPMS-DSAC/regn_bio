        <td> 400 021.RRTI Circular No. 1 (93-94) November 5, 1993To All Registered Registrars to an Issue   Dear Sirs, With the passing of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and notification of the Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents Rules and Regulations, 1993, no person shall act either as a Registrar to an Issue and/or Share Transfer Agent unless he is registered with SEBI under Section 12 of the Act. SEBI has granted Certificates of Registration to certain Registrars to an Issue (RTI) and Share Transfer Agents (STA) in terms of Rule 4, and Regulation 8 of <mark>SEBI (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Rules & Regulations, 1993 either to act both as Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents (Category I) or only as Registrars to an Issue/ Share Transfer Agents (Category II). In terms of the powers conferred on it under Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992, SEBI will, from time to time, issue operational guidelines/ instructionsto the Registered Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents by means of circulars. This is the first circular in the series on Registrars to an Issue function and accordingly has been numbered as RRTI Circular No. 1. (General instructions so far issued by SEBI to the Registrars to an Issue have been consolidated and included in this Circular). Further circulars on RTI function would bear continuous serial numbers, valid for the relevant financial year. All Registered Registrars to an Issue should ensure compliance with the instructions contained in such circulars. Circulars on Share Transfer Agents function shall constitute a different series and shall be numbered as RSTA Circulars.A. REGISTRATION:1.The registration granted pursuant to Chapter II of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Regulations</mark><mark>employees</mark> of the Registrars should be framed to prevent insider trading, in the light of SEBI Insider Trading Regulations, 1992.4.Regulations 22 and 23 provide for penalty of suspension/ cancellation of registration for persistent defaults by the Registrars to an Issue. However, in order to give an opportunity to the Registrars to an Issue to make up the deficiencies in their functioning and to strengthen their machinery, SEBI may issue warning letters or penalty point advices by which the Registrars to an Issue would be forewarned in respect of their omissions. A Registrar to an Issue who; despite the receipt of three warning letters or penalty point advices, does not show improvement or fails to make up the deficiencies, may be subjected to action for default in terms of Regulation 22 or 23 as the case may be.5.Memorandum of Understanding: (Valid Agreement)In terms of Rule 4(b), before taking up any assignment to act as RTI, every RTI must invariably enter into a valid agreement with the company making the issue (issuer) clearly setting out their mutual rights, liabilities and obligations relating to the issue and more specifically, the inter-se responsibilities for redressal of investor grievances after the closure of the Issue. SEBI shall endeavour to provide a draft of the Agreement in due course. The RTI may adapt the draft and incorporate such clauses as may be considered necessary for defining his rights and obligations vis-a-vis the issuer. While doing so, it must, be ensured that neither party should reserve for itself any .rights, which would have the effect of diminishing in any way its liabilities and obligations under the Companies Act, 1956 and SEBI (RTI and STA) Rules and Regulations,1993. The Registrars should ensure that such an agreement provides for retention of issue records atleast for a period of six months from the last date of despatch of letters of allotment / share certificates/refund orders to enable the investors to approach the Registrar for redressal of their complaints.  : : 3 : :C. STOCKINVEST In November 1992, SEBI had issued a circular to the Registrars to Issue outlining the procedure to be followed by them while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest. Subsequent to the issue of the said circular, there have been certain modifications to the stockinvest scheme. Accordingly, the revised outline of the procedure to be followed while handling applications accompanied by stockinvest is given in Annexure A. D. BULK MAILING OF REGISTERED LETTERS, ARTICLES ETC.: RTIs are aware that all share/debenture certificates refund orders, interest/dividend warrants etc. are required to be sent by Registered Post. In order to mitigate the problems faced by all parties concerned and evolve a time saving facility for bulk mailing of these articles, SEBI had arranged a meeting of the Registrars to the Issue based in Bombay with the Controller (Mail Planning and Operations) of the Bombay G.P.O. in October 1991, when the Controller explained the procedure for bulk mailing of Registered articles. The procedure as explained by him is set out below for the benefit of all Registrars. 1. The Registrars to the Issues should tender bulk registered mail to the 2.The registration number contained in the certificate of registration should be quoted in all the correspondence with SEBI, Government authorities, Stock Exchanges and its clients..2/-designated post offices. 2. The department (i.e. the Office of the Chief Postmaster General) will grant permission for computerised Registered Journals by the parties concerned with a separate code for each mailer and a separate pre-fix for each issue/company.3. The Registrars to the Issue should prepare PIN code number wise list and accordingly club articles to be mailed (this is already being done in case of mail posted by certain Consultancy Services). 4. In case of very large bulk registered mailers, facility of accepting, sorting and bagging at their premises will be arranged by postal authorities. The department will also arrange to provide for necessary manpower, canvas bags, stamps, seals etc. The mailer will provide for transport for taking the bags to the Railway Station/Airport. 5. The Registrars to the Issue should intimate their bulk mailing programme to the designated post offices or mailing centres at least a .week or 10 days in advance and obtain necessary permission for the same. These post offices of bulk mailing centres will also act as nodal agencies for bulk booking as also for providing related assistance of manpower, etc. RTIs may note that for the purpose of ensuring despatch of refund orders etc. by Registered Post only, issuers are made to declare in the prospectus that adequate funds will be made available to the Registrars for the purpose. RTIs shall therefore ensure mailing of articles by Registered Post as per the extant Postal Rules. :: 4 ::E. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS1.The Registrars should take proper care and evolve a suitable system whereby multiple applications can be weeded out and eliminated.2.Instances of multiple applications should be brought to the notice of the Companies (Issuers) as also the lead managers for necessary action. 3.Registrars shall ascertain from bank schedules whether each application form was accompanied by a separate cheque as required in terms of instructions printed on the reverse of application forms. In case a bunch of applications have been submitted with a single cheque, such fact should also be brought to the notice of the lead manager for appropriate action.4.In order to prevent fraudulent encashment of refund orders by third parties, the applicant is now being given an opportunity to provide information in the relative application form as to his savings bank/ current account number and name of the bank with whom such account is held. For the purpose, the application form shall contain suitable provision. The Registrars to the issue shall note to capture these details while processing the application forms and incorporate the same in the refund order.5.With the introduction of collection agents for collection of applications and with the reduction in the number of mandatory collection centres from 57 to 30, It has been provided that - .a) applications accompanied by stockinvest received by collection agents shall be sent directly to the registrars to the issue along with the schedules within one week from the date of closure of the Issue ; b) investors from places other than those where the mandatory centres and ,authorised collection centres are located, can forward their applications along with stockinvests directly to the Registrars to the Issue by Registered Post with acknowledgement due. The Registrars shall note to maintain proper records of all applications received through post by them.  F. BASIS OF ALLOTMENT IN CASE OF OVERSUBSCRIPTIONWherever the prospectus provides for basis of allotment to be decided on a proportionate basis, the Registrars shall follow the procedure as given in Annexure B for deciding the basis, of allotment.Please acknowledge receipt of this circular.Yours faithfully,Sd/- V.H..PANDYASR.EXECUTIVE DIRECTOREncl: as above.ANNEXURE "A"Procedure for handling of applications accompanied by stockinvest 1. Registrars shall receive applications for subscription to shares, debentures etc. accompanied by stockinvest alongwith separate schedules from the controlling branches of bankers to the issues, authorised collection agents wherever provided and directly from investors residing in places other than 30 mandatory centres. 2. Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

Registrars may ensure that the stockinvests are used by the purchaser(s) within 10 days of issue.. (For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvests are drawn in the name of the issuer company only. 14. Registrars shall regularly maintain a proper record of applications received with stockinvests, giving, inter-alia, the name of the investor, station code, number and value of stockinvest attached, utilised and returned to enable the Registrars to reply to the Investors' queries promptly. The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

After examining these recommendations, it has been decided that all mutual funds shall take steps to implement the following guidelines. Transactions of mutual funds in Government Securities in dematerialised form As you are aware, according to Regulation 44(1A), the mutual fund having an aggregate of securities worth Rs. 10 crore or more are required to settle their transactions only through dematerialised securities. It is further advised to all mutual funds to enter into transactions relating to government securities only in dematerialised form. Treatment and disposal of illiquid securities/NPAs at the time of maturity/ closure of the scheme Some of the investments made by mutual funds may become non-performing (NPAs) or illiquid at the time of maturity/closure of schemes. In due course of time, these NPAs and illiquid securities may be realised by the mutual funds i.e. after the winding up of the schemes. You are therefore advised to distribute such amount, if it is substantial and is realised within two years, to the old investors. In case the amount is not substantial or it is realised after two years, it may be transferred to the Investor Education Fund maintained by each mutual fund as specified in SEBI circular MFD/CIR/9/120/2000 dated November 24, 2000. The decision as to the determination of substantial amount shall be taken by the trustees of mutual funds after considering the relevant factors. 3.

        <td>market an of all (issuers/intermediaries/investors). 1.2 The  Developments 1.2.1  Since its launch in November 2003, i.e. nearly 18 months ago, only about three lakh MAPIN UINs have been issued, compared to over 70 lakh demat accounts (even recognizing  multiple  demat  accounts,  the  number  would  still  be  very  large).  This is because  of  considerable  opposition  to  the  MAPIN  system  entailing  fingerprinting.  It  is also  because  of  lack  of  clarity  on  several  aspects  of  the  Regulations  (leading  to  a couple  of  amendments  to  the  Regulations),  non-notification  of  certain  categories of MAPIN Committee Report                                                                                                                                          4 and non-investing <mark>employees</mark></td>

        <td>Order in the matter of (1) M/s Digital Stocks & its Proprietor, Shri Dheeraj Kumar Madaan, (2) Ganpati Finsec Pvt Ltd and its directors Shri Devender Mittal, Smt. Ritu Mittal and Dr. K.C Mittal SEBI vide order dated October 5, 2005 has issued the following directions in the matter of M/s Digital Stocks & its Proprietor, Shri Dheeraj Kumar Madaan, (2) Ganpati Finsec Pvt Ltd and its directors Shri Devender Mittal, Smt. Ritu Mittal and Dr. K.C Mittal : 1.      Shri Dheeraj Kumar Madaan, Proprietor of M/s Digital Stocks, having its office at 3, Circular Road, Mawa Market, Abohar, District Ferozepur (Punjab) is prohibited, with immediate effect, from buying, selling or dealing in securities or being associated with the securities market in any manner. 2.      Ganpati Finsec Pvt Ltd (GFPL) and its directors namely Shri Devender Mittal, Smt. Ritu Mittal and Dr. K.C Mittal are prohibited, with immediate effect, from buying, selling or dealing in securities or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever. 3.      NSDL/CDSL shall freeze, with immediate effect, all the demat accounts of Digital Stocks and its proprietor Shri Dheeraj Kumar Madaan, maintained with them. 4.      India Bulls Securities Ltd shall freeze, with immediate effect, the trading account of Digital Stocks and its proprietor Shri Dheeraj Kumar Madaan. 5.      Appropriate proceedings are being initiated against SMC Securities Ltd. and SAM Global Securities Ltd. for alleged irregularities in their franchisee operations. In the meantime, these brokers are directed to review their systems and procedures and confirm to SEBI within 15 days from the date of receipt of the order that all their operations are within the framework of SEBI regulations, rules and guidelines. All the above directions shall take effect immediately and shall be in force until further orders. SEBI received a complaint from Abohar Investor Forum (AIF) from Abohar, District Firozepur, Punjab and other investors alleging misappropriation of shares and funds of small investors by one Shri Dheeraj Kumar Madaan (hereinafter referred to as DKM) , Proprietor of M/s Digital Stocks, having its address at 3, Circular Road, Mawa Market, Abohar, District Ferozepur (Punjab). It was also alleged that that DKM was an associate of M/s Ganpati Finsec P. Ltd., who was a sub-broker of SAM Global Securities Ltd. (member BSE) and that DKM had absconded on 30th June 2005 with investors’ money. Additionally, there were widespread media reports highlighting the fact that DKM had run away with huge money/ shares of investors. Thereafter, a preliminary investigation into the matter was conducted. The enquiries made by SEBI prima-facie revealed the following.- 1.      SMC claims to have its branch office at Abohar. SMC has further informed that it had entrusted the management of its said branch to its franchisee viz. GFPL, who is based in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. GFPL in turn appointed DKM as the sub agent for managing SMC’s so-called branch at Abohar. DKM was managing SMC’s so-called branch at Abohar for around 3 years. DKM was neither an <mark>employee</mark><mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade practices relating to securities market) Regulations</mark>, 2003. Further, the dealings by DKM as an unregistered sub-broker is prima facie in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of SEBI (Stockbroker and Sub Brokers) Rules, 1992. Furthermore, even GFPL was not registered with SEBI as a sub-broker and was thus acting as unregistered sub-broker in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Rule 3 of SEBI (Stockbrokers and Sub brokers) Rules, 1992. Apart from the above, brokers SAM Global Securities Ltd. and SMC Securities Ltd. have also prima facie violated SEBI circular SMDRP/Policy/Cir/49/2001 dated 22.10.01 by giving trading terminals at places other than registered office, branch office or registered sub-broker offices. It was prima facie seen that SMC/SAM has installed their terminals at various places in and around Sri Ganganagar (including Abohar). SMC/ SAM have a franchise agreement with GFPL, specifically for Sri Ganganagar location and their terminals at other places were also being managed by GFPL . Under the facts and circumstances as stated above, it is therefore incumbent upon the regulator to take emergent and remedial steps to safeguard the interests of the investors and the orderly development of the securities market. In view of the aforesaid and with a view to protect the interest of investors, Shri G. Anantharaman, Whole Time Member, SEBI has passed the above order.

        <td>Rationalizing disclosure requirements for further public offers and rights issues: Presently all companies irrespective of whether they are listed in any stock exchange or are approaching the markets for the first time with IPOs have to make identical disclosures in the prospectus / offer document. In the context of further public offers (FPO) and Rights Issues, some disclosures in the document are repetitive, as the same have been periodically disclosed to the exchanges by the listed companies. It is now proposed to do away with the repetitive disclosures in case of rights issues and FPOs by companies which have a satisfactory track record of filing disclosures with the stock exchanges, of redressing investors’ grievances etc. Common platform for electronic filing and dissemination of corporate information: In terms of the listing agreement, listed companies are required to disclose corporate information to the stock exchanges where they are listed and also on EDIFAR, a electronic filing platform currently maintained by SEBI. This results in multiple disclosures/filings for the companies that are listed on more than one exchange. SEBI, in consultation with NSE and BSE, is in the process of brining a common electronic platform maintained / run by Stock Exchanges. A listed company would be required to file only on this platform for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of listing agreement. The proposed platform would introduce single window filing and would also serve as a one stop shop for corporate information of listed companies. Introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Funds in India: Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his speech presenting the Budget 2005-06 had announced the introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Fund (GETF) in India and creation of a market for such units. Consequent upon the announcement by the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Chairman, SEBI constituted a committee to look into all aspects of facilitating the setting up of GETF in India. After considering various issues involved in the matter, the Committee recommended that the GETF may be implemented in India based on two models- (i) Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model and (ii) Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt Model. The two models are briefly as follows:- Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model- In this model, the physical gold is held by a custodian bank on behalf of the Mutual Fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt model- In this model, gold warehouse receipts are held by a custodian bank on behalf of the mutual fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold warehouse receipts with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Amendment to Takeover Regulations : SEBI Board in its meeting held today approved amendment to SEBI Takeover Regulation. The amendments would provide required flexibility to corporate restructuring. At the same time, to ensure the maintenance of minimum public shareholding for continuous listing it has been decided that if in the process of corporatre restructuring under Takeover Regulations the target company’s public shareholding falls below the prescribed minimum, the restoration of minimum public shareholding will take place through framework provided in the revised Clause 40A of Listing Agreement. Among other things, restrictions on market purchases, preferential allotments as in the Takeover Regulations have been removed. It has also been provided that the outgoing shareholder (promoter) can sell entire stake to incoming acquirer in case of takeover. Further, shareholders holding more than 55% would be able to make further acquisitions subject to making open offer. Amendment to <mark>SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its Board meeting held today has approved amendment to SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>employees</mark> would be required to obtain UIN. These changes will be implemented after the necessary amendments are made to the MAPIN Regulations Note : The aforesaid are policy announcements based on decisions of the Board and do not reflect change in the existing legal framework until the relevant amendments are effected through issue of circulars.

        <td>(2)  Minimum public shareholding for Public Sector Undertakings (“PSUs”) under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (i)  SEBI believes that rules for the market should be uniform across all the companies and should be promoter neutral. (ii)  Under the current rule, while non-PSUs are required to have minimum 25% public shareholding, PSUs are required to have only 10%, which is discriminatory and inconsistent with the broader market design. (iii)  Therefore, SEBI has decided to recommend to Ministry of Finance that SCRR should be amended so that all the listed companies including PSUs shall be required to achieve and maintain minimum public shareholding of 25% of the total number of issued shares, within a time period of three years. (3)  Increasing the investment bucket for anchor investor In order to increase the share of serious, committed investors, SEBI has decided to increase the anchor investor’s bucket to 60% from the current requirement of 30% of the institutional bucket. (4)  Eligibility of shares for Offer for Sale in an IPO with respect to bonus issues on shares held for more than a year The Board approved the proposal to permit bonus shares issued in last one year prior to filing of the draft offer document to be offered for sale, provided that these bonus shares were issued out of the free reserves or share premium. (5)  Amendments to regulations governing the preferential issue norms In order to bring consistency between various regulations and to clarify certain regulations governing the preferential issue norms, the following has been approved: (i)  Replace 'closing price' with 'volume weighted average price' in the pricing formula for preferential issues (ii)  The regulations concerning pricing of QIPs take into account the effect of stock split, bonus, etc. However, this has not been explicitly provided for in the regulations concerning preferential issues. SEBI has decided to extend the same treatment to preferential issues also. (iii)  The regulations concerning preferential issues do not provide specifically for pricing of infrequently traded shares. However, <mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark><mark>employee</mark> benefit schemes other than ESOS type of schemes on owning shares of the company / listed holding company, (iv)  Trusts shall undertake only delivery based transactions and not deal in derivatives, (v)  Restrictions on sale of shares by the Trusts, (vi)  At least six month holding period for shares acquired from secondary market, (vii)  Classifying shareholding of such Trusts separately from 'promoter' and 'public' category, (viii)  Stricter disclosure and other regulatory obligations.</td>

        <td>Nov 19, 2014 PR No.: 130/2014 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions: (I)  SEBI  (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2014 (1)       Two decades had passed since the <mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations</mark><mark>amendments to the regulations and judicial paradigm through case laws had also evolved in India. To ensure that the regulatory framework dealing with insider trading in India is further strengthened, SEBI sought review of the extant Insider Trading regulatory regime and constituted a committee under Chairmanship of Hon’ble Justice N. K. Sodhi. (2)       Board in its meeting deliberated on the Justice Sodhi Committee Report and public comments received thereon. The Board has approved a new regulation in place of the existing regulations. (3)       The new regulations strengthen the legal and enforcement framework, align Indian regime with international practices, provide clarity with respect to the definitions and concepts, and facilitate legitimate business transactions. The salient features of the regulations are as under:- (A) STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK (i) The definition of Insider has been made wider by including persons connected on the basis of being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship that allows such person access to unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). However directors, employees and all other persons in the deeming category covered under 1992 regulations would continue to be covered. Insider will also include a person who is in possession or has access to UPSI. Now, immediate relatives will be presumed to be connected persons, with a right to rebut the presumption. In 1992 regulations, definition of connected person was largely position based. (ii) In the case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possession of UPSI, shall be on such connected persons. (iii)  Clear prohibition on communication of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) has been provided except legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. (iv)  Considering every investor's interest in securities market, advance disclosure of UPSI at least 2 days prior to trading has been made mandatory in case of permitted communication of UPSI. (v)  UPSI has been defined as information not generally available and which may impact the price. The definition of UPSI has been strengthened by providing a test to identify price sensitive information, aligning it with listing agreement and providing platform of disclosure. Earlier, the definition of price sensitive information had reference to company only; now it has reference to both a company and securities. (vi)  Generally Available Information will be the information that is accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory platform which would ordinarily be stock exchange platform. (vii) Companies by law would be entitled to require third-party connected persons to disclose their trading and holdings in securities of the company. (viii) In line with Companies Act, 2013, prohibition on derivative trading by directors and KMPs on securities of the company has been provided. (B) ALIGNING INSIDER TRADING NORMS WITH INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES (i) The requirement of communication of UPSI in the case of legitimate business transaction has been recognized in law and a carve-out with safeguards has been provided. [Reference to A (iii) and (iv) above] (ii) Disclosure of UPSI in public domain has been made mandatory before trading, so as to rule out asymmetry of information in the market, as prevalent in other jurisdictions. [Reference to A (iv) above] (iii) A provision of Trading Plans on the lines of U.S. has been introduced for insiders with necessary safeguards. Such a plan has to be for bona fide transactions and has to be disclosed on stock exchange platform in advance. (C) CLARITY IN THE DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS (i) With important provisions, clarificatory notes have been inserted in the regulation</mark>s itself. (ii) Clarity has been brought to the definition of UPSI by aligning it with listing agreement and making the definition inclusive. (iii) To provide clarity, Generally Available Information has been defined as information that is accessible to public on a non-discriminatory platform such as stock exchange. [Reference to A (vi) above] (iv) Clarity about timing of disclosure of UPSI has been provided and the trading window norms have been made uniform to other connected persons. (D) FACILITATING LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS (i) To facilitate legitimate business transactions, unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) can be communicated with safeguards. [reference to A (iii) & (iv) above] (ii) Insiders who are liable to possess UPSI all round the year would have the option to formulate pre-scheduled trading plans. Trading plans would, however, to be disclosed on the stock exchanges and have to be strictly adhered to. Trading plans shall be available for bona fide transactions. (iii) Principle based Code of Fair Disclosure and Code of Conduct has been prescribed. (iv) In given cases, certain circumstances which can be demonstrated by an insider to prove his innocence have been provided. (v) Repeated disclosures have been removed so as to ease compliance burden and to align with Takeover Code. Disclosure of any change of 2% for persons holding more than 5% shares or voting rights has been removed as they are prescribed under Takeover Code.</td>
