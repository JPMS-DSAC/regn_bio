The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines.

BSE presented their views before the Group on two occasions. The Group also invited the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to present their views. A questionnaire (Annexure 2) was also sent to all the stock exchanges for eliciting their views in writing. The responses to the questionnaire were compiled and analysed (Annexure 3). Delhi Stock exchange (DSE), the Federation of Indian Stock Exchange (FISE), representatives from the BSE Brokers’ Forum and Association of Members of National Stock Exchange of India (AMNI) also made presentations before the Group. Some of the investor association viz. Consumer Education and Re<mark>search</mark> Centre (CERC), Ahmedabad, Jagrut Grahak Mandal and Investor Grievance Forum (IGF) were also given an opportunity to make presentations, but of these, only CERC made their submissions before the Group. 3.2 The Group studied the proposal of BSE on demutualisation submitted to SEBI. The Group also generally examined the existing articles of association, charters, trust deed, rules, regulations and bye laws of the various stock exchanges and in particular the peculiarities of the charter of BSE, for a better understanding and appreciation of the present legal structure and status of the stock exchanges in India. The present tax status of these stock exchanges in the light of the judgments given by the Income Tax Tribunal and the matters pending before the Income Tax Department, the tax implications of the process of corporatisation and demutualisation were also generally studied by the Group. The Group also took note of the experiences of other countries where the stock exchanges were already demutualised viz. Australia, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. In India the NSE stands out as one example of a demutualised stock exchange; the Group felt that it would be helpful if the capital, organizational and management structure of NSE, the shareholding pattern, could be compared with those of other demutualised international stock exchanges (Annexure 4). 4. Existing structure of the stock exchanges in India 4.1 In terms of the legal structure, the stock exchanges which are recognised under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act in India, could be segregated into two broad groups – 20 stock exchanges which were set up as companies, either limited by guarantees or by shares, and the 3 stock exchanges which are functioning as associations of persons (AOP) viz. BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange. The 20 stock exchanges which are companies are: the stock exchanges of Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Gauhati, Hyderabad, Interconnected SE, Jaipur, Ludhiana, Madras, Magadh, Managalore, NSE, Pune, OTCEI, Saurashtra-Kutch, Uttar Pradesh, and Vadodara. Of these, the stock exchanges of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, BSE, Calcutta, Delhi, Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh, Madras and Gauhati were given permanent recognition by the Central Government at the time of setting up of these stock exchanges. Apart from NSE, all stock exchanges whether established as corporate bodies or Association of Persons (AOPs), are non-profit making organizations. 4.2 It is thus clear that BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange will have to be both corporatised and demutualised, while of the balance 20 stock exchanges, 18 stock exchanges which are already corporate entities, will only have to be demutualised. Two stock exchanges, NSE and OTCEI, are not only corporatised but also demutualised with segregation of ownership and trading rights of members. Further, NSEIL is a for-profit company and the Board of NSEIL comprises of representatives of shareholders, (some of whom have 100% stock broking subsidiaries) and outside non-shareholder directors. But even these two stock exchanges may if necessary, have to undergo changes in organizational structure consequential to the recommendations of the Group so that a common structural model is adopted by the all the stock exchanges.</td>

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.
