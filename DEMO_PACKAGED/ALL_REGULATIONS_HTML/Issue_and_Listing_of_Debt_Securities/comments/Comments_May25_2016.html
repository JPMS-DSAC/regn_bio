Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines.

        <td>The capital market is not mainly about equities alone. The bulk of transactions in the capital markets of advanced nations are in <mark>debt securities</mark>. Ever since the Asian Currency Crisis in the late 1990s, it has come to be accepted that a lively market in corporate securities helps the banking system to accurately price current and future assets. This helps to mitigate risk.  However, in our experience debt markets in India have not quite delivered on expectations. We, therefore, need to make efforts to understand why the debt market has not taken off and to take appropriate policy measures to make it deeper, broader and more liquid. While regulation may help in this direction to some extent, we need to reform our financial sector further if we are to have a larger debt market. We need to promote a widely held pension fund system. We need a much larger insurance sector with a higher capital base and more diverse products. It is these which will generate the necessary long-term funds for investing in a debt market and make available resources for the investment needs of our country particularly in the vital infrastructure sector. If we have to achieve our growth ambitions of 8-10% per annum, we need investments of a high order. These would be possible only by making our financial markets more efficient, more competitive and more global. We may currently be lacking a consensus on the needed reforms. However, I am confident that we will in the long run be able to forge a meaningful consensus and take reforms of the financial sector forward.  The Financial Sector in India has now come of age, even though there are a number of issues which need to be resolved. Indeed, it is such issues, even if they be controversial, which encourage discussion and debate and result in furthering our collective understanding. This is the basis of ensuring healthy progress. SEBI, along with other regulators, and civil society, has contributed immensely to this informed discussion and to the identification of relevant issues. This debate is extremely important for all policy makers.</td>
