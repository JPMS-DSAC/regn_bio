Rationale: To expand investment avenues for foreign portfolio investors to include unlisted debt securities and securitized debt instruments. t. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) (Amendment)  Regulations, 2016, w.e.f. August 29, 2016 Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  clarifies  that Regulation  5(2)(b)  of  the  SEBI  (Settlement  of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 is not to prohibit settlements with respect to all kinds  of  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices  and that  Regulation  5(2)(c)  disqualifies  only  defaults which are ‘serious’ and have a market-wide impact or cause substantial losses to investors or affect the rights  of  investors  in  securities,  especially  retail investors and small shareholders. The  Regulations  were  formulated  primarily  to settle  minor  and  technical  violations  not  having a wider impact on the market so that enforcement is  concentrated  on  major  and  significant  cases. However, the intention was not to reject settlements with respect to violations pertaining to fraud. Rationale: clarifications were issued vide the amendment. In  order to remove  ambiguity, u. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) (Amendment)  Regulations, 2017 w.e.f February 27, 2017 Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  provides  for charging interest in case of excessive delays in filing applications  or  payments  of  settlement  amounts;  a settlement notice before issuance of a formal show cause  notice,  except  for  those  which  are  excluded from  settlement;  and  re-application  of  rejected  or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest. Rationale:  These  amendments  are  made  on  the basis of the experience gained and with the purpose of  streamlining  and  strengthening  the  settlement process. v. (Infrastructure SEBI (Amendment)  Regulations, November 30, 2016 Investment  Trusts) 2016  w.e.f. Details: The amendment eases the structuring and offering  requirements  for  InvIT  by  allowing  it  to invest through a two-level SPV structure, reducing the  quantum  of  mandatory  sponsor  holdings, removing the restriction on the number of sponsors and  aligning  the  minimum  public  holding  in  line with  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957 etc.  The  amendment  also  eases  the  process  of registration of InvIT with SEBI by doing away with the requirement of filing the project implementation agreement  at  the  time  of  making  registration application.  The  amendment  also  rationalizes  the requirements for private placement of InvIT and the requirements  for  unit  holder  approval  for  related party  transactions  and  expands  the  definition  of ‘valuer’ under the Regulations. Rationale: To facilitate InvITs’ growth by easing the regulatory framework. 164 SEBI Annual Report 2016-17 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA w. SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure Requirements)  (Amendment)  Regulations, 2016 w.e.f.

Rationale: To prescribe a new mechanism of dealing with financial statements of listed companies which have  been  qualified  by  auditors.  The  new  system which  has  been  made  applicable  from  March  31, 2017  is  simplified  and  will  also  lower  the  cost  of compliance by listed companies. x.

The  Regulations  were  formulated  primarily  to settle  minor  and  technical  violations  not  having a wider impact on the market so that enforcement is  concentrated  on  major  and  significant  cases.
