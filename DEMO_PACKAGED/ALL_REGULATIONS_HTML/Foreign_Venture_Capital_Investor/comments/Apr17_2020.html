With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / non-convertible redeemable preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of the wilful defaulters. Any company or its promoter or its director categorized as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to take control over other listed entity.

Or, any other option as may be decided after consultation. The discussion paper inviting comments will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.</td>

        <td>Jan 14, 2017 PR No.: 5/2017 The SEBI Board met in Jaipur today and took the following decisions: I. Reduction of Fees payable by brokers by 25% and Calibration of other fees SEBI has been following the practice of calibrating the fees either upwards or downwards as per SEBI's requirements from time to time so as to keep a balance between the financial resources required to ensure regulatory efficiency while maintaining reasonableness to avoid any undue burden on any particular class of <mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>SEBI (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>regulation of Listed Entities 1. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges. However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI. SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 to provide for a criteria alternative to "Net Worth" for municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations The SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 (ILDM) provides that a municipality or a Corporate Municipal Entity (CME) making public issue of debt securities, under these regulations shall not have negative net worth in any of three immediately preceding financial years. In order to facilitate issuance of debt securities under these regulations by entities other than CME, the Board agreed that the Municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations shall have surplus as per its Income and Expenditure Statement, in any of the three immediately preceding financial years or any other financial criteria as specified by SEBI from time to time. VII. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 On the basis of experience gained and with the purpose of streamlining and strengthening the settlement process, Board approved amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014.  The amendment</mark>s, inter alia, provide for charging of interest in case of excessive delays in filing of applications or payment of settlement amount;  settlement Notice before issuance of a formal show cause notice, except those which are excluded from settlement; re-application of rejected or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest; situations when  joint and several liability is taken into account for determining settlement amount and Incentive for defaulters to come voluntarily on their own, before initiation of investigation or enforcement action. VIII. Enabling Payment by Digital Mode The Board approved the proposal to amend various Regulations to enable the market participants to make payments to SEBI through digital mode (such as NEFT/RTGS) as well.</td>
