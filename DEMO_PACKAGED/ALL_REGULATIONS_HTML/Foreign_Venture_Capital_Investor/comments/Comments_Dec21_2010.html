        <td> In 1980s and 19990s, it was increasingly realized that an efficient and well developed securities market is essential for sustained economic growth. Without venturing into a detailed discussion, it would suffice if I just say that the securities market fosters economic growth to the extent it augments the quantities of real savings and capital formation from a given level of national income and it raises productivity of investment by improving allocation of investible funds. The extent depends on the quality of the securities market. In order to improve the quality of the market, that is, to improve market efficiency, enhance transparency, preventunfair trade practices and bring the Indian market up to international standards, a package of reforms consisting of measures to liberalise, regulate and develop the securities market is being implemented since early 1990s. Let me sound a little academic, in presence of Sir Davies, to explain why the package included liberalization, regulation and development? Why liberalization? I strongly believe that the more liberalised a securities market is, the better is its impact on economic growth. Interventions in the securities market were originally designed to help governments expropriate much of the seigniorage and control and direct the flow of funds for favoured uses. These helped governments to tap savings on a low or even no-cost basis. Besides, government used to allocate funds from the securities market to competing enterprises and decide the terms of allocation. The result was channelisation of resources to favoured uses rather than sound projects. In such circumstances accumulation of capital per se meant little, where rate of return on some investments were negative while extremely remunerative investment opportunities were foregone. This kept the average rate of return from investment lower than it would otherwise have been and, given the cost of savings, the resulting investment was less than optimum. Hence, it was necessary to do away interventions hindering optimum allocation of resources. Why Regulation? Do you know what a ‘security’ is? Our laws provide an inclusive definition of ‘securities’. It says that ‘securities’ include shares, bonds, debentures, units of CIS, etc. It does not define in terms of ingredients an instrument must have to be considered as ‘securities’. I have not seen an ingredient type definition of ‘securities’ in any other jurisdiction. It is precisely because ‘securities’ are most insecure instruments. The only ingredient common to all types of securities is its associated ‘insecurity’. It is like a blind man named padmalochan. If it is a market for such insecure instruments, market would collapse if some body does not regulate away the insecurities. We need regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures. In the absence of regulation by a specialized agency, each participant would do its own due diligence before undertaking any transaction in the market. This imposes huge social costs. Besides, regulations signal minimum standards of quality and hence enhance confidence in markets. With a known asymmetric information problem, risk averse investors may exit the market altogether if such minimum standards are not signaled. In its extreme form the market breaks down completely. There is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalisation does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. Why development? Unless you develop market, what do you regulate? Unless there is regulation, how does the market develop? It is a chicken and egg issue. Regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combine the elements of regulation and development. Besides, some developmental measures are introduced as a part of general programme for economic and political development. The macro economic policies relating to interest rate, prices, etc can have salubrious effect on the growth and development of the securities market. Other developmental measures include provision of realiable payment system and clearing mechanism, standardized accounting procedure, good corporate governance, skilled manpower etc. which improve the efficiency and transparency of the market. Though it is incidental that reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI, I, by no means, propose to suggest that SEBI is the agency exclusively responsible for all the reforms. These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated. It would do justice with your time and attention if I make a dhobi list of reforms undertaken since early 1990s. In stead let me discuss only a few major reforms. a. Control over Issue of Capital: A major initiative of liberalisation was the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992. With this, Government’s control over issue of capital, pricing of the issues, fixing of premia and rates of interest on debentures etc. ceased and the market was allowed to allocate resources to competing uses. In the interest of investors, SEBI issued Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines. The guidelines allow issuers, complying with the eligibility criteria, to issue securities the securities at market determined rates. The market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation. b. Establishment of Regulator: A major initiative of regulation was establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities. It was empowered adequately and assigned the responsibility to (a) protect the interests of investors in securities, (b) promote the development of the securities market, and (c) regulate the securities market. Its regulatory jurisdiction extends over corporates in the issuance of capital and transfer of securities, in addition to all <mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>intermediaries</mark> are registered and regulated by SEBI. They are also required to appoint a compliance officer who is responsible for monitoring compliance with securities laws and for redressal of investor grievances. c. Screen Based Trading: A major developmental initiative was a nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS) where a member can punch into the computer quantities of securities and the prices at which he likes to transact and the transaction is executed as soon as it finds a matching sale or buy order from a counter party. SBTS electronically matches orders on a strict price/time priority and hence cut down on time, cost and risk of error, as well as on fraud resulting in improved operational efficiency. It allowed faster incorporation of price sensitive information into prevailing prices, thus increasing the informational efficiency of markets. It enabled market participants to see the full market on real-time, making the market transparent. It allowed a large number of participants, irrespective of their geographical locations, to trade with one another simultaneously, improving the depth and liquidity of the market – over 10,000 terminals creating waves by clicks from over 400 towns / cities in India. It provided full anonymity by accepting orders, big or small, from members without revealing their identity, thus providing equal access to everybody. It also provided a perfect audit trail, which helps to resolve disputes by logging in the trade execution process in entirety.</td>

        <td>Straight Through Processing (STP) is generally understood to be a mechanism that automates the end to end processing of transactions of financial instruments. It involves use of a system to process or control all elements of the work flow of a financial transaction, what are commonly known as the Front, Middle, Back office and General Ledger. In other words, STP allows electronic capturing and processing of transactions in one pass from the point of order origination to final settlement. STP thus streamlines the process of trade execution and settlement and avoids manual entry and re-entry of the details of the same trade by different market <mark>intermediaries</mark> and participants. Usage of STP enables orders to be processed, confirmed, settled in a shorter time period and in a more cost effective manner with fewer errors. Apart from compressing the clearing and settlement time, STP also provides a flexible, cost effective infrastructure, which enables e-business expansion through online processing and access to enterprise data. SEBI vide letter dated October 3, 2002 informed the stock exchanges, depositories and custodians that it proposed to introduce STP for electronic trade processing with a common messaging standard ISO 15022 w.e.f December 2, 2002. Accordingly, STP was launched in India on November 30, 2002. Currently, STP is being used by the market participants on a voluntary basis. To facilitate STP, SEBI has also issued circulars SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-15/00 dated December 15, 2000 & circular SEBI/SMD/SE/15/2003/29/04 dated April 29, 2003 which permitted the issue of electronic contract notes with digital signature obtained from a valid Certifying Authority provided under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and circular no. DNPD/Cir-9/04 dated February 3, 2004 & circular no. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-11/2004 dated February 25, 2004 directing exchanges to amend their bye-laws, rules and regulations for the equity and the debt segment to streamline the issuance of electronic contract notes as a legal document like the physical contract note. Exchanges are in the process of amending their bye-laws, rules and regulations. </td>
