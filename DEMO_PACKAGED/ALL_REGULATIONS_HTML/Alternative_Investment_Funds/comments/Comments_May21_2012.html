        <td>The last few years have witnessed initiative by private entrepreneurs to undertake plantation activities on a commercial scale. The effort per se is commendable as it supplements the Governments efforts to prevent erosion of forest base and also channelises private investments towards agro plantation activities. However, it was noticed that the promoters themselves invested a minimal amount in such ventures and sourced a majority of the funds from ordinary investors. The high returns promised by these schemes coupled with questionable claims of fiscal incentives and effective rural marketing helped many of these companies to mobilise large amounts over a period of time. The initial success in mobilising funds by some of these companies lead to a mushrooming of such schemes throughout the country. The Government, after detailed consultations with the regulatory bodies, decided that an appropriate regulatory framework for regulating entities which issue instruments like Agro Bonds, Plantation Bonds etc. has to be put in place. A press release was issued by the Government on November 18, 1997, conveying that such schemes should be treated as Collective Investment Schemes coming under the SEBI Act, 1992. In order to regulate such collective investment schemes, both from the point of view of investor protection as well as promotion of legitimate investment activity, SEBI was asked to formulate the draft regulations for them. These draft regulations were to be made available for public discussion. The investors who have invested in these schemes as well as entities running such schemes will be requested to give their comments on pertinent matters to SEBI for enabling it to formulate appropriate regulations for the collective investment schemes. The press release further states that once these regulations come into force, it is expected that they will promote legitimate investment activity in plantation and other agriculture based business, while at the same time giving investors an adequate degree of protection for their investments. In order to examine and finalize the draft regulations for Collective Investment schemes, SEBI appointed this committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. S. A. Dave. The committee contains representation from the Government Ministries, Regulatory Bodies, Consumer forum, Professional Bodies and Plantation Industry. The committee held its first meeting on January 28, 1998 and began its task by reviewing the information submitted by the existing schemes to gather an insight into the structuring of the offerings by some of the larger Collective Investment Schemes. The data submitted by the existing schemes and its analysis provided by SEBI helped the committee in analysing the aspects relating to scheme features, disclosures, background of promoters etc. The members also conducted site visits of some of the plantations. As per the data available, it was noticed that large sums of monies had been collected by entities which did not necessarily have sufficient experience in agro based activities. The schemes were typically open ended and the disclosures made to the investors were not adequate to enable informed decisions. There were high risks associated with these ventures due to the long gestation period involved coupled with crop risks. The committee members felt that some interim measures of investors protection must be notified pending finalisation of regulations. Accordingly, the committee made a recommendation for mandatory credit rating for existing schemes desiring to mobilise further funds. This provision was expected to provide a degree of risk asses<mark>sme</mark>nt associated with the future cash flows by independent and accredited agencies.</td>

        <td>3.1 The Group held in all 10 meetings. The fundamental issues involved in the process of corporatisation and demutualisation of the stock exchanges were first identified. To obtain a better asses<mark>sme</mark>nt and appreciation of these issues, the Group felt that it would be useful to first hear the different points of view of the major stakeholders in the process of corporatisation and demutualisation viz. the stock exchanges, brokers and investors. Accordingly, the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE), which had already done some work on the subject, and other stock exchanges were invited by the Group to make presentations. BSE presented their views before the Group on two occasions. The Group also invited the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to present their views. A questionnaire (Annexure 2) was also sent to all the stock exchanges for eliciting their views in writing. The responses to the questionnaire were compiled and analysed (Annexure 3). Delhi Stock exchange (DSE), the Federation of Indian Stock Exchange (FISE), representatives from the BSE Brokers’ Forum and Association of Members of National Stock Exchange of India (AMNI) also made presentations before the Group. Some of the investor association viz. Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC), Ahmedabad, Jagrut Grahak Mandal and Investor Grievance Forum (IGF) were also given an opportunity to make presentations, but of these, only CERC made their submissions before the Group. 3.2 The Group studied the proposal of BSE on demutualisation submitted to SEBI. The Group also generally examined the existing articles of association, charters, trust deed, rules, regulations and bye laws of the various stock exchanges and in particular the peculiarities of the charter of BSE, for a better understanding and appreciation of the present legal structure and status of the stock exchanges in India. The present tax status of these stock exchanges in the light of the judgments given by the Income Tax Tribunal and the matters pending before the Income Tax Department, the tax implications of the process of corporatisation and demutualisation were also generally studied by the Group. The Group also took note of the experiences of other countries where the stock exchanges were already demutualised viz. Australia, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. In India the NSE stands out as one example of a demutualised stock exchange; the Group felt that it would be helpful if the capital, organizational and management structure of NSE, the shareholding pattern, could be compared with those of other demutualised international stock exchanges (Annexure 4). 4. Existing structure of the stock exchanges in India 4.1 In terms of the legal structure, the stock exchanges which are recognised under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act in India, could be segregated into two broad groups – 20 stock exchanges which were set up as companies, either limited by guarantees or by shares, and the 3 stock exchanges which are functioning as associations of persons (AOP) viz. BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange. The 20 stock exchanges which are companies are: the stock exchanges of Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Gauhati, Hyderabad, Interconnected SE, Jaipur, Ludhiana, Madras, Magadh, Managalore, NSE, Pune, OTCEI, Saurashtra-Kutch, Uttar Pradesh, and Vadodara. Of these, the stock exchanges of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, BSE, Calcutta, Delhi, Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh, Madras and Gauhati were given permanent recognition by the Central Government at the time of setting up of these stock exchanges. Apart from NSE, all stock exchanges whether established as corporate bodies or Association of Persons (AOPs), are non-profit making organizations. 4.2 It is thus clear that BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange will have to be both corporatised and demutualised, while of the balance 20 stock exchanges, 18 stock exchanges which are already corporate entities, will only have to be demutualised. Two stock exchanges, NSE and OTCEI, are not only corporatised but also demutualised with segregation of ownership and trading rights of members. Further, NSEIL is a for-profit company and the Board of NSEIL comprises of representatives of shareholders, (some of whom have 100% stock broking subsidiaries) and outside non-shareholder directors. But even these two stock exchanges may if necessary, have to undergo changes in organizational structure consequential to the recommendations of the Group so that a common structural model is adopted by the all the stock exchanges.</td>
