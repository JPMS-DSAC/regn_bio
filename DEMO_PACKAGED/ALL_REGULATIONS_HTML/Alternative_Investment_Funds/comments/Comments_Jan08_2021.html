Pursuant to the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in the matter of  Roofit Industries Ltd., a need arose for clarifying the monetary penalty provisions in the securities laws, relating to cases prior to 2014.  In view of this, Board approved to send a proposal to the Central Government for amendment</mark>s in the law.</td>

Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, employee cost and other direct expenditure. 7) Research and development expenses: Research expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Development costs of products are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless a product’s technical feasibility has been established, in which case such expenditure is capitalized. Tangible assets used in research and development are capitalized. Expenditure incurred towards other development activity where the research results or other knowledge is applied for developing new or improved products or processes, are recognised as an Intangible Asset if the recognition criteria specified in Ind AS 38 are met and when the product or process developed is expected to be technically and commercially usable, the company has sufficient resources to complete development and subsequently use or sell the intangible asset, and the product or process is likely to generate future economic benefits. 8) Impairment of Non-financial assets  At the end of each Balance Sheet date, carrying amount of assets are reviewed, if there is any indication of impairment based on internal/external factors. If the estimated recoverable amount is found to be lower than the carrying amount, then the impairment loss is recognised and assets are written down to the recoverable amount. 9) Depreciation /Amortisation  Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation on additions and deletions to fixed assets during the year is provided on pro-rata basis as under: a. Depreciation is reckoned in full for the month of addition for the assets commissioned on or before 15th day of a month while no depreciation is reckoned for the month of addition for the assets commissioned after 15th of the month.  b. In respect of assets sold, discarded, damaged or destroyed on or before 15th day of a month no depreciation is reckoned for the month of deletion while for the assets sold, discarded, damaged or destroyed after 15th of the month depreciation is reckoned in full for the month of deletion. c. Where cost of a part of the asset is significant to the total cost of the asset and useful life of that part is different from the useful life of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant part is determined separately and depreciated on straight line method over its estimated useful life.  d. The Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Amortization Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically at each financial year end. In the case of depreciable assets which have been revalued, depreciation is calculated on straight line method on the revalued amount. Incremental depreciation on account of Revaluation is recouped as a credit to the general Reserve, as per the Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013. Disposal of property, plant and equipment An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 192 Particulars (Years) A.

Assets costing less than ₹5,000/- are depreciated @ 100%  However, in respect of assets having original cost of ₹50,000/- and above, a residual balance of ₹5/- has been retained in the books.  10) Leases A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease.  Company as a Lessee Finance leases are capitalised at lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments on commencement of the lease. Finance charges are recognised as Finance Costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset or lease term, whichever is lower.  Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except when the lease payments escalate in accordance general inflation or are otherwise justified Company as a lessor Operating lease income is recognised over the lease term on straight line basis, except when the escalations are due to general inflation or otherwise justified. Contingent rents, if any, are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. In case of a finance lease, amounts due from lessees are recorded as receivables as the Company’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 11) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale is capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. General borrowing costs are capitalised to qualifying assets by applying a capitalisation rate, which is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the general borrowings outstanding, other than specific borrowings, to the expenditure on that asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds, as also exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.  19312) Government Grants  Grants from Government are measured at fair value and initially recognized as Deferred Income. Amount lying under Deferred Income on account of acquisition of Fixed Assets is transferred to the credit of the Statement of Profit and Loss in proportion to the depreciation charged on the respective assets to the extent attributable to Government Grants utilised for the acquisition. Amount lying under Deferred Income on account of revenue expenses is transferred to the credit of the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent of expenditure incurred in the ratio of the funding to the total sanctioned cost, limited to the grant received. 13) Investments in joint venture and associates  Company accounts for its interests in associates and joint ventures at cost or in accordance with Ind AS 109 in the standalone financial statements but in the consolidated Financial statements under equity method. 14) Inventories  Raw materials, components and stores purchased for manufacturing/production activities are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. Cost is calculated on weighted average rate as at the end of the year. Where same items are purchased as also manufactured, manufacturing costs are generally adopted. Raw materials and production stores with ancillaries and fabricators are valued at lower of cost at the time of such issue and net realizable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. Manufactured items in stock and stock-in-trade are valued at lower of cost excluding interest charges, administration overheads & sales overheads and at the net realisable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. Precious metals scrap is brought to books at the year end at net realizable value. 15) Work-in-process a. Work-in-process (production) is valued on the basis of physically verified quantities at lower of cost excluding interest charges, administration & sales overheads and at the net realisable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any.  b. Work-in-process (Installation) is valued at lower of cost as recorded in the work orders and net realizable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. 16) Tools and Gauges Expenditure on special purpose tools and fixtures is initially capitalized at cost and then amortized over production on a systematic basis, based on technical asses<mark>sme</mark><mark>sme</mark>nt. 21) Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at their respective currency exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency exchange rate at the reporting date.  Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the functional currency exchange rate at the dates of the initial transactions. 22) Employee benefits a. Short-term employee benefits are recognised as an expense at the undiscounted amount in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in which the related service is rendered.  b. Post-employment benefit viz. gratuity and other long-term employee benefits viz. Privilege Leave, Sick Leave and LLTC are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in which the employee has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.

Ever since, as a pioneering venture in the field of telecommunications, it has contributed to 50% of the present national telecom network. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across six locations and a countrywide network of marketing/service outlets, the company offers a complete range of telecom products and total solutions covering the whole spectrum of Switching, Transmission, Access and Subscriber Premises equipment. ITI joined the league of world class vendors of Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology with the inauguration of mobile equipment manufacturing facilities at its Mankapur and Rae Bareli Plants in 2005-06. This ushered in a new era of indigenous mobile equipment production in the country. These two facilities supply more than nine million lines per annum to both domestic as well as export markets.  1) Basis of Preparation  The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (GAAP), on accrual basis of accounting, except as stated herein. GAAP comprises the mandatory Accounting Standards (IND -AS) [as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] to the extent applicable, provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, which have been consistently applied except where a new Accounting Standard is initially adopted or revision to an existing Accounting Standard requires a change in the Accounting Policy hitherto in use. Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value: a. Derivative financial instruments, if any b. Financial assets and liabilities that are qualified to be measured at fair value c. Defined benefit asset/(liability) recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. 2) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although such estimates are made on a reasonable and prudent basis taking into account all the available information, actual results could differ from the estimates and such differences are recognised in the period in which the results are ascertained. 3) Functional and presentation currency Financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest lakhs except share and per share data. 4) Revenue Recognition a. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the customer as per the terms of sale agreement, neither continuing management involvement nor effective control over the goods is retained, recovery of the consideration is probable, and the amount of cost incurred and the revenue 189can be measured reliably. Timing of transfer of risks and rewards is evaluated based on Inco-terms of the sales agreement. Ex- Works Contract  When specified goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract after prior Inspection and acceptance, if required. b. FOR Contracts In the case of FOR contracts, sale is recognised when goods are handed over to the carrier for transmission to the buyer after prior inspection and acceptance, if stipulated, and in the case of FOR destination contracts, if there is a reasonable expectation of the goods reaching destination within the accounting period. Revenue is recognised even if goods are retained with the Company at the request of the customer. c. Bill and Hold Sales For bill-and-hold transactions, revenue is recognised when the customer takes title, provided that: i. it is probable that delivery will be made; ii. the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time when the sale is recognised; iii. the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions; the usual payment terms apply d. Construction contracts Contract revenue includes initial amount agreed in the contract and any variations in the contract work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Stage of completion is assessed based on the ratio of actual costs incurred on the contract up to the reporting date to the estimated total costs expected to complete the contract.  If the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. When it is probable that contract costs at completion will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss at completion is recognised immediately as an expense.  e. Price escalations In case of contracts where additional consideration is to be determined and approved by the customers, such additional revenue is recognised on receipt of confirmation from the customer(s). Where break up prices of sub units sold are not provided for, the same are estimated. f. Bundled contracts  In case of a Bundled contract, where separate fee for installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component   is not stipulated, the Company applies recognition criteria to separately identifiable components (sale of goods, installation, commissioning, etc.) of the transaction and allocates revenue to those separate components based on their relative fair value. g. Multiple elements In cases where the installation and commissioning or any other separately identifiable component is stipulated and price for the same agreed separately, the Company applies the recognition criteria to separately identified components (sale of goods and installation and commissioning, etc.) of the transaction, allocates the revenue to those separate components based on the contract. h. Sales exclude Sales Tax / Value Added Tax (VAT)/Goods and Service Tax (GST)/Service Tax. Export Sales are treated as sales on issue of Bill of Lading Provision is made separately for likely disallowance by customers including Liquidated Damages for contracts executed during the year. i. Supply of services Revenue from annual maintenance contracts relating to the year is recognised when the contracts are entered into on time proportion basis. Revenue is recognized at the time of rendering services. 190For other fixed-price contracts (including sale of software related services), revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the work performed. No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or if the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured reliably. j. Interest income Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. k. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established l. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless increases in rentals are in line with the expected inflation or otherwise justified (Fair Value). m. Duty Drawbacks Duty drawback claims on exports are accounted on preferring the claims. n. Other Income Other Income not specifically stated above is recognised on accrual basis. 5) Property, plant and equipment, Capital Work-in progress  Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any. Cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the PPE to its working condition for its intended use. Borrowing and other attributable costs relating to acquisition of the PPE which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such PPE are ready to be put to use. PPE are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from such use. When significant parts of Plant and Equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the same is recognised as a separate component.  Assets acquired free of cost or received as gift      are stated at fair value which is credited to Other Equity at the time of acquisition or receipt less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress Assets under installation or under construction as at the Balance Sheet date are shown as Capital Work-In-Progress. Income pertaining to construction period such as interest on advance to contractors, sale of tender documents etc., is set off against expenditure during construction.  Expenditure on development of leasehold land is capitalised as Land Development Expenditure and amortised over the lease period or useful, life whichever is lower. In the event of revaluation of entire class of PPE, if the revalued amount is greater than the carrying amount of the PPE, such difference is taken to the Revaluation Reserve. If the revalued amount is lower than the carrying amount of the PPE and if the class of PPE has already been revalued, difference is set off against the amount available under the Revaluation Reserve for the same class of PPE and excess thereof, life any, is charged to the statement of Profit and Loss. 6) Intangible Assets, Intangible Asset under Development a. Cost of software (which is not an integral part of the related hardware) acquired for internal use and resulting in significant future economic benefits, is recognised as an intangible asset when the same is ready for use.  Intangible Assets not yet ready for their intended use as at the Balance Sheet date are classified as “Intangible Assets under Development b. Cost of developmental work which is completed, wherever eligible, is recognized as an Intangible Asset. c. Cost of developmental work under progress, wherever eligible, is classified as “Intangible Assets under Development”. 191d. Carrying amount includes amount funded by the Company to external agencies towards developmental project(s) and expenditure incurred by the Company towards material cost, employee cost and other direct expenditure. 7) Research and development expenses: Research expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Development costs of products are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless a product’s technical feasibility has been established, in which case such expenditure is capitalized. Tangible assets used in research and development are capitalized. Expenditure incurred towards other development activity where the research results or other knowledge is applied for developing new or improved products or processes, are recognised as an Intangible Asset if the recognition criteria specified in Ind AS 38 are met and when the product or process developed is expected to be technically and commercially usable, the company has sufficient resources to complete development and subsequently use or sell the intangible asset, and the product or process is likely to generate future economic benefits. 8) Impairment of Non-financial assets  At the end of each Balance Sheet date, carrying amount of assets are reviewed, if there is any indication of impairment based on internal/external factors. If the estimated recoverable amount is found to be lower than the carrying amount, then the impairment loss is recognised and assets are written down to the recoverable amount. 9) Depreciation /Amortisation  Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation on additions and deletions to fixed assets during the year is provided on pro-rata basis as under: a. Depreciation is reckoned in full for the month of addition for the assets commissioned on or before 15th day of a month while no depreciation is reckoned for the month of addition for the assets commissioned after 15th of the month.  b. In respect of assets sold, discarded, damaged or destroyed on or before 15th day of a month no depreciation is reckoned for the month of deletion while for the assets sold, discarded, damaged or destroyed after 15th of the month depreciation is reckoned in full for the month of deletion. c. Where cost of a part of the asset is significant to the total cost of the asset and useful life of that part is different from the useful life of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant part is determined separately and depreciated on straight line method over its estimated useful life.  d. The Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Amortization Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically at each financial year end. In the case of depreciable assets which have been revalued, depreciation is calculated on straight line method on the revalued amount. Incremental depreciation on account of Revaluation is recouped as a credit to the general Reserve, as per the Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013. Disposal of property, plant and equipment An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 192 Particulars (Years) A.

Assets costing less than ₹5,000/- are depreciated @ 100%  However, in respect of assets having original cost of ₹50,000/- and above, a residual balance of ₹5/- has been retained in the books.  10) Leases A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease.  Company as a Lessee Finance leases are capitalised at lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments on commencement of the lease. Finance charges are recognised as Finance Costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset or lease term, whichever is lower.  Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except when the lease payments escalate in accordance general inflation or are otherwise justified Company as a lessor Operating lease income is recognised over the lease term on straight line basis, except when the escalations are due to general inflation or otherwise justified. Contingent rents, if any, are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. In case of a finance lease, amounts due from lessees are recorded as receivables as the Company’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 11) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale is capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. General borrowing costs are capitalised to qualifying assets by applying a capitalisation rate, which is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the general borrowings outstanding, other than specific borrowings, to the expenditure on that asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds, as also exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.  19312) Government Grants  Grants from Government are measured at fair value and initially recognized as Deferred Income. Amount lying under Deferred Income on account of acquisition of Fixed Assets is transferred to the credit of the Statement of Profit and Loss in proportion to the depreciation charged on the respective assets to the extent attributable to Government Grants utilised for the acquisition. Amount lying under Deferred Income on account of revenue expenses is transferred to the credit of the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent of expenditure incurred in the ratio of the funding to the total sanctioned cost, limited to the grant received. 13) Investments in joint venture and associates  Company accounts for its interests in associates and joint ventures at cost or in accordance with Ind AS 109 in the standalone financial statements but in the consolidated Financial statements under equity method. 14) Inventories  Raw materials, components and stores purchased for manufacturing/production activities are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. Cost is calculated on weighted average rate as at the end of the year. Where same items are purchased as also manufactured, manufacturing costs are generally adopted. Raw materials and production stores with ancillaries and fabricators are valued at lower of cost at the time of such issue and net realizable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. Manufactured items in stock and stock-in-trade are valued at lower of cost excluding interest charges, administration overheads & sales overheads and at the net realisable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. Precious metals scrap is brought to books at the year end at net realizable value. 15) Work-in-process a. Work-in-process (production) is valued on the basis of physically verified quantities at lower of cost excluding interest charges, administration & sales overheads and at the net realisable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any.  b. Work-in-process (Installation) is valued at lower of cost as recorded in the work orders and net realizable value, after providing for obsolescence, if any. 16) Tools and Gauges Expenditure on special purpose tools and fixtures is initially capitalized at cost and then amortized over production on a systematic basis, based on technical asses<mark>sme</mark><mark>sme</mark>nt. 21) Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at their respective currency exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency exchange rate at the reporting date.  Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the functional currency exchange rate at the dates of the initial transactions. 22) Employee benefits a. Short-term employee benefits are recognised as an expense at the undiscounted amount in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in which the related service is rendered.  b. Post-employment benefit viz. gratuity and other long-term employee benefits viz. Privilege Leave, Sick Leave and LLTC are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in which the employee has rendered services. Expense is recognised at the present value of the amounts payable determined using actuarial valuation techniques.  c. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability (asset), to the net defined liability (asset) at the start of the financial year after taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments during the year. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Expenditure related to voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) is written off in the year of incidence. 23) Provision & Contingent Liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 195If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts other than construction contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  Provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 24) Fair value measurement The Company measures certain financial instruments, such as derivatives and other items in its financial statements at fair value at each balance sheet date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or   liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). For purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy. 25) Investment property Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 26) Financial Instruments a. Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are included in the cost of the asset. b. Subsequent measurement c. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: i. Debt instruments at amortised cost, ii. Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), iii. Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), iv. Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). Derecognition A financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired        Embedded derivative Embedded derivative, if required, is separated from host contract and measured at fair value.   19627) Forward Contracts The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 28) Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts, if any, are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 29) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets with credit risk exposure. a. Time barred dues from the Government / Government Departments / Government Companies are generally not considered as increase in credit risk of such financial asset. b. Where dues are disputed in legal proceedings, provision is made if any decision is given against the Company even if the same is taken up on appeal to higher authorities / courts. c. In case of dues outstanding for a significant period of time, on a case to case basis ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as expense/ (income) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected in a separate line in Profit and Loss Statement as an impairment gain or loss. 30) Financial Liabilities a. Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, at fair value through Profit and Loss as loans, borrowings, payables, or derivatives, as appropriate. Loans, borrowings and payables, are stated net of transaction costs that are directly attributable. b. Subsequent measurement Measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: i. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ii. Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. d. Trade and other payables Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not. 31) Reclassification of Financial Instruments The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if 197there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively. 32) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 33) Cash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity shareholders The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. 34) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 35) Events after the reporting period Adjusting events are events that provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements are adjusted for such events before authorisation for issue.  Non-adjusting events are events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period. Non-adjusting events after the reporting date are not accounted but disclosed. 36) New standards and interpretations not yet effective: A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The effect of the same is being evaluated by the Company. 37) Consolidation ITI has invested in 49% of Equity Share Capital of its Joint Venture "India Satcom Limited" for the cost of ₹40.55 lakhs.
