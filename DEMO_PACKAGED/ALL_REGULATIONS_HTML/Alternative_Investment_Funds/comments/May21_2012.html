        <td>Securities  and Exchange Board of India Consultative Paper <mark>amendments to SEBI on (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 1.   On  1st  January  2008,  SEBI  came  out  with  a  consultative  paper  to  introduce “short swing profit” regulations by amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 and sought public comments on the same. In addition to the proposal of 1st January, public comment is being sought on several other proposed amendments to the regulations. 2.  Amendments were carried out in 2002 to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 (the regulations) to introduce a wide range of prophylactics and corporate governance norms. 3.  Over the course of the past few years since the amendment, there have been some new learnings in terms of the way the regulations have played out in the market.  The  key  amendments  brought  in  processes  which  would  reduce  the possibilities of insider trading by means of an institutionalized methodology e.g. pre-clearance of trades, black-out  windows  of  trading,  disclosure  of  buy/sell  by certain  insiders,  appointment  of  compliance  officer  and  a  catena  of  other provisions. 4.  There  have  been  several  instances  of  persons  of  high  integrity  committing unintended violations of these provisions. Thus, we need to be sensitive to the -1- Securities and Exchange Board of India fact that perhaps the norms have been set so high that even experts are unable to  keep  track  and  be  in  compliance  with  these  standards.  This  is  an  important issue as criminal jeopardy is attached to such corporate governance violations. In addition, there is a need to move towards a more principle based approach to regulations rather than a rule based approach, particularly in matters of corporate governance. 5.  In addition, some regulations are also proposed to be introduced. Background 6.  The  2002  amendments  to  the  Regulations  provide  extensive  suggestions  and regulations.  Most  of  the  good  governance  provisions  are  provided  for  as mandatory provisions. Briefly, the good governance regulations provide for: a) Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. b) Appointment of a compliance officer. c) Setting forth policies and procedure to restrict the possibility of abuse of insider trading. d) Monitoring and pre-clearance of trades by the designated persons. e) Restrict trading by such insiders within a certain period of time i.e. before corporate announcements, buybacks etc. are made. f) The company has to convey all the significant insider activity and corporate disclosure in a uniform publicly accessible means to the public – and to the stock exchange. g) Chinese walls within a firm to prevent one part of the firm which deals in sensitive information from going to other parts of the firm which have an inherent conflict of interest with such other parts. h) Minimum holding period of securities by insiders. i) No selective disclosure to analysts. Wide dissemination of information. -2- Securities and Exchange Board of India 7.  Provided  below  is  an  analysis  of  some  of  the  provisions  of  good  governance regulations and proposals for amendments. Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. 8.  There should be some coordination between the requirements of acquisition/sale of  shares  reported  in  these  regulations  with  the  requirements  of  the  takeover regulations. In fact the takeover reporting is broader since it mandates reporting by any person over certain thresholds and also requires reporting by a group – a concept  not  introduced  in  these  Regulations.  However,  the  insider  trading Regulations  provide  for  disclosure  of  smaller  amounts  and  provides  for disclosure  on  selling  shares  (something  which  the  takeover  code  does  not mandate). Proposal:  It  is  suggested  that  a  purchase  disclosure  made  under  either regulations (with the same or higher level of disclosure) should be deemed to be is  also  proposed good  disclosure  under the harmonization between the two in terms of threshold limits set. Regulatory Impact Assessment: As there is a proposal to harmonise the two regulation</mark>s, there is expected to be neither a substantial change in the burden on insiders nor will there be a dilution of the rights of investors. To the extent of deemed disclosure, there will be a reduction in cost without any reduction in benefit to investors.</td>
