With a view to protect the interest of investors and to promote development of and to regulate the securities market and in particular the stock exchanges in terms of Section 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and further pursuant to sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the powers delegated by the Central Government under its notification no. SO/573(E) dated July 3, 1992 issued under 29 A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as " the Board") had through its communication dated August 19, 1992 consulted the stock exchanges on certain specific issues relating to the reconstitution of the governing bodies of the stock exchanges (hereinafter referred to as "governing bodies"), the appointment of Executive Directors including the constitution of disciplinary, arbitration and default committees of the stock exchanges; AND 2. After taking into account, the views expressed by several stock exchanges, the Board by its communication dated November 20, 1992 advised all the stock exchanges to take steps to amend their Rules or Articles of Association; AND 3. In response to the said communication dated November 20, 1992, while several stock exchanges have expressed their willingness to carry out the amendments to their respective Rules and Articles of Association, others have either suggested modifications or opposed or shown reluctance to carry out such amendments; AND 4. By a further communication dated January 1, 1993 the Board had proposed specific terms of office for President and Vice-President of the Stock Exchanges, AND 5. The Board has since considered various proposals in the light of further suggestions received from the stock exchanges pursuant to above mentioned communications and it is of the opinion that in interest of the investors and the capital market as also in the public interest , it is necessary and expedient to amend the Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, of the stock exchanges in the manner indicated in this Order for the following reasons namely : (i) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to effectively and promptly implement the directives issued by the Central Government; (ii) Some governing bodies have shown reluctance or indifference or have failed to take adequate steps for the appointment of Executive Director; (iii) The disciplinary, arbitration and default committees as constituted at present have failed to take quick, effective or timely action against erring brokers; (iv) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to enforce the Articles of Association, Rules, Regulations and Bye-laws of the stock exchanges; (v) It is a matter of common knowledge that when some members get elected on the governing board including as President or Vice-President or as members for several years they get into a position whereby they can exert excessive influence in the affairs of the stock exchange which is not desirable in the public interest; (vi) There is a need to broad base the membership of the governing bodies, and make them fully representative of various interests in the securities market in order to ensure that the affairs of the stock exchanges are conducted on healthy lines with the highest standards of professional conduct, business ethics and morality to inspire and sustain the confidence of the investing public. NOW THEREFORE in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, read with the powers delegated to the Board by the Central Government under section 29A of the said Act, the Board hereby directs all the recognised stock exchanges, more particularly mentioned in the Schedule hereunder written, to take steps, immediately but in any case not later than six months from the date of this Order, for amendment of their respective Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, be provide for the following matters :- 1.

Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8.

Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

Registrars may ensure that the stockinvests are used by the purchaser(s) within 10 days of issue.. (For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13.

The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

This mark up was applicable to close out of equities as well as debentures and bonds. SEBI has received representations from the exchanges that the debentures and bond issued by the companies and traded at the exchanges do not experience daily price variation in fashion similar to the equities and that the presently applicable 20% close out mark up is almost equal to the interest due on bonds and debentures in most cases and thus is unduly high. The matter was discussed in the Advisory Committee on Derivatives and Market Risk Management. Pursuant to the discussions of the Advisory Committee on Derivatives and Market Risk Management, it has been decided that close out mark up of 5% would be applied in case of debentures and bonds which are assigned a credit rating of triple A and above. However, for the other debentures and the bonds without the triple A credit rating, the existing close out mark up of 20% shall be applicable as is applicable in the case of equities.

Dear Sir, Sub: Issuance of Electronic Contract Notes This is in continuation of the SEBI circular no. SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-15/00 dated December 15, 2000 and clarification issued vide letter dated SEBI/SMD/SE/15/2003/29/04 dated April 29, 2003 on the issue of an electronic contract note whereby SEBI had permitted the issue of electronic contract notes with digital signature obtained from a valid Certifying Authority provided under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). The exchanges were directed to make the necessary <mark>amendments to the bye-laws, rules and regulations for the implementation of the same. It has been brought to the notice of SEBI that the format of the electronic contract note prescribed by the exchanges were not in conformity with the format of the physical contract note particularly with respect to the pre-printed terms and conditions. Hence members issuing electronic contract notes were also issuing physical contract notes which amounted to duplication and unnecessary reconciliation between the physical and electronic contract notes. In order to streamline the issuance of electronic contract notes as a legal document like the physical contract note, the exchanges are advised to implement the following: The exchanges would prescribe a standard format for the electronic contract note (based on the model format prescribed in Annexure A) in its bye-laws, rules and regulations. The exchange bye-laws, rules and regulations for issuance of electronic contract note shall be amended to include all the standard pre-printed terms and conditions in the physical contract note. The electronic contract note would mention the relevant bye-laws / rules / regulations of the exchange subject to which the said contract note is being issued. The exchange shall also modify / amend other relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations with respect to signing of the electronic contract note with a digital signature so as to make the modified format of the electronic contract note a valid legal document like the physical contract note. The mechanism of record keeping of electronic contract notes in a soft non-tamperable form shall be prescribed by the exchange in compliance with the provisions of the IT Act, 2000. Hence you are advised to, - Make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark><mark>securities market</mark>. Yours sincerely, N. PARAKH</td>

        <td>Dear Sir/s, Sub: Transfer-cum-demat scheme 1.      SEBI had introduced compulsory dematerialized trading in select shares for all investors with effect from January, 1999. Thereafter, an increasing number of shares were added to this list at regular intervals. During this phase, the companies/transfer agents were under tremendous pressure on account of the large number of physical shares being received by them for transfer and/or demat. Moreover, transfer and demat were two separate processes and the investors were required to submit the transferred shares to the share transfer agent, through their DPs, for dematerialization. This entire process involved anywhere from 1-3 months and the investors could not sell the shares during this period. 2.      Accordingly, the transfer-cum-demat scheme was introduced by the depositories to counter the problems faced by the investors in the transition phase of moving from physical to demat trading mode, to decrease the time period involved in transfer and demat. However, as on date, a large number of stocks have already been dematerialized, almost 100% trading takes place in dematerialized form and hence, there is far less pressure on the companies/the share transfer agents. 3.      In view of the above, it is felt that the facility of transfer-cum-demat is no longer relevant and can be withdrawn without causing any undue inconvenience and/or delays to the investors. It has accordingly been decided to withdraw the transfer-cum-demat scheme. 4.      The depositories are accordingly advised to ; 4.1.   make necessary <mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark><mark>securities market</mark>.

        <td>"This is a key component in devising a regulatory system which is both effective in pursuit of its objectives, and also which wins the respect and perhaps even the approval of the regulated community", Sir Davies said. Skilled regulatory resources are scarce anywhere, and particularly in developing countries. It is therefore absolutely crucial that those resources are deployed where they can make most impact, and where the need is greatest. Stressing the need for international regulatory cooperation, Sir Davies said that "it is no longer adequate for a regulator in any country to focus on domestic standards only. Any regulator must ensure that its practices are compatible with internationally agreed codes." The Governor of Maharashtra, His Excellency Shri Mohammed Fazal, said that "the role of SEBI is of prime importance to safeguard the interests of the common investor who is totally ignorant about the business environment and global trends and hence cannot assess the future of the industries". Appreciating the "metamorphosis from physical to electronic transactions", as a "welcome development", the Governor said that "this is a healthy step towards gaining the confidence of small investors for which SEBI needs to be congratulated". Tracing the growth of the <mark>securities market</mark><mark>regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures". Explaining further on the need for regulation, Shri Bajpai said "regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combined the elements of regulation and development. ." On liberalization versus regulation, the Chairman said that " there is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalization does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. ". "Reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI", Shri Bajpai said. "These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated", he added. Shri Bajpai also highlighted the reforms in the securities market in India viz. the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992 and issuance of Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines by SEBI, thereby the market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation, establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities and introduction of nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS). "A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the participants are safe and market integrity is protected", Shri Bajpai said and gave examples of Reduction of Trading Cycle to T+2, dematerialization of stocks, introduction of derivatives, establishment of Settlement Guarantee Fund, setting up of the Central Listing Authority etc. On the future initiatives of SEBI, Shri Bajpai spoke about the setting up of a national institute to build a cadre of professionals to man the specialized functions in the securities market, corporatisation and demutualization of exchanges, introduction if market wide straight through processing from trade initiation to settlement, migration to T+1 rolling settlement, continuous review and upgradation of accounting standards, disclosures, corporate governance practices in the interest of investors, continuous review and amendment</mark><mark>securities market</mark> a model for other jurisdictions to follow and make SEBI the most dynamic and respected regulator globally."</td>

In  this  regard,  the  Group  has  also deliberated on the difficulty involved in classifying certain activities such as opinions expressed by experts through electronic media or press as that of Research Analysts.</td>

Please refer to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/IMD/CIR No.10/1756/04 dated January 27,2004, on the captioned subject. Under point no. 4 of the said SEBI circular, it has been mentioned inter alia that the secrecy of the UCC shall be maintained by the mutual funds and the same shall be furnished only to the member broker through whom the mutual funds are trading. SEBI has received a request from AMFI that mutual funds should be allowed to share the UCC with their clients (unitholders) for complying with the Income Tax Rules pertaining to claiming of Tax benefit linked to payment of  Securities Transaction Tax (STT). 2. In order to facilitate the unitholders to claim the tax benefit associated with payment of STT, it has now been decided to allow mutual funds to share the UCC of their schemes/plans with their unitholders. 3. All other provisions of the aforesaid Circular dated January 27,2004 remain unchanged. 4. These guidelines are issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with the provisions of regulation 77 of <mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>securities market</mark>.

(Specific connectivity issues of the custodians and members shall not be considered as valid exceptions).

Such trades would however be subject to penalties as may be imposed by the stock exchanges. b.      In case evidence as above is not available with the stock exchange, the stock exchange, while allowing the trade to be settled through Hand Delivery Bargain on a DVP basis will however impose both margin and penalties. 6.

        <td>Dear Sir/s, Sub: Review of Dematerialisation Charges 1.      After detailed deliberations, as a first step, SEBI vide circular No.MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir-4/2005 dated 28th January, 2005 rationalized the tariff structure with regard to account opening charges, custody charges and transaction charges towards the credit of securities. 2.      Pursuant to the representations from the investor community and in order to encourage more investors to hold securities in demat mode,  SEBI vide aforesaid circular made entry into the demat environment free except from applicable statutory charges. 3.      It is observed that Depositories and Depository Participants (DPs) have been levying transaction charges for the transfer of securities from one DP to another DP although no account closure charges are levied by the  depositories or depository participants. This implies that an investor, who is not satisfied with the services of a DP, can move his BO account to another DP, only at a cost. It is desirable that investors are freed of this cost. 4.      In view of the above, it has been decided that with effect from January 09, 2006 (Monday), no charges shall be levied by a depository on DP and consequently, by a DP on a Beneficiary Owner (BO) when a BO transfers all the securities lying in his account to another branch of the same DP or to another DP of the same depository or another depository, provided the BO Account/s at transferee DP and at transferor DP are one and the same, i.e. identical in all respects. In case the BO Account at transferor DP is a joint account, the BO Account at transferee DP should also be a joint account in the same sequence of ownership. 5.      The depositories/DPs are advised to put in place necessary systems and procedures to differentiate between an account closure transaction and a normal debit transaction on or before January 08, 2006 so as to avoid any problems in the live environment and ensure smooth implementation of the aforesaid decision. 6.      The Depositories are advised to:- a)     make <mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark><mark>securities market</mark>.

The average sale price works out to Rs.61.40 per share. Reckoning the issue price of Rs.45/- per share, the total profit earned by the five entities on sale of 8,39,500 shares works out to Rs. 1,37,67,800/-. A similar modus operandi as above has been adopted by Sugandh who received 150 shares each from 1315 dematerialized accounts aggregating to 197250 shares in off market transactions. It in turn had, on July 08, 2005 transferred 196050 shares to the dematerialized account of 3 entities Sujal Leasing and Finance P. Ltd., Ritaben R Thakkar and Veenaben Y Thakkar. The above three entities sold 1,94,250 shares at an average sale price of Rs.61.61 per share on NSE for a total sale value of Rs. 1,19,68,708.45. The total profit earned by the three entities on sale of 1,94,250 shares works out to Rs. 32,26,492.50 reckoning the issue price of Rs.45/- as cost of acquisition of these shares. It appears that the above profit has been earned by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Sugandh would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants. Further probe is required for examining the systemic fault, if any, of the registrar Karvy-RTI i.e. Karvy Computershares P Ltd. and the lead managers DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd. and Enam Financial Consultants P Ltd. in identifying and weeding out the benami applications. Also, the role of Karvy-DP that opened the dematerialized accounts of 6315 entities being benamis of Roopalben Panchal and 1315 entities being benamis of Sugandh probably without taking adequate steps to ascertain the genuineness of these entities while acting as a facilitator in what appears to be an act of either gross negligence or active collusion ill behoves them as a SEBI registered market participant. It is matter of concern that NSDL, which is a self-regulatory organization and within whose regulatory domain Karvy-DP falls, could not detect in advance the apparently systemic deficiencies in Karvy-DP.

        <td>Though the various parties involved in the different stages of the entire chain of events might claim their part as genuine, the same cannot be countenanced at this juncture of the proceedings, where the materiality of circumstances and the manner in which the entire modus operandi was executed have the ingredients of a manipulative assemblage to scupper the process of IPO allotment. It appears that unfair gain has been made by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani, Manojdev Seksaria and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Purshottam Budhwani would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants. The entire gameplan, craftily designed, masterminded and executed by a coterie of operators acting in concert, in a tout ensemble through the mechanism of front entities of name-lenders seeking to impart a veneer of acceptability to a deal which is otherwise sham in an agonistic aggression in the market through predatory cornering is a clear abuse of the very process of IPO, meant to shore up the participation of retail investors. What is equally reprehensible is the unjust enrichment by a few masquerading in the retail category at the cost of genuine retail investors, who have been crowded out by the "hyperplasia" engineered and induced by the machinations of a few to monopolise the retail segment through colorable devices and make-believe arrangements. The entire gamut of elaborate game-plan of queering the pitch in the market is driven by base cupidity to wangle a patently unfair gain. Further probe is required for examining the systemic fault, if any, of the registrar Karvy-RTI i.e. Karvy Computer Shares P Ltd. and the lead managers Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd., DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. in identifying and weeding out the benami applications. It appears that Karvy-DP relied on a sub-broker namely Deepak Panchal for the purpose of opening the above dematerialized accounts without conducting any due diligence of its own to verify the identity and address of thousands of dematerialized account-holders. The role of Karvy-DP and Pratik-DP in acting as facilitators for Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani and Manojdev Seksaria needs further examination to ascertain whether it was gross negligence or blatant complicity that caused these SEBI registered intermediaries to fail in discharging their obligations. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani and Manojdev Seksaria have perfected the ‘art’ of IPO manipulation as evidenced by their apparent indulging in similar malfeasances in numerous other IPOs in the recent past. These are being examined by SEBI and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings.

        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a recognised stock exchange. iii.      The corpus of any stock exchange is made up of (1) the contribution of the members, (2) the income of the exchange, and (3) the fiscal incentives which had helped the accumulation of reserves. In addition, it may include an adventitious factor by way of appreciation in the value of the assets over a period of time. The net worth of the exchange after revaluation of the assets and liabilities based on market value could be apportioned on the basis of the three components of the corpus mentioned above. The share relating to the members’ contribution should be made available to the members. The balance will be transferred to an escrow account and then to a fund earmarked for the purpose of investor protection managed by SEBI. This scheme will need a proper methodology for valuation of the assets and liabilities as well as for determining the proportion mentioned above and should be carried out by an independent entity. A Task Force may be constituted by SEBI comprising a chartered accountant, an approved valuer and a representative of SEBI for the purpose. iv.     In the absence of any specific provision for distribution of assets, no RSE would seek a voluntary exit option and one would have to live with a situation in which RSEs would continue to exist nearly in perpetuity and continue to remain a burden on the investor and the regulatory system. v.       The entity which remains after withdrawal of recognition must immediately change its name and style and cannot continue in any business as a stock exchange. In case a stock exchange whose recognition is withdrawn has a subsidiary, such an entity would also have to change its name and style to avoid any representation of any present or past affiliation with an exchange. It would be upto the subsidiary to carry on broking operations as any other broking entity registered with SEBI subject to the same rights and duties. vi.     The impact, on account of withdrawal of recognition either on request or on compulsory direction, on the companies exclusively listed on the RSEs and their shareholders would also need to be suitably addressed. An analysis of the compliance status of these companies indicates that only about 500 companies are compliant with the continuous listing requirements. It is felt that such compliant companies, in an exchange which will no longer remain recognized, should be allowed to migrate to any other exchange with minimum procedure and hassle to the company. SEBI can prescribe that files of such compliant companies be moved inter-exchange with minimum burden on such companies. vii.    Before seeking voluntary withdrawal of recognition, the RSEs would have to compulsorily delist all non-compliant companies. viii.  In the event of some of the remaining RSEs which have already been corporatised and are unable to demutualise within the stipulated time such RSEs will also attract the consequences of withdrawal of recognition under sec. 5(2) of the SCRA and their recognition will be compulsorily withdrawn and accordingly, they would have recourse to the same mechanism of asset distribution as recommended supra. ix.     All the RSEs whose recognition has not been withdrawn either voluntarily or compulsorily must collectively choose (in order for it to succeed) either the BSE model or in the alternative, the Inter-Connected Stock Exchange (ICSE) model. The Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges (FISE) will have to take the initiative of evolving a consensus amongst the RSEs. In order that the Public Representative (PR) Directors are able to discharge their responsibilities, it is important that they are conversant with the governance of the RSEs, have a reasonable knowledge of the <mark>securities market</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in.

        <td>The Executive Directors/Managing Directors/Administrators of All Stock Exchanges Dear Sir / Madam, Sub:- Margining in Cash Market. 1.      This is further to SEBI Circular No.MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-07/2005 dated February 23, 2005 on the comprehensive Risk Management Framework for the cash market. 2.      Currently in the cash market, VaR margin rate is calculated at the end of the trading day and then applied to the open positions of the subsequent trading day. However, in the derivative market, the risk parameter files for computation of the margins are updated intra-day. 3.      With a view to ensure market safety and protect the interest of investors and also to further align the risk management framework across the cash and derivative markets, it has been decided that the risk arrays should be updated intra-day in the cash market as has been done in the derivative market. The applicable VaR margin rates shall be updated atleast 5 times in a day, which may be carried out by taking the closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and the prices at 11:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and at the end of the trading session. 4.      While BSE and NSE shall implement the aforesaid methodology with effect from July 10, 2006, the other stock exchanges shall implement the same with effect from August 28, 2006. The stock exchanges are advised to note that from the date of the said implementation, no stock exchange shall permit trading activity unless it is in a position to implement the aforesaid methodology. 5.      The Stock Exchanges are also advised to ; 5.1.   make necessary <mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark><mark>securities market</mark>.

These workshops were arranged throughout the country to reach the common investors and educate them about the functioning of the capital market.

AMFI has represented to SEBI that with the increase in the number of investors opting for SIP/STP/SWP, the statement of accounts that each Mutual Fund has to send every month has increased. The proposal of AMFI has been examined. Mutual Funds may, henceforth, dispatch the statement of accounts to the unit holders under SIP/STP/SWP once every quarter ending March, June, September and December within 10 working days of the end of the respective quarter. However, the first account statement under SIP/STP/SWP shall be issued within 10 working days of the initial investment. In case of specific request received from investors, Mutual Funds shall provide the account statement to the investors within 5 working days from the receipt of such request without any charges. Further, soft copy of the account statement shall be mailed to the investors under SIP/STP/SWP to their e-mail address on a monthly basis, if so mandated. 2.      At present the account statements are sent to unit holders only in case of a transaction in the unit holder’s account. In the interest of investors, the Mutual Funds shall provide the account statements to the unit holders who have not transacted during the last six months prior to the date of generation of account statements. The account statements in such cases may be generated and issued along with the Portfolio Statement or Annual Report of the scheme. The account statement should reflect the latest closing balance and value of the units prior to the date of generation of the account statement. Further, soft copy of the account statements shall be mailed to the investors’ e-mail address, instead of physical statement, if so mandated.

After extensive deliberations and consultations by the Committee, it was decided to create a new investor class called "Foreign Portfolio Investor" (FPI) by merging the existing three investor classes viz. FIIs, Sub Accounts and Qualified Foreign Investors.  It was envisaged that dispensing with the mandatorily requirement of direct registration with SEBI and adopting risk based KYC approach in FPI regime would smoothen the entry process and onboarding experience of FPIs which desire to invest in the Indian <mark>securities market</mark><mark>SEBI (FPI) Regulations</mark>, 2014 were notified on January 07, 2014 followed by certain other enabling notifications by Ministry of Finance and RBI.

SEBI approved Designated Depository Participants have already commenced granting registration to FPIs under the new framework.

        <td>Creating a core fund (called Core Settlement Guarantee Fund), within the SGF, against which no exposure is given and which is readily and unconditionally available to meet settlement obligations of clearing corporation in case of clearing member(s) failing to honour settlement obligation. Aligning stress testing practices of clearing corporations with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). Capturing in stress testing, the risk due to possible default in institutional trades. Harmonising default waterfalls across clearing corporations. Limiting the liability of non-defaulting members in view of the Basel capital adequacy requirements for exposure towards Central Counterparties (CCPs). Ring-fencing each segment of clearing corporation from defaults in other segments. Bringing in uniformity in the stress testing and the risk management practices of different clearing corporations especially with regard to the default of members. SEBI has from time to time put in place various risk containment measures to address the risks involved in the <mark>securities market</mark>. One such measure prescribed was norms for Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) at Stock Exchanges including corpus, contribution, management, usage and recoupment of the fund corpus (vide circular no SMD/POLICY/SGF/CIR-13/97). In order to promote and sustain an efficient and robust global financial infrastructure, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) updated the standards applicable for systemically important financial market infrastructures (central counterparties, payment systems, trade repositories and securities settlement systems) with the PFMIs. SEBI as a member of IOSCO is committed to the adoption and implementation of the new CPSS-IOSCO standards of PFMIs. As required under PFMIs, to provide greater legal basis for settlement finality, netting and rights of FMIs over collateral, Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges And Clearing Corporations) (Amendment) Regulations, 2013 were notified on September 02, 2013. Vide circular dated September 04, 2013, SEBI required FMIs under its regulatory purview to comply with the PFMIs applicable to them. These new guidelines will align stress testing practices of clearing corporations with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). The new stress testing norms will also capture the risk posed due to possible default in institutional trades. The stress test, which will be conducted every day, will determine the Minimum Required Corpus (MRC) of Core SGF. This will be a dynamic process which will form the basis for replenishing the Core SGF every month. PFMIs require CCs to maintain sufficient resources to cover losses due to major defaults in the market so as to avoid any systemic risk. While margins of defaulting member/s form primary layer of defence for CC against default of a member, a next layer of defence by way of a dedicated pool of resources is generally maintained by CCs to effect settlement guarantee. The current practice followed by CCs in India for quantifying such resources is to also include margins of all members. As margins are against positions, there are difficulties felt in estimating the correct value of resources readily available to meet settlement shortages in case of default by member/s. The new guidelines will remove these difficulties by creating the Core SGF as a second layer of defence, against which no exposure is allowed and thus will always be available in sufficiently liquid form.  Availability of such a liquid fund will make the whole risk management system much safer as the CCs will have better capability to deal with extreme stress situations where the defaulters' funds are not sufficient to meet their obligations. The new system will substantially reduce the possibility of such stresses leading to systemic risk. Broadly the contribution to Core SGF will be from the following sources: At least 50% of MRC from CC At least 25% of MRC from Stock Exchange (SE) Upto 25% of MRC from clearing members (CMs) Penalties levied by CC will also be credited to Core SGF. As per the present default waterfall of CCs, residual losses after exhausting resources available in other layers of the waterfall are to be allocated to the non-defaulting clearing members. Thus, effectively under such circumstances there is no limit to the liability of non-defaulting members in the event of extreme loss. As per Basel capital adequacy requirements, many members are required to make capital provisions towards counterparty exposure including towards CCPs which becomes difficult to quantify in case of an unlimited liability. The circular has provisions regarding manner for limiting the liability of non-defaulting members. The new guidelines will also harmonise default waterfall across CCs and will adequately ring-fence each segment of CC from defaults in other segments. The default waterfall in case of default in any segment will generally follow the following order - 1- Monies of defaulting member 2- Insurance, if any 3- CC resources (equal to 5% of MRC) 4- Core SGF 5- CC resources 6- CC/Stock Exchange contribution to Core SGFs of other segments 7- Capped contribution of non defaulting members 8- Pro-rata haircut to pay-outs (for details refer to circular) Norms for contribution to Core SGF as well as default waterfall have been specified with a view that all the stakeholders (CC, SE and CMs) are incentivised to adequately monitor the risks brought into the system. Based on deliberations in the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI and further discussions with CCs, SEs and market participants, it has been decided to issue these norms related to core settlement guarantee fund, stress testing and default procedures specified in the present Circular which would bring greater clarity and uniformity as well as align the same with international best practices.

        <td>Nov 19, 2014 PR No.: 130/2014 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions: (I)  SEBI  (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2014 (1)       Two decades had passed since the <mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations</mark><mark>amendments to the regulations and judicial paradigm through case laws had also evolved in India. To ensure that the regulatory framework dealing with insider trading in India is further strengthened, SEBI sought review of the extant Insider Trading regulatory regime and constituted a committee under Chairmanship of Hon’ble Justice N. K. Sodhi. (2)       Board in its meeting deliberated on the Justice Sodhi Committee Report and public comments received thereon. The Board has approved a new regulation in place of the existing regulations. (3)       The new regulations strengthen the legal and enforcement framework, align Indian regime with international practices, provide clarity with respect to the definitions and concepts, and facilitate legitimate business transactions. The salient features of the regulations are as under:- (A) STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK (i) The definition of Insider has been made wider by including persons connected on the basis of being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship that allows such person access to unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). However directors, employees and all other persons in the deeming category covered under 1992 regulations would continue to be covered. Insider will also include a person who is in possession or has access to UPSI. Now, immediate relatives will be presumed to be connected persons, with a right to rebut the presumption.

        <td>Besides, ODI subscribers are not permitted to have an Opaque Structure(s). The term “Opaque Structure” means any structure such as protected cell company, segregated cell company or equivalent, where the details of the ultimate beneficial owners are not accessible or where the beneficial owners are ring fenced from each other or where the beneficial owners are ring fenced with regard to enforcement. It may also be noted that NRIs/Resident Indians are not permitted to transact in ODIs. The Board noted that in view of the strict norms for ODI issuance, the notional value of ODIs to the AUC of FPIs has declined over the years from a high of 55.7% in June 2007 to 10% in March 2016. However, the concerns raised by the Special <mark>investigation</mark><mark>SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations, ODI subscribers are not required to take prior permission of the ODI Issuer for transfer of ODIs to another investor offshore. In order to tighten the ODI regime and have more control over issuance and transfer of ODIs, it has been decided that the ODI subscribers will have to seek prior permission of the original ODI issuer for further/onward issuance/transfer of ODIs. Reporting of complete transfer trail of ODIs (iii)       Presently, the details of the holder of ODIs have to be mandatorily reported to SEBI on a monthly basis. The ODI issuers are also required to capture the details of all the transfers of the ODIs issued by them and these can be made available to SEBI on demand. The Board decided that in the monthly reports on ODIs all the intermediate transfers during the month would also be required to be reported. KYC Review (iv)       The KYC review shall be done on the basis of the risk criteria as determined by the ODI issuers, as follows: a.         At the time of on-boarding and once every three years for low risk clients b.         At the time of on-boarding and every year for all other clients Suspicious Transactions Report (v)        ODI Issuers shall be required to file suspicious transaction reports with the Indian FIU, if any, in relation to the ODIs issued by it. Reconfirmation of ODI positions (vi)       ODI Issuers shall be required to carry out reconfirmation of the ODI positions on a semi-annual basis. Periodic Operational Evaluation (vii)      ODI Issuers shall be required to put in place necessary systems and carry out a periodical review and evaluation of its controls, systems and procedures with respect to the ODIs. Suitable amendments to the Regulations/Circulars shall be made to bring the above mentioned measures into effect. B. Dividend distribution policy for listed companies SEBI Board approved the proposal for the top 500 listed companies (by way of market capitalization) to formulate and disclose their dividend distribution policies in the annual reports and on their websites. Such policy may include: a)         The circumstances under which their shareholders can or cannot expect dividend; b)         The financial parameters that will be considered while declaring dividends; c)         Internal and external factors that would be considered for declaration of dividend; d)         Policy as to how the retained earnings will be utilized. e)         Provisions in regard to various classes of shares. When the company proposes to declare dividend on the basis of parameters other than what is mentioned in such policy or proposes to change its dividend distribution policy, the same along with the rationale shall be disclosed. This step will help the investors in taking well informed investment decisions. C. Amendment to Regulation 33 of Securities Contracts Regulation (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The Board took note that the requirement of establishing Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF) was introduced by SEBI vide circular dated August 27, 2014 and Core SGFs have now been built up in the clearing corporations. It also considered the recommendations of the Expert Committee, constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri K V Kamath, to look into various issues relating to clearing corporations including the issue of transfer of 25% of profits by stock exchanges to the core SGF of clearing corporations, and observations of the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI. Taking note that Core SGF have been built up, it was decided to do away with the said requirement of transfer of 25% of profits by stock exchanges. However, there will be a mandate that stock exchanges, along with clearing corporations, shall replenish the Core SGF immediately, in case of any shortfall in the corpus. Such a review will take place on a monthly basis or earlier as and when required. Accordingly, the Regulations would be amended to give effect to the above decision of the Board. D. Amendments to the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 SEBI has notified the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 on September 26, 2014. For smoothening the process of registration of InvIT with SEBI and launching of the offer, SEBI Board has approved for bringing out a consultation paper proposing certain changes/providing clarification in the InvIT Regulations on the following points: 1.         Allowing InvITs to invest in two-level SPV structure. 2.         Mandatory sponsor holding in InvIT to be reduced to 10% from current requirement of 25%, subject to certain conditions. 3.         Increase in the number of sponsors from 3 to 5. 4.         Other operational requirements, such as, aligning regulations in line with the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and SCRR, filing of Project Implementation Agreement at the time of filing of offer document, etc. The consultation paper will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments. E. Guidance Note  on Settlement and procedural changes in processing of Compounding applications Settlement Regulations were formulated primarily to settle minor and technical violations not having wider impact on the market so that enforcement is concentrated on major and significant cases. During the year 2015-16, number of settlement cases have come down putting pressure on the enforcement system.  An analysis revealed that   there are certain doubts on the interpretation of Regulation 5 (2) (b) of Settlement Regulations.  An internal guidance note was issued on March 03, 2016 clarifying the doubts so that more serious and substantial cases are only taken up for enforcement action. For this purpose, defaults which in the opinion of the Board have a bearing on the securities market as whole and not just the listed security and its investors may be considered to have market wide impact.  The assessment of facts and circumstances while deciding the seriousness of the default in relation to an applicant shall take into account the weight and the sufficiency of the evidence. The guidance note was placed before the Board and while noting the contents of the memorandum, it approved that the guidance note be incorporated in the regulations. Further, in dealing with prosecution cases for non-payment of penalty, where compounding request has been filed and where full penalty with interest is paid, the Board took note of the simplification in the procedure for disposing of these matters. F. Amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996 During 2014, Parliament has amended Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996, providing for minimum and maximum monetary penalties and discretion to impose appropriate penalty by the adjudicating officer. However, this is prospective and not applicable to cases falling between 2002 and 2014. Pursuant to the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in the matter of  Roofit Industries Ltd., a need arose for clarifying the monetary penalty provisions in the securities laws, relating to cases prior to 2014.  In view of this, Board approved to send a proposal to the Central Government for amendment</mark>s in the law. G. Establishment of SEBI Chair at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM): The Board considered and approved the proposal for establishment of up to two "SEBI Chairs" at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) by contributing a certain corpus to NISM. NISM is a public trust established by SEBI. SEBI Chairs would provide research based policy inputs and would also help in increasing academic interest and awareness about the activities of SEBI. SEBI Chairs would also undertake activities of publishing research papers, policy notes, concept notes etc., in addition to delivering lectures and seminars. The selection of SEBI Chairs would be with Academic Council of NISM.</td>

However, the features are more like equity securities and the concentration and liquidity risks require to be addressed. 2) In light of the above, the Board decided that the following investment restrictions will be applicable: (i) A Mutual Fund scheme shall not invest more than 5% of its NAV in units of a single issuer of REITs and InvITs. Such limit of 5% shall not be applicable for investments in case of index fund or sector or industry specific scheme pertaining to REITs and InvITs.

However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI.

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges. However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI. SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 to provide for a criteria alternative to "Net Worth" for municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations The SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 (ILDM) provides that a municipality or a Corporate Municipal Entity (CME) making public issue of debt securities, under these regulations shall not have negative net worth in any of three immediately preceding financial years. In order to facilitate issuance of debt securities under these regulations by entities other than CME, the Board agreed that the Municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations shall have surplus as per its Income and Expenditure Statement, in any of the three immediately preceding financial years or any other financial criteria as specified by SEBI from time to time. VII. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 On the basis of experience gained and with the purpose of streamlining and strengthening the settlement process, Board approved amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014.  The amendment</mark><mark>investigation</mark> or enforcement action. VIII. Enabling Payment by Digital Mode The Board approved the proposal to amend various Regulations to enable the market participants to make payments to SEBI through digital mode (such as NEFT/RTGS) as well.</td>
