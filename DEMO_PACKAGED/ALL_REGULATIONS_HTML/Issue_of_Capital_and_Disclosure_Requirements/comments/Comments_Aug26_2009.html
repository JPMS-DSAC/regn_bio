Accordingly, the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE), which had already done some work on the subject, and other stock exchanges were invited by the Group to make presentations. BSE presented their views before the Group on two occasions. The Group also invited the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to present their views. A questionnaire (Annexure 2) was also sent to all the stock exchanges for eliciting their views in writing. The responses to the questionnaire were compiled and analysed (Annexure 3). Delhi Stock exchange (DSE), the Federation of Indian Stock Exchange (FISE), representatives from the BSE Brokers’ Forum and Association of Members of National Stock Exchange of India (AMNI) also made presentations before the Group. Some of the investor association viz. Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC), Ahmedabad, Jagrut Grahak Mandal and Investor Grievance Forum (IGF) were also given an opportunity to make presentations, but of these, only CERC made their submissions before the Group. 3.2 The Group studied the proposal of BSE on demutualisation submitted to SEBI. The Group also generally examined the existing articles of association, charters, trust deed, rules, regulations and bye laws of the various stock exchanges and in particular the peculiarities of the charter of BSE, for a better understanding and appreciation of the present legal structure and status of the stock exchanges in India. The present tax status of these stock exchanges in the light of the judgments given by the Income Tax Tribunal and the matters pending before the Income Tax Department, the tax implications of the process of corporatisation and demutualisation were also generally studied by the Group. The Group also took note of the experiences of other countries where the stock exchanges were already demutualised viz. Australia, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. In India the NSE stands out as one example of a demutualised stock exchange; the Group felt that it would be helpful if the capital, organizational and management structure of NSE, the shareholding pattern, could be compared with those of other demutualised international stock exchanges (Annexure 4). 4. Existing structure of the stock exchanges in India 4.1 In terms of the legal structure, the stock exchanges which are recognised under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act in India, could be segregated into two broad groups – 20 stock exchanges which were set up as companies, either limited by guarantees or by shares, and the 3 stock exchanges which are functioning as associations of persons (AOP) viz. BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange. The 20 stock exchanges which are companies are: the stock exchanges of Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Gauhati, Hyderabad, Interconnected SE, Jaipur, Ludhiana, Madras, Magadh, Managalore, NSE, Pune, OTCEI, Saurashtra-Kutch, Uttar Pradesh, and Vadodara. Of these, the stock exchanges of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, BSE, Calcutta, Delhi, Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh, Madras and Gauhati were given permanent recognition by the Central Government at the time of setting up of these stock exchanges. Apart from NSE, all stock exchanges whether established as corporate bodies or Association of Persons (AOPs), are non-profit making organizations. 4.2 It is thus clear that BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange will have to be both corporatised and demutualised, while of the balance 20 stock exchanges, 18 stock exchanges which are already corporate entities, will only have to be demutualised. Two stock exchanges, NSE and OTCEI, are not only corporatised but also demutualised with segregation of ownership and trading rights of members. Further, NSEIL is a for-profit company and the Board of NSEIL comprises of representatives of shareholders, (some of whom have 100% stock broking subsidiaries) and outside non-shareholder directors. But even these two stock exchanges may if necessary, have to undergo changes in organizational structure consequential to the recommendations of the Group so that a common structural model is adopted by the all the stock exchanges.</td>

The amendments inter-alia include introduction of Net Tangible Assets and minimum number of allottees as additional criterion, appraisal route as an alternative to the mandatory book building route etc. Details of the amendments are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section B    Review of Book Building guidelines  Book building is a facility given to issuer companies  and merchant bankers to ascertain the demand and indicative price before the actual opening of the issue. SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue. It is extensively used in international IPOs as stabilization tool for post listing price of the newly issued shares. It is being introduced in the Indian Capital Market in the initial public offerings using book building method. It is expected to boost investors’ confidence by arresting the speculative forces which work immediately after the listing and thus results in short-term volatility in post listing price. The amendments carried out in SEBI (DIP) guidelines in this regard, have been detailed under this section in the Annexure.    Section D   Review of disclosure requirements in the offer documents  The existing disclosure requirements in the offer documents are reviewed on an ongoing basis by SEBI and based on the review, the amendments are carried out in SEBI (DIP) guidelines.

        <td> In 1980s and 19990s, it was increasingly realized that an efficient and well developed securities market is essential for sustained economic growth. Without venturing into a detailed discussion, it would suffice if I just say that the securities market fosters economic growth to the extent it augments the quantities of real savings and capital formation from a given level of national income and it raises productivity of investment by improving allocation of investible funds. The extent depends on the quality of the securities market. In order to improve the quality of the market, that is, to improve market efficiency, enhance transparency, preventunfair trade practices and bring the Indian market up to international standards, a package of reforms consisting of measures to liberalise, regulate and develop the securities market is being implemented since early 1990s. Let me sound a little academic, in presence of Sir Davies, to explain why the package included liberalization, regulation and development? Why liberalization? I strongly believe that the more liberalised a securities market is, the better is its impact on economic growth. Interventions in the securities market were originally designed to help governments expropriate much of the seigniorage and control and direct the flow of funds for favoured uses. These helped governments to tap savings on a low or even no-cost basis. Besides, government used to allocate funds from the securities market to competing enterprises and decide the terms of allocation. The result was channelisation of resources to favoured uses rather than sound projects. In such circumstances accumulation of capital per se meant little, where rate of return on some investments were negative while extremely remunerative investment opportunities were foregone. This kept the average rate of return from investment lower than it would otherwise have been and, given the cost of savings, the resulting investment was less than optimum. Hence, it was necessary to do away interventions hindering optimum allocation of resources. Why Regulation? Do you know what a ‘security’ is? Our laws provide an inclusive definition of ‘securities’. It says that ‘securities’ include shares, bonds, debentures, units of CIS, etc. It does not define in terms of ingredients an instrument must have to be considered as ‘securities’. I have not seen an ingredient type definition of ‘securities’ in any other jurisdiction. It is precisely because ‘securities’ are most insecure instruments. The only ingredient common to all types of securities is its associated ‘insecurity’. It is like a blind man named padmalochan. If it is a market for such insecure instruments, market would collapse if some body does not regulate away the insecurities. We need regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures. In the absence of regulation by a specialized agency, each participant would do its own <mark>due diligence</mark> before undertaking any transaction in the market. This imposes huge social costs. Besides, regulations signal minimum standards of quality and hence enhance confidence in markets. With a known asymmetric information problem, risk averse investors may exit the market altogether if such minimum standards are not signaled. In its extreme form the market breaks down completely. There is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalisation does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. Why development? Unless you develop market, what do you regulate? Unless there is regulation, how does the market develop? It is a chicken and egg issue. Regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combine the elements of regulation and development. Besides, some developmental measures are introduced as a part of general programme for economic and political development. The macro economic policies relating to interest rate, prices, etc can have salubrious effect on the growth and development of the securities market. Other developmental measures include provision of realiable payment system and clearing mechanism, standardized accounting procedure, good corporate governance, skilled manpower etc. which improve the efficiency and transparency of the market. Though it is incidental that reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI, I, by no means, propose to suggest that SEBI is the agency exclusively responsible for all the reforms. These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated. It would do justice with your time and attention if I make a dhobi list of reforms undertaken since early 1990s. In stead let me discuss only a few major reforms. a. Control over Issue of Capital: A major initiative of liberalisation was the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992. With this, Government’s control over issue of capital, pricing of the issues, fixing of premia and rates of interest on debentures etc. ceased and the market was allowed to allocate resources to competing uses. In the interest of investors, SEBI issued Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines. The guidelines allow issuers, complying with the eligibility criteria, to issue securities the securities at market determined rates. The market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation. b. Establishment of Regulator: A major initiative of regulation was establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities. It was empowered adequately and assigned the responsibility to (a) protect the interests of investors in securities, (b) promote the development of the securities market, and (c) regulate the securities market. Its regulatory jurisdiction extends over corporates in the issuance of capital and transfer of securities, in addition to all intermediaries and persons associated with securities market. All market intermediaries are registered and regulated by SEBI. They are also required to appoint a compliance officer who is responsible for monitoring compliance with securities laws and for redressal of investor grievances. c. Screen Based Trading: A major developmental initiative was a nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS) where a member can punch into the computer quantities of securities and the prices at which he likes to transact and the transaction is executed as soon as it finds a matching sale or buy order from a counter party. SBTS electronically matches orders on a strict price/time priority and hence cut down on time, cost and risk of error, as well as on fraud resulting in improved operational efficiency. It allowed faster incorporation of price sensitive information into prevailing prices, thus increasing the informational efficiency of markets. It enabled market participants to see the full market on real-time, making the market transparent. It allowed a large number of participants, irrespective of their geographical locations, to trade with one another simultaneously, improving the depth and liquidity of the market – over 10,000 terminals creating waves by clicks from over 400 towns / cities in India. It provided full anonymity by accepting orders, big or small, from members without revealing their identity, thus providing equal access to everybody. It also provided a perfect audit trail, which helps to resolve disputes by logging in the trade execution process in entirety.</td>

However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.
