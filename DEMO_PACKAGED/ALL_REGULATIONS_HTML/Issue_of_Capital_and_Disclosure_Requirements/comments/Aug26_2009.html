        <td>Jun 26, 2002| Circulars CHIEF GENERAL MANAGER MUTUAL FUNDS DEPARTMENT MFD/CIR/ 06/210/2002 June 26, 2002 All Mutual Funds Registered with SEBI Unit Trust of India Association of Mutual Funds in India Dear Sirs, CODE OF CONDUCT According to clause 7 of the code of conduct as specified in the Fifth Schedule to <mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>due diligence</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual funds) Regulations</mark> and Guidelines with specific focus on regulations/guidelines on advertisements/sales literature and code of conduct. In furtherance of these objectives, AMFI has now prescribed a code of conduct for the mutual funds intermediaries i.e. agents and distributors, a copy of which is enclosed. It is advised that all distributors and agents of mutual funds units shall follow the code of conduct strictly. As advised in the aforesaid circular dated September 25, 2001, the mutual funds shall monitor the activities of their agents/distributors to ensure that they do not indulge in any kind of malpractice or unethical practice while selling/marketing mutual funds units. If any intermediary does not comply with the code of conduct, the mutual fund shall report it to AMFI and SEBI. No mutual fund shall deal with those intermediaries who do not follow code of conduct. The contents of this circular may please be brought to the notice of the intermediaries immediately. As already advised in the aforesaid SEBI circular, Boards of AMCs and trustees shall review the progress of certification programme in their periodical meetings and take steps to ensure that the distributors and agents pass the certification programme within the stipulated time period. This circular is issued under Regulation 77 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regultions, 1996. Yours faithfully, P.K.NAGPAL CODE OF CONDUCT FOR INTERMEDIARIES OF MUTUAL FUNDS 1. Take necessary steps to ensure that the clients’ interest is protected. 2. Adhere to SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations and guidelines related to selling, distribution and advertising practices. Be fully conversant with the key provisions of the offer document as well as the operational requirements of various schemes. 3. Provide full and latest information of schemes to investors in the form of offer documents, performance reports, fact sheets, portfolio disclosures and brochures, and recommend schemes appropriate for the client’s situation and needs. 4. Highlight risk factors of each scheme, avoid misrepresentation and exaggeration, and urge investors to go through offer documents/key information memorandum before deciding to make investments. 5. Disclose all material information related to the schemes/plans while canvassing for business. 6. Abstain from indicating or assuring returns in any type of scheme, unless the offer document is explicit in this regard. 7. Maintain necessary infrastructure to support the AMCs in maintaining high service standards to investors, and ensure that critical operations such as forwarding forms and cheques to AMCs/registrars and despatch of statement of account and redemption cheques to investors are done within the time frame prescribed in the offer document and SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations. 8. Avoid colluding with clients in faulty business practices such as bouncing cheques, wrong claiming of dividend/redemption cheques, etc. 9. Avoid commission driven malpractices such as: (a) recommending inappropriate products solely because the intermediary is getting higher commissions therefrom. (b) encouraging over transacting and churning of mutual fund investments to earn higher commissions, even if they mean higher transaction costs and tax for investors. 10. Avoid making negative statements about any AMC or scheme and ensure that comparisons if any, are made with similar and comparable products. 11. Ensure that all investor related statutory communications (such as changes in fundamental attributes, exit/entry load, exit options, and other material aspects) are sent to investors reliably and on time. 12. Maintain confidentiality of all investor deals and transactions. 13. When marketing various schemes, remember that a client’s interest and suitability to their financial needs is paramount, and that extra commission or incentive earned should never form the basis for recommending a scheme to the client. 14. Intermediaries will not rebate commission back to investors and avoid attracting clients through temptation of rebate/gifts etc. 15. A focus on financial planning and advisory services ensures correct selling, and also reduces the trend towards investors asking for passback of commission. 16. All employees engaged in sales and marketing should obtain AMFI certification. Employees in other functional areas should also be encouraged to obtain the same certification.</td>

This is felt necessary in the interest of the efficacy of the market. With effect from 3rd February, 2004, overseas derivative instruments such as Participatory Notes (PNs) against underlying Indian securities can be issued only to regulated entities and further transfers, if any, of these instruments can also be to other regulated entities only. FIIs/sub accounts are required to ensure that no further down stream issuance of such derivative instruments is made. In order to give effect to this decision, necessary amendments to the Regulations are being notified. To discharge regulatory responsibilities, SEBI would need to be in a position to ascertain, if circumstances so warrant, details of the ultimate investors investing through PNs etc. in the Indian market. The FIIs issuing such derivative instruments are therefore required to exercise <mark>due diligence</mark> and maintain complete details of the investors, based strictly on "know your client" principles. To facilitate the process of transition, derivative instruments already issued and outstanding against un-regulated entities will not be required to be terminated immediately. It has been decided that the said contracts will be permitted to expire or to be wound – down on maturity, or within a period of 5 years, whichever is earlier. Circular to this effect is also being issued.</td>

        <td>Rationalizing disclosure requirements for further public offers and <mark>rights issue</mark><mark>rights issue</mark><mark>allotment</mark><mark>SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its Board meeting held today has approved amendment to SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark>, 2003 (MAPIN), after considering the recommendations of the Committee set up by SEBI to examine the issues related to MAPIN. The registration process will be resumed in a phased manner. To begin with, the cut off limit for obtaining UIN with biometric impressions for natural persons has been raised from the existing limit of trade order value of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.5.00 lakh or more. The limit will be reduced progressively. Agencies capable of providing such facilities in a cost effective manner will be assigned the responsibility of maintaining the databases. For trade order value of less than Rs.5.00 lakh, option will be available to investors to obtain either the Permanent Account Number of Income Tax Department or UIN obtained under MAPIN. Investors in mutual funds would be exempted from the requirement of obtaining UIN. The definition of promoter, which is a body corporate would be limited, to immediate holding company of the Indian entity and any of the subsidiaries, if located in India. Listed company or a company which intends to get its securities listed, along with their promoters, directors, officers and designated employees would be required to obtain UIN. These changes will be implemented after the necessary amendments are made to the MAPIN Regulations Note : The aforesaid are policy announcements based on decisions of the Board and do not reflect change in the existing legal framework until the relevant amendments are effected through issue of circulars.

While AMCs manage the operations of mutual funds, the trustees act as supervisors. AMCs are required to send periodical compliance reports to the trustees who in turn send reports to SEBI.  Boards of AMCs and the trustees of mutual funds meet periodically to review the operations of mutual funds. The Regulations require two thirds of the trustees to be independent persons.  The role of independent trustees in the oversight of mutual fund is greater than that of associate trustees. The extant Regulations allow (i)           An independent trustee of a Mutual Fund to act as an independent trustee on other Mutual Fund. (ii)         An AMC director (except Chairman) to act as a trustee of other Mutual Fund. Trustees are privy to information pertaining to the conduct of the business by the AMC.  The role of independent trustees is crucial to avoid conflicts of interests in a mutual fund. Towards improving fund governance, SEBI is considering to amend the Regulations to disallow a trustee of a mutual fund from being: (i)            a trustee on other mutual fund; (ii)           a director on the Board of AMC of other mutual fund.</td>

They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

        <td>Securities  and Exchange Board of India Consultative Paper <mark>amendments to SEBI on (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 1.   On  1st  January  2008,  SEBI  came  out  with  a  consultative  paper  to  introduce “short swing profit” regulations by amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 and sought public comments on the same. In addition to the proposal of 1st January, public comment is being sought on several other proposed amendments to the regulations. 2.  Amendments were carried out in 2002 to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 (the regulations) to introduce a wide range of prophylactics and corporate governance norms. 3.  Over the course of the past few years since the amendment, there have been some new learnings in terms of the way the regulations have played out in the market.  The  key  amendments  brought  in  processes  which  would  reduce  the possibilities of insider trading by means of an institutionalized methodology e.g. pre-clearance of trades, black-out  windows  of  trading,  disclosure  of  buy/sell  by certain  insiders,  appointment  of  compliance  officer  and  a  catena  of  other provisions. 4.  There  have  been  several  instances  of  persons  of  high  integrity  committing unintended violations of these provisions. Thus, we need to be sensitive to the -1- Securities and Exchange Board of India fact that perhaps the norms have been set so high that even experts are unable to  keep  track  and  be  in  compliance  with  these  standards.  This  is  an  important issue as criminal jeopardy is attached to such corporate governance violations. In addition, there is a need to move towards a more principle based approach to regulations rather than a rule based approach, particularly in matters of corporate governance. 5.  In addition, some regulations are also proposed to be introduced. Background 6.  The  2002  amendments  to  the  Regulations  provide  extensive  suggestions  and regulations.  Most  of  the  good  governance  provisions  are  provided  for  as mandatory provisions. Briefly, the good governance regulations provide for: a) Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. b) Appointment of a compliance officer. c) Setting forth policies and procedure to restrict the possibility of abuse of insider trading. d) Monitoring and pre-clearance of trades by the designated persons. e) Restrict trading by such insiders within a certain period of time i.e. before corporate announcements, buybacks etc. are made. f) The company has to convey all the significant insider activity and corporate disclosure in a uniform publicly accessible means to the public – and to the stock exchange. g) Chinese walls within a firm to prevent one part of the firm which deals in sensitive information from going to other parts of the firm which have an inherent conflict of interest with such other parts. h) Minimum holding period of securities by insiders. i) No selective disclosure to analysts. Wide dissemination of information. -2- Securities and Exchange Board of India 7.  Provided  below  is  an  analysis  of  some  of  the  provisions  of  good  governance regulations and proposals for amendments. Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. 8.  There should be some coordination between the requirements of acquisition/sale of  shares  reported  in  these  regulations  with  the  requirements  of  the  takeover regulations. In fact the takeover reporting is broader since it mandates reporting by any person over certain thresholds and also requires reporting by a group – a concept  not  introduced  in  these  Regulations.  However,  the  insider  trading Regulations  provide  for  disclosure  of  smaller  amounts  and  provides  for disclosure  on  selling  shares  (something  which  the  takeover  code  does  not mandate). Proposal:  It  is  suggested  that  a  purchase  disclosure  made  under  either regulations (with the same or higher level of disclosure) should be deemed to be is  also  proposed good  disclosure  under the harmonization between the two in terms of threshold limits set. Regulatory Impact Assessment: As there is a proposal to harmonise the two regulation</mark>s, there is expected to be neither a substantial change in the burden on insiders nor will there be a dilution of the rights of investors. To the extent of deemed disclosure, there will be a reduction in cost without any reduction in benefit to investors.</td>

On  04-03-2008  SEBI  had  put  up  a  consultative  paper  on  amendments  to  SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 for public comments. In order to harmonize requirements of acquisition/sale of shares reported under the SEBI (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  1992  and  the  requirements  of  the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 it was proposed  that  transaction  disclosures  made  under  either  regulation  (with  the same  or  higher  level  of  disclosure)  should  be  deemed  to  be  good  disclosure under the other. It was also proposed to increase the harmonization between the two in terms of threshold limits set. In order to have an efficient market, it is essential that all relevant information which  has  an  impact  on  the  price  of  the  shares  of  a  company  is  promptly disseminated to the market. The listing agreement of the company with the stock exchanges and SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 requires the  company  to  make  continuous  and  prompt  dissemination  of  the  price sensitive information to the market through stock exchanges and other print and electronic  media.    The  Directors/Officers  of  the  company,  being  insiders  have access to the unpublished price sensitive information. The dealing in shares by major shareholders itself is price sensitive information and therefore, Regulation 13 of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 requires that these entities  shall  disseminate  information  about  their  dealing  in  the  shares  of  the company on crossing certain threshold limit prescribed in the regulation to the company.  The  stock  exchange  in  turn  disseminates  the  same  to  the  market through  electronic  notices  to  its  members  and  also  displays  the  same  on  its website. 3.  Under  the  present  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  1992  the shareholder/director/officer  of  a  listed  company  is  required  to  disclose  to  the company  information  regarding  the  shareholding  or  voting  rights  within  4 working days of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights or of becoming the director or officer of the said company, as the case may be. The company in turn is required to disclose this to the Stock Exchanges, on which the company is listed, within five days. Thus, on occasion,  a  total  of  9  days  may  pass  before  price  sensitive  information  is disseminated to the public.  The rationale</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>regulation. Stock Exchanges in turn are required to “immediately” display the said information on the trading screen, the notice board and on its website. In line with SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997,  it  is  proposed  that  the  time  gap  between  the  date  of  transaction  and  the date of dissemination of the information by the stock exchange may be reduced from nine days to two working days by making necessary amendments to the relevant  provisions  of  Insider  Trading  Regulations.  This  would  make  it mandatory  for  a  person  to  report  the  transactions  within  one  working  day  of trading to the company and company in turn shall inform the stock exchanges, where  the  shares  are  listed,  within  one  working  day  of  receipt  of  information.
