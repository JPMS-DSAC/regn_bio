Any offer of securities made to 50 or more persons has to be construed as a “Public Offer” under the provisions of Companies Act, 1956. Under Companies Act, 2013,“Private Placement” shall be made only to such persons whose names are recorded by the company prior to the invitation to subscribe.  Further, in case of private placements, the company shall not release any public advertisements or utilise any media, marketing or distribution channels or agents to inform the public at large about such an offer. Further, such offer or invitation shall not be made to more than 200 persons in the aggregate in a financial year As per the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI Regulations, no issuer shall make <mark>public issue</mark> of these securities, unless it has made application to the recognized Stock Exchange(s) for listing of such securities.

A presentation was made by our external domain expert articulating the road map for SEBI to implement this task. Following the presentation, the IAB, inter alia, advised the following: As the commodities markets operate in a different eco-system, have legacy issues and need domain knowledge for efficient regulation, SEBI needs to conduct a thorough <mark>due diligence</mark> and gap analysis before articulating its vision for the commodity derivatives segment. SEBI should concentrate more on studying the risks and the structure of the market, including various aspects like contract design, warehouse receipts and quality control of underlying commodities in the initial period. The emphasis during this period should be on avoiding any crisis in the market. Market development may be visited only after fully understanding the strengths and weaknesses of commodities markets.   iv.        Compensating the victims (if identifiable) of Insider Trading offences IAB was informed about SEBI’s new Insider Trading Regulations and was requested to share their global experience inter alia regarding compensation to the victims. The IAB members shared their experiences in this area, more specifically on the South African, Hong Kong and the New Zealand experience. The following major observations were made –  </td>
