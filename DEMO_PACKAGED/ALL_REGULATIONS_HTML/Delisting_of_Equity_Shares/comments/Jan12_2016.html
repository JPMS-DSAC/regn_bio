        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a recognised stock exchange. iii.      The corpus of any stock exchange is made up of (1) the contribution of the members, (2) the income of the exchange, and (3) the fiscal incentives which had helped the accumulation of reserves. In addition, it may include an adventitious factor by way of appreciation in the value of the assets over a period of time. The net worth of the exchange after revaluation of the assets and liabilities based on market value could be apportioned on the basis of the three components of the corpus mentioned above. The share relating to the members’ contribution should be made available to the members. The balance will be transferred to an <mark>escrow</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in.

This would generate accurate public announcements about defaults and improve transparency about soft defaults; SEBI has already issued a circular for adopting ECS for IPOs in equities. Another circular may be issued to cover the corporate debt issuances also.</td>

        <td>Exemptions have been made precise, streamlined and provided with clear conditions on the basis of the specific charging provision from which exemptions would be available. Some of the areas where clarity has been brought in include schemes of arrangement, certain inter se transfers, corporate debt restructuring and rights issues. While SEBI would continue to have the power to grant exemption from making an open offer, the requirement of making a reference to Takeover Panel has now been left to the discretion of SEBI. Offer price The minimum price payable as the offer price continues to be regulated. The minimum offer price is classified between the price payable for direct acquisitions and indirect acquisitions. The major changes proposed are: (i) market price to be based on 12 weeks volume weighted average of market prices as against higher of weekly averages of market prices for 26 weeks or 2 weeks; (ii) a qualitative improvement and expansion in the look back provision; (iii) in the case of indirect acquisitions, ascription of value to the target company under certain circumstances. Mode of payment The Committee has brought in clarity on valuation in case offer price is being paid through shares. To ensure that the shares given in consideration for the open offer are indeed liquid and an acceptable replacement for cash, eligibility conditions have been stipulated. The Committee also noted that although the current <mark>regulations provide for exchange offers, the same has not been used for want of clarity on whether such issuance would attract provisions of preferential allotment and public issue requirements. The Committee has recommended that SEBI may consider making suitable amendments to ICDR/ other regulations as applicable. Competing offers The Committee has recommended certain changes such as increasing the period for making a competing bid, prohibiting acquirers from being represented in the board of target company, and permitting any competing acquirer to negotiate and acquire the shares tendered to the other competing acquirer, at the same price that was offered by him to the public. Execution of the agreement that triggers open offer The Committee has recommended that the execution of the agreement that triggered the open offer obligation may be completed during the pendency of the open offer provided 100% of the consideration payable under the open offer is deposited in escrow. Currently, an agreement which triggers an open offer can be consummated only after completion of the offer formalities. The Committee has further recommended that execution of such agreement would have to be completed within 26 weeks after the offer period. Currently the regulations are silent on this aspect. Governance Issues The current Regulations restrict the target company from undertaking certain transactions during the offer period. The Committee thought it fit to bring in materiality concept as also to enhance the scope of such restrictions to include transactions by subsidiaries since potentially material transactions can be undertaken at the level of any subsidiary of the target company without approval of shareholders of the target company. The Committee has also decided to mandate recommendation on the open offer, by a committee of independent directors of the target company. This is currently optional. Activities and Timelines in open offer process Timelines of various activities in the open offer process have been rationalized to compress the open offer period. The Committee has also recommended that a short public announcement should be made by the acquirer on the date of entering in to an agreement followed by a detailed public statement within five business days thereafter. The Committee was constituted by SEBI in September 2009 to examine and review the Takeover Regulations of 1997 and suggest suitable amendment</mark>s as deemed fit. The committee comprises the following members: 1.                  Shri C. Achuthan, Former Presiding Officer, Securities Appellate Tribunal – Chairman. 2.                  Shri Kumar Desai, Advocate, High Court, Mumbai 3.                  Shri Somasekhar Sundaresan, Advocate; Partner, J.

(V)  Risk based supervision of market intermediaries The Board took note of the recommendations viz. simple, formalized and risk based supervision approach for the market intermediaries as suggested by M/s. Oliver Wyman, the Consultant appointed by SEBI to study and make recommendations, inter-alia with the objective of designing best practice regulatory approach, and the report of the internal taskforce of SEBI formed to implement the  recommendations. Based on above, SEBI is in the process of formalizing its risk based approach towards supervision of market intermediaries which will be in alignment with the global best practices. The system will be implemented in a phased manner. (VI)  Granting Single Registration to Depository Participants With a view to further simplify the registration requirements for Depository Participants (DPs), the Board has approved the policy of granting single registration for the application of initial registration as well as the permanent registration for operating with both the Depositories. Currently, the Depository participants are required to obtain separate registration for both the depositories. Further the applicants are granted initial registration for five years and then permanent registrations. As per the new policy SEBI would process the registration application only for the first time initial or permanent registration, as the case may be,  through one depository and subsequent permissions to act as a DP of other depository, shall be granted by the concerned Depository after complying with the prescribed requirements. Thus, there will be a single SEBI registration for DP to operate in both the Depositories in India.</td>
