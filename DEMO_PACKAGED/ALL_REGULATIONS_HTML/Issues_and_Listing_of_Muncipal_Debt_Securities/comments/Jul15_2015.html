        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme.

        <td>Exemptions have been made precise, streamlined and provided with clear conditions on the basis of the specific charging provision from which exemptions would be available. Some of the areas where clarity has been brought in include schemes of arrangement, certain inter se transfers, corporate debt restructuring and rights issues. While SEBI would continue to have the power to grant exemption from making an open offer, the requirement of making a reference to Takeover Panel has now been left to the discretion of SEBI. Offer price The minimum price payable as the offer price continues to be regulated. The minimum offer price is classified between the price payable for direct acquisitions and indirect acquisitions. The major changes proposed are: (i) market price to be based on 12 weeks volume weighted average of market prices as against higher of weekly averages of market prices for 26 weeks or 2 weeks; (ii) a qualitative improvement and expansion in the look back provision; (iii) in the case of indirect acquisitions, ascription of value to the target company under certain circumstances. Mode of payment The Committee has brought in clarity on valuation in case offer price is being paid through shares. To ensure that the shares given in consideration for the open offer are indeed liquid and an acceptable replacement for cash, eligibility conditions have been stipulated. The Committee also noted that although the current <mark>regulations provide for exchange offers, the same has not been used for want of clarity on whether such issuance would attract provisions of preferential allotment and public issue requirements. The Committee has recommended that SEBI may consider making suitable amendments to ICDR/ other regulations as applicable. Competing offers The Committee has recommended certain changes such as increasing the period for making a competing bid, prohibiting acquirers from being represented in the board of target company, and permitting any competing acquirer to negotiate and acquire the shares tendered to the other competing acquirer, at the same price that was offered by him to the public. Execution of the agreement that triggers open offer The Committee has recommended that the execution of the agreement that triggered the open offer obligation may be completed during the pendency of the open offer provided 100% of the consideration payable under the open offer is deposited in escrow. Currently, an agreement which triggers an open offer can be consummated only after completion of the offer formalities. The Committee has further recommended that execution of such agreement would have to be completed within 26 weeks after the offer period. Currently the regulations are silent on this aspect. Governance Issues The current Regulations restrict the target company from undertaking certain transactions during the offer period. The Committee thought it fit to bring in materiality concept as also to enhance the scope of such restrictions to include transactions by subsidiaries since potentially material transactions can be undertaken at the level of any subsidiary of the target company without approval of shareholders of the target company. The Committee has also decided to mandate recommendation on the open offer, by a committee of independent directors of the target company. This is currently optional. Activities and Timelines in open offer process Timelines of various activities in the open offer process have been rationalized to compress the open offer period. The Committee has also recommended that a short public announcement should be made by the acquirer on the date of entering in to an agreement followed by a detailed public statement within five business days thereafter. The Committee was constituted by SEBI in September 2009 to examine and review the Takeover Regulations of 1997 and suggest suitable amendment</mark>s as deemed fit. The committee comprises the following members: 1.                  Shri C. Achuthan, Former Presiding Officer, Securities Appellate Tribunal – Chairman. 2.                  Shri Kumar Desai, Advocate, High Court, Mumbai 3.                  Shri Somasekhar Sundaresan, Advocate; Partner, J.

        <td>b)  Smoothening  the  Payment/Refund Process  in  Issues:  In  its  continuing endeavour  to  make  the  existing  <mark>public issue</mark><mark>public issue</mark>s, ASBA facility has now been extended to all investors other than qualified institutional buyers. This is expected to further improve the efficiency of  the  issue  process.  Additionally,  to encourage  ASBA,  there  was  a  need to  have  a  uniform  incentive  structure and  level  playing  field  between  the respective  intermediaries,  i.e.  syndicate members for non-ASBA and self certified syndicate  banks  (SCSBs)  for  ASBA. Therefore,  SEBI  directed  merchant the  bid  is  open  to  other  categories  of  the investors. iii.   Rationalisation  of  Regulatory  Frame- work for Issuance of Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) In  order  to  facilitate  issuance  of  IDRs and to bring in necessary liquidity in trading of  IDRs,  the  regulatory  framework  has  been suitably  modified  to  enable  participation  of FIIs  and  Mutual  Funds  in  IDRs.  SEBI  has also  notified  a  simplified  “Model  Listing Agreement  for  IDRs”  of  issuer  companies from  the  countries  whose  securities  market regulators  are  signatories  to  the  Multilateral Memorandum  of  Understanding  of  IOSCO. The  provisions  of  this  model  Listing Agreement  are  aligned  with  the  listing requirements  of  the  issuers’  home  countries so  as  to  avoid  additional  regulatory  burden or  cost  for  the  issuer  company.  Further,  in order  to  align  the  disclosure  requirements pertaining  to  issuance  of  IDRs  with  the Companies  (Issue  of  Indian  Depository Receipts)  Rules,  2004,  amendments  relating to  disclosure  of  financial  information  in  the offer  document  in  respect  of  the  accounting standard  to  be  adhered  to  and  the  format of  disclosures  and  extent  of  applicability of  SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2009 to issuances of IDRs have been carried out. iv.   Making Issue Process More Efficient For issuers, capital market access should be easy, cost effective and time efficient. This is  all  the  more  necessary  when  issuers  are competing in the markets across the globe. In order to make our markets competitive, SEBI has  been  constantly  reviewing  various  rules and procedures to make issue process simpler, at the same time safer and cost effective. Some of the major initiatives in this area include:</td>
