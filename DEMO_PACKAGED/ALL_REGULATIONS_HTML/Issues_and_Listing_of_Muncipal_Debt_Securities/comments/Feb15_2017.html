As per these regulations, settlements of  violations are arrived at by issuing a settlement order on conclusion of  the settlement process.

In order to make securities markets safe and a level playing field and to align them with the best practices globally, SEBI reviewed the insider trading regulatory regime. On the basis of  the recommendation of  the high level committee appointed in this regard, the new regulations on prohibition of  insider trading were notified on January 15, 2015. Further, the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, inter-alia, conferred powers on SEBI to call for information from any person in relation to matters under investigation or enquiry, powers of  attachment and recovery.

In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3.

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges. However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI.
