        <td>cap, small-cap new entrepreneurs to the primary market without exposing the public to undue risk, to maintain quality of issuer companies and also to keep fly by night issuers at bay.  Accordingly <mark>amendments to SEBI(DIP) guidelines have been carried out . The amendments inter-alia include introduction of Net Tangible Assets and minimum number of allottees as additional criterion, appraisal route as an alternative to the mandatory book building route etc. Details of the amendments are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section B    Review of Book Building guidelines  Book building is a facility given to issuer companies  and merchant bankers to ascertain the demand and indicative price before the actual opening of the issue. SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue. It is extensively used in international IPOs as stabilization tool for post listing price of the newly issued shares. It is being introduced in the Indian Capital Market in the initial public offerings using book building method. It is expected to boost investors’ confidence by arresting the speculative forces which work immediately after the listing and thus results in short-term volatility in post listing price. The amendments carried out in SEBI (DIP) guidelines in this regard, have been detailed under this section in the Annexure.    Section D   Review of disclosure requirements in the offer documents  The existing disclosure requirements in the offer documents are reviewed on an ongoing basis by SEBI and based on the review, the amendments are carried out in SEBI (DIP) guidelines. The amendments under this section interalia include full disclosure about the promoters including their photograph, PAN number etc, classification of risk factors, use of standard financial units etc.  Details of the amendments are given under this section in the Annexure.     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIACORPORATION FINANCE DEPARTMENTDIVISION OF ISSUES & LISTINGMittal Court, ‘A’ Wing, Ground Floor  Nariman Point, MUMBAI - 400 021.
