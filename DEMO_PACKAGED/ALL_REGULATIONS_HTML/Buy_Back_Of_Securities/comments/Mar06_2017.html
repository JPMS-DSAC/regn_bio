Pursuant to this  amendment,  asset  management companies  can  register  themselves  under ‘proprietary trading members’ category. These (Mutual Funds) AMCs  would  be  allowed  to  trade  only  on behalf of schemes managed by them. The move could lead to the reduction in cost of trading for  AMCs  in  debt  segment,  which  in  turn could enhance the performance of debt funds. Another  change  made  by  these  regulations is  that  subject  to  certain  conditions,  the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates hold 50 percent or more of the voting rights, would be allowed to act as  custodian  for  a  mutual  fund  constituted by the same sponsor or any of its associates or subsidiary. g.

This provision  enables  imposition  of  deterrent monetary  penalties  for  illegal  mobilization of funds by floating schemes in the nature of unregistered  collective  investment  schemes within the existing scheme of adjudication. There was a perception that an activity specifically prohibited under Regulation 4(2) of  the  SEBI  (PFUTP  Regulations),  2003  was restricted to a certain class of persons despite regulation  3  being  couched  in  wide  terms to  cover  any  person  irrespective  of  who  the perpetrator  of  fraud  or  unfair/manipulative practice  is.  Therefore,  an  explanation  to regulation  4(2)  was  inserted  to  clarify  that an  activity  falling  foul  of  regulation  3  is prohibited notwithstanding that it may not be included in categories of activity enumerated in  Regulation  4(2)(a)  to  (s),  or  is  mentioned in  Regulation  4(2)(a)  to  (s),  but  is  restricted therein to a certain class of persons. j. SEBI  (Alternative  Investment  Funds) (Amendment)  Regulations,  2013  w.e.f. September 16, 2013 Giving  effect  to  the  announcement  on angel  investor  pools  in  Union  Budget  for financial  year  2013-14  by  Hon’ble  Finance Minister,  amendments  to  SEBI  (Alternative Investment  Funds)  Regulations,  2012  (“AIF Regulations”)  have  been  notified for providing  a  framework  for  registration and  regulation</mark>  of  angel  pools  under  a  sub- category ‘Angel  Funds’  under  Category I-Venture  Capital  Funds.  Salient  features  of such angel funds are as under: i.  Angel Funds have been included in the definition  of  ‘Venture  Capital  Funds’ and a separate Chapter has been inserted specific to such funds. Angel funds shall raise funds only from angel investors. In  view  of  the  high  risk  investments of  such  funds,  certain  conditions  have been imposed on investors. For instance, individual  angel investors  shall  be required to have early stage investment experience/  experience  as  a  serial entrepreneur/  be  a  senior  management professional  with  10  years  experience. They shall also be required to have net tangible  assets  of  at  least  rupees  two crore.

Further,  the  continuing  interest by sponsor/manager in the Angel Fund shall be not less than 2.5 percent of the corpus or `50 lakh, whichever is lesser.</td>
