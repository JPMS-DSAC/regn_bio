        <td>Securities  and Exchange Board of India Consultative Paper <mark>amendments to SEBI on (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 1.   On  1st  January  2008,  SEBI  came  out  with  a  consultative  paper  to  introduce “short swing profit” regulations by amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 and sought public comments on the same. In addition to the proposal of 1st January, public comment is being sought on several other proposed amendments to the regulations. 2.  Amendments were carried out in 2002 to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 (the regulations) to introduce a wide range of prophylactics and corporate governance norms. 3.  Over the course of the past few years since the amendment, there have been some new learnings in terms of the way the regulations have played out in the market.  The  key  amendments  brought  in  processes  which  would  reduce  the possibilities of insider trading by means of an institutionalized methodology e.g. pre-clearance of trades, black-out  windows  of  trading,  disclosure  of  buy/sell  by certain  insiders,  appointment  of  compliance  officer  and  a  catena  of  other provisions. 4.  There  have  been  several  instances  of  persons  of  high  integrity  committing unintended violations of these provisions. Thus, we need to be sensitive to the -1- Securities and Exchange Board of India fact that perhaps the norms have been set so high that even experts are unable to  keep  track  and  be  in  compliance  with  these  standards.  This  is  an  important issue as criminal jeopardy is attached to such corporate governance violations. In addition, there is a need to move towards a more principle based approach to regulations rather than a rule based approach, particularly in matters of corporate governance. 5.  In addition, some regulations are also proposed to be introduced. Background 6.  The  2002  amendments  to  the  Regulations  provide  extensive  suggestions  and regulations.  Most  of  the  good  governance  provisions  are  provided  for  as mandatory provisions. Briefly, the good governance regulations provide for: a) Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. b) Appointment of a compliance officer. c) Setting forth policies and procedure to restrict the possibility of abuse of insider trading. d) Monitoring and pre-clearance of trades by the designated persons. e) Restrict trading by such insiders within a certain period of time i.e. before corporate announcements, buybacks etc. are made. f) The company has to convey all the significant insider activity and corporate disclosure in a uniform publicly accessible means to the public – and to the stock exchange. g) Chinese walls within a firm to prevent one part of the firm which deals in sensitive information from going to other parts of the firm which have an inherent conflict of interest with such other parts. h) Minimum holding period of securities by insiders. i) No selective disclosure to analysts. Wide dissemination of information. -2- Securities and Exchange Board of India 7.  Provided  below  is  an  analysis  of  some  of  the  provisions  of  good  governance regulations and proposals for amendments. Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. 8.  There should be some coordination between the requirements of acquisition/sale of  shares  reported  in  these  regulations  with  the  requirements  of  the  takeover regulations. In fact the takeover reporting is broader since it mandates reporting by any person over certain thresholds and also requires reporting by a group – a concept  not  introduced  in  these  Regulations.  However,  the  insider  trading Regulations  provide  for  disclosure  of  smaller  amounts  and  provides  for disclosure  on  selling  shares  (something  which  the  takeover  code  does  not mandate). Proposal:  It  is  suggested  that  a  purchase  disclosure  made  under  either regulations (with the same or higher level of disclosure) should be deemed to be is  also  proposed good  disclosure  under the harmonization between the two in terms of threshold limits set. Regulatory Impact Assessment: As there is a proposal to harmonise the two regulation</mark>s, there is expected to be neither a substantial change in the burden on insiders nor will there be a dilution of the rights of investors. To the extent of deemed disclosure, there will be a reduction in cost without any reduction in benefit to investors.</td>

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1.

In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience. They shall also be required to have net tangible assets of atleast Rs. 2 crore. Corporate angel investors shall be required to have Rs. 10 crore net worth or be a registered AIF/VCF. iii.   Angel Funds shall have a corpus of atleast Rs.10 crore (as against Rs. 20 crore for other AIFs) and minimum investment by an investor shall be Rs. 25 lakh (may be accepted over a period of maximum 3 years) as against Rs. 1 crore for other AIFs. Further, the continuing interest by sponsor/manager in the Angel Fund shall be not less than 2.5% of the corpus or Rs. 50 lakh, whichever is lesser. iv.  For ensuring investments are genuine angel investments, angel funds shall invest only in investee companies which: a. are incorporated in India and are not more than 3 years old; and b. have a turnover not exceeding Rs.25 crore; and c.  are unlisted, and d.  are not promoted, sponsored or related to an Industrial Group whose group turnover is in excess of Rs.300 crore, and e. has no family connection with the investors proposing to invest in the company. v.  Further, investment in an investee company by an angel fund shall be not less than Rs.50 lakh and not more than Rs.5 crore and shall be required to be held for a period of at least 3 years.</td>
