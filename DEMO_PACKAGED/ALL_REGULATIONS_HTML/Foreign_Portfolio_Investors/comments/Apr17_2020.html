To this end, several investor protection measures and regulatory reforms have been initiated by SEBI from time to time for the benefit of investors and to make the Indian securities market a more transparent and safer place for their investments. 2.      In the recent past, SEBI has been receiving representations from various investors requesting for a direct and quicker forum for enabling them to register their complaints expeditiously with the intermediaries/listed companies/stock exchanges. It has also been observed in several cases that pursuant to registering a complaint, the investors do not have any mode for a follow-up or monitoring the processing of their complaints. 3.      In order to address the aforesaid representations, it is felt desirable to designate an exclusive e-mail ID of the grievance redressel division / compliance officer in which the investors would be able to register their complaints and also take necessary follow-up actions as necessary. Such a process would not only expedite the redressal of the complaints of the investors but also enable several investors across the country to register their complaints through a single, centralized, exclusive e-mail ID that is designated for the purpose. 4.      Accordingly, all the stock exchanges/registered brokers/registered sub- brokers/listed companies/depositories/registered <mark>depository participants</mark><mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark>s and clauses of the listing agreement for the implementation of the above decision immediately; 5.2 bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the member brokers/clearing members of the exchange/listed companies and also to disseminate the same on their websites; and 5.3 communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in the Monthly Development Report. 6.      The depositories are advised to:- 6.1 bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the DPs of the depositories and also to disseminate the same on their websites; 6.2 include the details of the e-mail ID in the advertisement campaigns released by them from time to time for better understanding of the investors; 6.3 make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws and business rules for the implementation of the above decision immediately, as may be applicable/necessary; and 6.4 communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in the Monthly Development Report 7.      This circular is being issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11 (1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.</td>

        <td>Dec 19, 2007 PR No.: 320/2007 PRESS RELEASE PR No.320/2007 SEBI organises workshop for market participants on “Certification of Associated Persons in the Securities Markets” Securities and Exchange Board of India organized a workshop for market participants on “Certification of Associated Persons in the Securities Markets”, in Mumbai today. Shri M. Damodaran, Chairman, SEBI, the Whole Time Members, SEBI and other senior SEBI officials interacted with market participants on the salient features of the <mark>SEBI (Certification of Associated Persons in the Securities Markets) Regulations</mark><mark>depository participants</mark>. The new regulations enlarge the scope of mandated certification to a number of new segments of intermediaries and their associated persons. All persons engaged in handling investors’ money, investors’ assets, investor complaints, dealing with operational risk, attending to compliance, and persons responsible for management of intermediaries will have to demonstrate minimum proficiency standards in order to maintain their registration with SEBI. The certificate is to be obtained by passing an examination approved by SEBI. The certificate would be valid for three years. Subsequently, such persons would be required to complete an approved programme of Continuing Professional Education to maintain the validity of certificate. SEBI has also permitted grandfathering provisions in these regulations. National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) established by SEBI has been made responsible to coordinate the task of certification in Indian Securities Markets. NISM, in discussion with the market segments, would design the examinations and engage agencies to administer computer based multiple choice tests across the country. In addition, the NISM would put in place a comprehensive continuing professional education framework involving reputed institutions. A significant development in this context would be the maintenance of complete data base of all market participants who have been certified by NISM. This is the first time that such a comprehensive database is being created. SEBI’s new initiative is expected to result in the creation of a large pool of qualified workforce in the Indian Securities Industry and spur a set of new educational programmes catering to the market professionals over a period of time. This initiative is likely to result in a significantly enhanced market quality. Mumbai December 19, 2007</td>

SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) (Amendment)  Regulations, 2017 w.e.f February 27, 2017 Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  provides  for charging interest in case of excessive delays in filing applications  or  payments  of  settlement  amounts;  a settlement notice before issuance of a formal show cause  notice,  except  for  those  which  are  excluded from  settlement;  and  re-application  of  rejected  or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest. Rationale:  These  amendments  are  made  on  the basis of the experience gained and with the purpose of  streamlining  and  strengthening  the  settlement process. v. (Infrastructure SEBI (Amendment)  Regulations, November 30, 2016 Investment  Trusts) 2016  w.e.f. Details: The amendment eases the structuring and offering  requirements  for  InvIT  by  allowing  it  to invest through a two-level SPV structure, reducing the  quantum  of  mandatory  sponsor  holdings, removing the restriction on the number of sponsors and  aligning  the  minimum  public  holding  in  line with  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957 etc.  The  amendment  also  eases  the  process  of registration of InvIT with SEBI by doing away with the requirement of filing the project implementation agreement  at  the  time  of  making  registration application.  The  amendment  also  rationalizes  the requirements for private placement of InvIT and the requirements  for  unit  holder  approval  for  related party  transactions  and  expands  the  definition  of ‘valuer’ under the Regulations. Rationale: To facilitate InvITs’ growth by easing the regulatory framework. 164 SEBI Annual Report 2016-17 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA w. SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure Requirements)  (Amendment)  Regulations, 2016 w.e.f. May 25, 2016 Details:  The  amendment  modifies  the  current mechanism of dealing with financial statements and audit  qualifications  contained  in  the  audit  reports of  listed  companies.  The  new  mechanism  inter-alia specifies that listed entities are required to disclose the cumulative impact of all the audit qualifications in  a  separate  form  called  ‘Statement  of  Audit Qualifications’  and  that  the  management  may  be given opportunity to explain its point of view on the audit qualifications. Rationale: To prescribe a new mechanism of dealing with financial statements of listed companies which have  been  qualified  by  auditors.  The  new  system which  has  been  made  applicable  from  March  31, 2017  is  simplified  and  will  also  lower  the  cost  of compliance by listed companies. x. SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure Requirements) Amendment) Regulations, 2016, w.e.f. July 8, 2016 (Second Details: The amendment mandates the top-500 listed entities based on market capitalization to formulate a  dividend  distribution  policy  as  per  suggested parameters which will be disclosed in their annual reports  and  on  their  websites.  In  case  of  deviation from  the  suggested  parameters,  this  has  to  be disclosed along with the rationale</mark>. The amendment further allows listed entities (other than the top-500 listed entities) to voluntarily disclose their dividend distribution policies.</td>
