BHAVE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA Order under Section 8 of the SCRA Act WHEREAS: 1. With a view to protect the interest of investors and to promote development of and to regulate the securities market and in particular the stock exchanges in terms of Section 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and further pursuant to sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the powers delegated by the Central Government under its notification no. SO/573(E) dated July 3, 1992 issued under 29 A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as " the Board") had through its communication dated August 19, 1992 consulted the stock exchanges on certain specific issues relating to the reconstitution of the governing bodies of the stock exchanges (hereinafter referred to as "governing bodies"), the appointment of Executive Directors including the constitution of disciplinary, arbitration and default committees of the stock exchanges; AND 2. After taking into account, the views expressed by several stock exchanges, the Board by its communication dated November 20, 1992 advised all the stock exchanges to take steps to amend their Rules or Articles of Association; AND 3. In response to the said communication dated November 20, 1992, while several stock exchanges have expressed their willingness to carry out the amendments to their respective Rules and Articles of Association, others have either suggested modifications or opposed or shown reluctance to carry out such amendments; AND 4. By a further communication dated January 1, 1993 the Board had proposed specific terms of office for President and Vice-President of the Stock Exchanges, AND 5. The Board has since considered various proposals in the light of further suggestions received from the stock exchanges pursuant to above mentioned communications and it is of the opinion that in interest of the investors and the capital market as also in the public interest , it is necessary and expedient to amend the Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, of the stock exchanges in the manner indicated in this Order for the following reasons namely : (i) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to effectively and promptly implement the directives issued by the Central Government; (ii) Some governing bodies have shown reluctance or indifference or have failed to take adequate steps for the appointment of Executive Director; (iii) The disciplinary, arbitration and default committees as constituted at present have failed to take quick, effective or timely action against erring brokers; (iv) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to enforce the Articles of Association, Rules, Regulations and Bye-laws of the stock exchanges; (v) It is a matter of common knowledge that when some members get elected on the governing board including as President or Vice-President or as members for several years they get into a position whereby they can exert excessive influence in the affairs of the stock exchange which is not desirable in the public interest; (vi) There is a need to broad base the membership of the governing bodies, and make them fully representative of various interests in the securities market in order to ensure that the affairs of the stock exchanges are conducted on healthy lines with the highest standards of professional conduct, business ethics and morality to inspire and sustain the confidence of the investing public. NOW THEREFORE in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, read with the powers delegated to the Board by the Central Government under section 29A of the said Act, the Board hereby directs all the recognised stock exchanges, more particularly mentioned in the Schedule hereunder written, to take steps, immediately but in any case not later than six months from the date of this Order, for amendment of their respective Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, be provide for the following matters :- 1.

The Board approved certain amendments to the said Guidelines. Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines. Therefore, pre- issue share capital of an unlisted company held by Venture Capital Funds and Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board shall not be subject to lock in as per the Guidelines. However, the provisions of the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors), Regulations 2000 and any amendment thereto, in this regard, shall be applicable. Section C : This section lays down the revised requirements for filing the post issue monitoring reports with the Board for both book built portion and fixed price portion.

        <td>The Group felt that if three stock exchanges in different regulatory regimes could be merged may be such a merger could be explored even in India by some of the stock exchanges. The Inter Connected Stock Exchange of India (ICSEI) had attempted such an exercise but could not succeed mainly because the order book remained split between the stock exchanges which are the 14 constituent stock exchanges of ICSEI and the order book of ICSEI. The splitting of the order book fragmented the market. Also, the clearing for the same security took place in multiple stock exchanges, which added to the cost. The Group therefore felt that some of the stock exchanges could undertake a more meaningful exercise following the example of a single order book and setting up of single clearing corporation at the national level or using the services of either Clearing Corporation / Clearing House of BSE and NSE. This exercise could serve another important economic purpose as the markets grow, as it is possible that the two large stock exchanges may raise the minimum capital requirement for an issue to be listed on these stock exchanges. Further in a competitive environment, there is a possibility of abolishing of concept of multiple listing and leaving the choice of listing in more than one stock exchange to the issuer. This would not leave any avenue for raising capital for a medium size company, which may have smaller issues. A stock exchange modeled on the Euronext could play an important economic role for the listing and trading of such issues. 9.43 The Group therefore was of the view that some of the stock exchanges could explore the possibility of merger on the lines of Euronext. The Group does not recommend any specific route as being mandatory as the choice should be dictated on commercial considerations. The Group however feels that it would be in national interest that the infrastructure available with the stock exchanges be put to best economic use. In case the stock exchanges adopt the Euronext model, SEBI will have to work out the eligibility criteria for the brokers, model rules and bye-laws for such an stock exchange, the risk containment measures, and the listing guidelines.    9.44 In sum, the Group is of the view that – a uniform model for corporatisation and demutualisation would have to be adopted by all the stock exchanges. This model should not be made applicable selectively only for a few stock exchanges; if the recommendations are adopted and suitable legislative changes carried out to implement the recommendations, the stock exchanges will be required to submit a <mark>scheme</mark> of demutualisation to SEBI by an appointed date, and non-compliance in this regard would result in lapse of recognition granted to an existing stock exchange, whether permanent or temporary; merger of stock exchanges, before or after demutualisation is a commercial decision and the choice should be left to the concerned stock exchanges and it is not within the purview of the Group to recommend a specific course of action. However, the Group strongly feels that corporatisation and demutualisation will facilitate the process of consolidation of stock exchanges; and while the Group does not wish to recommend measures which may provide an exit route to the members of the stock exchanges, any stock exchange which fails to comply with the requirement of corporatisation and demutualisation by the appointed date and is accordingly derecognised, will have to distribute its assets in accordance with the provisions of the respective articles/ rules of the stock exchange and the relevant tax laws shall become applicable. Legal changes required 9.45 The Group felt that some of the provisions in the various relevant statutes would have to be amended to implement the recommendations. Without these amendments it would be difficult to enforce the recommendations. The Group noted that the stock exchanges and the representatives of brokers have also suggested similar changes. The Group also noted that in several countries such as Australia and Singapore, a separate Act was passed to give effect to demutualisation. Among the statutes which require changes here are the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956, the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899. The Group therefore recommends that - the relevant provisions of the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956, the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899 be suitably amended to facilitate corporatisation and demutualisation of the stock exchanges and to grant fiscal exemptions to encourage this process. Acknowledgement The Group records its appreciation of the assistance received during its deliberations from the representatives of the various stock exchanges, broker associations, investor associations and the concerned officials of SEBI.    M.

The overall cap for the entire mutual funds industry to invest in ADRs/GDRs issued by Indian companies and foreign equity and debt securities, would be US $1 billion. Accordingly, it has been decided to permit each mutual fund to invest up to 10% of their net assets as on January 31, 2003 for investment in foreign securities. However, the limit of a minimum of US$ 5 million and a maximum of US$ 50 million for each mutual fund irrespective of the size of the assets as specified in SEBI circular MFD/CIR/18/21826/2002 dated November 7, 2002 remains unchanged.

        <td>To The Managing Directors and Executive Directors Of All Stock Exchanges Dear Sir, Sub :- Close out mark up in respect of debentures and bonds traded on the Stock Exchanges The SEBI circular No.SMD/Policy/IECG/5548/96 dated December 09, 1996, stipulates in para no. 1 that the mark up for the close out shall be 20% above the official closing price. This mark up was applicable to close out of equities as well as debentures and bonds. SEBI has received representations from the exchanges that the debentures and bond issued by the companies and traded at the exchanges do not experience daily price variation in fashion similar to the equities and that the presently applicable 20% close out mark up is almost equal to the interest due on bonds and debentures in most cases and thus is unduly high. The matter was discussed in the Advisory Committee on Derivatives and Market Risk Management. Pursuant to the discussions of the Advisory Committee on Derivatives and Market Risk Management, it has been decided that close out mark up of 5% would be applied in case of debentures and bonds which are assigned a credit rating of triple A and above. However, for the other debentures and the bonds without the triple A credit rating, the existing close out mark up of 20% shall be applicable as is applicable in the case of equities. The undersigned has been authorised to direct Exchanges to a)                            make neces<mark>sar</mark><mark>amendments to the bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark>s for the implementation of the above decision immediately. b)                            bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the member brokers/clearing members of the Exchange and also to disseminate the same on the website for easy access to the investors. c)                            communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in Section II, item no. 13 of the Monthly Development Report for the month of June 2003.

SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-15/00 dated December 15, 2000 and clarification issued vide letter dated SEBI/SMD/SE/15/2003/29/04 dated April 29, 2003 on the issue of an electronic contract note whereby SEBI had permitted the issue of electronic contract notes with digital signature obtained from a valid Certifying Authority provided under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). The exchanges were directed to make the neces<mark>sar</mark><mark>amendments to the bye-laws, rules and regulations for the implementation of the same. It has been brought to the notice of SEBI that the format of the electronic contract note prescribed by the exchanges were not in conformity with the format of the physical contract note particularly with respect to the pre-printed terms and conditions. Hence members issuing electronic contract notes were also issuing physical contract notes which amounted to duplication and unnecessary reconciliation between the physical and electronic contract notes. In order to streamline the issuance of electronic contract notes as a legal document like the physical contract note, the exchanges are advised to implement the following: The exchanges would prescribe a standard format for the electronic contract note (based on the model format prescribed in Annexure A) in its bye-laws, rules and regulations. The exchange bye-laws, rules and regulations for issuance of electronic contract note shall be amended to include all the standard pre-printed terms and conditions in the physical contract note. The electronic contract note would mention the relevant bye-laws / rules / regulations of the exchange subject to which the said contract note is being issued. The exchange shall also modify / amend other relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations with respect to signing of the electronic contract note with a digital signature so as to make the modified format of the electronic contract note a valid legal document like the physical contract note. The mechanism of record keeping of electronic contract notes in a soft non-tamperable form shall be prescribed by the exchange in compliance with the provisions of the IT Act, 2000. Hence you are advised to, - Make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark>s of the exchange for the implementation of the above decision immediately.

        <td>"This is a key component in devising a regulatory system which is both effective in pursuit of its objectives, and also which wins the respect and perhaps even the approval of the regulated community", Sir Davies said. Skilled regulatory resources are scarce anywhere, and particularly in developing countries. It is therefore absolutely crucial that those resources are deployed where they can make most impact, and where the need is greatest. Stressing the need for international regulatory cooperation, Sir Davies said that "it is no longer adequate for a regulator in any country to focus on domestic standards only. Any regulator must ensure that its practices are compatible with internationally agreed codes." The Governor of Maharashtra, His Excellency Shri Mohammed Fazal, said that "the role of SEBI is of prime importance to safeguard the interests of the common investor who is totally ignorant about the business environment and global trends and hence cannot assess the future of the industries". Appreciating the "metamorphosis from physical to electronic transactions", as a "welcome development", the Governor said that "this is a healthy step towards gaining the confidence of small investors for which SEBI needs to be congratulated". Tracing the growth of the securities market in India in general and SEBI in particular, Chairman, SEBI, Shri G.N. Bajpai said that "we need <mark>regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures". Explaining further on the need for regulation, Shri Bajpai said "regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combined the elements of regulation and development. ." On liberalization versus regulation, the Chairman said that " there is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalization does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. ". "Reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI", Shri Bajpai said. "These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated", he added. Shri Bajpai also highlighted the reforms in the securities market in India viz. the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992 and issuance of Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines by SEBI, thereby the market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation, establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities and introduction of nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS). "A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the participants are safe and market integrity is protected", Shri Bajpai said and gave examples of Reduction of Trading Cycle to T+2, dematerialization of stocks, introduction of derivatives, establishment of Settlement Guarantee Fund, setting up of the Central Listing Authority etc. On the future initiatives of SEBI, Shri Bajpai spoke about the setting up of a national institute to build a cadre of professionals to man the specialized functions in the securities market, corporatisation and demutualization of exchanges, introduction if market wide straight through processing from trade initiation to settlement, migration to T+1 rolling settlement, continuous review and upgradation of accounting standards, disclosures, corporate governance practices in the interest of investors, continuous review and amendment</mark> of various regulations to bring them in tune with dynamics of market requirements and introduction of new products in the market to meet all kinds of needs of market participants. Concluding his speech, Shri Bajpai said that "SEBI is working continuously and in close co-ordination with the regulated and the government, to improve market design to bring in further efficiency and transparency to market and make available newer and newer products to meet the varying needs of market participants, while protecting investors in securities. The aim is to make Indian securities market a model for other jurisdictions to follow and make SEBI the most dynamic and respected regulator globally."</td>

As agreed, in the meeting with stock exchanges, depositories, market participants and RBI held on March 24, 2003 to take stock of the preparedness of the exchanges, depositories and the market participants in implementing the T+2 rolling settlement, it has been decided that the exchanges would generate a unique code for Mutual Funds and each scheme of a Mutual Fund, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their sub-accounts. As this would require the exchanges to put in place adequate systems and carry out software changes the exchanges are provided with three months time to implement the system. Till such time the present practice of putting client IDs at the time of order entry in case of FIIs and mutual funds shall continue. The exchanges are directed to make necessary amendment</mark>s to the bye-laws, rules and regulations for the implementation of the above decision immediately. The exchanges are directed to bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the member brokers/clearing members of the exchange and also to disseminate the same on the website for easy access to the investors. The exchanges are also directed to communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in Section II, item no. 13 of the Monthly Development Report for the month of March 2003.

        <td>Dear Sir/s, Sub: Review of Dematerialisation Charges 1.      After detailed deliberations, as a first step, SEBI vide circular No.MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir-4/2005 dated 28th January, 2005 rationalized the tariff structure with regard to account opening charges, custody charges and transaction charges towards the credit of securities. 2.      Pursuant to the representations from the investor community and in order to encourage more investors to hold securities in demat mode,  SEBI vide aforesaid circular made entry into the demat environment free except from applicable statutory charges. 3.      It is observed that Depositories and Depository Participants (DPs) have been levying transaction charges for the transfer of securities from one DP to another DP although no account closure charges are levied by the  depositories or depository participants. This implies that an investor, who is not satisfied with the services of a DP, can move his BO account to another DP, only at a cost. It is desirable that investors are freed of this cost. 4.      In view of the above, it has been decided that with effect from January 09, 2006 (Monday), no charges shall be levied by a depository on DP and consequently, by a DP on a Beneficiary Owner (BO) when a BO transfers all the securities lying in his account to another branch of the same DP or to another DP of the same depository or another depository, provided the BO Account/s at transferee DP and at transferor DP are one and the same, i.e. identical in all respects. In case the BO Account at transferor DP is a joint account, the BO Account at transferee DP should also be a joint account in the same sequence of ownership. 5.      The depositories/DPs are advised to put in place neces<mark>sar</mark><mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark><mark>sar</mark>y ; b)     bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the DPs of the Depositories and also to disseminate the same on the website; and c)      Communicate to SEBI the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in the Monthly Development Report. 7.      This circular is being issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11 (1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.

        <td>Rationalizing disclosure requirements for further public offers and rights issues: Presently all companies irrespective of whether they are listed in any stock exchange or are approaching the markets for the first time with IPOs have to make identical disclosures in the prospectus / offer document. In the context of further public offers (FPO) and Rights Issues, some disclosures in the document are repetitive, as the same have been periodically disclosed to the exchanges by the listed companies. It is now proposed to do away with the repetitive disclosures in case of rights issues and FPOs by companies which have a satisfactory track record of filing disclosures with the stock exchanges, of redressing investors’ grievances etc. Common platform for electronic filing and dissemination of corporate information: In terms of the listing agreement, listed companies are required to disclose corporate information to the stock exchanges where they are listed and also on EDIFAR, a electronic filing platform currently maintained by SEBI. This results in multiple disclosures/filings for the companies that are listed on more than one exchange. SEBI, in consultation with NSE and BSE, is in the process of brining a common electronic platform maintained / run by Stock Exchanges. A listed company would be required to file only on this platform for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of listing agreement. The proposed platform would introduce single window filing and would also serve as a one stop shop for corporate information of listed companies. Introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Funds in India: Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his speech presenting the Budget 2005-06 had announced the introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Fund (GETF) in India and creation of a market for such units. Consequent upon the announcement by the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Chairman, SEBI constituted a committee to look into all aspects of facilitating the setting up of GETF in India. After considering various issues involved in the matter, the Committee recommended that the GETF may be implemented in India based on two models- (i) Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model and (ii) Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt Model. The two models are briefly as follows:- Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model- In this model, the physical gold is held by a custodian bank on behalf of the Mutual Fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt model- In this model, gold warehouse receipts are held by a custodian bank on behalf of the mutual fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold warehouse receipts with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Amendment to Takeover Regulations : SEBI Board in its meeting held today approved amendment to SEBI Takeover Regulation. The amendments would provide required flexibility to corporate restructuring. At the same time, to ensure the maintenance of minimum public shareholding for continuous listing it has been decided that if in the process of corporatre restructuring under Takeover Regulations the target company’s public shareholding falls below the prescribed minimum, the restoration of minimum public shareholding will take place through framework provided in the revised Clause 40A of Listing Agreement. Among other things, restrictions on market purchases, preferential allotments as in the Takeover Regulations have been removed. It has also been provided that the outgoing shareholder (promoter) can sell entire stake to incoming acquirer in case of takeover. Further, shareholders holding more than 55% would be able to make further acquisitions subject to making open offer. Amendment to <mark>SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its Board meeting held today has approved amendment to SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>sar</mark>y amendments are made to the MAPIN Regulations Note : The aforesaid are policy announcements based on decisions of the Board and do not reflect change in the existing legal framework until the relevant amendments are effected through issue of circulars.

        <td>Rationalizing disclosure requirements for further public offers and rights issues: Presently all companies irrespective of whether they are listed in any stock exchange or are approaching the markets for the first time with IPOs have to make identical disclosures in the prospectus / offer document. In the context of further public offers (FPO) and Rights Issues, some disclosures in the document are repetitive, as the same have been periodically disclosed to the exchanges by the listed companies. It is now proposed to do away with the repetitive disclosures in case of rights issues and FPOs by companies which have a satisfactory track record of filing disclosures with the stock exchanges, of redressing investors’ grievances etc. Common platform for electronic filing and dissemination of corporate information: In terms of the listing agreement, listed companies are required to disclose corporate information to the stock exchanges where they are listed and also on EDIFAR, a electronic filing platform currently maintained by SEBI. This results in multiple disclosures/filings for the companies that are listed on more than one exchange. SEBI, in consultation with NSE and BSE, is in the process of brining a common electronic platform maintained / run by Stock Exchanges. A listed company would be required to file only on this platform for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of listing agreement. The proposed platform would introduce single window filing and would also serve as a one stop shop for corporate information of listed companies. Introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Funds in India: Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his speech presenting the Budget 2005-06 had announced the introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Fund (GETF) in India and creation of a market for such units. Consequent upon the announcement by the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Chairman, SEBI constituted a committee to look into all aspects of facilitating the setting up of GETF in India. After considering various issues involved in the matter, the Committee recommended that the GETF may be implemented in India based on two models- (i) Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model and (ii) Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt Model. The two models are briefly as follows:- Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model- In this model, the physical gold is held by a custodian bank on behalf of the Mutual Fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt model- In this model, gold warehouse receipts are held by a custodian bank on behalf of the mutual fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold warehouse receipts with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange.

This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate <mark>scheme</mark><mark>scheme</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in. Comments, if any, on the aforesaid Report may be sent by email to rses@sebi.gov.in or by post so as to reach the following address by May 31, 2006:- Shri V.S.

        <td>In the case of trading in repos in corporate bonds, SEBI will need to write to RBI for framing the guidelines . 13 Order Matching Trading System As market participants gain experience with trade reporting and the first phase of clearing and settlement systems, efforts should be made to develop online order matching platforms for corporate bonds. Such trading platforms can be set up by the stock exchanges or jointly by regulated institutions like banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, etc. SEBI would frame specific guidelines for setting up such trading platforms. Any platform, other than the one offered by a stock exchange would effectively be performing the functions of an exchange to a limited extent and as such would need the specific approval of SEBI; The Committee recognizes the need for more than one category of member viz., some who will trade on their own account and/or some who will do agency business. The membership criteria and responsibilities would be significantly different between the various types of members. The provisions of the relevant legislations/<mark>regulations may be reviewed and appropriate amendment</mark><mark>sar</mark><mark>sar</mark>y to avoid multiplicity of regulators for entities taking limited purpose membership for trading on their own behalf in the proposed trading and clearing platforms, the responsibility of regulating their activity in corporate bonds through trading platforms will vest with SEBI while the primary regulation of these institutions will continue to vest with their respective primary regulators. Appropriate approvals may be considered by concerned regulators to enable free participation on the trading platform through limited membership by the concerned entities for the purpose of their proprietary trading. The major holders of corporate bonds like banks, FIs, PDs, PFs, Insurance companies are not regulated by SEBI. Hence, SEBI will have to write to all concerned regulators who will advise their regulated agencies to trade on the designated order matching system. SEBI can in the interest of market will mandate a particular exchange to begin with to set up an order matching system. The same exchange which provides the centralized data base should ideally have order matching system. This system or platform should be separate from that of equity and derivative platforms already existing. The trades should be settled through novation and settlement guarantee fund, and as in the case of equities, the clearing agency of the exchange should be connected to the depositories for electronic transfer of bonds. At a later date when trading picks up and the market deepens, SEBI can examine whether there is a scope for other trading platforms to be set up. Also the chosen exchange should examine the scope of introducing T+1 settlement only for corporate debt, if it has to compete effectively with the OTC/telephone market. In the case of NDS also settlement is mostly on T+1 basis, if not on T+0 (i.e same day). SEBI can announce the plan through a comprehensive press release first, to put the market on notice. 14</td>

However, in the derivative market, the risk parameter files for computation of the margins are updated intra-day. 3.      With a view to ensure market safety and protect the interest of investors and also to further align the risk management framework across the cash and derivative markets, it has been decided that the risk arrays should be updated intra-day in the cash market as has been done in the derivative market. The applicable VaR margin rates shall be updated atleast 5 times in a day, which may be carried out by taking the closing price of the previous day at the start of trading and the prices at 11:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and at the end of the trading session. 4.      While BSE and NSE shall implement the aforesaid methodology with effect from July 10, 2006, the other stock exchanges shall implement the same with effect from August 28, 2006. The stock exchanges are advised to note that from the date of the said implementation, no stock exchange shall permit trading activity unless it is in a position to implement the aforesaid methodology. 5.      The Stock Exchanges are also advised to ; 5.1.   make neces<mark>sar</mark><mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark>s for the implementation of the above decision immediately. 5.2.   bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the member brokers/clearing members of the Exchange and also to disseminate the same on the website. 5.3.   communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in Section II, item no. 13 of the Monthly Development Report for the month of July, 2006. 6.      This circular is being issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.

MFD/CIR/9/120/2000 dated November 24, 2000, regarding dispatch of account statement to the unit holders. 1.      Mutual Funds, at present, dispatch the account statements to the unit holders under Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)/Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)/Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) on monthly/quarterly/half yearly basis, as may be applicable. AMFI has represented to SEBI that with the increase in the number of investors opting for SIP/STP/SWP, the statement of accounts that each Mutual Fund has to send every month has increased. The proposal of AMFI has been examined. Mutual Funds may, henceforth, dispatch the statement of accounts to the unit holders under SIP/STP/SWP once every quarter ending March, June, September and December within 10 working days of the end of the respective quarter. However, the first account statement under SIP/STP/SWP shall be issued within 10 working days of the initial investment. In case of specific request received from investors, Mutual Funds shall provide the account statement to the investors within 5 working days from the receipt of such request without any charges. Further, soft copy of the account statement shall be mailed to the investors under SIP/STP/SWP to their e-mail address on a monthly basis, if so mandated. 2.      At present the account statements are sent to unit holders only in case of a transaction in the unit holder’s account. In the interest of investors, the Mutual Funds shall provide the account statements to the unit holders who have not transacted during the last six months prior to the date of generation of account statements. The account statements in such cases may be generated and issued along with the Portfolio Statement or Annual Report of the <mark>scheme</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark>, 1996, to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market.

        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

Under the DVP III mode of settlement, it is possible to sell government securities, already contracted for purchase without taking delivery provided the transaction is guaranteed by an approved central counterparty namely Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL). Presently, mutual funds cannot sell such securities contracted for purchase as they are required under SEBI Regulations to take the actual physical delivery of securities. This decision taken at the SEBI Board meeting held on April 16, 2008 at Mumbai will put mutual funds at par with other market participants like Banks, Primary Dealers and Insurance Companies as they can now go in for the net settlement of government securities transactions.

        <td>Apr 16, 2008 PR No.: 99 /2008 PR No. 99 /2008 SEBI ALLOWS MUTUAL FUNDs TO GO FOR NET SETTLEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS In its efforts to further develop the debt market, SEBI has now decided to allow mutual funds to sell government securities contracted for purchase in DVP III mode for government securities market in accordance with the guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India in this regard. Under the DVP III mode of settlement, it is possible to sell government securities, already contracted for purchase without taking delivery provided the transaction is guaranteed by an approved central counterparty namely Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL). Presently, mutual funds cannot sell such securities contracted for purchase as they are required under SEBI Regulations to take the actual physical delivery of securities. This decision taken at the SEBI Board meeting held on April 16, 2008 at Mumbai will put mutual funds at par with other market participants like Banks, Primary Dealers and Insurance Companies as they can now go in for the net settlement of government securities transactions. The Board also approved the participation of mutual funds in ‘when-issued’ (WI) market. Neces<mark>sar</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark>, 1996 will follow. Mumbai April 16, 2008</td>

        <td>Exemptions have been made precise, streamlined and provided with clear conditions on the basis of the specific charging provision from which exemptions would be available. Some of the areas where clarity has been brought in include <mark>scheme</mark><mark>regulations provide for exchange offers, the same has not been used for want of clarity on whether such issuance would attract provisions of preferential allotment and public issue requirements. The Committee has recommended that SEBI may consider making suitable amendments to ICDR/ other regulations as applicable. Competing offers The Committee has recommended certain changes such as increasing the period for making a competing bid, prohibiting acquirers from being represented in the board of target company, and permitting any competing acquirer to negotiate and acquire the shares tendered to the other competing acquirer, at the same price that was offered by him to the public. Execution of the agreement that triggers open offer The Committee has recommended that the execution of the agreement that triggered the open offer obligation may be completed during the pendency of the open offer provided 100% of the consideration payable under the open offer is deposited in escrow. Currently, an agreement which triggers an open offer can be consummated only after completion of the offer formalities. The Committee has further recommended that execution of such agreement would have to be completed within 26 weeks after the offer period. Currently the regulations are silent on this aspect. Governance Issues The current Regulations restrict the target company from undertaking certain transactions during the offer period. The Committee thought it fit to bring in materiality concept as also to enhance the scope of such restrictions to include transactions by subsidiaries since potentially material transactions can be undertaken at the level of any subsidiary of the target company without approval of shareholders of the target company. The Committee has also decided to mandate recommendation on the open offer, by a committee of independent directors of the target company. This is currently optional. Activities and Timelines in open offer process Timelines of various activities in the open offer process have been rationalized to compress the open offer period. The Committee has also recommended that a short public announcement should be made by the acquirer on the date of entering in to an agreement followed by a detailed public statement within five business days thereafter. The Committee was constituted by SEBI in September 2009 to examine and review the Takeover Regulations of 1997 and suggest suitable amendment</mark>s as deemed fit. The committee comprises the following members: 1.                  Shri C. Achuthan, Former Presiding Officer, Securities Appellate Tribunal – Chairman. 2.                  Shri Kumar Desai, Advocate, High Court, Mumbai 3.                  Shri Somasekhar Sundaresan, Advocate; Partner, J.

However, MPS not only failed to fulfill the conditions of Provisional Registration, it also raised money from the public in violation of the conditions of provisional registration and it appears to be still mobilizing money from public. As per information provided by ICRA Limited, the total outstanding balance of funds with the company stood at around Rs.1169.39 crores as on January 25,  2011. Moreover, MPS had issued a newspaper advertorial which wrongly stated that the company is allowed to carry out Collective Investment Scheme activities. While the aforesaid directions take effect as on the date of the order, the company may make its submissions, if any, within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the order. The full text of the order is available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in.</td>

        <td>b)  Immediate and continuous disclosures of material RPTs: Presently,  RPTs  are  disclosed  to  Stock  Exchanges  only  annually.  This  limits  the effectiveness of the disclosure as the information reaches the investors much after the transactions were carried out. Many of the jurisdictions such as Singapore, Italy and Israel have provisions mandating immediate  disclosure  of  the  material  RPTs.  This  would  help  in  better  scrutiny  of  the transactions  by  investors,  public,  regulators  and  the  media  thereby  limiting  scope  for abusive  RPTs.  This  requirement  can  be  mandated  by  amending  the  reporting requirements  specified  under  the  Listing  Agreement.  Suitable  threshold  limits  for  the reporting requirements need to be analyzed. c) Prohibiting/regulating grant of affirmative rights to certain investors: 27 Whenever a company seeks funds from a private equity investor or a financial institution, it  will  enter  into  shareholders/share  subscription  or  investment  agreement.  In  these agreements, it is normal to find clauses pertaining to "drag along rights" and "tag-along rights". Apart from these rights, sometimes these agreements do grant certain superior rights  to  these  investors    like  access  rights  information  (right  to  receive  selective information), right to appoint their nominee directors in the board, requirements that the presence  of  their  nominee  is  neces<mark>sar</mark>y  to  constitute  a  quorum  etc.  These  rights  are subsequently  incorporated  into  the  articles  of  the  company  by  amending  the  articles. Further, in the case of Messer Holdings Limited, Bombay High Court on September 1, 2010,  has  held  that  such  consensual  agreements  between  shareholders  are  legally valid. Though these rights are intended to protect the institutions investing their funds in these companies, since these rights are not available to all the other shareholders, especially minority  shareholders,  it  is  debatable  as  to  whether  these  superior  rights  may  lead  to oppression  of  minority.  Apart  from  that,  there  are  also  concerns  regarding  selective sharing  of  price  sensitive  information  to  these  investors.    Though,  these  may  be oppressive to  minority shareholders, it appears that presently there are no restrictions for a listed company to  enter into such an agreement, as such an amendment to articles may not, presently, be in violation of clauses of listing agreement or SEBI Regulations. The remedy can be obtained by minority holders through a petition made under Section 397/398 to the Company Law Board (against oppression and mis-management). In  this  regard,  it  has  to  be  examined  whether  listed  company  should  be  permitted  to enter into such an agreement granting superior affirmative rights to selective investors d)  Approval of major RPTs by ‘Majority of the minority’ Many of the abusive RPTs are undertaken between company groups controlled by the controlling shareholders. As such, providing for shareholders approval of RPTs may not serve the intended purpose as the controlling shareholders intended to do an abusive RPT  would  have  sufficient  majority  to  obtain  the  shareholder  approval  easily.  Hence, there  is  a  requirement  for  mandating  approval  of  such  major  RPTs  by  majority  of  the minority or disinterested shareholders. Such a requirement is in practice in some of the developed jurisdictions. As  suggested  by  SEBI,  Clause-188  of  the  Companies  Bill,  2012  contains  a  similar provision  prohibiting  interested  shareholders  from  voting  in  Related  Party  Transaction approvals.

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience. They shall also be required to have net tangible assets of atleast Rs. 2 crore. Corporate angel investors shall be required to have Rs. 10 crore net worth or be a registered AIF/VCF. iii.   Angel Funds shall have a corpus of atleast Rs.10 crore (as against Rs. 20 crore for other AIFs) and minimum investment by an investor shall be Rs. 25 lakh (may be accepted over a period of maximum 3 years) as against Rs. 1 crore for other AIFs. Further, the continuing interest by sponsor/manager in the Angel Fund shall be not less than 2.5% of the corpus or Rs. 50 lakh, whichever is lesser. iv.  For ensuring investments are genuine angel investments, angel funds shall invest only in investee companies which: a. are incorporated in India and are not more than 3 years old; and b. have a turnover not exceeding Rs.25 crore; and c.  are unlisted, and d.  are not promoted, sponsored or related to an Industrial Group whose group turnover is in excess of Rs.300 crore, and e. has no family connection with the investors proposing to invest in the company. v.  Further, investment in an investee company by an angel fund shall be not less than Rs.50 lakh and not more than Rs.5 crore and shall be required to be held for a period of at least 3 years.</td>

(ii)  Under the current rule, while non-PSUs are required to have minimum 25% public shareholding, PSUs are required to have only 10%, which is discriminatory and inconsistent with the broader market design. (iii)  Therefore, SEBI has decided to recommend to Ministry of Finance that SCRR should be amended so that all the listed companies including PSUs shall be required to achieve and maintain minimum public shareholding of 25% of the total number of issued shares, within a time period of three years. (3)  Increasing the investment bucket for anchor investor In order to increase the share of serious, committed investors, SEBI has decided to increase the anchor investor’s bucket to 60% from the current requirement of 30% of the institutional bucket. (4)  Eligibility of shares for Offer for Sale in an IPO with respect to bonus issues on shares held for more than a year The Board approved the proposal to permit bonus shares issued in last one year prior to filing of the draft offer document to be offered for sale, provided that these bonus shares were issued out of the free reserves or share premium. (5)  Amendments to regulations governing the preferential issue norms In order to bring consistency between various regulations and to clarify certain regulations governing the preferential issue norms, the following has been approved: (i)  Replace 'closing price' with 'volume weighted average price' in the pricing formula for preferential issues (ii)  The regulations concerning pricing of QIPs take into account the effect of stock split, bonus, etc. However, this has not been explicitly provided for in the regulations concerning preferential issues. SEBI has decided to extend the same treatment to preferential issues also. (iii)  The regulations concerning preferential issues do not provide specifically for pricing of infrequently traded shares.
