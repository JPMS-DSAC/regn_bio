The Board has approved that in respect of the cases involving issuance of securities to more than 49 persons but up to 200 persons in a financial year, the companies may avoid penal action if they had provided the investors with an option to surrender the securities and get the refund amount at a price not less than the amount of subscription money paid along with 15% interest p.a. thereon.

In case of transfer of securities by the original allottees, option for refund may be provided to the current holders of the securities.

As a green initiative, the business responsibility reports can be given on the websites of the companies providing website link for the same in their annual reports. 8)Exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process regarding exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders under Companies Act, 2013 in case of change in objects or varying the term of contracts referred to in the prospectus. 9) Public issuance of convertible securities The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process for revival of public issuance of convertible securities by listed entities. 10) Delisting of Small Companies Delisting Regulations provide for simplified procedure of delisting for small companies and exempt them from the requirements of Chapter IV of the Delisting Regulations subject to certain conditions.

The companies may adjust the amounts already paid to the allottees either as interest / dividend or otherwise from the amount of refund to be paid to the investors. In case of transfer of securities by the original allottees, option for refund may be provided to the current holders of the securities. The refunds made by the company following the option for refund exercised by investors would be certified by independent practicing Chartered Accountants / practicing Company Secretaries / practicing Cost Accountants. The proposal has taken into account the interest of investors while recognising their right to stay invested in case they feel it is beneficial to them. 7) Business Responsibility Reporting by Listed Entities SEBI has, vide circular dated August 13, 2012, mandated Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) requirement for top 100 listed entities based on market capitalization in their annual reports. The key principles which are required to be reported by the entities include the areas such as environment, social, governance, stakeholder’s relationships, etc. SEBI Board has now approved that present applicability of BRR be extended to top five hundred listed entities based on market capitalization as on March 31st of every year. As a green initiative, the business responsibility reports can be given on the websites of the companies providing website link for the same in their annual reports. 8)Exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process regarding exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders under Companies Act, 2013 in case of change in objects or varying the term of contracts referred to in the prospectus. 9) Public issuance of convertible securities The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process for revival of public issuance of convertible securities by listed entities. 10) Delisting of Small Companies Delisting Regulations provide for simplified procedure of delisting for small companies and exempt them from the requirements of Chapter IV of the Delisting Regulations subject to certain conditions. Currently, one of such conditions is that the shares of the company have not been traded for the preceding one year. Based on suggestion receive from Investor Association, Board has approved the proposal that the condition of no trading for preceding one year may be relaxed and the small companies, whose trading of equity shares during the twelve calendar months is less than 10% of the total number of shares of such company, would also be eligible for simplified procedure of delisting. However, to protect the interest of investors, the exit price shall not be less than the floor price determined for the purpose of Reverse Book Building for not frequently traded securities in terms of Delisting Regulations read with SEBI Takeover Regulations.</td>

With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / non-convertible redeemable preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of the wilful defaulters. Any company or its promoter or its director categorized as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to take control over other listed entity.

Or, any other option as may be decided after consultation. The discussion paper inviting comments will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.</td>

        <td>Besides, ODI subscribers are not permitted to have an Opaque Structure(s). The term “Opaque Structure” means any structure such as protected cell company, segregated cell company or equivalent, where the details of the ultimate beneficial owners are not accessible or where the beneficial owners are ring fenced from each other or where the beneficial owners are ring fenced with regard to enforcement. It may also be noted that NRIs/Resident Indians are not permitted to transact in ODIs. The Board noted that in view of the strict norms for ODI issuance, the notional value of ODIs to the AUC of FPIs has declined over the years from a high of 55.7% in June 2007 to 10% in March 2016. However, the concerns raised by the Special investigations Team (SIT) with regard to identification of Beneficial Owners and transferability of ODIs were also discussed and the Board approved the following additional measures for the purpose of enhancing the transparency and control over the issuance of ODIs: Applicability of Indian KYC/AML norms for Client Due Diligence (i)         Presently, the ODI issuers follow the KYC/AML norms of either the jurisdiction of the end beneficial owner or of the jurisdiction of the ODI issuer. In order to bring about an uniformity in the KYC/AML norms, it has been decided that Indian KYC/AML norms will now be applicable to all ODI issuers. The KYC/AML norms applicable to ODI issuers will be the same as that for all other domestic investors. ODI Issuers shall be required to identify and verify the beneficial owners in the subscriber entities, who hold in excess of the threshold as defined under Rule 9 of the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 i.e. 25% in case of a company and 15% in case of partnership firms/ trusts/ unincorporated bodies. In such cases, the ODI issuers shall be required to identify and verify the person(s) who control the operations of these entities. Prior permission for Transferability of ODIs (Amendment to <mark>SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations, ODI subscribers are not required to take prior permission of the ODI Issuer for transfer of ODIs to another investor offshore. In order to tighten the ODI regime and have more control over issuance and transfer of ODIs, it has been decided that the ODI subscribers will have to seek prior permission of the original ODI issuer for further/onward issuance/transfer of ODIs. Reporting of complete transfer trail of ODIs (iii)       Presently, the details of the holder of ODIs have to be mandatorily reported to SEBI on a monthly basis. The ODI issuers are also required to capture the details of all the transfers of the ODIs issued by them and these can be made available to SEBI on demand. The Board decided that in the monthly reports on ODIs all the intermediate transfers during the month would also be required to be reported. KYC Review (iv)       The KYC review shall be done on the basis of the risk criteria as determined by the ODI issuers, as follows: a.         At the time of on-boarding and once every three years for low risk clients b.         At the time of on-boarding and every year for all other clients Suspicious Transactions Report (v)        ODI Issuers shall be required to file suspicious transaction reports with the Indian FIU, if any, in relation to the ODIs issued by it. Reconfirmation of ODI positions (vi)       ODI Issuers shall be required to carry out reconfirmation of the ODI positions on a semi-annual basis. Periodic Operational Evaluation (vii)      ODI Issuers shall be required to put in place necessary systems and carry out a periodical review and evaluation of its controls, systems and procedures with respect to the ODIs. Suitable amendments to the Regulations/Circulars shall be made to bring the above mentioned measures into effect. B. Dividend distribution policy for listed companies SEBI Board approved the proposal for the top 500 listed companies (by way of market capitalization) to formulate and disclose their dividend distribution policies in the annual reports and on their websites. Such policy may include: a)         The circumstances under which their shareholders can or cannot expect dividend; b)         The financial parameters that will be considered while declaring dividends; c)         Internal and external factors that would be considered for declaration of dividend; d)         Policy as to how the retained earnings will be utilized. e)         Provisions in regard to various classes of shares. When the company proposes to declare dividend on the basis of parameters other than what is mentioned in such policy or proposes to change its dividend distribution policy, the same along with the rationale shall be disclosed. This step will help the investors in taking well informed investment decisions. C. Amendment to Regulation 33 of Securities Contracts Regulation (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The Board took note that the requirement of establishing Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF) was introduced by SEBI vide circular dated August 27, 2014 and Core SGFs have now been built up in the clearing corporations. It also considered the recommendations of the Expert Committee, constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri K V Kamath, to look into various issues relating to clearing corporations including the issue of transfer of 25% of profits by stock exchanges to the core SGF of clearing corporations, and observations of the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI. Taking note that Core SGF have been built up, it was decided to do away with the said requirement of transfer of 25% of profits by stock exchanges. However, there will be a mandate that stock exchanges, along with clearing corporations, shall replenish the Core SGF immediately, in case of any shortfall in the corpus. Such a review will take place on a monthly basis or earlier as and when required. Accordingly, the Regulations would be amended to give effect to the above decision of the Board. D. Amendments to the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 SEBI has notified the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 on September 26, 2014. For smoothening the process of registration of InvIT with SEBI and launching of the offer, SEBI Board has approved for bringing out a consultation paper proposing certain changes/providing clarification in the InvIT Regulations on the following points: 1.         Allowing InvITs to invest in two-level SPV structure. 2.         Mandatory sponsor holding in InvIT to be reduced to 10% from current requirement of 25%, subject to certain conditions. 3.         Increase in the number of sponsors from 3 to 5. 4.         Other operational requirements, such as, aligning regulations in line with the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and SCRR, filing of Project Implementation Agreement at the time of filing of offer document, etc. The consultation paper will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments. E. Guidance Note  on Settlement and procedural changes in processing of Compounding applications Settlement Regulations were formulated primarily to settle minor and technical violations not having wider impact on the market so that enforcement is concentrated on major and significant cases. During the year 2015-16, number of settlement cases have come down putting pressure on the enforcement system.  An analysis revealed that   there are certain doubts on the interpretation of Regulation 5 (2) (b) of Settlement Regulations.  An internal guidance note was issued on March 03, 2016 clarifying the doubts so that more serious and substantial cases are only taken up for enforcement action. For this purpose, defaults which in the opinion of the Board have a bearing on the securities market as whole and not just the listed security and its investors may be considered to have market wide impact.  The assessment of facts and circumstances while deciding the seriousness of the default in relation to an applicant shall take into account the weight and the sufficiency of the evidence. The guidance note was placed before the Board and while noting the contents of the memorandum, it approved that the guidance note be incorporated in the regulations. Further, in dealing with prosecution cases for non-payment of penalty, where compounding request has been filed and where full penalty with interest is paid, the Board took note of the simplification in the procedure for disposing of these matters. F. Amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996 During 2014, Parliament has amended Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996, providing for minimum and maximum monetary penalties and discretion to impose appropriate penalty by the adjudicating officer. However, this is prospective and not applicable to cases falling between 2002 and 2014. Pursuant to the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in the matter of  Roofit Industries Ltd., a need arose for clarifying the monetary penalty provisions in the securities laws, relating to cases prior to 2014.  In view of this, Board approved to send a proposal to the Central Government for amendment</mark>s in the law. G. Establishment of SEBI Chair at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM): The Board considered and approved the proposal for establishment of up to two "SEBI Chairs" at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) by contributing a certain corpus to NISM. NISM is a public trust established by SEBI. SEBI Chairs would provide research based policy inputs and would also help in increasing academic interest and awareness about the activities of SEBI. SEBI Chairs would also undertake activities of publishing research papers, policy notes, concept notes etc., in addition to delivering lectures and seminars. The selection of SEBI Chairs would be with Academic Council of NISM.</td>

A robust & credible warehousing  infrastructure  is  sine  qua  non  for  an  effective  Commodity Derivatives Market that can inspire confidence amongst the market participants and  other  stake  holders.  At  the  time  of  the  merger  of  Forward  Market Commission  (FMC)  with  SEBI,  with  a  view  to  ensuring  good  delivery  of commodities  on  expiry  of  the  futures  contract,  SEBI  decided  to  fasten  the responsibility of settlement of the futures contact, including good delivery on the commodity derivatives exchanges. With this objective neces<mark>sar</mark>y amendments were  carried  out  by  inserting  Regulation  44D(2)  in  Securities  Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 ("SECC  Regulations"),    by  providing  that  every  commodity  derivatives exchange (in short, exchange) shall ensure guarantee for settlement of trades including good delivery. 2.  It is therefore, incumbent upon the commodity derivatives exchanges to  have in place comprehensive framework of norms for adherence by the Warehouse Service  Providers  (WSP),  warehouse,  assayers  and  other  allied  service providers engaged by them so as to exercise a robust mechanism, for ensuring good delivery as mandated under the SECC Regulations. In order to facilitate good delivery by the commodity derivatives exchanges by providing therein with a  set  of  minimum  standards  and  norms  for  compliance  by  the  accredited warehouses, the existing norms for exchange accredited WSPs, warehouses and assayers have been reviewed.</td>

It  is  recommended  that  both  IRDA  and  PFRDA  issue  suitable clarification  to  the  effect  that  Insurers  and  pension  funds  will  have  the permission to invest in Category II AIFs so long as such AIFs invest primarily in unlisted investee companies and in accordance with the AIF Regulations. Draft Notification for Amendments in TISPRO Regulations, 2000 It is recommended that Explanation 1 of para 4 of the RBI notification issued on 16th November, 2015 (No. FEMA 355/2015-RB)  amending the TISPRO Regulations, 2000, should be amended as follows: Explanation 1: For purposes of determining level of foreign ownership of the Sponsor or the manager or investment manager of an AIF referred to above, account should  not be taken of the holdings of equity in an Indian promoter company  of  such  Sponsor  or the  manager  or  investment  manager  which  is held by foreign institutional investors or foreign portfolio investors or non- resident Indians under the portfolio investment <mark>scheme</mark> unless  these shares are held by the foreign promoters of the applicant and their subsidiaries and nominees, and Indian mutual funds to the extent the investment of foreign institutional  investors  and  Indian  mutual  funds  are  within  the  approved limits  laid  down  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  under  its rules, regulations or guidelines issued from time to time.</td>

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges. However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI. SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 to provide for a criteria alternative to "Net Worth" for municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations The SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 (ILDM) provides that a municipality or a Corporate Municipal Entity (CME) making public issue of debt securities, under these regulations shall not have negative net worth in any of three immediately preceding financial years. In order to facilitate issuance of debt securities under these regulations by entities other than CME, the Board agreed that the Municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations shall have surplus as per its Income and Expenditure Statement, in any of the three immediately preceding financial years or any other financial criteria as specified by SEBI from time to time. VII. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 On the basis of experience gained and with the purpose of streamlining and strengthening the settlement process, Board approved amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014.  The amendment</mark>s, inter alia, provide for charging of interest in case of excessive delays in filing of applications or payment of settlement amount;  settlement Notice before issuance of a formal show cause notice, except those which are excluded from settlement; re-application of rejected or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest; situations when  joint and several liability is taken into account for determining settlement amount and Incentive for defaulters to come voluntarily on their own, before initiation of investigation or enforcement action.

Recommendation and rationale: The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  listed  banks,  NBFCs  and  insurance  companies  are  important financial intermediaries, critical to the sanctity of India’s financial markets and its growth. Given the principle-based  rules  of  IND-AS  and  resultant  disclosures  in  financial  statements,  the  Committee recommends  full  implementation  of  IND-AS as currently scheduled without extension, for all listed entities including banks, NBFCs and insurance companies.

The Committee suggests that SEBI take up the above recommendation with the relevant authorities/ regulators, as necessary. 11. Strengthening Monitoring, Oversight and Enforcement by SEBI A. Review of Audit Qualifications Current regulatory provisions: Earlier, SEBI LODR  Regulations had detailed provisions on  the  review of audit qualifications  by the Qualified Audit report Review Committee (QARC) and further reference of the same to the Financial Reporting Review Board (FRRB) of ICAI. However, after consultation with SEBI Advisory Committees, ICAI,  Stock  Exchanges  and  Industry  Bodies,  it  was  decided  by  SEBI  to  discontinue  with  QARC mechanism and in place of the same, require disclosures on the impact of audit qualifications. Recommendation and rationale</mark>: The Committee is of the view that any audit qualification needs detailed scrutiny and therefore, the QARC  mechanism  may  be  revived  or  any  other  similar  mechanism  may  be  devised  wherein  audit qualifications are examined in greater detail. It is also recommended that the process to be followed by such committee should be time bound. Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations: Suitable amendments may be made as determined by SEBI. 86 Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 B.

The  statutory  audit  process  forms  the  bedrock  of  reliance  by  external  stakeholders (shareholders, lenders and regulatory authorities, among others) on the financial performance of  a  listed  entity,  making  statutory  auditors  the  principal  gatekeepers,  enhancing  corporate governance.  ICAI, as the  professional services regulator, regulates the  profession of chartered accountants  and  has  a  mechanism  in  place  for  disciplinary  proceedings  against  them.  The Companies Act also sets forth detailed provisions for responsibilities and liabilities of auditors, which are administered by the MCA.</td>
