        <td> Press note 1. Under the existing rule 8 of the Securities <mark>contract</mark>s (Regulation) Rules 1957, a company formed in compliance with the provisions of Section 322 of the Companies Act 1956 is eligible to become a member of a Stock Exchange. The rule also requires that a majority of the directors of such a company are its shareholders and also members of a Stock Exchange and that the directors of the company, who are members of a Stock Exchange, have unlimited liability in the company. Experience has shown that the existing rule is not conducive to the growth of corporate membership in Stock Exchanges. Accordingly, Government have issued a Notification on 2nd June, 1992 containing draft of certain rules further to amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation)Rules 1957. 2. After considering the objections or suggestions on the draft rules received from the public and Stock Exchanges in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Government have issued a Notification in the gazette of India on 13th November, 1992 amending Rule 8 of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules 1957 in order to provide at a company formed in compliance with the provisions of Section 12 of the Companies Act 1956 will also be eligible to become a member of a Stock Exchange subject to certain conditions. Some of the important conditions are as follows :-   i. such a company undertakes to comply with such financial requirements and norms as may be specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for the registration of such company under sub-section (1) of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Act, 1992;</td>

        <td> 2. The committee was disadvantaged by the fact that no reliable precise data are available with regard to the income from the above activities and the turnover generated thereon. The committee has figures of turnover in the Bombay Stock Exchange, however, the break-up of the turnover related to different categories enumerated above is not available from all over the country. The committees had therefore, to rely on empirical methods. For example, while brokerage scales are fixed by stock exchanges and brokers are required to pass on the price paid by a broker on the floor of the exchange to the client , frequent complaints are received from investors that these norms are not followed. Reliable data are not available as to the magnitude of the difference between the price paid by a broker and the price charged to a client. Maximum brokerage chargeable is 2.5 percent. No data on actual brokerage is available because a trading practice has evolved over the years that <mark>contract</mark> notes are issued showing a consolidated amount payable and receivable and brokerage is not indicated separately. The badla financing rates vary between 20 to 50 percent per annum. Jobbing differences vary widely across scrips, there are no ceilings on such differences. Functions like underwriting, collection of deposits, etc will not result in trading turnover but would contribute to income. However, taking into account different factors the committee has, therefore, assumed that even at a conservative estimate gross income of one percent on the turnover (as defined in the Regulations and as mentioned above) would not be an unfair assumption. 3. The committee has worked out examples to illustrate the extent of incidence of registration fees payable by brokers with a turnover of Rs.1 crore, Rs. 10 crores and Rs. 100 crores. The table below illustrates the figures.</td>
