Based on the consultative paper and the comments received thereon, the SEBI Board today approved the proposal to amend Listing Regulations to enforce disclosures and shareholder approval for all such agreements including existing agreements that extend beyond the date of the amendment. The revised norms for such disclosures and shareholder approvals are as under: i)          No employee including key managerial personnel, director or promoter of a <mark>listed entity</mark> shall enter into any agreement for himself or on behalf of any other person, with any shareholder or any other third party with regard to compensation or profit sharing unless prior approval has been obtained from the Board as well as public shareholders.</td>

Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3.

In order to specify uniform standards and to address the gaps or overlaps in legal or regulatory standards governing all the intermediaries/persons engaged in providing investment advisory services, SEBI had issued two consultation papers on October 07, 2016 and June 22, 2017 seeking public comments on the clarifications/amendments to SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013.2. Based on the feedback received from the consultation process and the meetings with various stakeholders, it was felt that there is a need to prevent the conflict of interest between advising for investing in financial products and selling of financial products. Considering the same, SEBI Board has approved the consultation paper to  seek public comments on following proposals:i) There should be clear segregation between the two activities of the entity i.e. providing investment advice and distribution of the investment products/ execution of investment transactions.ii) Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs), while distributing their mutual fund products can explain the features of products to client, and shall ensure the principle of ‘appropriateness’ of products to the client. The consultation paper will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.9. Fees Payable by Stock Brokers Trading in "Options" in Commodity DerivativesOn introduction of Options contract in Commodity Derivatives, SEBI Board has decided to amend the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992, such that the manner of calculation of turnover fees for Options contracts in Commodity Derivatives shall be computed the same way as computed for Options contract in Equity Derivatives. 10. Integration of trading in commodity derivatives market with other segments of securities market at exchange levelHon’ble Union Finance Minister, while presenting the Union budget for the FY 2017-2018, proposed that the commodities and securities derivative markets will be further integrated by integrating the participants, brokers, and operational frameworks. For the sake of smoother implementation of the above budget announcement regarding integration between commodity derivatives and rest of the securities markets, it was decided that the integration would be achieved in two phases. In Phase-I, it was proposed to have integration at Intermediary level. In Phase-II, necessary steps would be taken to enable a single exchange to operate various segments such as equity, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, interest rate futures & debt etc.With regards to Phase-I, all necessary steps required to enable integration of commodity derivatives market with rest of the securities markets at intermediary’s level have been taken by SEBI.In order to implement phase II i.e. to permit trading of commodity derivatives and other segments of securities market on single exchange,   the Board approved the proposal to remove the restrictions by making suitable amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporation) Regulations, 2012 (“SECC Regulations”). The amendment</mark>s to the SECC Regulations would be effective from October 1, 2018.MumbaiDecember 28, 2017 </td>
