        <td>PART - A CLARIFICATIONS ON THE ISSUES ARISING OUT OF THE VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS ON FEES TO BE PAID BY BROKERS TO SEBI The issues raised in the representations from brokers with respect to the payment of fees to SEBI are clarified as under: Reckoning of first five years fees : It is clarified that the period of first five years as specified in the <mark>regulations shall be computed as under : Brokers who were already carrying on their activities in the financial year 1991-1992 would have to pay the fees for the financial year 1992-93 on the basis of their turnover for the previous financial year i.e. 1991-92. The brokers who have commenced their business from the financial year 1992-93 and onwards, would pay a flat fee of Rs.5,000/- for the first financial year if they have a nil turnover in the preceding financial year. For the next four years, brokers would pay fees based on their corresponding previous financial year’s turnover. Interpretation of `received' and 'receivable': In the definition of Annual Turnover as appearing in sub-clause (3) of Regulation 10 of Schedule III of SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992, the words 'received' and 'receivable' shall be interpreted as follows: It is clarified that the words "received" and "receivable" refer to the price of the securities traded and not the securities themselves. Therefore, the words, "receive" and "receivable" cannot be restricted to the securities actually delivered or to transactions which involve the actual delivery of securities. Thus, turnover shall be computed as aggregate of sale and purchase price of securities received and receivable by the stock broker either on his own account as well as on account of his clients in respect of sale and purchase or dealing in securities during any financial year in conformity with Regulation 10 of Schedule III of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992. Jobbing transactions: The word 'jobbing' shall be interpreted in accordance with Schedule III of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992 as amended on 20th February 2002. The SEBI circular no. SMD/DBA-II/Cir-31/98 dated November 5, 1998 issued in this regard for non-applicability of jobbing to order driven systems stands superceded. Interest on delayed payment of fees: Interest on delayed payment of fees shall be computed @ 15% p.a. as under : As the statutory amendment for payment of interest has come into force from December 16, 1998, the liability to pay interest would be for fee outstanding for the delay beyond December 16, 1998, at the specified rate of 15% p.a. As per Schedule III, a broker is liable to pay fees on or before October 1st based on the previous year turnover. For the fees payable for the financial year 1999-2000 and thereafter, the interest shall be payable @ 15% p.a. from October 2nd of the corresponding financial year. Payment of fees in cash segment / Registration in derivatives segment : The SEBI Board at its meeting held on December 28, 2001 had decided that all those brokers who did not pay fees should pay atleast 50% of the principal due in the cash market and give an undertaking to pay the balance fees within a period of 2 years along with interest. The brokers are required to give an undertaking in the format as given in the Annexure C of this circular. The Board further decided that any such member who abides by the above would be granted registration in the derivatives segment subject to the other conditions mentioned in the regulations. Fees payable by composite corporate members: It is clarified that Regulations require every broker who wants to receive a certificate of registration from SEBI to make payment of fees to SEBI. This is irrespective of the number of cards which are held by the broker on the stock exchange. In case the broker has more than one registration certificate from SEBI on any stock exchange then he will be required to pay fees as per the Regulations for each and every certificate that he holds. In case the broker holds only one registration certificate and more than one card on any exchange it is clarified that registration fees are payable on the registration certificate and not on the number of cards held by the broker. The brokers' turnover will be the aggregate turnover of all cards. Fees payable on Government securities and PSU bonds: Transactions in Government securities, bonds, units, etc. clearly form a part of the turnover and have to be included in the total turnover of the member and will have the benefit of concessional rate as mentioned in Regulation 10, Schedule III of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Rules and Regulations, 1992 as amended on 20th February 2002. Applicability of the notification on exemption from fees on corporatisation: Notification dated January 21, 1998 was issued and the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations were amended granting exemption from payment of fee on corporatisation of individual / partnership membership of the Exchange. It has been clarified vide notification dated February 20, 2002 that the amendment which was brought in on January 21, 1998 in respect of conversion of individual or partnership membership card of the exchange into corporate entity shall be deemed to be in continuation of the old entity subject to the condition mentioned in the above notification and no fee shall be collected again from the converted corporate entity for the period for which the erstwhile entity has paid the fees. The spirit behind notification dated January 21, 1998 was to give benefit of this amendment</mark> to stock brokers who have converted their individual / partnership membership into corporate on or after April 1, 1997. Accordingly such stock brokers shall be given the benefit of continuity subject to the satisfaction of conditions mentioned in the notification. Nomination by a member by an existing member / Transmission of Membership: Wherever a new registration is required - where it is by virtue of transmission or transfer or any other reason, fresh fees, will have to be paid by the new broking entity. Membership right acquired in auction purchase: Where a person 'purchases' the card of another defaulting member, then the said purchaser shall have to seek fresh registration with SEBI and he shall be liable to pay turnover fees like a new member of the stock exchange.</td>

SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue.

        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units.

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable.
