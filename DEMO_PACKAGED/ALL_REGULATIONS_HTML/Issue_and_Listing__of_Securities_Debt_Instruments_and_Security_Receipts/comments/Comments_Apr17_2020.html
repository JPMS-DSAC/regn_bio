        <td>                                                                                 SEBI Board MeetingThe SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions:1.  Instant Access Facility (IAF) in Mutual Funds and use of e-wallet for investment in Mutual FundsWith an objective to channelize households’ savings into capital market and to promote digitalization in mutual funds, SEBI Board after deliberation has decided the following:a) Mutual Funds / Asset Management Companies (AMCs) can offer instant access facility (through online mode) of upto INR 50,000 or 90% of folio value, whichever is lower, to resident individual investors in liquid schemes by applying lower of Previous Day NAV or Prospective NAV. For providing such facility AMCs would not be allowed to borrow. Liquidity is to be provided out of the available funds from the scheme and AMCs to put in place a mechanism to meet the liquidity demands. This facility can also be used for investment in mutual funds through tie-ups with Payments Banks provided necessary approvals are taken from RBI. Presently, any scheme providing this facility would reduce the limit to INR 50,000, immediately and other than liquid schemes providing this facility would completely stop this facility within one month from the date of circular.b) Investment of upto INR 50,000 per Mutual Fund per financial year can be made using e-wallets. However, redemptions of such investments can be made only to a bank account of the unit holder. E-wallet issuers must not offer any incentive such as cash back etc., directly or indirectly for investing in mutual fund scheme through them. E-wallet’s balance loaded through cash or debit card or net banking, can only be used for subscription to mutual funds schemes and balance loaded through credit card, cash back, promotional scheme etc. should not be allowed for subscription to MF schemes. Further, this limit of INR 50,000 would be an umbrella limit for investment by an investor through e-wallet and/or cash, per mutual fund per financial year.2. Amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012While presenting the Union Budget for the FY 2016-2017, the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister,  made an announcement for permitting new derivative products in the commodity derivatives market. In pursuance thereof, SEBI vide circular dated September 28, 2016, permitted launch of 'options' in commodity derivatives market. In this regard, to enable the Commodity Derivatives Exchanges to organize trading of ‘options', the Board, after undertaking due public consultation process, has approved a proposal to amend the relevant provisions of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012. Detailed guidelines for trading in 'option' on commodity derivatives exchanges will be issued by SEBI.3. Inclusion of RBI registered systemically important NBFCs in the category of QIBsPresently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI. They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for the FY 2017-18, proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs since it would strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for inclusion of systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI having a net worth of more than Rs. 500 crore in the category of QIBs. As NBFCs are well regulated entities, classifying such NBFCs under the definition of QIBs will give Issuers access to a larger pool of funds.4.

They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for the FY 2017-18, proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs since it would strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for inclusion of systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI having a net worth of more than Rs. 500 crore in the category of QIBs. As NBFCs are well regulated entities, classifying such NBFCs under the definition of QIBs will give Issuers access to a larger pool of funds.4.

To streamline the existing provisions in the DT Regulations with the provisions as  mentioned in the Companies Act 2013, Companies (Share Capital and Debentures)  Rules, 2014 and on account of amendment</mark><mark>SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations</mark>, 1992 (Stock Brokers Regulations), a stock broker / clearing member dealing in commodity derivatives cannot deal in other securities or vice versa, except by setting up of a separate entity. In this regard, the Board approved the proposal to remove this restriction by amending Stock Brokers Regulations and also to recommend to Government of India for amending SCR Rules accordingly.The integration of the stock brokers in equity and commodity derivative markets while having many synergies in terms of trading and settlement mechanism, risk management, redressal of investor grievances, etc. would benefit the investors, brokers, Stock Exchanges and SEBI as the same would help to:• enhance the economic efficiency in terms of meeting the operational as well as compliance obligations at a Member level resulting in ease of doing business • provide for efficient use of capital for the investors • widen the market penetration leading to greater financial inclusion for participants across all market segments.• facilitate effective regulatory oversight by Stock Exchanges and SEBI </td>
