On  1st  January  2008,  SEBI  came  out  with  a  consultative  paper  to  introduce “short swing profit” regulations by amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 and sought public comments on the same. In addition to the proposal of 1st January, public comment is being sought on several other proposed amendments to the regulations. 2.  Amendments were carried out in 2002 to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 (the regulations) to introduce a wide range of prophylactics and corporate governance norms. 3.  Over the course of the past few years since the amendment, there have been some new learnings in terms of the way the regulations have played out in the market.  The  key  amendments  brought  in  processes  which  would  reduce  the possibilities of insider trading by means of an institutionalized methodology e.g. pre-clearance of trades, black-out  windows  of  trading,  disclosure  of  buy/sell  by certain  insiders,  appointment  of  compliance  officer  and  a  catena  of  other provisions. 4.  There  have  been  several  instances  of  persons  of  high  integrity  committing unintended violations of these provisions. Thus, we need to be sensitive to the -1- Securities and Exchange Board of India fact that perhaps the norms have been set so high that even experts are unable to  keep  track  and  be  in  compliance  with  these  standards.  This  is  an  important issue as criminal jeopardy is attached to such corporate governance violations. In addition, there is a need to move towards a more principle based approach to regulations rather than a rule based approach, particularly in matters of corporate governance. 5.  In addition, some regulations are also proposed to be introduced. Background 6.  The  2002  amendments  to  the  Regulations  provide  extensive  suggestions  and regulations.  Most  of  the  good  governance  provisions  are  provided  for  as mandatory provisions. Briefly, the good governance regulations provide for: a) Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. b) Appointment of a compliance officer. c) Setting forth policies and procedure to restrict the possibility of abuse of insider trading. d) Monitoring and pre-clearance of trades by the designated persons. e) Restrict trading by such insiders within a certain period of time i.e. before corporate announcements, buybacks etc. are made. f) The company has to convey all the significant insider activity and corporate disclosure in a uniform publicly accessible means to the public – and to the stock exchange. g) Chinese walls within a firm to prevent one part of the firm which deals in sensitive information from going to other parts of the firm which have an inherent conflict of interest with such other parts. h) Minimum holding period of securities by insiders. i) No selective disclosure to analysts. Wide dissemination of information. -2- Securities and Exchange Board of India 7.  Provided  below  is  an  analysis  of  some  of  the  provisions  of  good  governance regulations and proposals for amendments. Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. 8.  There should be some coordination between the requirements of acquisition/sale of  shares  reported  in  these  regulations  with  the  requirements  of  the  takeover regulations. In fact the takeover reporting is broader since it mandates reporting by any person over certain thresholds and also requires reporting by a group – a concept  not  introduced  in  these  Regulations.  However,  the  insider  trading Regulations  provide  for  disclosure  of  smaller  amounts  and  provides  for disclosure  on  selling  shares  (something  which  the  takeover  code  does  not mandate). Proposal:  It  is  suggested  that  a  purchase  disclosure  made  under  either regulations (with the same or higher level of disclosure) should be deemed to be is  also  proposed good  disclosure  under the harmonization between the two in terms of threshold limits set. Regulatory Impact Assessment: As there is a proposal to harmonise the two regulation</mark>s, there is expected to be neither a substantial change in the burden on insiders nor will there be a dilution of the rights of investors. To the extent of deemed disclosure, there will be a reduction in cost without any reduction in benefit to investors.</td>

        <td>Exemptions have been made precise, streamlined and provided with clear conditions on the basis of the specific charging provision from which exemptions would be available. Some of the areas where clarity has been brought in include schemes of arrangement, certain inter se transfers, corporate debt restructuring and rights issues. While SEBI would continue to have the power to grant exemption from making an <mark>open offer</mark><mark>acquisition</mark><mark>acquisition</mark><mark>acquisition</mark><mark>open offer</mark><mark>regulations provide for exchange offers, the same has not been used for want of clarity on whether such issuance would attract provisions of preferential allotment and public issue requirements. The Committee has recommended that SEBI may consider making suitable amendments to ICDR/ other regulations as applicable. Competing offers The Committee has recommended certain changes such as increasing the period for making a competing bid, prohibiting acquirers from being represented in the board of target company, and permitting any competing acquirer to negotiate and acquire the shares tendered to the other competing acquirer, at the same price that was offered by him to the public. Execution of the agreement that triggers open offer The Committee has recommended that the execution of the agreement that triggered the open offer obligation may be completed during the pendency of the open offer provided 100% of the consideration payable under the open offer is deposited in escrow. Currently, an agreement which triggers an open offer can be consummated only after completion of the offer formalities. The Committee has further recommended that execution of such agreement would have to be completed within 26 weeks after the offer period. Currently the regulations are silent on this aspect. Governance Issues The current Regulations restrict the target company from undertaking certain transactions during the offer period. The Committee thought it fit to bring in materiality concept as also to enhance the scope of such restrictions to include transactions by subsidiaries since potentially material transactions can be undertaken at the level of any subsidiary of the target company without approval of shareholders of the target company. The Committee has also decided to mandate recommendation on the open offer, by a committee of independent directors of the target company. This is currently optional. Activities and Timelines in open offer process Timelines of various activities in the open offer process have been rationalized to compress the open offer period. The Committee has also recommended that a short public announcement should be made by the acquirer on the date of entering in to an agreement followed by a detailed public statement within five business days thereafter. The Committee was constituted by SEBI in September 2009 to examine and review the Takeover Regulations of 1997 and suggest suitable amendment</mark>s as deemed fit. The committee comprises the following members: 1.                  Shri C. Achuthan, Former Presiding Officer, Securities Appellate Tribunal – Chairman. 2.                  Shri Kumar Desai, Advocate, High Court, Mumbai 3.                  Shri Somasekhar Sundaresan, Advocate; Partner, J.

        <td>Considering the important role played by Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) in fulfilling the social objective of increased home ownership and supporting the economy by creating demand for construction of new homes, it has been decided that an additional exposure to financial services sector (over and above the existing 30%) not exceeding 10% of the net assets of the scheme in debt oriented mutual fund schemes will be allowed by way of increase in exposure to HFCs only, subject to the condition that such securities issued by HFCs are rated AA and above and these HFCs are registered with National Housing Bank (NHB). However, the total investment in HFCs cannot exceed 30% of the net assets of the scheme. II.          Review of the Debt Limit Allocation Mechanism for FIIs Regarding the review of the debt limit allocation mechanism for FIIs, the Board took note of the following: (i)    With effect from January 01, 2014, the FIIs shall be allowed to re-invest during the calendar year to the extent of 50% of their debt holdings at the end of the previous calendar year. (ii)  The utilization period for Government Debt and Corporate Debt limits will be reduced to 30 days and 60 days respectively. (iii)  In the FII Debt limit, the unutilised limit in respect of Corporate Debt infra long term bonds category may be availed by the FIIs/Sub Accounts without obtaining prior SEBI approval till the overall FII investments reaches 90% of the limit, after which the auction mechanism shall be initiated for allocation of remaining limits. III.          Suggestions to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for Foreign Portfolio   Investments such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. With a view to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for foreign portfolio investments, SEBI will prepare a draft guideline based on the guidance of the Working Group on Foreign Investment in India (WGFII), for consideration of the Government so that uniform guidelines are made for various categories of investors such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. IV.          Expansion of asset classes which can be held in demat form (i)  There have been demands for dematerialization of assets/records other than securities, such as, Warehouse receipts, Fixed Deposits with banks and corporates, Insurance Policies, Investment products of Post Office, etc. (ii) Under Regulation 7(c) of <mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>shareholders</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations</mark>, 1996 (D&P Regulations) lay down various obligations on the part of Issuers or their agents such as entering into agreement with the Depositories, carrying out reconciliation of share capital, carrying out timely dematerialization of shares, maintaining proper records etc. It has been seen in the past that there are instances of non compliance such as lack of reconciliation of issued or listed capital and actual share capital by the Issuer company and its appointed RTA.
