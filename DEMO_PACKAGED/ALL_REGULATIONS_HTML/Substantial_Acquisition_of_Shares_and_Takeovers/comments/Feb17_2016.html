(ix)       Necessity to execute a  shortened version of Listing Agreement  within six months of notification of these regulations. (4)       In addition to the above, a number of changes which are in the nature of either providing clarity or maintaining consistency or removal of redundancies have been carried out in the Listing Regulations.  Such changes include removal of dichotomy regarding utilization of issue proceeds, manner of dealing with unclaimed shares, aligning connected provisions pertaining to disclosures on website and issuing advertisements,  disclosures  in Annual Report, documents and information to be provided to holders of securities, terms and structure of securities, and operational modalities in manner of review of audit reports with modified opinion, etc. (5)       There were certain provisions in the listing agreements related to issuance of securities and not in the nature of continuous obligations, such as, 1% security deposit, allotment, refund, payment of interest on account of delay in allotment / non-allotment, etc. They have been now incorporated in respective regulations, viz., ICDR Regulations, ILDS Regulations, etc. Similarly, requirements which are in the nature of continuous disclosure and obligations have been shifted and now incorporated in the Listing Regulations.

Such permission would be considered on a case to case basis, depending on such AMCs demonstrating that serious efforts are being made by them to meet the networth requirements within the prescribed timelines. (V)  Risk based supervision of market intermediaries The Board took note of the recommendations viz. simple, formalized and risk based supervision approach for the market intermediaries as suggested by M/s. Oliver Wyman, the Consultant appointed by SEBI to study and make recommendations, inter-alia with the objective of designing best practice regulatory approach, and the report of the internal taskforce of SEBI formed to implement the  recommendations. Based on above, SEBI is in the process of formalizing its risk based approach towards supervision of market intermediaries which will be in alignment with the global best practices. The system will be implemented in a phased manner. (VI)  Granting Single Registration to Depository Participants With a view to further simplify the registration requirements for Depository Participants (DPs), the Board has approved the policy of granting single registration for the application of initial registration as well as the permanent registration for operating with both the Depositories. Currently, the Depository participants are required to obtain separate registration for both the depositories. Further the applicants are granted initial registration for five years and then permanent registrations. As per the new policy SEBI would process the registration application only for the first time initial or permanent registration, as the case may be,  through one depository and subsequent permissions to act as a DP of other depository, shall be granted by the concerned Depository after complying with the prescribed requirements. Thus, there will be a single SEBI registration for DP to operate in both the Depositories in India.</td>

        <td>2. Simplified Framework for Capital Raising by technological start ups and other companies on Institutional Trading Platform. The Board undertook a review of the extant regulatory framework in the primary market and noted the suggestions of market participants on making the existing avenues for capital raising amenable for accommodating a larger number of start-up companies. Based on the same, the Board approved the following proposals to amend the regulations concerning the ITP Platform: The      platform shall now be called as Institutional Trading Platform (ITP) and      shall facilitate capital raising as well. The said platform will be made accessible to: companies which are intensive in their use of technology, information technology, intellectual property, data analytics, bio-technology, nano-technology to provide products, services or business platforms with substantial value addition and with at least 25% of the pre-issue capital being held by QIBs (as defined in <mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>shareholders</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012 to invest      a certain minimum amount in unlisted securities, investment in shares of      companies listed on this platform may be treated as investment in      'unlisted securities' for the purpose of calculation of the investment      limits. Grandfathering of existing companies listed on SME-ITP: xiv. The existing companies listed on SME-ITP may      continue to be guided by the existing regulatory framework for them      including applicable relaxations from compliance with corporate governance      requirements. Rationalisation of disclosures for proposed ITP as well as main board: xv. Further, in order to      rationalize the disclosures requirements for all issuers whether intending      to list on the main board or the proposed ITP, it has been decided that      the disclosures in offer document with respect to group companies,      litigations and creditors shall be in accordance with policy on      materiality as defined by the issuer. However, all relevant disclosures      shall be available on the website of the issuer. Also, the product advertisements of an issuer      will not be required to give details of public/rights issue. 3. Fast Track Issuances - Follow on Public Offerings and Rights Issues In order to enable more number of listed companies to raise further capital using fast-track route, Board approved the proposal to reduce the minimum public holding requirement from Rs. 3000 crore to Rs. 1000 crore in case of FPO and to Rs. 250 crore in case of rights issue, subject to compliance with following additional conditions: In case of rights issue, promoters shall not renounce their rights, except to the extent of renunciations within the promoter group, or for the purposes of complying with minimum public shareholding norms; Annualized delivery based trading turnover requirement of 10% of the total paid up capital; No conflict of interest between the lead manager and the issuer or its group or associate company in accordance with applicable SEBI Regulations; Shares of the company should not have been suspended from trading as a disciplinary measure in past 3 years; &Issuer, promoter group and directors of the issuer should not have settled any alleged violation of securities laws through the consent mechanism with the Board in last 3 years. This is in addition to the existing condition that no show-cause notices should have been issued or prosecution proceedings initiated by SEBI or pending against the issuer or its promoters or whole time directors.</td>
