        <td>  The caption apparently suggests that SEBI cannot decide takeover price and that the regulator has no role to play in the valuation of shares under takeover scheme. However, the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, dated              May 16, 2007 in the matter of H.L. Somany and others v/s. SEBI makes no such mention. On the contrary, as has been rightly mentioned in the text of the above mentioned news item, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed that the Board has to be satisfied that the offer made is reasonable and fair, and in the interest of the <mark>shareholders</mark> and that the Board as the regulator is not bound to accept the offer price which is required to be incorporated in the public offer, if it suspects that the offer price does not truly represent the fair value of the shares determined in accordance with Regulation 20 (5).  </td>
