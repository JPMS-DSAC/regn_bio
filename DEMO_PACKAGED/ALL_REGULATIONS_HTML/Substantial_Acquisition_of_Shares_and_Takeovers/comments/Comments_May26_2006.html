        <td> Press note 1. Under the existing rule 8 of the Securities contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957, a company formed in compliance with the provisions of Section 322 of the Companies Act 1956 is eligible to become a member of a Stock Exchange. The rule also requires that a majority of the directors of such a company are its <mark>shareholders</mark> and also members of a Stock Exchange and that the directors of the company, who are members of a Stock Exchange, have unlimited liability in the company. Experience has shown that the existing rule is not conducive to the growth of corporate membership in Stock Exchanges. Accordingly, Government have issued a Notification on 2nd June, 1992 containing draft of certain rules further to amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation)Rules 1957. 2. After considering the objections or suggestions on the draft rules received from the public and Stock Exchanges in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Government have issued a Notification in the gazette of India on 13th November, 1992 amending Rule 8 of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules 1957 in order to provide at a company formed in compliance with the provisions of Section 12 of the Companies Act 1956 will also be eligible to become a member of a Stock Exchange subject to certain conditions. Some of the important conditions are as follows :-   i. such a company undertakes to comply with such financial requirements and norms as may be specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for the registration of such company under sub-section (1) of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Act, 1992;</td>

The following decisions / steps have been taken in this regard:  Reporting of transactions by Foreign Institutional Investors : With a view to monitoring the trends of investment by FIIs, SEBI had asked the FIIs to submit the details of transactions made by them on daily basis as specified in regulation 16 (2) (b) of the Regulations. Initially the FII transaction reporting was done in dBase. Subsequently a comprehensive program was developed in Oracle for this purpose. The operational guidelines for the Oracle program have already been communicated vide Circular No. FITTC/CUST/3/1998 dated November 20, 1998. The operational guidelines / procedures have been reviewed and modified to include reporting of transaction related to buyback, <mark>open offer</mark>s, write-off of securities etc. The revised version (Version 2.0) of the operational guidelines is enclosed for information and compliance.</td>

        <td>Straight Through Processing (STP) is generally understood to be a mechanism that automates the end to end processing of transactions of financial instruments. It involves use of a system to process or control all elements of the work flow of a financial transaction, what are commonly known as the Front, Middle, Back office and General Ledger. In other words, STP allows electronic capturing and processing of transactions in one pass from the point of order origination to final settlement. STP thus streamlines the process of trade execution and settlement and avoids manual entry and re-entry of the details of the same trade by different market intermediaries and participants. Usage of STP enables orders to be processed, confirmed, settled in a shorter time period and in a more cost effective manner with fewer errors. Apart from compressing the clearing and settlement time, STP also provides a flexible, cost effective infrastructure, which enables e-business expansion through online processing and access to enterprise data. SEBI vide letter dated October 3, 2002 informed the stock exchanges, depositories and custodians that it proposed to introduce STP for electronic trade processing with a common messaging standard ISO 15022 w.e.f December 2, 2002. Accordingly, STP was launched in India on November 30, 2002. Currently, STP is being used by the market participants on a <mark>voluntary</mark> basis. To facilitate STP, SEBI has also issued circulars SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-15/00 dated December 15, 2000 & circular SEBI/SMD/SE/15/2003/29/04 dated April 29, 2003 which permitted the issue of electronic contract notes with digital signature obtained from a valid Certifying Authority provided under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and circular no. DNPD/Cir-9/04 dated February 3, 2004 & circular no. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-11/2004 dated February 25, 2004 directing exchanges to amend their bye-laws, rules and regulations for the equity and the debt segment to streamline the issuance of electronic contract notes as a legal document like the physical contract note. Exchanges are in the process of amending their bye-laws, rules and regulations. </td>

However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.
