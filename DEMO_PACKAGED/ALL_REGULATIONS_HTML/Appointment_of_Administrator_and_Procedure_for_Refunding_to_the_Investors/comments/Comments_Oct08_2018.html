Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

(b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

Registrars shall receive applications for subscription to shares, debentures etc. accompanied by stockinvest alongwith separate schedules from the controlling branches of bankers to the issues, authorised collection agents wherever provided and directly from investors residing in places other than 30 mandatory centres. 2. Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

SEBI has been receiving complaints that issues are listed on stock exchanges and trading is allowed before a company has completed despatch of all share certificates. This results in a shortage of available scrips for trading and can be a tool in the hands of manipulators. The exchanges are hereby requested to ensure that no listing or trading permission is granted unless an unambiguous certificate is obtained from the company concerned that all share certificates have been despatched. Clause 42 of the listing agreement allows the Stock Exchanges to seek 1% deposit of the amount of securities offered for subscription by the company. Regulations 2.3A(iii) of the Stock Exchange Regulations prescribes that the aforesaid amount can be forfeited if the company has not complied with the requirements and conditions of listings as laid down by the stock exchange.

The Committee constituted by SEBI for examining the existing Articles and Memorandum of Association, Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of Stock Exchanges and framing a uniform set of Rules and Bye-laws to be followed by all the stock exchanges of the country has submitted its report and the Model Rules for Stock Exchanges.  Some of the Model Rules have already been implemented by the Stock Exchanges through SEBI Circulars and directives. For some rules suitable provisions already exist in SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 1957 or in the GOI directives/Circulars and <mark>SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment to the existing SEBI Act, 1992, SC (R) Act, 1956, SC (R) Rules, 1957 and other relevant Rules, Regulations and laws etc. In order to bring about uniformity among stock exchanges and taking into account uniformity already brought about by SEBI through the directives/circulars so far issued to the stock exchanges, you are advised to implement the Rules under Part 'B'. In the case of Rules in Part 'A', the proposed rules may be adopted in case there is a material difference between these rules and the existing similar rules of the exchange. The Model Rules along with the Committee Report are enclosed for adoption after necessary approvals from the General Body/Governing Board of the Exchanges. However if there are any difficulties in implementation of these Rules, such difficulties may be brought to the notice of SEBI. A compliance report in this regard may be submitted to SEBI within 2 months. The Exchanges will be suitably advised for introduction of Rules under Part 'C' and 'D' Yours faithfully,     S.V.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.
