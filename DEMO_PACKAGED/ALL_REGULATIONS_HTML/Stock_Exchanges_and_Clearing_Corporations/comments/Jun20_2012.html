A statutory directive dated April 19, 1993 issued by the Board is enclosed for necessary action at an early date and in any case not later than six months from the date of the order. While making the proposed <mark>amendments please ensure to make consequential amendments to the Rules/Articles of Association. The draft of the proposed amendments may be sent to us for approval. Please acknowledge receipt. Yours faithfully, sd/- C. B. BHAVE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA Order under Section 8 of the SCRA Act WHEREAS: 1. With a view to protect the interest of investors and to promote development of and to regulate the securities market and in particular the stock exchanges in terms of Section 11 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and further pursuant to sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the powers delegated by the Central Government under its notification no. SO/573(E) dated July 3, 1992 issued under 29 A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as " the Board") had through its communication dated August 19, 1992 consulted the stock exchanges on certain specific issues relating to the reconstitution of the governing bodies of the stock exchanges (hereinafter referred to as "governing bodies"), the appointment of Executive Directors including the constitution of disciplinary, arbitration and default committees of the stock exchanges; AND 2. After taking into account, the views expressed by several stock exchanges, the Board by its communication dated November 20, 1992 advised all the stock exchanges to take steps to amend their Rules or Articles of Association; AND 3. In response to the said communication dated November 20, 1992, while several stock exchanges have expressed their willingness to carry out the amendments to their respective Rules and Articles of Association, others have either suggested modifications or opposed or shown reluctance to carry out such amendments; AND 4. By a further communication dated January 1, 1993 the Board had proposed specific terms of office for President and Vice-President of the Stock Exchanges, AND 5. The Board has since considered various proposals in the light of further suggestions received from the stock exchanges pursuant to above mentioned communications and it is of the opinion that in interest of the investors and the capital market as also in the public interest , it is necessary and expedient to amend the Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, of the stock exchanges in the manner indicated in this Order for the following reasons namely : (i) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to effectively and promptly implement the directives issued by the Central Government; (ii) Some governing bodies have shown reluctance or indifference or have failed to take adequate steps for the appointment of Executive Director; (iii) The disciplinary, arbitration and default committees as constituted at present have failed to take quick, effective or timely action against erring brokers; (iv) The governing bodies as constituted at present have failed to enforce the Articles of Association, Rules, Regulations and Bye-laws of the stock exchanges; (v) It is a matter of common knowledge that when some members get elected on the governing board including as President or Vice-President or as members for several years they get into a position whereby they can exert excessive influence in the affairs of the stock exchange which is not desirable in the public interest; (vi) There is a need to broad base the membership of the governing bodies, and make them fully representative of various interests in the securities market in order to ensure that the affairs of the stock exchanges are conducted on healthy lines with the highest standards of professional conduct, business ethics and morality to inspire and sustain the confidence of the investing public. NOW THEREFORE in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, read with the powers delegated to the Board by the Central Government under section 29A of the said Act, the Board hereby directs all the recognised stock exchanges, more particularly mentioned in the Schedule hereunder written, to take steps, immediately but in any case not later than six months from the date of this Order, for amendment of their respective Rules or Articles of Association, as the case may be, be provide for the following matters :- 1.

        <td>The Group felt that if three stock exchanges in different regulatory regimes could be merged may be such a merger could be explored even in India by some of the stock exchanges. The Inter Connected Stock Exchange of India (ICSEI) had attempted such an exercise but could not succeed mainly because the order book remained split between the stock exchanges which are the 14 constituent stock exchanges of ICSEI and the order book of ICSEI. The splitting of the order book fragmented the market. Also, the clearing for the same security took place in multiple stock exchanges, which added to the cost. The Group therefore felt that some of the stock exchanges could undertake a more meaningful exercise following the example of a single order book and setting up of single <mark>clearing corporation</mark> at the national level or using the services of either Clearing Corporation / Clearing House of BSE and NSE. This exercise could serve another important economic purpose as the markets grow, as it is possible that the two large stock exchanges may raise the minimum capital requirement for an issue to be listed on these stock exchanges. Further in a competitive environment, there is a possibility of abolishing of concept of multiple listing and leaving the choice of listing in more than one stock exchange to the issuer. This would not leave any avenue for raising capital for a medium size company, which may have smaller issues. A stock exchange modeled on the Euronext could play an important economic role for the listing and trading of such issues. 9.43 The Group therefore was of the view that some of the stock exchanges could explore the possibility of merger on the lines of Euronext. The Group does not recommend any specific route as being mandatory as the choice should be dictated on commercial considerations. The Group however feels that it would be in national interest that the infrastructure available with the stock exchanges be put to best economic use. In case the stock exchanges adopt the Euronext model, SEBI will have to work out the eligibility criteria for the brokers, model rules and bye-laws for such an stock exchange, the risk containment measures, and the listing guidelines.    9.44 In sum, the Group is of the view that – a uniform model for corporatisation and demutualisation would have to be adopted by all the stock exchanges. This model should not be made applicable selectively only for a few stock exchanges; if the recommendations are adopted and suitable legislative changes carried out to implement the recommendations, the stock exchanges will be required to submit a scheme of demutualisation to SEBI by an appointed date, and non-compliance in this regard would result in lapse of recognition granted to an existing stock exchange, whether permanent or temporary; merger of stock exchanges, before or after demutualisation is a commercial decision and the choice should be left to the concerned stock exchanges and it is not within the purview of the Group to recommend a specific course of action. However, the Group strongly feels that corporatisation and demutualisation will facilitate the process of consolidation of stock exchanges; and while the Group does not wish to recommend measures which may provide an exit route to the members of the stock exchanges, any stock exchange which fails to comply with the requirement of corporatisation and demutualisation by the appointed date and is accordingly derecognised, will have to distribute its assets in accordance with the provisions of the respective articles/ rules of the stock exchange and the relevant tax laws shall become applicable. Legal changes required 9.45 The Group felt that some of the provisions in the various relevant statutes would have to be amended to implement the recommendations. Without these amendments it would be difficult to enforce the recommendations. The Group noted that the stock exchanges and the representatives of brokers have also suggested similar changes. The Group also noted that in several countries such as Australia and Singapore, a separate Act was passed to give effect to demutualisation. Among the statutes which require changes here are the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956, the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899. The Group therefore recommends that - the relevant provisions of the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956, the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899 be suitably amended to facilitate corporatisation and demutualisation of the stock exchanges and to grant fiscal exemptions to encourage this process. Acknowledgement The Group records its appreciation of the assistance received during its deliberations from the representatives of the various stock exchanges, broker associations, investor associations and the concerned officials of SEBI.    M.

        <td>2.0  Registration  and  Regulation  of  Asset  Management Company,  Research  Analyst,  Clearing  Corporation,  STP Provider etc. The  Group  noted  that  at  present  certain  important  market intermediaries  such  as  Asset  Management  Company,  Research Analyst,  Clearing  Corporation,  clearing  bank,  stock  lender,  STP Service Provider are not expressly included in Section 12 of SEBI Act  although  they  operate  in  the  market  as intermediaries. The Group further noted that although such entities may be covered in the expression “persons associated with the securities market” so as to bring them in the ambit of sections 11 (2) (i), 11 (4), 11B, 11C, 11D etc. they are not expressely covered for the purpose of registration and <mark>regulation under section 12.  Therefore, the Group felt that such other intermediaries may also be included in section 12. It  was  noted  by  the  Group  that  by  amendment  to  Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956  the stock exchanges are enabled to  transfer  the  activities  of  the  clearing  house  to  a  clearing corporation which is required to seek recognition from SEBI and make its rules, bye laws, etc. with prior approval of SEBI.  SEBI may  also  supersede  the  governing  Board  of  such  clearing corporation.  All incidences of regulating the activities of a clearing corporation  have  now  been  provided  in  the  Securities  Contracts (Regulations)  Act,  1956.

The Group further noted that although such entities may be covered in the expression “persons associated with the securities market” so as to bring them in the ambit of sections 11 (2) (i), 11 (4), 11B, 11C, 11D etc. they are not expressely covered for the purpose of registration and <mark>regulation under section 12.  Therefore, the Group felt that such other intermediaries may also be included in section 12. It  was  noted  by  the  Group  that  by  amendment  to  Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956  the stock exchanges are enabled to  transfer  the  activities  of  the  clearing  house  to  a  clearing corporation which is required to seek recognition from SEBI and make its rules, bye laws, etc. with prior approval of SEBI.  SEBI may  also  supersede  the  governing  Board  of  such  clearing corporation.  All incidences of regulating the activities of a clearing corporation  have  now  been  provided  in  the  Securities  Contracts (Regulations)  Act,  1956.

        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a <mark>recognised stock exchange</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in.
