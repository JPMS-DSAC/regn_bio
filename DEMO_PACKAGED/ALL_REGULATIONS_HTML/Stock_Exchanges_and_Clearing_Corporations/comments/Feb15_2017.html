        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience. They shall also be required to have net tangible assets of atleast Rs. 2 crore. Corporate angel investors shall be required to have Rs. 10 crore net worth or be a registered AIF/VCF. iii.   Angel Funds shall have a corpus of atleast Rs.10 crore (as against Rs. 20 crore for other AIFs) and minimum investment by an investor shall be Rs. 25 lakh (may be accepted over a period of maximum 3 years) as against Rs. 1 crore for other AIFs. Further, the continuing interest by sponsor/manager in the Angel Fund shall be not less than 2.5% of the corpus or Rs. 50 lakh, whichever is lesser. iv.  For ensuring investments are genuine angel investments, angel funds shall invest only in investee companies which: a. are incorporated in India and are not more than 3 years old; and b. have a turnover not exceeding Rs.25 crore; and c.  are unlisted, and d.  are not promoted, sponsored or related to an Industrial Group whose group turnover is in excess of Rs.300 crore, and e. has no family connection with the investors proposing to invest in the company. v.  Further, investment in an investee company by an angel fund shall be not less than Rs.50 lakh and not more than Rs.5 crore and shall be required to be held for a period of at least 3 years.</td>

As such, it was subjected to regulation and supervision using the PFMIs framework thus necessitating its adherence to PFMI requirements. The “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure” (PFMIs) were issued by the CPSS and IOSCO in April 2012. These were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, settlement, and recording arrangements, and more broadly, to limit systemic risk and foster transparency and financial stability. The members of CPSS and IOSCO are required to strive to adopt the PFMIs in their respective jurisdictions in line with the G20 expectations.

        <td>Creating a core fund (called Core Settlement Guarantee Fund), within the SGF, against which no exposure is given and which is readily and unconditionally available to meet settlement obligations of <mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark><mark>clearing corporation</mark>s with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). The new stress testing norms will also capture the risk posed due to possible default in institutional trades. The stress test, which will be conducted every day, will determine the Minimum Required Corpus (MRC) of Core SGF. This will be a dynamic process which will form the basis for replenishing the Core SGF every month. PFMIs require CCs to maintain sufficient resources to cover losses due to major defaults in the market so as to avoid any systemic risk. While margins of defaulting member/s form primary layer of defence for CC against default of a member, a next layer of defence by way of a dedicated pool of resources is generally maintained by CCs to effect settlement guarantee. The current practice followed by CCs in India for quantifying such resources is to also include margins of all members. As margins are against positions, there are difficulties felt in estimating the correct value of resources readily available to meet settlement shortages in case of default by member/s. The new guidelines will remove these difficulties by creating the Core SGF as a second layer of defence, against which no exposure is allowed and thus will always be available in sufficiently liquid form.  Availability of such a liquid fund will make the whole risk management system much safer as the CCs will have better capability to deal with extreme stress situations where the defaulters' funds are not sufficient to meet their obligations. The new system will substantially reduce the possibility of such stresses leading to systemic risk. Broadly the contribution to Core SGF will be from the following sources: At least 50% of MRC from CC At least 25% of MRC from Stock Exchange (SE) Upto 25% of MRC from clearing members (CMs) Penalties levied by CC will also be credited to Core SGF. As per the present default waterfall of CCs, residual losses after exhausting resources available in other layers of the waterfall are to be allocated to the non-defaulting clearing members. Thus, effectively under such circumstances there is no limit to the liability of non-defaulting members in the event of extreme loss. As per Basel capital adequacy requirements, many members are required to make capital provisions towards counterparty exposure including towards CCPs which becomes difficult to quantify in case of an unlimited liability. The circular has provisions regarding manner for limiting the liability of non-defaulting members. The new guidelines will also harmonise default waterfall across CCs and will adequately ring-fence each segment of CC from defaults in other segments. The default waterfall in case of default in any segment will generally follow the following order - 1- Monies of defaulting member 2- Insurance, if any 3- CC resources (equal to 5% of MRC) 4- Core SGF 5- CC resources 6- CC/Stock Exchange contribution to Core SGFs of other segments 7- Capped contribution of non defaulting members 8- Pro-rata haircut to pay-outs (for details refer to circular) Norms for contribution to Core SGF as well as default waterfall have been specified with a view that all the stakeholders (CC, SE and CMs) are incentivised to adequately monitor the risks brought into the system. Based on deliberations in the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI and further discussions with CCs, SEs and market participants, it has been decided to issue these norms related to core settlement guarantee fund, stress testing and default procedures specified in the present Circular which would bring greater clarity and uniformity as well as align the same with international best practices.

        <td>Nov 19, 2014 PR No.: 130/2014 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions: (I)  SEBI  (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2014 (1)       Two decades had passed since the <mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations</mark><mark>amendments to the regulations and judicial paradigm through case laws had also evolved in India. To ensure that the regulatory framework dealing with insider trading in India is further strengthened, SEBI sought review of the extant Insider Trading regulatory regime and constituted a committee under Chairmanship of Hon’ble Justice N. K. Sodhi. (2)       Board in its meeting deliberated on the Justice Sodhi Committee Report and public comments received thereon. The Board has approved a new regulation in place of the existing regulations. (3)       The new regulations strengthen the legal and enforcement framework, align Indian regime with international practices, provide clarity with respect to the definitions and concepts, and facilitate legitimate business transactions. The salient features of the regulations are as under:- (A) STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK (i) The definition of Insider has been made wider by including persons connected on the basis of being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship that allows such person access to unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). However directors, employees and all other persons in the deeming category covered under 1992 regulations would continue to be covered. Insider will also include a person who is in possession or has access to UPSI. Now, immediate relatives will be presumed to be connected persons, with a right to rebut the presumption. In 1992 regulations, definition of connected person was largely position based. (ii) In the case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possession of UPSI, shall be on such connected persons. (iii)  Clear prohibition on communication of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) has been provided except legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. (iv)  Considering every investor's interest in securities market, advance disclosure of UPSI at least 2 days prior to trading has been made mandatory in case of permitted communication of UPSI. (v)  UPSI has been defined as information not generally available and which may impact the price. The definition of UPSI has been strengthened by providing a test to identify price sensitive information, aligning it with listing agreement and providing platform of disclosure. Earlier, the definition of price sensitive information had reference to company only; now it has reference to both a company and securities. (vi)  Generally Available Information will be the information that is accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory platform which would ordinarily be stock exchange platform. (vii) Companies by law would be entitled to require third-party connected persons to disclose their trading and holdings in securities of the company. (viii) In line with Companies Act, 2013, prohibition on derivative trading by directors and KMPs on securities of the company has been provided. (B) ALIGNING INSIDER TRADING NORMS WITH INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES (i) The requirement of communication of UPSI in the case of legitimate business transaction has been recognized in law and a carve-out with safeguards has been provided. [Reference to A (iii) and (iv) above] (ii) Disclosure of UPSI in public domain has been made mandatory before trading, so as to rule out asymmetry of information in the market, as prevalent in other jurisdictions. [Reference to A (iv) above] (iii) A provision of Trading Plans on the lines of U.S. has been introduced for insiders with necessary safeguards. Such a plan has to be for bona fide transactions and has to be disclosed on stock exchange platform in advance. (C) CLARITY IN THE DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS (i) With important provisions, clarificatory notes have been inserted in the regulation</mark><mark>as stock exchange</mark>. [Reference to A (vi) above] (iv) Clarity about timing of disclosure of UPSI has been provided and the trading window norms have been made uniform to other connected persons. (D) FACILITATING LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS (i) To facilitate legitimate business transactions, unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) can be communicated with safeguards. [reference to A (iii) & (iv) above] (ii) Insiders who are liable to possess UPSI all round the year would have the option to formulate pre-scheduled trading plans. Trading plans would, however, to be disclosed on the stock exchanges and have to be strictly adhered to. Trading plans shall be available for bona fide transactions. (iii) Principle based Code of Fair Disclosure and Code of Conduct has been prescribed. (iv) In given cases, certain circumstances which can be demonstrated by an insider to prove his innocence have been provided. (v) Repeated disclosures have been removed so as to ease compliance burden and to align with Takeover Code. Disclosure of any change of 2% for persons holding more than 5% shares or voting rights has been removed as they are prescribed under Takeover Code.</td>

        <td>Nov 19, 2014 PR No.: 130/2014 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions: (I)  SEBI  (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2014 (1)       Two decades had passed since the <mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations</mark><mark>amendments to the regulations and judicial paradigm through case laws had also evolved in India. To ensure that the regulatory framework dealing with insider trading in India is further strengthened, SEBI sought review of the extant Insider Trading regulatory regime and constituted a committee under Chairmanship of Hon’ble Justice N. K. Sodhi. (2)       Board in its meeting deliberated on the Justice Sodhi Committee Report and public comments received thereon. The Board has approved a new regulation in place of the existing regulations. (3)       The new regulations strengthen the legal and enforcement framework, align Indian regime with international practices, provide clarity with respect to the definitions and concepts, and facilitate legitimate business transactions. The salient features of the regulations are as under:- (A) STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK (i) The definition of Insider has been made wider by including persons connected on the basis of being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship that allows such person access to unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). However directors, employees and all other persons in the deeming category covered under 1992 regulations would continue to be covered. Insider will also include a person who is in possession or has access to UPSI. Now, immediate relatives will be presumed to be connected persons, with a right to rebut the presumption. In 1992 regulations, definition of connected person was largely position based. (ii) In the case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possession of UPSI, shall be on such connected persons. (iii)  Clear prohibition on communication of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) has been provided except legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. (iv)  Considering every investor's interest in securities market, advance disclosure of UPSI at least 2 days prior to trading has been made mandatory in case of permitted communication of UPSI. (v)  UPSI has been defined as information not generally available and which may impact the price. The definition of UPSI has been strengthened by providing a test to identify price sensitive information, aligning it with listing agreement and providing platform of disclosure. Earlier, the definition of price sensitive information had reference to company only; now it has reference to both a company and securities. (vi)  Generally Available Information will be the information that is accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory platform which would ordinarily be stock exchange platform. (vii) Companies by law would be entitled to require third-party connected persons to disclose their trading and holdings in securities of the company. (viii) In line with Companies Act, 2013, prohibition on derivative trading by directors and KMPs on securities of the company has been provided. (B) ALIGNING INSIDER TRADING NORMS WITH INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES (i) The requirement of communication of UPSI in the case of legitimate business transaction has been recognized in law and a carve-out with safeguards has been provided. [Reference to A (iii) and (iv) above] (ii) Disclosure of UPSI in public domain has been made mandatory before trading, so as to rule out asymmetry of information in the market, as prevalent in other jurisdictions. [Reference to A (iv) above] (iii) A provision of Trading Plans on the lines of U.S. has been introduced for insiders with necessary safeguards. Such a plan has to be for bona fide transactions and has to be disclosed on stock exchange platform in advance. (C) CLARITY IN THE DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS (i) With important provisions, clarificatory notes have been inserted in the regulation</mark><mark>as stock exchange</mark>. [Reference to A (vi) above] (iv) Clarity about timing of disclosure of UPSI has been provided and the trading window norms have been made uniform to other connected persons. (D) FACILITATING LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS (i) To facilitate legitimate business transactions, unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) can be communicated with safeguards. [reference to A (iii) & (iv) above] (ii) Insiders who are liable to possess UPSI all round the year would have the option to formulate pre-scheduled trading plans. Trading plans would, however, to be disclosed on the stock exchanges and have to be strictly adhered to. Trading plans shall be available for bona fide transactions. (iii) Principle based Code of Fair Disclosure and Code of Conduct has been prescribed. (iv) In given cases, certain circumstances which can be demonstrated by an insider to prove his innocence have been provided. (v) Repeated disclosures have been removed so as to ease compliance burden and to align with Takeover Code. Disclosure of any change of 2% for persons holding more than 5% shares or voting rights has been removed as they are prescribed under Takeover Code.</td>

        <td>Sep 01, 2015 PR No.: 225/2015 The Report of the Committee on Clearing Corporations, chaired by Shri K V Kamath, was placed before the SEBI Board in its meeting held on August 24, 2015. The Board took note of the report and approved the proposal to seek public comments on the recommendations of the Committee. The “Committee on Clearing Corporations” was constituted in November 2012 with the following broad terms of reference: a)    The viability of introducing a single Clearing Corporation (CC) or interoperability between different CCs b)   Investment by a recognized CC and the manner of utilization of profits of CCs c)    To examine and review the existing <mark>regulation of transfer of profits every year by the recognized Stock Exchanges to the fund of recognized CC d)   To define ‘the liquid assets’ of CCs for the purpose of calculation of Net worth of a clearing corporation e)    Any other matter that Committee considers relevant or incidental thereto - The issue of Transfer of Depositories’ profits to their Investor Protection Fund (IPF) was referred to the Committee. The main recommendations of the Committee are as follows: On interoperability / viability of single Clearing Corporation, the committee recommended that at this juncture, maintaining separate clearing corporations for each exchange would be prudent. However, SEBI may keep the interoperability option open and consider the proposal for implementation when ground conditions are met, which, inter alia, include clear intent of the participants coming together and having  a suitable  framework in place to the satisfaction of SEBI. On investments by Clearing Corporations, the committee recommended that Clearing Corporations may be permitted to invest in Fixed Deposits and Central Government Securities. However, Clearing Corporations may not be permitted to invest in instruments like Non-convertible debentures (NCDs), Commercial Papers (CPs), Money Market Mutual Funds, etc as these instruments may carry credit/liquidity risks. As the requirement of Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) has already been met, it was recommended that the requirement, under Regulation 33 of SECC Regulations, 2012, to transfer twenty five per cent of its profits by every recognised stock exchange to the Fund, as specified in Regulation 39, of the recognised clearing corporation, may no longer be required. However, Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI may review the stress test model used to determine the Minimum Required Corpus of Core SGF before making such departure. The ‘liquid assets’ of clearing corporations for the purpose of calculation of its Net worth, shall comprise Fixed Deposits/Central Government Securities. Other instruments like NCDs, CPs, money market mutual funds, etc. may carry credit/liquidity risks and hence, may not be considered towards calculation of liquid assets in net worth of CC. With regard to transfer of profits by Depositories, it was recommended that  Depositories may transfer five per cent or such percentage as may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time, of their profits from depository operations every year to the IPF since the date of amendment</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories and Participants) (Amendment) Regulations</mark>, 2012 requiring transfer of profits. The report of the Committee is placed on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in Public comments are invited on the recommendations made in the report. Comments may be emailed to Ms. Yogita Jadhav, Assistant General Manager, at yogitag@sebi.gov.in and to Mr. Ramaneesh Goyal, Assistant Manager, at ramaneeshg@sebi.gov.in by September 24, 2015</td>

As a green initiative, the business responsibility reports can be given on the websites of the companies providing website link for the same in their annual reports. 8)Exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process regarding exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders under Companies Act, 2013 in case of change in objects or varying the term of contracts referred to in the prospectus. 9) Public issuance of convertible securities The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process for revival of public issuance of convertible securities by listed entities. 10) Delisting of Small Companies Delisting Regulations provide for simplified procedure of delisting for small companies and exempt them from the requirements of Chapter IV of the Delisting Regulations subject to certain conditions. Currently, one of such conditions is that the shares of the company have not been traded for the preceding one year. Based on suggestion receive from Investor Association, Board has approved the proposal that the condition of no trading for preceding one year may be relaxed and the small companies, whose trading of equity shares during the twelve calendar months is less than 10% of the total number of shares of such company, would also be eligible for simplified procedure of delisting. However, to protect the interest of investors, the exit price shall not be less than the floor price determined for the purpose of Reverse Book Building for not frequently traded securities in terms of Delisting Regulations read with SEBI Takeover Regulations.</td>

        <td>Besides, ODI subscribers are not permitted to have an Opaque Structure(s). The term “Opaque Structure” means any structure such as protected cell company, segregated cell company or equivalent, where the details of the ultimate beneficial owners are not accessible or where the beneficial owners are ring fenced from each other or where the beneficial owners are ring fenced with regard to enforcement. It may also be noted that NRIs/Resident Indians are not permitted to transact in ODIs. The Board noted that in view of the strict norms for ODI issuance, the notional value of ODIs to the AUC of FPIs has declined over the years from a high of 55.7% in June 2007 to 10% in March 2016. However, the concerns raised by the Special investigations Team (SIT) with regard to identification of Beneficial Owners and transferability of ODIs were also discussed and the Board approved the following additional measures for the purpose of enhancing the transparency and control over the issuance of ODIs: Applicability of Indian KYC/AML norms for Client Due Diligence (i)         Presently, the ODI issuers follow the KYC/AML norms of either the jurisdiction of the end beneficial owner or of the jurisdiction of the ODI issuer. In order to bring about an uniformity in the KYC/AML norms, it has been decided that Indian KYC/AML norms will now be applicable to all ODI issuers. The KYC/AML norms applicable to ODI issuers will be the same as that for all other domestic investors. ODI Issuers shall be required to identify and verify the beneficial owners in the subscriber entities, who hold in excess of the threshold as defined under Rule 9 of the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 i.e. 25% in case of a company and 15% in case of partnership firms/ trusts/ unincorporated bodies. In such cases, the ODI issuers shall be required to identify and verify the person(s) who control the operations of these entities. Prior permission for Transferability of ODIs (Amendment to <mark>SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investor) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations, ODI subscribers are not required to take prior permission of the ODI Issuer for transfer of ODIs to another investor offshore. In order to tighten the ODI regime and have more control over issuance and transfer of ODIs, it has been decided that the ODI subscribers will have to seek prior permission of the original ODI issuer for further/onward issuance/transfer of ODIs. Reporting of complete transfer trail of ODIs (iii)       Presently, the details of the holder of ODIs have to be mandatorily reported to SEBI on a monthly basis. The ODI issuers are also required to capture the details of all the transfers of the ODIs issued by them and these can be made available to SEBI on demand. The Board decided that in the monthly reports on ODIs all the intermediate transfers during the month would also be required to be reported. KYC Review (iv)       The KYC review shall be done on the basis of the risk criteria as determined by the ODI issuers, as follows: a.         At the time of on-boarding and once every three years for low risk clients b.         At the time of on-boarding and every year for all other clients Suspicious Transactions Report (v)        ODI Issuers shall be required to file suspicious transaction reports with the Indian FIU, if any, in relation to the ODIs issued by it. Reconfirmation of ODI positions (vi)       ODI Issuers shall be required to carry out reconfirmation of the ODI positions on a semi-annual basis. Periodic Operational Evaluation (vii)      ODI Issuers shall be required to put in place necessary systems and carry out a periodical review and evaluation of its controls, systems and procedures with respect to the ODIs. Suitable amendments to the Regulations/Circulars shall be made to bring the above mentioned measures into effect. B. Dividend distribution policy for listed companies SEBI Board approved the proposal for the top 500 listed companies (by way of market capitalization) to formulate and disclose their dividend distribution policies in the annual reports and on their websites. Such policy may include: a)         The circumstances under which their shareholders can or cannot expect dividend; b)         The financial parameters that will be considered while declaring dividends; c)         Internal and external factors that would be considered for declaration of dividend; d)         Policy as to how the retained earnings will be utilized. e)         Provisions in regard to various classes of shares. When the company proposes to declare dividend on the basis of parameters other than what is mentioned in such policy or proposes to change its dividend distribution policy, the same along with the rationale shall be disclosed. This step will help the investors in taking well informed investment decisions. C. Amendment to Regulation 33 of Securities Contracts Regulation (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The Board took note that the requirement of establishing Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (Core SGF) was introduced by SEBI vide circular dated August 27, 2014 and Core SGFs have now been built up in the clearing corporations. It also considered the recommendations of the Expert Committee, constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri K V Kamath, to look into various issues relating to clearing corporations including the issue of transfer of 25% of profits by stock exchanges to the core SGF of clearing corporations, and observations of the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI. Taking note that Core SGF have been built up, it was decided to do away with the said requirement of transfer of 25% of profits by stock exchanges. However, there will be a mandate that stock exchanges, along with clearing corporations, shall replenish the Core SGF immediately, in case of any shortfall in the corpus. Such a review will take place on a monthly basis or earlier as and when required. Accordingly, the Regulations would be amended to give effect to the above decision of the Board. D. Amendments to the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 SEBI has notified the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 on September 26, 2014. For smoothening the process of registration of InvIT with SEBI and launching of the offer, SEBI Board has approved for bringing out a consultation paper proposing certain changes/providing clarification in the InvIT Regulations on the following points: 1.         Allowing InvITs to invest in two-level SPV structure. 2.         Mandatory sponsor holding in InvIT to be reduced to 10% from current requirement of 25%, subject to certain conditions. 3.         Increase in the number of sponsors from 3 to 5. 4.         Other operational requirements, such as, aligning regulations in line with the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and SCRR, filing of Project Implementation Agreement at the time of filing of offer document, etc. The consultation paper will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments. E. Guidance Note  on Settlement and procedural changes in processing of Compounding applications Settlement Regulations were formulated primarily to settle minor and technical violations not having wider impact on the market so that enforcement is concentrated on major and significant cases. During the year 2015-16, number of settlement cases have come down putting pressure on the enforcement system.  An analysis revealed that   there are certain doubts on the interpretation of Regulation 5 (2) (b) of Settlement Regulations.  An internal guidance note was issued on March 03, 2016 clarifying the doubts so that more serious and substantial cases are only taken up for enforcement action. For this purpose, defaults which in the opinion of the Board have a bearing on the securities market as whole and not just the listed security and its investors may be considered to have market wide impact.  The assessment of facts and circumstances while deciding the seriousness of the default in relation to an applicant shall take into account the weight and the sufficiency of the evidence. The guidance note was placed before the Board and while noting the contents of the memorandum, it approved that the guidance note be incorporated in the regulations. Further, in dealing with prosecution cases for non-payment of penalty, where compounding request has been filed and where full penalty with interest is paid, the Board took note of the simplification in the procedure for disposing of these matters. F. Amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996 During 2014, Parliament has amended Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996, providing for minimum and maximum monetary penalties and discretion to impose appropriate penalty by the adjudicating officer. However, this is prospective and not applicable to cases falling between 2002 and 2014. Pursuant to the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in the matter of  Roofit Industries Ltd., a need arose for clarifying the monetary penalty provisions in the securities laws, relating to cases prior to 2014.  In view of this, Board approved to send a proposal to the Central Government for amendment</mark>s in the law. G. Establishment of SEBI Chair at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM): The Board considered and approved the proposal for establishment of up to two "SEBI Chairs" at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) by contributing a certain corpus to NISM. NISM is a public trust established by SEBI. SEBI Chairs would provide research based policy inputs and would also help in increasing academic interest and awareness about the activities of SEBI. SEBI Chairs would also undertake activities of publishing research papers, policy notes, concept notes etc., in addition to delivering lectures and seminars. The selection of SEBI Chairs would be with Academic Council of NISM.</td>

For this purpose, defaults which in the opinion of the Board have a bearing on the securities market as whole and not just the listed security and its investors may be considered to have market wide impact.  The assessment of facts and circumstances while deciding the seriousness of the default in relation to an applicant shall take into account the weight and the sufficiency of the evidence. The guidance note was placed before the Board and while noting the contents of the memorandum, it approved that the guidance note be incorporated in the regulations. Further, in dealing with prosecution cases for non-payment of penalty, where compounding request has been filed and where full penalty with interest is paid, the Board took note of the simplification in the procedure for disposing of these matters. F. Amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996 During 2014, Parliament has amended Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996, providing for minimum and maximum monetary penalties and discretion to impose appropriate penalty by the adjudicating officer. However, this is prospective and not applicable to cases falling between 2002 and 2014. Pursuant to the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in the matter of  Roofit Industries Ltd., a need arose for clarifying the monetary penalty provisions in the securities laws, relating to cases prior to 2014.  In view of this, Board approved to send a proposal to the Central Government for amendment</mark>s in the law. G. Establishment of SEBI Chair at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM): The Board considered and approved the proposal for establishment of up to two "SEBI Chairs" at National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) by contributing a certain corpus to NISM. NISM is a public trust established by SEBI. SEBI Chairs would provide research based policy inputs and would also help in increasing academic interest and awareness about the activities of SEBI. SEBI Chairs would also undertake activities of publishing research papers, policy notes, concept notes etc., in addition to delivering lectures and seminars. The selection of SEBI Chairs would be with Academic Council of NISM.</td>
