        <td>The  SEBI  (Foreign  Institutional  Investors)  Regulations,  1995  also  lays down scrip-wise and fund wise maximum limits a fund can invest. Further, through  circular  No.  SMD/DC/CIR-11/02  dated  February  12,  2002  and SEBI/DNAD/CIR-21/2004/03/09  dated  March  9,  2004 issued  by Secondary Market  Department,  position  limits  for  investment  by  FIIs  in derivatives have been advised. These limits will  help diversify the  foreign hedge  fund  investments  and  will  help  in  jettisoning  concentration  in  any specific    scrip.  The  provisions  of  Chapter  III  (Regulation  15  (3)  (a)) disallows  short  selling  by  FIIs  and  stipulates  that  all  trades  by  FIIs  are delivery based. The provision will clearly keep the hedge funds if allowed to  invest  as  FIIs  out  of  short  selling  at  least  in  the  cash  segment.  It  is therefore,  clear  that  existing  provisions  in  the  FII  Regulations  include several  checks  and  balances  which  can  keep  our  market  safe  from potential market abuse and manipulation. 39 4.5  Additional Regulatory Concerns: In view of the increasing popularity among the institutions as well as their increasing  interest  in  the  Indian  market,  it  might  be  time  to  provide  a limited  window  to  this  growing  segment  of  asset  management  industry within the  existing framework of the  <mark>SEBI (Foreign  Institutional  Investors) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Foreign  Institutional Investors) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations</mark><mark>investment adviser</mark>  must have experience of 40 at least 3 years of managing funds with similar investment strategy that the applicant fund has adopted. This provision is expected to allow  well  managed funds to access our  market and at the same time, keep our markets insulated from the possible adverse effects of ‘trial and errors’ by uninitiated rookies.</td>
