        <td>The SEBI Board at its meeting held on December 28, 2001 had decided that all those brokers who did not pay fees should pay atleast 50% of the principal due in the cash market and give an undertaking to pay the balance fees within a period of 2 years along with interest. The brokers are required to give an undertaking in the format as given in the Annexure C of this circular. The Board further decided that any such member who abides by the above would be granted registration in the derivatives segment subject to the other conditions mentioned in the <mark>regulations. Fees payable by composite corporate members: It is clarified that Regulations require every broker who wants to receive a certificate of registration from SEBI to make payment of fees to SEBI. This is irrespective of the number of cards which are held by the broker on the stock exchange. In case the broker has more than one registration certificate from SEBI on any stock exchange then he will be required to pay fees as per the Regulations for each and every certificate that he holds. In case the broker holds only one registration certificate and more than one card on any exchange it is clarified that registration fees are payable on the registration certificate and not on the number of cards held by the broker. The brokers' turnover will be the aggregate turnover of all cards. Fees payable on Government securities and PSU bonds: Transactions in Government securities, bonds, units, etc. clearly form a part of the turnover and have to be included in the total turnover of the member and will have the benefit of concessional rate as mentioned in Regulation 10, Schedule III of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Rules and Regulations, 1992 as amended on 20th February 2002. Applicability of the notification on exemption from fees on corporatisation: Notification dated January 21, 1998 was issued and the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations were amended granting exemption from payment of fee on corporatisation of individual / partnership membership of the Exchange. It has been clarified vide notification dated February 20, 2002 that the amendment which was brought in on January 21, 1998 in respect of conversion of individual or partnership membership card of the exchange into corporate entity shall be deemed to be in continuation of the old entity subject to the condition mentioned in the above notification and no fee shall be collected again from the converted corporate entity for the period for which the erstwhile entity has paid the fees. The spirit behind notification dated January 21, 1998 was to give benefit of this amendment</mark><mark>stock broker</mark><mark>stock broker</mark>s shall be given the benefit of continuity subject to the satisfaction of conditions mentioned in the notification. Nomination by a member by an existing member / Transmission of Membership: Wherever a new registration is required - where it is by virtue of transmission or transfer or any other reason, fresh fees, will have to be paid by the new broking entity. Membership right acquired in auction purchase: Where a person 'purchases' the card of another defaulting member, then the said purchaser shall have to seek fresh registration with SEBI and he shall be liable to pay turnover fees like a new member of the stock exchange.</td>

        <td>SUBJECT: STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN FOR THE YEAR 2003-04 ISSUED BY: OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN SEBI had devised a Strategic Action Plan for the year 2003-04 in order to make the "Indian Securities market, a Benchmark for the Globe’. The Strategic Action Plan has been drawn with four broad segments: a) Investors b) Market c) Intermediaries and d) Regulator in mind. The Plan designed after analysing the inadequacies in the existing structure and practices and bearing the market ethos in mind addresses major issues segregated into: Structural Issues Systemic Issues Operational Issues During the period April 2003 to November 2003, a number of initiatives have been taken with a view to achieve the targets under the Plan. The following are the significant developments ; T+2 rolling settlement was introduced in the Indian markets with effect from April 1, 2003. This would reduce the risk and would be beneficial to the investors. India joins a select group of six nations viz. South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, Chile and Mexico which are following a short settlement cycle. The Central Listing Authority (CLA) was constituted with Chief Justice of India (retd.) Shri. M. N. Venkatachaliah as the President. The Regulations have been notified and the CLA would become operational shortly. Trading in Interest Rate Derivatives was launched by the Hon’ble Minister of Finance and Department of Company Affairs. This instrument would provide a mechanism for banks and financial institutions to hedge their positions in a volatile interest rate regime. Mutual Funds were allowed to launch ‘ Fund of Funds’. This would provide an opportunity to a Mutual Fund to invest in the units of other Mutual Funds. Guidelines for Mutual Funds for investments in overseas equity markets have been issued. The disclosure regime for the Mutual Funds was further strengthened and in order to ensure that all important disclosures are made to the investors of the concerned schemes and their interests are protected in cases of consolidation of schemes by Mutual Funds. The entry norms for IPOs were strengthened to ensure better quality of issuers, the issue process was revamped to facilitate faster allotment, and quick listing. The notice period for book closure/record date has been reduced to 15 days (for demat shares) to facilitate corporate decision making and reduce time required for making rights offers. The arbitration mechanism at the exchanges has been revamped in order to expedite the process and ensure transparency. <mark>SEBI (Ombudsman) Regulations</mark><mark>stock broker</mark>, and the residence of its promoters for carrying out illegal trading in securities, outside the recognized stock exchanges (dabba trading.)

The committee submitted its report on 18th December 1992 and recommended concessional rates of fees for certain types of transactions.  It  observed  that  the  turnover  was  a  fair  basis  for  determination  of registration  fees  and  the  incidence  of  fees  prescribed  by  SEBI  was  not  unreasonable. The  Government  and  SEBI  accepted  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  in principle.  SEBI  advised  the  brokers  on  January  7,  1993  to  pay  fees  in  the  manner prescribed by the Bhatt Committee. In meantime several writ petitions challenging the registration fees based on turnover, SEBI’s competence to levy fees, etc. were filed by the brokers in various High Courts. All these petitions were transferred to the Supreme Court which dismissed the transfer petition (No. 502/2000) on February 1, 2001 and upheld SEBI's powers to levy fees for carrying out the purposes of the SEBI Act. It also held that turnover can be a measure of the levy of fees. It, however, directed SEBI to incorporate  the  R.  S.  Bhatt  Committee  recommendations  in  the  regulations.  The regulations were amended on February 20, 2002 to provide for concessional rates for various  transactions  and  exclude  some  transactions  from  turnover.  Two  circulars clarifying the various issues raised in the representations of the brokers were issued on March 28, 2002 and September 30, 2002. The brokers have been paying the fees as per amended regulations.</td>

        <td>d) Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  RTS Power Corporation Limited SEBI  received  complaints  from  the brokers  wherein  it  was  mentioned  that the  brokers  suspected  that  trading carried  out  in  the  scrip  of  M/s.  RTS Power  Corporation  Limited  (RTS)  was fraudulent in nature. Upon investigation, 102 SEBI  found  out  that  Mr.  Konde,  Mr. Jadhav,  Mr.  Waje,  Ms.  Hetal  Patel  and Mr. Rajesh Patel prima facie colluded to misuse  the  stock  exchange  mechanism to  profitably  exit  from  their  positions in  the  scrip  RTS  on  February  11,  2009. They had orchestrated a plan to default in  the  pay-in  obligation  of  the  buy clients who provided an exit to the seller, thereby  defrauding  the  stock  brokers. It  was  observed  that  buyers  and  sellers had  dealings  with  common  financiers such  as  M/s.  OM  Associates  and  M/s. Bhavani  Trading  Co,  for  routing  funds between  them.  It  is  also  pertinent  to note  that  Mr.  Konde  and  Ms.  Hetal Patel  traded  through  a  different  set  of stock  brokers  on  February  11,  2009, as  against  their  regular  stock  brokers and  selected  well  capitalised  <mark>stock broker</mark><mark>SEBI (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair Trade  Practices  Relating  to  Securities Market) Regulations</mark>, 2003.

Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market e) Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  Alka Securities Ltd. During  the  course  of  preliminary examination during the period November 2008 to March 2009, SEBI observed that the  promoters  of  M/s.  Alka  Securities Ltd. used the off-market route to transfer shares  of  the  company  to  42  entities (1st level entities) and these entities have either  dealt  the  said  shares  in  market or  transferred  to  317  entities  (2nd  level entities)  who  in  turn  had  dealt  in  the said  shares  at  BSE.  The  trading  activity by  the  promoter/company  connected entities  prima-facie  suggests  circular trading  activity  with  an  intention  of creating  the  volume  so  as  to  give  the market  a  false  impression  about  the liquidity  of  the  scrip.  Further,  the company,  its  promoters  and  directors, prima  facie,  appeared  to  have  failed to  provide  mandatory  disclosures  for change in their shareholdings on various occasions  whereas  the  shareholding disclosures made to BSE were incorrect and  apparently  false.  This  activity continued in the period after March 2009. In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an interim  order  dated  July  28,  2009  with following directions:- •  The  promoters  of  M/s.  Alka Securities  Limited  viz.  Ms.  Alka M  Pandey,  Mr.  Ravi  Pandey,  Mr. Mahesh  Natvarlal  Kothari,  Ms. Anjuben Kothari, Mr. Brijesh Kothari, Ms.  Dimple  Kothari,  Mr.  Mahendra Pandey and Mayuresh Esatate Agent were  restrained  from  accessing the  securities  market  and  further prohibited  from  buying,  selling, dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner whatsoever, till further orders.</td>

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience. They shall also be required to have net tangible assets of atleast Rs. 2 crore. Corporate angel investors shall be required to have Rs. 10 crore net worth or be a registered AIF/VCF. iii.   Angel Funds shall have a corpus of atleast Rs.10 crore (as against Rs. 20 crore for other AIFs) and minimum investment by an investor shall be Rs. 25 lakh (may be accepted over a period of maximum 3 years) as against Rs. 1 crore for other AIFs. Further, the continuing interest by sponsor/manager in the Angel Fund shall be not less than 2.5% of the corpus or Rs. 50 lakh, whichever is lesser. iv.  For ensuring investments are genuine angel investments, angel funds shall invest only in investee companies which: a. are incorporated in India and are not more than 3 years old; and b. have a turnover not exceeding Rs.25 crore; and c.  are unlisted, and d.  are not promoted, sponsored or related to an Industrial Group whose group turnover is in excess of Rs.300 crore, and e. has no family connection with the investors proposing to invest in the company. v.  Further, investment in an investee company by an angel fund shall be not less than Rs.50 lakh and not more than Rs.5 crore and shall be required to be held for a period of at least 3 years.</td>

With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / non-convertible redeemable preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of the wilful defaulters. Any company or its promoter or its director categorized as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to take control over other listed entity. However, if a listed company or its promoter or its director is categorized as wilful defaulter, and there is a take-over offer in respect of the listed company, they may be allowed to make competing offer for the said listed company in accordance with <mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>stock broker</mark><mark>SEBI (Listing and Other Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark>, 2011, the following  proposals may be considered: 1: Framework for protective rights An illustrative list of protective rights which would not amount to acquisition of control may be issued. Grant of such protective rights to an investor may be subject to obtaining the public shareholders’ approval (majority of minority). 2: Adopting a numerical threshold Considering the international practices and the current regulatory environment in India, the definition of control may be amended such that control is defined as (a) the right or entitlement to exercise at least 25% of voting rights of a company irrespective of whether such holding gives de facto control and/or (b) the right to appoint majority of the non-independent directors of a company. Or, any other option as may be decided after consultation. The discussion paper inviting comments will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.</td>

The  Supreme  Court  observed  that  paragraph  4  of Schedule  III  to  the  Regulations,  inserted  through an  amendment  with  effect  from  January  21,  1998, does  not  disclose,  either  explicitly  or  by  necessary implication,  that  a  corporate  entity  formed  earlier to  January  21,  1998  would  not  be  exempted  from payment of fee for the period for which the erstwhile individual  or  partnership  members  had  already paid the fees. Further, the explanation to paragraph 4 introduced with effect from February 20, 2002 also does not restrict the benefits of conversion to entities converted on or after any particular date.
