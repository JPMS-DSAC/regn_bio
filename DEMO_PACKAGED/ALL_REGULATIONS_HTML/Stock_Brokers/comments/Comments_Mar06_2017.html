        <td>You would be aware that the Ministry of Finance issued a directive to all stock exchanges in August 1991, instructing inter-alia that the transaction price and brokerage should be shown separately in the contract notes issued by <mark>stock broker</mark>s. On our follow up in the last month, the stock exchanges have reported to us that they have issued necessary directive to their member brokers. In this connection, please also refer to our letter no. SE/4569 dated 19.6.92, advising you to make a sample scrutiny of the books of your member brokers and report to us whether the aforesaid directive of the Government has been implemented by the member brokers. We have not received any response from your Exchange as yet. Hence you may arrange to inspect the contract notes of your member brokers on a sample basis for a period of the last 2- 4 weeks and send a report to us which should include the following details : i. the date when the Exchange issued directive to the member brokers to show execution price and the brokerage separately in the contract notes.   ii. the date when the bye-laws and regulations in this respect were amended.   iii. after the inspection of records of the member brokers, the findings of the Exchange indicating whether the aforesaid directive of the Government has been implemented by brokers. iv. any action taken against the member brokers who have not followed the directive of the Government and the Exchange, and   v. the steps taken/proposed to be taken by the Exchange to ensure that the member brokers show transaction price and the brokerage separately in the contract notes.</td>

        <td>1. The terms of reference of the committee require it to go into the various components of turnover. However, questions regarding reasonableness of turnover based registration fee were raised and therefore the committee would like to deal with these questions first. 2. The Webster’s New Twentieth Century (p.1973) dictionary meaning of the word "Turnover" relevant to the matter referred to the Committee is "the amount of business done during the given period of time in terms of money used in buying and selling". The term "Turnover" has been defined to mean "the aggregate of the sale and purchase prices of securities received and receivable by the <mark>stock broker</mark> either on his own account as well as on account of his clients in respect of sale and purchase or dealing in securities during any financial year" in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992. The committee found that the definition given in the regulations is consistent with the meaning of the word as normally understood. 3. It has been represented to SEBI that since brokers carry out business on behalf of their clients most of the time, the brokerage earned by them should be regarded as their turnover and not the purchase and sale price of the securities bought and sold. The committee considered this matter in depth and found it unacceptable for two reasons. First, the definition in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Rules and Regulations, 1992 is quite clear and does not admit of the interpretation that the brokerage alone would constitute turnover. Even in common parlance the total volume that is the price paid or received for securities purchased or sold would constitute turnover and the brokerage together with the differential in the prices, if any, would constitute income or revenues from which profits would be derived ultimately. Secondly, it has also been represented that for income tax purposes brokerage is deemed to be the turnover and hence even for the purposes of fees payable to SEBI the same interpretation should apply. Each authority is required to interpret terms as per the enactment(s) being administered by that authority. Therefore, the Committee did not go into the question of what exact interpretation is given by the income-tax authorities. 4. The committee noted the fact that fees have been levied and collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States of America since 1935 on the basis of the total price of securities and not brokerage alone. The turnover based fees are charged every year and are being collected from 1935 on a perennial basis whereas, under SEBI Regulations fees would be payable by any broker for a period of initial five years only and thereafter a nominal sum of Rs. one thousand per annum is payable by each broker.   III.

        <td>  This matter was discussed by SEBI separately with the heads of some major Stock Exchanges. In this connection, it has been decided that the members of stock Exchanges executing transactions of his clients through the members of other Exchanges are to be treated as a "sub - broker". In terms of Rule 3 of SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Rules, 1992 read with Section 12 of SEBI Act, no <mark>stock broker</mark> or sub-broker shall buy, sell, deal in securities unless he holds a certificate granted by the Board under the regulations. Thus, it is necessary for any person who acts as sub-broker to hold Certificate of Registration as a sub-broker granted by SEBI and accordingly the members of Stock Exchanges who also act as sub-brokers should hold a separate registration with SEBI as a sub-broker. However, presently some of the members of exchanges who are acting as sub-brokers through the members of other exchanges have not obtained separate registration from SEBI to act as sub-brokers.   In view of the above It is advised that the members of the stock exchanges who are acting as sub-brokers through the members of other exchanges should obtain Certificate of Registration from SEBI to act as a sub-broker under SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Rules & Regulations, 1992. Further, in terms of clause B (2)(a) of the Code of Conduct of sub-brokers issued under Regulation 15 of SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers)Rules and Regulations, 1992, sub-brokers are required to issue promptly to his clients purchase or sale notes for all the transactions entered into by him on behalf of his clients. Accordingly, the members who act on behalf of his principal broker as sub-brokers should issue purchase or sale notes for all the transactions entered into by him through his principal broker as an agent of the principal broker. </td>

In the case of Rules in Part 'A', the proposed rules may be adopted in case there is a material difference between these rules and the existing similar rules of the exchange. The Model Rules along with the Committee Report are enclosed for adoption after necessary approvals from the General Body/Governing Board of the Exchanges. However if there are any difficulties in implementation of these Rules, such difficulties may be brought to the notice of SEBI.
