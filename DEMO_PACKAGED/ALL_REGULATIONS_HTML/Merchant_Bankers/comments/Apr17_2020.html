Further,  the  definition  of “fugitive economic offender”, “list regulations” and “postal ballot” have been inserted in the regulations, and the word “listing agreement” wherever occurring has been replaced by the word “listing regulations”. Rationale: SEBI had earlier issued a discussion paper  on  March  28,  2018  soliciting  public comments  for  reviewing  the  SEBI  Takeover Regulations.  The  amendments  are  mainly aimed at simplifying the language, removing redundant  provisions  and inconsistencies, updating the references to the Companies Act, 2013  and  other  new  SEBI  Regulations,  and incorporating  the  relevant  circulars,  FAQs, informal guidance in the regulations. 5. Amendment  Notification  dated  December 31,  2018:  Amendment  to  regulation  29(4)  of the Regulations to extend the exemption from disclosure to deposit taking Housing Finance 3. 182 Securities and Exchange Board of India Annual Report : 2018-19 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA 6.

Rationale:  Under the  regulations,  shares taken  by  way  of  encumbrance  are  treated  as an acquisition and shares given upon release of  encumbrance  are  treated  as  a  disposal. Such  acquisition  and  disposal  are  required to  be  disclosed.  However,  such  disclosure requirements  were  not  applicable to  a scheduled commercial bank or public financial institution  as  pledgee  in  connection  with  a pledge  of  shares  for  securing  indebtedness in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Pursuant to  the  amendment,  shares  taken  by  way  of encumbrance (or shares given upon release of encumbrance)  by  the  said  HFCs  and  NBFCs shall not be treated as acquisition (or disposal) for  the  purpose  of  disclosure  requirements under Regulation 29 of Takeover Regulations. Amendment  Notification  dated  March 29,  2019:  The  exemptions  available  to  debt restructuring  approved  by  a  “competent authority”  other  than  a  Court  or  Tribunal have  been  removed.  Further,  the  exemption available to new investors who purchase equity from  lenders  pursuant  to  debt  restructuring has been removed. Rationale:  The  amendment  inter  alia  takes into  account  the  changes  brought  in  by  the Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code,  2016  and the  revisions  made  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of India in its debt restructuring guidelines and confines the exemption from open offer only to lenders converting their debt to equity under such revised guidelines or to a resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. (14)    Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India (Alternative Investment Funds) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018, notified on June 01, 2018 Details:  Relevant  provisions  referring to Companies  act,  1956  in  the  regulation  have been  updated  with corresponding provisions  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013  and the  words  “Companies  Act,  1956”  wherever occurring has been replaced with “Companies Act, 2013”. the Rationale: The amendments have been made to update the regulations with the Companies Act, 2013.

Relevant provisions, chapter and Schedule pertaining to issuance  and  listing  of  security  receipts  have been  inserted.  The  regulations  which  were earlier titled as SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008  shall  now  be  titled  as  SEBI  (Issue  and Listing  of  Securitised  Debt  Instruments  and Security Receipts) Regulations, 2008.

Amendment Notification dated July 30, 2018: Amendment  to  discontinue  the  category  of sub-broker  as  a  market  intermediary  and accordingly  delete  all  clauses  and  provisions with respect to sub-brokers in the regulations. Rationale:  Under  the  current  regulations and  the  procedure  prescribed  by  the  Stock Exchanges, there is no difference between role and functioning of a Sub-Broker and that of an Authorized  Person.

(20)  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India (Regulatory  Fee  on  Stock  Exchanges) (Amendment)  Regulations,  2018,  notified  on October 23, 2018 Details:  Amendment  to  the  Explanation  to sub-regulation (1) of Regulation 4. Rationale: It was decided to give relaxation in charging regulatory fees on the trading turnover 184 Securities and Exchange Board of India Annual Report : 2018-19 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA of  agricultural  commodity  derivatives  in  a manner  that  would  help  the  stock  exchanges to reduce the cost burden on the farmers/FPOs under different cost heads such as transaction charges,  delivery  fees,  warehouse  charges, assaying  charges  etc.  by  way  of  subsidizing these costs from the amount that will be saved by  them  from  the  reduction  of  regulatory fees by SEBI. For this purpose, it was decided that  instead  of  levying  regulatory  fee  at  the prescribed turn-over based slab rates discussed above, a nominal regulatory fee at a flat rate of INR  1,00,000  per  stock  exchange,  irrespective of  the  aggregate  value  of  the  transactions  on agricultural  commodity  derivatives  shall  be levied. (21)    Amendments to  SEBI (Prohibition  of Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  2015  and SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 Pursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the Committee  on  Fair  Market  Conduct  which was  set  up  under  Chairmanship  of  Shri  T.K.

PIT Regulations 1. 2. Amendments to the PIT Regulations were made to  strengthen  transparence  and  enforcement aspects  of  the  PIT  regulations,  and  to  bring clarity  in  respect  of  certain  regulation</mark>s  for better implementation. A  framework  for  institutional  responsibility has been created to ensure that the institution takes  responsibility  to  formulate  a  code  of conduct  and  put  in  place  an  effective  system of  internal  controls  to  ensure  compliance with  the  various  requirements  specified  in the PIT Regulation to prevent insider trading. Listed companies are required to have written policies and procedures for inquiries into leak of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information (UPSI)  or  suspected  leak  of  UPSI,  which  are duly  approved  by  board  of  directors  of  the company, and to have whistle-blower policies that  make  it  easy  for  employees  to  report instances of leak of UPSI. Further, every listed company  /  market  participant  is  required  to maintain  an  electronic  record  containing  the names of person / entities with whom UPSI is shared to facilitate tracing of UPSI. Amendments  to  the  PIT  Regulations  were made  to  bring  further  clarity  on  sharing  of UPSI for due diligence or legitimate purposes. Board of directors of listed company or market participants  are  now  required  to  define  their own policy / definition relating to “legitimate purposes” within the contours provided under law. Certain defences are available to insider who trade when in possession of UPSI. Regulation 4(1)  of  PIT  Regulations  were  amended  to extend  the  defence  available  for  off-market inter-se  transfers  between  promoters,  who were in possession of the same UPSI, to other insiders in possession of same UPSI subject to disclosure  of  such  transactions,  transactions carried  out  through  the  block  deal  window mechanism  among  persons  possessing  the same  UPSI,  transactions  carried  out  in  a bona  fide  manner  pursuant  to  a  statutory  or regulatory  obligation  and  for  transactions undertaken  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  stock options.</td>
