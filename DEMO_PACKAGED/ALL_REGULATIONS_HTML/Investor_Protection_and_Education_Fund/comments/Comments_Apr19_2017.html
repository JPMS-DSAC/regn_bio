Participation of as large number of investors as possible is desirable from the angle of democratizing the price discovery process as well as from the angle of making best use of the markets. Investors will get attracted to the market only when they feel that the markets are free from manipulation and in case of any manipulation regulator will take suitable enforcement action. In this context, the role of surveillance department and investigation department in the regulation of any jurisdiction is important. He added that in view of globalization of markets interaction amongst regulators is need of the hour. </td>
