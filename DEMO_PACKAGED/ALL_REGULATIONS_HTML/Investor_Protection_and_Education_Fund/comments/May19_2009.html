        <td>The  previous  report  of  the  Committee  while  making  its  recommendations  had concluded by observing that no Rule, no Regulation, indeed no Law, which deals with  dynamically  evolving  economic  situation  and  circumstances  and  seeks  to resolve  constantly  varying  economic  interests  and  problems  in  -a  fast  growing economy, can possibly hope to have a permanent – not even a long ending life. With new ideas and new experiences, the law must move forward.  It cannot be allowed  to  stagnate,  for  stagnation  is  death.    This  observation  was  no  mere rhetoric.  The truth of this observation became evident within a short time of the coming into force of the <mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>investor protection</mark>.  The Regulations in fact spurred takeover activity as evidenced by the large number of public  offers,  cases  of  automatic  exemption  and  references  to  the  Takeover Panel under the provisions of the Regulations during the years following upon the coming into force of the Regulations. However,  it  was  found  as  a  result  of  the  experience  of  the  working  of  the Regulations  that  some  provisions  were  open  to  diverse  interpretations  while some  others  were  not  sufficiently  precise  and  could  be  used  to  achieve unintended results.  Moreover, new challenges in the light of on-going economic reforms,  which  arose  consequent  on  liberalisation,  needed  to  be  satisfactorily met.  The challenges were accentuated in view of the irreversible integration of the Indian economy in general and the capital market in particular with the world markets.        It  was,  therefore,  realised  that  in  order  to  make  the  Regulations efficient and effective for achieving the object and purpose for which they were made  as  also  to  meet  the  challenges  resulting  from  economic  reforms  and liberalisation, it was necessary to take a fresh look at the Regulations and make a dispassionate, well informed review of the provisions of the Regulations in the light  of  the  experience  gained  as  a  result  of  working  the  Regulations,  so  as  to better  subserve  investor  interest,  consistent  with  fostering  economic  growth. The need for review of the Regulations arose as early as June 1998.</td>

        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a recognised stock exchange. iii.      The corpus of any stock exchange is made up of (1) the contribution of the members, (2) the income of the exchange, and (3) the fiscal incentives which had helped the accumulation of reserves. In addition, it may include an adventitious factor by way of appreciation in the value of the assets over a period of time. The net worth of the exchange after revaluation of the assets and liabilities based on market value could be apportioned on the basis of the three components of the corpus mentioned above. The share relating to the members’ contribution should be made available to the members. The balance will be transferred to an escrow account and then to a fund earmarked for the purpose of <mark>investor protection</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in. Comments, if any, on the aforesaid Report may be sent by email to rses@sebi.gov.in or by post so as to reach the following address by May 31, 2006:- Shri V.S.

        <td>Action has already been initiated. 3 Non-compliance with the listing agreement should not result in suspension or delisting of securities, as it would harm the small investors. Penal action against the promoters/directors of the defaulting company is, however warranted. The SCRA has been suitably amended authorizing SEBI to take action against the issuer companies for non-compliance with the Listing Agreement. No further action is called for. 4 SEBI should encourage the growth and development of professional trustee companies. Debenture trustees should ensure that information on rating downgrades is made available to all investors. Moreover, a press release should be issued by the concerned debenture trustee whenever there is a default by a corporate. All information/ reports, including compliance reports filed by the companies and by the debenture trustees should be made public and be put up on the websites of the companies, debenture trustees and stock exchanges. Investors, by and large, are not aware of the role and responsibilities of a debenture trustee. Suitable <mark>education</mark><mark>amendment of rules and regulations pertaining to Debenture Trustees While amending the regulation</mark>s will take time, the latter part of the recommendation will be implemented immediately. 5 Companies should pay interest and redemption amounts, in respect of corporate bonds issued by them, to the concerned depositories who would then pass them on to the investors through ECS/warrants. This would generate accurate public announcements about defaults and improve transparency about soft defaults; SEBI has already issued a circular for adopting ECS for IPOs in equities. Another circular may be issued to cover the corporate debt issuances also.</td>
