        <td>Accordingly,  Union  Budget:  2006-07, proposed setting up of an Investor Protection Fund (IPF) funded by fines and penalties recovered by SEBI.  At  present  these  amounts  are  credited  to the Consolidated Fund of India as required under securities laws. Hence, the IPF can be established after the relevant laws are amended permitting credit of these amounts to the IPF. Pending the aforesaid amendment, SEBI set up an ‘Investor Protection and Education Fund’ (IPEF) by an administrative order dated July 23, 2007.  An  initial  corpus  of  Rs.10  crore  was  set aside for IPEF from the General Fund of SEBI. The Fund will be utilized for investor <mark>education</mark> and  related  activities.  The  fund  shall  be administered in accordance with the Regulations, which were approved by the Board on February 2, 2009 and are in the process of being notified. Salient  features  of  this  Regulations  are  as under: a) Amounts  that  can  be  credited  to  the IPEF</td>
