        <td>It	was	alleged	that	VHPL,	one	of	the	promoter entities	 of	 the	 Va<mark>kra</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial	 Acquisition	 of	 Shares	 and	 Takeovers) Regulations</mark>,	 2011	 (“Takeover	 Regulations”),	 by exceeding	the	threshold	limit	of	25	per	cent	of	total share	capital	of	the	company	on	May	27,	2013. VHPL	inter-alia	submitted	that	it	was	a	person acting  in  concert  along  with  the  Promoters  and Dinesh	 Nandwana	 had	 the	 ultimate	 control	 over the	target	company.	Since	the	promoters	collectively already	held	more	than	25	per	cent,	the	noticee	could not be alleged to have independently triggered the Takeover	Regulations.	SEBI	in	its	order	dated	August 9,	 2018	 held	 that	 Regulation	 3(3)	 unambiguously provides	that	acquisition	of	shares	or	voting	rights beyond	the	threshold	of	25	per	cent,	even	by	a	single entity	amongst	the	PACs	would	attract	the	obligation to	 make	 an	 open	 offer.	 The	 contention	 raised	 by the	 Noticee	 that	 VHPL	 was	 controlled	 by	 Dinesh Nandwana	 at	 the	 relevant	 time,	 would	 at	 best	 be a	 defence	 to	 counter	 an	 allegation	 levelled	 under Regulation	 4,	 but	 the	 same	 is	 not	 a	 valid	 defence for	an	allegation	under	Regulation	3,	where	specific threshold  is  stipulated  without  contemplating  or considering,  who  exercises  control  over  the  target company.</td>
