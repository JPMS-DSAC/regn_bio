With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / <mark>non-convertible redeemable</mark><mark>preference shares</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Listing and Other Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark>, 2011, the following  proposals may be considered: 1: Framework for protective rights An illustrative list of protective rights which would not amount to acquisition of control may be issued. Grant of such protective rights to an investor may be subject to obtaining the public shareholders’ approval (majority of minority). 2: Adopting a numerical threshold Considering the international practices and the current regulatory environment in India, the definition of control may be amended such that control is defined as (a) the right or entitlement to exercise at least 25% of voting rights of a company irrespective of whether such holding gives de facto control and/or (b) the right to appoint majority of the non-independent directors of a company. Or, any other option as may be decided after consultation. The discussion paper inviting comments will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.</td>
