The  Regulations  were  formulated  primarily  to settle  minor  and  technical  violations  not  having a wider impact on the market so that enforcement is  concentrated  on  major  and  significant  cases. However, the intention was not to reject settlements with respect to violations pertaining to fraud. Rationale: clarifications were issued vide the amendment. In  order to remove  ambiguity, u. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) (Amendment)  Regulations, 2017 w.e.f February 27, 2017 Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  provides  for charging interest in case of excessive delays in filing applications  or  payments  of  settlement  amounts;  a settlement notice before issuance of a formal show cause  notice,  except  for  those  which  are  excluded from  settlement;  and  re-application  of  rejected  or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest.
