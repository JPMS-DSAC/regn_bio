        <td>Action has already been initiated. 3 Non-compliance with the listing agreement should not result in suspension or delisting of securities, as it would harm the small investors. Penal action against the promoters/directors of the defaulting company is, however warranted. The SCRA has been suitably amended authorizing SEBI to take action against the issuer companies for non-compliance with the Listing Agreement. No further action is called for. 4 SEBI should encourage the growth and development of professional trustee companies. Debenture trustees should ensure that information on rating downgrades is made available to all investors.
