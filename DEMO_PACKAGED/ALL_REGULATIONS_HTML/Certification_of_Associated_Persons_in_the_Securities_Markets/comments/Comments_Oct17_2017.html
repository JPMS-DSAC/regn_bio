        <td> SEBI took over the Regulation of the Commodity Derivatives market on September 28, 2015 as a result of merger of FMC with SEBI. The merger of two Regulators is an unique and rare event across the world. It was also a heartening moment for SEBI as an organization that Government had reposed faith in its regulatory capacity while entrusting <mark>regulation of a new sector.  Taking over the Regulation of the new sector and bringing it at par with the Regulation  of the securities market was a lengthy process which involved Gap Analyses, widespread consultation with stakeholders, amendment</mark><mark>nism</mark> for investor grievance redressal and arbitration, capacity building and necessary organizational restructuring. We have made substantial progress in the past one year. The Government has also taken the e-Agri market initiative to link spot markets for agricultural commodities across the country. This will also improve linkage of futures market with spot market.</td>
