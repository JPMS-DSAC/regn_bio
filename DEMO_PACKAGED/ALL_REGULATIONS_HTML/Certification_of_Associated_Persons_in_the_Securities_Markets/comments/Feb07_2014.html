We have also come across instances wherein the companies have never paid interest and principal amount to mutual funds particularly when the securities were bought on private placement basis. While going through the portfolio statements of the mutual funds, we find non-performing assets (NPAs) and some of the scrips valued at a negligible amount.

SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue.

The Strategic Action Plan has been drawn with four broad segments: a) Investors b) Market c) Intermediaries and d) Regulator in mind. The Plan designed after analysing the inadequacies in the existing structure and practices and bearing the market ethos in mind addresses major issues segregated into: Structural Issues Systemic Issues Operational Issues During the period April 2003 to November 2003, a number of initiatives have been taken with a view to achieve the targets under the Plan. The following are the significant developments ; T+2 rolling settlement was introduced in the Indian markets with effect from April 1, 2003. This would reduce the risk and would be beneficial to the investors. India joins a select group of six nations viz. South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, Chile and Mexico which are following a short settlement cycle. The Central Listing Authority (CLA) was constituted with Chief Justice of India (retd.) Shri. M. N. Venkatachaliah as the President. The Regulations have been notified and the CLA would become operational shortly.

In order to strengthen supervision over functioning of subsidiaries of Stock exchanges directions were issued to the stock exchanges for making necessary provisions in rules, regulations and the byelaws as well as in the Memoranda/ Articles of Associations of the subsidiary companies. Investor protection has been enhanced through redefining the relationship between a broker and a sub-broker . Model Bye-Laws of the exchanges are being implemented across all the exchanges . The Code of conduct for regulated market intermediaries has been strengthened by incorporating global standards that would be relevant in the present market scenario. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Informal Guidance) Scheme, 2003 were notified to facilitate transparency and clarity on regulatory issues.

Dear Sir, Sub: Issuance of Electronic Contract Notes This is in continuation of the SEBI circular no. SMDRP/POLICY/Cir-15/00 dated December 15, 2000 and clarification issued vide letter dated SEBI/SMD/SE/15/2003/29/04 dated April 29, 2003 on the issue of an electronic contract note whereby SEBI had permitted the issue of electronic contract notes with digital signature obtained from a valid Certifying Authority provided under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). The exchanges were directed to make the necessary <mark>amendments to the bye-laws, rules and regulations for the implementation of the same. It has been brought to the notice of SEBI that the format of the electronic contract note prescribed by the exchanges were not in conformity with the format of the physical contract note particularly with respect to the pre-printed terms and conditions. Hence members issuing electronic contract notes were also issuing physical contract notes which amounted to duplication and unnecessary reconciliation between the physical and electronic contract notes. In order to streamline the issuance of electronic contract notes as a legal document like the physical contract note, the exchanges are advised to implement the following: The exchanges would prescribe a standard format for the electronic contract note (based on the model format prescribed in Annexure A) in its bye-laws, rules and regulations. The exchange bye-laws, rules and regulations for issuance of electronic contract note shall be amended to include all the standard pre-printed terms and conditions in the physical contract note. The electronic contract note would mention the relevant bye-laws / rules / regulations of the exchange subject to which the said contract note is being issued. The exchange shall also modify / amend other relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations with respect to signing of the electronic contract note with a digital signature so as to make the modified format of the electronic contract note a valid legal document like the physical contract note. The mechanism of record keeping of electronic contract notes in a soft non-tamperable form shall be prescribed by the exchange in compliance with the provisions of the IT Act, 2000. Hence you are advised to, - Make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark>s of the exchange for the implementation of the above decision immediately. Bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of members of the Exchange and also disseminate the same on your website, if any.

        <td>Though the various parties involved in the different stages of the entire chain of events might claim their part as genuine, the same cannot be countenanced at this juncture of the proceedings, where the materiality of circumstances and the manner in which the entire modus operandi was executed have the ingredients of a manipulative assemblage to scupper the process of IPO allotment. It appears that unfair gain has been made by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani, Manojdev Seksaria and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Purshottam Budhwani would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants.

        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a recognised stock exchange. iii.      The corpus of any stock exchange is made up of (1) the contribution of the members, (2) the income of the exchange, and (3) the fiscal incentives which had helped the accumulation of reserves. In addition, it may include an adventitious factor by way of appreciation in the value of the assets over a period of time. The net worth of the exchange after revaluation of the assets and liabilities based on market value could be apportioned on the basis of the three components of the corpus mentioned above. The share relating to the members’ contribution should be made available to the members. The balance will be transferred to an escrow account and then to a fund earmarked for the purpose of investor protection managed by SEBI. This scheme will need a proper methodology for valuation of the assets and liabilities as well as for determining the proportion mentioned above and should be carried out by an independent entity. A Task Force may be constituted by SEBI comprising a chartered accountant, an approved valuer and a representative of SEBI for the purpose. iv.     In the absence of any specific provision for distribution of assets, no RSE would seek a voluntary exit option and one would have to live with a situation in which RSEs would continue to exist nearly in perpetuity and continue to remain a burden on the investor and the regulatory system. v.       The entity which remains after withdrawal of recognition must immediately change its name and style and cannot continue in any business as a stock exchange. In case a stock exchange whose recognition is withdrawn has a subsidiary, such an entity would also have to change its name and style to avoid any representation of any present or past affiliation with an exchange. It would be upto the subsidiary to carry on broking operations as any other broking entity registered with SEBI subject to the same rights and duties. vi.     The impact, on account of withdrawal of recognition either on request or on compulsory direction, on the companies exclusively listed on the RSEs and their shareholders would also need to be suitably addressed. An analysis of the compliance status of these companies indicates that only about 500 companies are compliant with the continuous listing requirements. It is felt that such compliant companies, in an exchange which will no longer remain recognized, should be allowed to migrate to any other exchange with minimum procedure and hassle to the company. SEBI can prescribe that files of such compliant companies be moved inter-exchange with minimum burden on such companies. vii.    Before seeking voluntary withdrawal of recognition, the RSEs would have to compulsorily delist all non-compliant companies. viii.  In the event of some of the remaining RSEs which have already been corporatised and are unable to demutualise within the stipulated time such RSEs will also attract the consequences of withdrawal of recognition under sec. 5(2) of the SCRA and their recognition will be compulsorily withdrawn and accordingly, they would have recourse to the same mecha<mark>nism</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in.

        <td>a)  There is no express provision saying so. b)  Even so distinctive numbers of securities of an issuer which are still in physical form are not required to be maintained by the depository. c)  The problem is compounded because of existence of two depositories, which may not have identical data. ii. It  is  seen  that  in  one  of  the  depositories  there  was  a mecha<mark>nism</mark>  of  communication  between  the  depository participant  and  the  depository  even  before  forwarding  to the issuer and that non genuine cases such as demat of (duplicate  or  forged)  certificates  bearing  same  distinctive number  as  those  already  dematted  are  capable  of  being eliminated  at  the  first  stage  itself.  This  system  has  now been  discontinued.  It  is  felt  based  on  SEBI’s  experience that this system should be made compulsory for all demat requests  and  for  all  depositories  after  plugging  the loopholes  mentioned  in  (a)  to  (c)  above.  Any  other  view could  make  the  provisions  of  regulations  54(2)  and  (3) redundant  and  would  provide  no  means  of  checking whether  the  dematerialized  securities  are  within  the  limit of total issued capital.  Further, such a provision will only be  clarificatory  of  section  19E  of  the  Depositories  Act (Penalty for failure to reconcile records), which has been inserted by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2004. iii.  Accordingly,  regulations  54(4A)  to  (4C)  and  54A  are proposed. Since the depositories do not have a system to track  distinctive  numbers  and  share  the  information  with depository  participants  today,  a  transitional  period  would have  to  be  provided  for  them  to  collect  the  requisite information issuers  (listed  companies).  A corresponding obligation is also sought to be imposed on issuers. The process flow could take place in two stages, as detailed below :</td>

Shri M. Damodaran, Chairman, SEBI, the Whole Time Members, SEBI and other senior SEBI officials interacted with market participants on the salient features of the <mark>SEBI (Certification of Associated Persons in the Securities Markets) Regulations</mark><mark>associated person</mark>s. All persons engaged in handling investors’ money, investors’ assets, investor complaints, dealing with operational risk, attending to compliance, and persons responsible for management of intermediaries will have to demonstrate minimum proficiency standards in order to maintain their registration with SEBI. The certificate is to be obtained by passing an examination approved by SEBI. The certificate would be valid for three years. Subsequently, such persons would be required to complete an approved programme of Continuing Professional Education to maintain the validity of certificate. SEBI has also permitted grandfathering provisions in these regulations. National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) established by SEBI has been made responsible to coordinate the task of certification in Indian Securities Markets. NISM, in discussion with the market segments, would design the examinations and engage agencies to administer computer based multiple choice tests across the country. In addition, the NISM would put in place a comprehensive continuing professional education framework involving reputed institutions. A significant development in this context would be the maintenance of complete data base of all market participants who have been certified by NISM. This is the first time that such a comprehensive database is being created. SEBI’s new initiative is expected to result in the creation of a large pool of qualified workforce in the Indian Securities Industry and spur a set of new educational programmes catering to the market professionals over a period of time. This initiative is likely to result in a significantly enhanced market quality. Mumbai December 19, 2007</td>

        <td>d) Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  RTS Power Corporation Limited SEBI  received  complaints  from  the brokers  wherein  it  was  mentioned  that the  brokers  suspected  that  trading carried  out  in  the  scrip  of  M/s.  RTS Power  Corporation  Limited  (RTS)  was fraudulent in nature. Upon investigation, 102 SEBI  found  out  that  Mr.  Konde,  Mr. Jadhav,  Mr.  Waje,  Ms.  Hetal  Patel  and Mr. Rajesh Patel prima facie colluded to misuse  the  stock  exchange  mecha<mark>nism</mark><mark>SEBI (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair Trade  Practices  Relating  to  Securities Market) Regulations</mark>, 2003. In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed an  interim  order  dated  June  5,  2009 prohibiting  Mr.  Mukesh  G  Konde,  Mr. Ashok Narayan Waje, Mr. Nitesh Ashok Jadhav, Ms. Hetal Patel, Mr. Rajesh Patel, Mr.  Chetan  Shah,  M/s.  Om  Associates and M/s. Bhavani Trading Company from accessing the securities market and from buying,  selling  or  dealing  in  securities market, directly or indirectly, till further orders and directing BSE to withhold the payout of February 11, 2009 of Ms. Hetal Patel and Mr. Chetan Shah in a separate escrow account, till further orders. Part Three: Regulation of Securities Market e) Interim  Order  in  case  of  M/s.  Alka Securities Ltd. During  the  course  of  preliminary examination during the period November 2008 to March 2009, SEBI observed that the  promoters  of  M/s.  Alka  Securities Ltd. used the off-market route to transfer shares  of  the  company  to  42  entities (1st level entities) and these entities have either  dealt  the  said  shares  in  market or  transferred  to  317  entities  (2nd  level entities)  who  in  turn  had  dealt  in  the said  shares  at  BSE.  The  trading  activity by  the  promoter/company  connected entities  prima-facie  suggests  circular trading  activity  with  an  intention  of creating  the  volume  so  as  to  give  the market  a  false  impression  about  the liquidity  of  the  scrip.  Further,  the company,  its  promoters  and  directors, prima  facie,  appeared  to  have  failed to  provide  mandatory  disclosures  for change in their shareholdings on various occasions  whereas  the  shareholding disclosures made to BSE were incorrect and  apparently  false.  This  activity continued in the period after March 2009. In  view  of  the  above,  SEBI  passed  an interim  order  dated  July  28,  2009  with following directions:- •  The  promoters  of  M/s.  Alka Securities  Limited  viz.  Ms.  Alka M  Pandey,  Mr.  Ravi  Pandey,  Mr. Mahesh  Natvarlal  Kothari,  Ms. Anjuben Kothari, Mr. Brijesh Kothari, Ms.  Dimple  Kothari,  Mr.  Mahendra Pandey and Mayuresh Esatate Agent were  restrained  from  accessing the  securities  market  and  further prohibited  from  buying,  selling, dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner whatsoever, till further orders.</td>

In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience.
