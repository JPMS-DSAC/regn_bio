With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / non-convertible redeemable preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of the wilful defaulters. Any company or its promoter or its director categorized as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to take control over other listed entity. However, if a listed company or its promoter or its director is categorized as wilful defaulter, and there is a take-over offer in respect of the listed company, they may be allowed to make competing offer for the said listed company in accordance with <mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>nism</mark><mark>nism</mark><mark>nism</mark><mark>SEBI (Listing and Other Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>nism</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark>, 2011, the following  proposals may be considered: 1: Framework for protective rights An illustrative list of protective rights which would not amount to acquisition of control may be issued. Grant of such protective rights to an investor may be subject to obtaining the public shareholders’ approval (majority of minority). 2: Adopting a numerical threshold Considering the international practices and the current regulatory environment in India, the definition of control may be amended such that control is defined as (a) the right or entitlement to exercise at least 25% of voting rights of a company irrespective of whether such holding gives de facto control and/or (b) the right to appoint majority of the non-independent directors of a company. Or, any other option as may be decided after consultation. The discussion paper inviting comments will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.</td>

        <td>instruments,  it  is  announced  in  the  Union  Budget  2016-17  that  the  investment  basket  for FPIs  in  corporate  debt  may  be  expanded  to  include  unlisted  debt  securities  and  pass- through  securities  (PTCs) issued  by  securitization  SPVs.  The  Group  reiterates  that appropriate framework may be put in place by RBI taking into account comments received on the draft circular issued in this regard and necessary <mark>amendments may be carried out in FEMA regulations accordingly. 2.2.1.1  Investment  by  FPIs  in  corporate  bond  is  subject  to  overall  limit  prescribed  by  RBI from time to time. The current limit is Rs. 2443.23 billion. Limit monitoring is done through reporting  of  daily  utilisation  of  limits  by  each  FPI  through  their  custodian  banks  to  the depositories (NSDL and CDSL). In view of availability of a robust mechanism for capture of limits utilised by FPIs, FPIs may be permitted to transact in corporate bonds both in the OTC segment  and  in  the  Request  for  Quote  (RFQ)  platform  of  a  recognized  stock  exchange, subject to certain safeguards. This will also enable FPIs to trade directly on electronic trading platforms and thereby help in enhancing liquidity in the corporate bond market. Required changes may be carried out in both FEMA notification and SEBI guidelines to facilitate direct trading by FPIs in corporate bonds without involving brokers. Recommendations 3.  Necessary amendments may be made in FEMA regulation</mark>s to allow investment by FPIs in unlisted  debt  securities  and  pass  through  securities  issued  by  securitizations  SPVs  / 10 Special  Purpose  Distinct  Entity  (SPDE)  as  announced  in  the  Union  Budget  2016-17.

SEBI  (Foreign  Portfolio  Investors)  (Second Amendment)  Regulations, 2017  w.e.f February 27, 2017 Details:  The  <mark>amendment  enables  foreign  portfolio investors  to  invest  in  unlisted  non-convertible debentures and securities’ debt instruments. Rationale: To expand investment avenues for foreign portfolio investors to include unlisted debt securities and securitized debt instruments. t. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) (Amendment)  Regulations, 2016, w.e.f. August 29, 2016 Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  clarifies  that Regulation  5(2)(b)  of  the  SEBI  (Settlement  of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 is not to prohibit settlements with respect to all kinds  of  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices  and that  Regulation  5(2)(c)  disqualifies  only  defaults which are ‘serious’ and have a market-wide impact or cause substantial losses to investors or affect the rights  of  investors  in  securities,  especially  retail investors and small shareholders. The  Regulations  were  formulated  primarily  to settle  minor  and  technical  violations  not  having a wider impact on the market so that enforcement is  concentrated  on  major  and  significant  cases. However, the intention was not to reject settlements with respect to violations pertaining to fraud. Rationale: clarifications were issued vide the amendment. In  order to remove  ambiguity, u. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) (Amendment)  Regulations, 2017 w.e.f February 27, 2017 Details:  The  amendment  inter-alia  provides  for charging interest in case of excessive delays in filing applications  or  payments  of  settlement  amounts;  a settlement notice before issuance of a formal show cause  notice,  except  for  those  which  are  excluded from  settlement;  and  re-application  of  rejected  or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest. Rationale:  These  amendments  are  made  on  the basis of the experience gained and with the purpose of  streamlining  and  strengthening  the  settlement process. v. (Infrastructure SEBI (Amendment)  Regulations, November 30, 2016 Investment  Trusts) 2016  w.e.f. Details: The amendment eases the structuring and offering  requirements  for  InvIT  by  allowing  it  to invest through a two-level SPV structure, reducing the  quantum  of  mandatory  sponsor  holdings, removing the restriction on the number of sponsors and  aligning  the  minimum  public  holding  in  line with  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Rules,  1957 etc.  The  amendment  also  eases  the  process  of registration of InvIT with SEBI by doing away with the requirement of filing the project implementation agreement  at  the  time  of  making  registration application.  The  amendment  also  rationalizes  the requirements for private placement of InvIT and the requirements  for  unit  holder  approval  for  related party  transactions  and  expands  the  definition  of ‘valuer’ under the Regulations. Rationale: To facilitate InvITs’ growth by easing the regulatory framework. 164 SEBI Annual Report 2016-17 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA w.

        <td>Recommendation and rationale: Given  SEBI’s  mandate  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  the  securities  market  and  regulating listed  entities,  the  Committee  recommends  that  SEBI  should  have  clear  powers  to  act  against auditors and other third party fiduciaries with statutory duties under securities law (as defined under SEBI  LODR  Regulations),  subject  to  appropriate  safeguards.  This  power  ought  to  extend  to  act against  the  impugned  individual(s),  as  well  as  against  the  firm  in  question  with  respect  to  their functions  concerning  listed  entities.  This  power  should  be  provided  in  case  of  gross  negligence  as well, and not just in case of fraud/connivance. This recommendation may be implemented after due consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the relevant professional services regulators/ institutions. Dissenting View: The ICAI has expressed its dissent on the above recommendation as the <mark>regulation of  chartered  accountants  is  covered  under  the  Chartered  Accountants  Act,  1949  and  to  avoid jurisdictional conflict and other issues. Proposed amendments to SEBI LODR Regulations: No amendment</mark><mark>nism</mark> for taking  disciplinary  action  against  members  who  are  in  violation  of  obligations  cast  on  such professionals.  Further,  ICAI  Act  permits  ICAI  to  punish  such  a  member  or  levy  a  penalty  on  the member  not  exceeding  Rs.  5  lakh.  It  does  not  permit  ICAI  to  punish or  impose  penalties  on  firms. While  the  Companies  Act  also  has  provisions  for  enhanced  monetary  penalties  on  auditors,  the enforcement  of  the  same  is  through  the  MCA  and  not  the  ICAI,  which  is  the  professional  services regulator. 88 Report of the Committee on Corporate Governance | October 2017 Recommendation and Rationale: The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  reliable  financial  statements  are  at  the  core  of  corporate governance  and  therefore  the  fiduciary  role  of  the  auditor  is  crucial.  Hence  there  needs  to  be sufficient deterrence to ensure this objective in the interest of corporate governance. In this context, the  current  maximum  amount  for  penalty  under  the  ICAI  Act  of  Rs.  5  lakh  is  too  low  to  act  as  a deterrent. Additionally, a need is identified for ICAI to be able to punish or impose penalties on audit firms, in addition to individual members.</td>

Hence  there  needs  to  be sufficient deterrence to ensure this objective in the interest of corporate governance. In this context, the  current  maximum  amount  for  penalty  under  the  ICAI  Act  of  Rs.  5  lakh  is  too  low  to  act  as  a deterrent.

        <td>Recommendation and rationale: Given  SEBI’s  mandate  to  protect  the  interests  of  investors  in  the  securities  market  and  regulating listed  entities,  the  Committee  recommends  that  SEBI  should  have  clear  powers  to  act  against auditors and other third party fiduciaries with statutory duties under securities law (as defined under SEBI  LODR  Regulations),  subject  to  appropriate  safeguards.  This  power  ought  to  extend  to  act against  the  impugned  individual(s),  as  well  as  against  the  firm  in  question  with  respect  to  their functions  concerning  listed  entities.  This  power  should  be  provided  in  case  of  gross  negligence  as well, and not just in case of fraud/connivance.
