        <td>It is a pleasure for me to be here today to inaugurate this new campus. This is a time of slowdown in the global economy. Developed countries and emerging markets are both facing slow growth. Against this background, India is being seen as a bright spot. Growth is projected to remain among the highest in the world.  India’s place as the fastest growing large economy has not come about by accident. To see how far we have travelled, we should look back to 2012-13. The fiscal deficit had reached alarming levels. The currency was falling sharply. Inflation was high. The current account deficit was rising. Confidence was low and foreign investors were turning away from India. India was considered the weakest of the BRICS nations. In less than 3 years, this government has transformed the economy. We have cut the fiscal deficit target every year and also achieved it every year. The current account deficit is low. Even after the redemption of loans taken under the special currency swap in 2013, foreign exchange reserves are high. Inflation is low, running at less than 4 per cent compared to double digit inflation under the previous government. Public investment has increased largely, even while the overall fiscal deficit has been cut. A new monetary policy framework has been introduced by law with an inflation target. The Constitutional Amendment on Goods and Services Tax had remained pending for years. It has been passed and the long awaited GST will soon be a reality. We have made progress on improving the ease of doing business. As a result of all these policies, Foreign Direct Investment has reached record levels. By claiming that demonetisation has stopped a fast moving car, our critics too have acknowledged the speed of our progress. Let me make one thing very clear: This Government will continue to follow sound and prudent economic policies, to ensure that India has a bright future in the long run. We will not take decisions for short term political point scoring. We will not shy away from taking difficult decisions, if those decisions are in the interest of the country. Demonetisation is an example. It has short term pain but will bring long term gain. Financial markets can play an important role in the modern economy. They help in mobilizing savings. They channel the savings towards productive investments. However, history has shown that financial markets can also do damage, if not properly regulated. It is to ensure good regulation that the Securities and Exchange Board of India, - SEBI - was established by the Government. SEBI also has a role to promote the development of healthy securities markets. Recently, the Forward Markets Commission has been abolished. SEBI has been given the task of regulating commodity derivatives also. This is a big challenge. In the commodity markets, the spot market is not regulated by SEBI. Agricultural markets are regulated by states. And many commodities are purchased directly by the poor and the needy, not by investors. Hence the economic and social impact of commodity derivatives is more sensitive. For financial markets to function successfully, <mark>participants</mark><mark>participants</mark><mark>depositories</mark><mark>participants</mark> to the exchequer. We should consider methods for increasing it in a fair, efficient and transparent way. Earlier, there was a feeling that some investors were getting an unfair deal by using certain tax treaties. As you know, those treaties have been amended by this government. Now it is time to re-think and come up with a good design which is simple and transparent, but also fair and progressive. Friends. I know that financial markets attach a lot of importance to the budget. The budget cycle has an effect on the real economy. In our existing budget calendar, the authorization of expenditure comes with the onset of the monsoon. Government programmes are not active in the productive pre-monsoon months. Hence, this year, we are advancing the date of the budget so that expenditure is authorized by the time the new financial year begins. This will improve productivity and output. Friends. My aim is to make India a developed country in one generation. India cannot become a developed country without world class securities and commodity markets. Therefore, I look forward to a growing contribution from all of you in making the financial markets more relevant to this new era. I wish the NISM all success. I also wish everybody a merry Christmas and a very happy new year. *** </td>

This will improve productivity and output. Friends. My aim is to make India a developed country in one generation. India cannot become a developed country without world class securities and commodity markets. Therefore, I look forward to a growing contribution from all of you in making the financial markets more relevant to this new era. I wish the NISM all success. I also wish everybody a merry Christmas and a very happy new year. *** </td>

Such schemes shall be filed with stock exchanges for the limited purpose of disclosures only. V. Empowerment of Stock Exchanges for effective <mark>regulation of Listed Entities  1. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges. However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities.  VI. SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 to provide for a criteria alternative to "Net Worth" for municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations The SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 (ILDM) provides that a municipality or a Corporate Municipal Entity (CME) making public issue of debt securities, under these regulations shall not have negative net worth in any of three immediately preceding financial years.  In order to facilitate issuance of debt securities under these regulations by entities other than CME, the Board agreed that the Municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations shall have surplus as per its Income and Expenditure Statement, in any of the three immediately preceding financial years or any other financial criteria as specified by SEBI from time to time.  VII. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 On the basis of experience gained and with the purpose of streamlining and strengthening the settlement process, Board approved amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014.  The amendment</mark><mark>participants</mark> to make payments to SEBI through digital mode (such as NEFT/RTGS) as well. </td>

        <td>                                                                                 SEBI Board MeetingThe SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following decisions:1.  Instant Access Facility (IAF) in Mutual Funds and use of e-wallet for investment in Mutual FundsWith an objective to channelize households’ savings into capital market and to promote digitalization in mutual funds, SEBI Board after deliberation has decided the following:a) Mutual Funds / Asset Management Companies (AMCs) can offer instant access facility (through online mode) of upto INR 50,000 or 90% of folio value, whichever is lower, to resident individual investors in liquid schemes by applying lower of Previous Day NAV or Prospective NAV. For providing such facility AMCs would not be allowed to borrow. Liquidity is to be provided out of the available funds from the scheme and AMCs to put in place a mechanism to meet the liquidity demands. This facility can also be used for investment in mutual funds through tie-ups with Payments Banks provided necessary approvals are taken from RBI. Presently, any scheme providing this facility would reduce the limit to INR 50,000, immediately and other than liquid schemes providing this facility would completely stop this facility within one month from the date of circular.b) Investment of upto INR 50,000 per Mutual Fund per financial year can be made using e-wallets. However, redemptions of such investments can be made only to a bank account of the unit holder. E-wallet issuers must not offer any incentive such as cash back etc., directly or indirectly for investing in mutual fund scheme through them. E-wallet’s balance loaded through cash or debit card or net banking, can only be used for subscription to mutual funds schemes and balance loaded through credit card, cash back, promotional scheme etc. should not be allowed for subscription to MF schemes. Further, this limit of INR 50,000 would be an umbrella limit for investment by an investor through e-wallet and/or cash, per mutual fund per financial year.2. Amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012While presenting the Union Budget for the FY 2016-2017, the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister,  made an announcement for permitting new derivative products in the commodity derivatives market. In pursuance thereof, SEBI vide circular dated September 28, 2016, permitted launch of 'options' in commodity derivatives market. In this regard, to enable the Commodity Derivatives Exchanges to organize trading of ‘options', the Board, after undertaking due public consultation process, has approved a proposal to amend the relevant provisions of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012. Detailed guidelines for trading in 'option' on commodity derivatives exchanges will be issued by SEBI.3. Inclusion of RBI registered systemically important NBFCs in the category of QIBsPresently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI. They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for the FY 2017-18, proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs since it would strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for inclusion of systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI having a net worth of more than Rs. 500 crore in the category of QIBs. As NBFCs are well regulated entities, classifying such NBFCs under the definition of QIBs will give Issuers access to a larger pool of funds.4.

Amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012While presenting the Union Budget for the FY 2016-2017, the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister,  made an announcement for permitting new derivative products in the commodity derivatives market. In pursuance thereof, SEBI vide circular dated September 28, 2016, permitted launch of 'options' in commodity derivatives market. In this regard, to enable the Commodity Derivatives Exchanges to organize trading of ‘options', the Board, after undertaking due public consultation process, has approved a proposal to amend the relevant provisions of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012. Detailed guidelines for trading in 'option' on commodity derivatives exchanges will be issued by SEBI.3. Inclusion of RBI registered systemically important NBFCs in the category of QIBsPresently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI. They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for the FY 2017-18, proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs since it would strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.Accordingly, the Board considered and approved the proposal for inclusion of systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI having a net worth of more than Rs. 500 crore in the category of QIBs. As NBFCs are well regulated entities, classifying such NBFCs under the definition of QIBs will give Issuers access to a larger pool of funds.4.
