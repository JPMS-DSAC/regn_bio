        <td>Mar 12, 2016 PR No.: 56/2016 The SEBI Board met in New Delhi today and took the following decisions: A.        Imposing restrictions on wilful defaulters The Master Circular on "Wilful Defaulters" issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time lays down safeguards to be exercised by banks to contain the financial activities of a wilful defaulter. With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / non-convertible redeemable preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of the wilful defaulters. Any company or its promoter or its director categorized as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to take control over other listed entity. However, if a listed company or its promoter or its director is categorized as wilful defaulter, and there is a take-over offer in respect of the listed company, they may be allowed to make competing offer for the said listed company in accordance with <mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>participants</mark><mark>SEBI (Listing and Other Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (SAST) Regulations</mark>, 2011, the following  proposals may be considered: 1: Framework for protective rights An illustrative list of protective rights which would not amount to acquisition of control may be issued. Grant of such protective rights to an investor may be subject to obtaining the public shareholders’ approval (majority of minority). 2: Adopting a numerical threshold Considering the international practices and the current regulatory environment in India, the definition of control may be amended such that control is defined as (a) the right or entitlement to exercise at least 25% of voting rights of a company irrespective of whether such holding gives de facto control and/or (b) the right to appoint majority of the non-independent directors of a company. Or, any other option as may be decided after consultation. The discussion paper inviting comments will be placed on SEBI website for seeking public comments.</td>

        <td>instruments,  it  is  announced  in  the  Union  Budget  2016-17  that  the  investment  basket  for FPIs  in  corporate  debt  may  be  expanded  to  include  unlisted  debt  securities  and  pass- through  securities  (PTCs) issued  by  securitization  SPVs.  The  Group  reiterates  that appropriate framework may be put in place by RBI taking into account comments received on the draft circular issued in this regard and necessary <mark>amendments may be carried out in FEMA regulations accordingly. 2.2.1.1  Investment  by  FPIs  in  corporate  bond  is  subject  to  overall  limit  prescribed  by  RBI from time to time. The current limit is Rs. 2443.23 billion. Limit monitoring is done through reporting  of  daily  utilisation  of  limits  by  each  FPI  through  their  custodian  banks  to  the depositories (NSDL and CDSL). In view of availability of a robust mechanism for capture of limits utilised by FPIs, FPIs may be permitted to transact in corporate bonds both in the OTC segment  and  in  the  Request  for  Quote  (RFQ)  platform  of  a  recognized  stock  exchange, subject to certain safeguards. This will also enable FPIs to trade directly on electronic trading platforms and thereby help in enhancing liquidity in the corporate bond market. Required changes may be carried out in both FEMA notification and SEBI guidelines to facilitate direct trading by FPIs in corporate bonds without involving brokers. Recommendations 3.  Necessary amendments may be made in FEMA regulation</mark>s to allow investment by FPIs in unlisted  debt  securities  and  pass  through  securities  issued  by  securitizations  SPVs  / 10 Special  Purpose  Distinct  Entity  (SPDE)  as  announced  in  the  Union  Budget  2016-17.

        <td>instruments,  it  is  announced  in  the  Union  Budget  2016-17  that  the  investment  basket  for FPIs  in  corporate  debt  may  be  expanded  to  include  unlisted  debt  securities  and  pass- through  securities  (PTCs) issued  by  securitization  SPVs.  The  Group  reiterates  that appropriate framework may be put in place by RBI taking into account comments received on the draft circular issued in this regard and necessary <mark>amendments may be carried out in FEMA regulations accordingly. 2.2.1.1  Investment  by  FPIs  in  corporate  bond  is  subject  to  overall  limit  prescribed  by  RBI from time to time. The current limit is Rs. 2443.23 billion. Limit monitoring is done through reporting  of  daily  utilisation  of  limits  by  each  FPI  through  their  custodian  banks  to  the depositories (NSDL and CDSL). In view of availability of a robust mechanism for capture of limits utilised by FPIs, FPIs may be permitted to transact in corporate bonds both in the OTC segment  and  in  the  Request  for  Quote  (RFQ)  platform  of  a  recognized  stock  exchange, subject to certain safeguards. This will also enable FPIs to trade directly on electronic trading platforms and thereby help in enhancing liquidity in the corporate bond market. Required changes may be carried out in both FEMA notification and SEBI guidelines to facilitate direct trading by FPIs in corporate bonds without involving brokers. Recommendations 3.  Necessary amendments may be made in FEMA regulation</mark>s to allow investment by FPIs in unlisted  debt  securities  and  pass  through  securities  issued  by  securitizations  SPVs  / 10 Special  Purpose  Distinct  Entity  (SPDE)  as  announced  in  the  Union  Budget  2016-17. Necessary notification, in this regard, may be issued by RBI by end August 2016. (Action: RBI)</td>

        <td>Dear Sir / Madam, Sub: Revised Warehousing Norms in the Commodity Derivatives Market for Agricultural and Agri-processed Commodities Traded on the National Commodity Derivatives Exchanges 1.  Warehousing infrastructure and its ancillary services play a  critical role in the delivery mechanism of the Commodity Derivatives Market. A robust & credible warehousing  infrastructure  is  sine  qua  non  for  an  effective  Commodity Derivatives Market that can inspire confidence amongst the market <mark>participants</mark> and  other  stake  holders.  At  the  time  of  the  merger  of  Forward  Market Commission  (FMC)  with  SEBI,  with  a  view  to  ensuring  good  delivery  of commodities  on  expiry  of  the  futures  contract,  SEBI  decided  to  fasten  the responsibility of settlement of the futures contact, including good delivery on the commodity derivatives exchanges. With this objective necessary amendments were  carried  out  by  inserting  Regulation  44D(2)  in  Securities  Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 ("SECC  Regulations"),    by  providing  that  every  commodity  derivatives exchange (in short, exchange) shall ensure guarantee for settlement of trades including good delivery. 2.  It is therefore, incumbent upon the commodity derivatives exchanges to  have in place comprehensive framework of norms for adherence by the Warehouse Service  Providers  (WSP),  warehouse,  assayers  and  other  allied  service providers engaged by them so as to exercise a robust mechanism, for ensuring good delivery as mandated under the SECC Regulations. In order to facilitate good delivery by the commodity derivatives exchanges by providing therein with a  set  of  minimum  standards  and  norms  for  compliance  by  the  accredited warehouses, the existing norms for exchange accredited WSPs, warehouses and assayers have been reviewed.</td>
