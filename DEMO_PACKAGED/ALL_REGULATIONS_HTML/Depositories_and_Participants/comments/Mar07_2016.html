Market participants may be permitted to use electronic contract notes subject to them carrying the same details as a physical contract note. Also, the new ECN may include features/fields for Form  A  and  Form  B  type  of  contract  notes  to  differentiate  between  client  and  proprietary trades. The Committee is aware that under the current scenario there is a lack of adequate Certifying Agencies (CA) to digitally certify contract notes. However, as implementation of STP gets underway, we expect the market to come up with more CAs. An observation made here was that there were a few international players having the expertise of generating contract notes in electronic form. However, these ECNs were certified by CAs not registered in India. In this regard, a reference may also be made to the government to grant legal recognition to ECNs certified by an overseas CA as existing players related to capital market are global and do  not  have  an  existence  in  India.  The  Committee  has  listed  in  Annexure  III  the  various rules and regulation</mark>s as well as other statutes that require amendment. The Committee is of the  opinion  that  SEBI  should  take  steps  to  make  a  reference  to  the  respective  legislative authorities so that amendments, if any required, may be done at the earliest. The members of the committee were of the view that Stamp-duty payable on Contracts may need to be waived as a result of the conversion of the Contract Notes to Electronic form. This matter  comes  under  the  purview  of  respective  State  Governments  in  which  the  contract  is executed / initiated. Keeping in view the fact that issuance and maintenance of contract notes in  electronic  form  requires  a  considerable  one  time  and  recurring  investment,  imposition  of stamp duty would push up the transaction cost which is not desirable and may defeat the very purpose of introducing STP. SEBI may, therefore, consider writing to all State Governments for relaxing this Stamp-duty so as to reduce the transaction cost.</td>

SEBI has been reviewing the existing book building guideline on an ongoing basis, to make price discovery process more realistic, immune from artificial demand and more responsive to the  market demand. The companies have now been given a flexibility of indicating a  movable price band or a fixed floor price in Red Herring prospectus, definition of QIBs has been enlarged to include Insurance companies, Provident and Pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores. Further operational guidelines are amended thus shortening the interregnum between the closure of issue and listing/ trading of securities to T+6 ( T stands for date of closure of issue)   Details of the amendments carried out at relevant places in SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000, are given under this section in the Annexure.     Section C   Introduction of Green Shoe Option Green Shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue.

        <td>"This is a key component in devising a regulatory system which is both effective in pursuit of its objectives, and also which wins the respect and perhaps even the approval of the regulated community", Sir Davies said. Skilled regulatory resources are scarce anywhere, and particularly in developing countries. It is therefore absolutely crucial that those resources are deployed where they can make most impact, and where the need is greatest. Stressing the need for international regulatory cooperation, Sir Davies said that "it is no longer adequate for a regulator in any country to focus on domestic standards only. Any regulator must ensure that its practices are compatible with internationally agreed codes." The Governor of Maharashtra, His Excellency Shri Mohammed Fazal, said that "the role of SEBI is of prime importance to safeguard the interests of the common investor who is totally ignorant about the business environment and global trends and hence cannot assess the future of the industries". Appreciating the "metamorphosis from physical to electronic transactions", as a "welcome development", the Governor said that "this is a healthy step towards gaining the confidence of small investors for which SEBI needs to be congratulated". Tracing the growth of the securities market in India in general and SEBI in particular, Chairman, SEBI, Shri G.N. Bajpai said that "we need <mark>regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures". Explaining further on the need for regulation, Shri Bajpai said "regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combined the elements of regulation and development. ." On liberalization versus regulation, the Chairman said that " there is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalization does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. ". "Reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI", Shri Bajpai said. "These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated", he added. Shri Bajpai also highlighted the reforms in the securities market in India viz. the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992 and issuance of Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines by SEBI, thereby the market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation, establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities and introduction of nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS). "A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the participants are safe and market integrity is protected", Shri Bajpai said and gave examples of Reduction of Trading Cycle to T+2, dematerialization of stocks, introduction of derivatives, establishment of Settlement Guarantee Fund, setting up of the Central Listing Authority etc. On the future initiatives of SEBI, Shri Bajpai spoke about the setting up of a national institute to build a cadre of professionals to man the specialized functions in the securities market, corporatisation and demutualization of exchanges, introduction if market wide straight through processing from trade initiation to settlement, migration to T+1 rolling settlement, continuous review and upgradation of accounting standards, disclosures, corporate governance practices in the interest of investors, continuous review and amendment</mark><mark>participants</mark><mark>participants</mark>, while protecting investors in securities. The aim is to make Indian securities market a model for other jurisdictions to follow and make SEBI the most dynamic and respected regulator globally."</td>

As agreed, in the meeting with stock exchanges, depositories, market participants and RBI held on March 24, 2003 to take stock of the preparedness of the exchanges, depositories and the market participants in implementing the T+2 rolling settlement, it has been decided that the exchanges would generate a unique code for Mutual Funds and each scheme of a Mutual Fund, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their sub-accounts. As this would require the exchanges to put in place adequate systems and carry out software changes the exchanges are provided with three months time to implement the system. Till such time the present practice of putting client IDs at the time of order entry in case of FIIs and mutual funds shall continue. The exchanges are directed to make necessary amendment</mark>s to the bye-laws, rules and regulations for the implementation of the above decision immediately.

SEBI has observed the following relating to the Aastha and the nature of its conduct in the context of the preferential allotment made by it: “Aastha has in a clever subterfuge, put in place a chain of entities for engineering a web of transfers and retransfers among them in a bid to create a make-believe of fund-rolling the preferential allotment, when there was actually no infusion of funds for the large part of the allotment.” “The entire exercise of circulating the same funds to impart a seeming verisimilitude to otherwise a process of punk financial engineering is part of colorable devise and “it will be difficult for judicial process to accord its approval to it”.” “Aastha is one such case wherein an irregular preferential allotment was noticed. But for the freezing of shares issued vide preferential allotment by an order of SEBI, there was every possibility of the same to have been off-loaded into the market, further contaminating it.” The full text of the above order is available on the website: www.sebi.gov.in Mumbai September 09, 2005</td>

Further, the dealings by DKM as an unregistered sub-broker is prima facie in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of SEBI (Stockbroker and Sub Brokers) Rules, 1992. Furthermore, even GFPL was not registered with SEBI as a sub-broker and was thus acting as unregistered sub-broker in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Rule 3 of SEBI (Stockbrokers and Sub brokers) Rules, 1992. Apart from the above, brokers SAM Global Securities Ltd. and SMC Securities Ltd. have also prima facie violated SEBI circular SMDRP/Policy/Cir/49/2001 dated 22.10.01 by giving trading terminals at places other than registered office, branch office or registered sub-broker offices. It was prima facie seen that SMC/SAM has installed their terminals at various places in and around Sri Ganganagar (including Abohar). SMC/ SAM have a franchise agreement with GFPL, specifically for Sri Ganganagar location and their terminals at other places were also being managed by GFPL . Under the facts and circumstances as stated above, it is therefore incumbent upon the regulator to take emergent and remedial steps to safeguard the interests of the investors and the orderly development of the securities market.

It is now proposed to do away with the repetitive disclosures in case of rights issues and FPOs by companies which have a satisfactory track record of filing disclosures with the stock exchanges, of redressing investors’ grievances etc. Common platform for electronic filing and dissemination of corporate information: In terms of the listing agreement, listed companies are required to disclose corporate information to the stock exchanges where they are listed and also on EDIFAR, a electronic filing platform currently maintained by SEBI. This results in multiple disclosures/filings for the companies that are listed on more than one exchange. SEBI, in consultation with NSE and BSE, is in the process of brining a common electronic platform maintained / run by Stock Exchanges. A listed company would be required to file only on this platform for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of listing agreement. The proposed platform would introduce single window filing and would also serve as a one stop shop for corporate information of listed companies. Introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Funds in India: Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his speech presenting the Budget 2005-06 had announced the introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Fund (GETF) in India and creation of a market for such units. Consequent upon the announcement by the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Chairman, SEBI constituted a committee to look into all aspects of facilitating the setting up of GETF in India. After considering various issues involved in the matter, the Committee recommended that the GETF may be implemented in India based on two models- (i) Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model and (ii) Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt Model. The two models are briefly as follows:- Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model- In this model, the physical gold is held by a custodian bank on behalf of the Mutual Fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt model- In this model, gold warehouse receipts are held by a custodian bank on behalf of the mutual fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold warehouse receipts with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Amendment to Takeover Regulations : SEBI Board in its meeting held today approved amendment to SEBI Takeover Regulation. The amendments would provide required flexibility to corporate restructuring. At the same time, to ensure the maintenance of minimum public shareholding for continuous listing it has been decided that if in the process of corporatre restructuring under Takeover Regulations the target company’s public shareholding falls below the prescribed minimum, the restoration of minimum public shareholding will take place through framework provided in the revised Clause 40A of Listing Agreement. Among other things, restrictions on market purchases, preferential allotments as in the Takeover Regulations have been removed. It has also been provided that the outgoing shareholder (promoter) can sell entire stake to incoming acquirer in case of takeover. Further, shareholders holding more than 55% would be able to make further acquisitions subject to making open offer. Amendment to <mark>SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its Board meeting held today has approved amendment to SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark>, 2003 (MAPIN), after considering the recommendations of the Committee set up by SEBI to examine the issues related to MAPIN. The registration process will be resumed in a phased manner. To begin with, the cut off limit for obtaining UIN with biometric impressions for natural persons has been raised from the existing limit of trade order value of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.5.00 lakh or more. The limit will be reduced progressively. Agencies capable of providing such facilities in a cost effective manner will be assigned the responsibility of maintaining the databases. For trade order value of less than Rs.5.00 lakh, option will be available to investors to obtain either the Permanent Account Number of Income Tax Department or UIN obtained under MAPIN. Investors in mutual funds would be exempted from the requirement of obtaining UIN. The definition of promoter, which is a body corporate would be limited, to immediate holding company of the Indian entity and any of the subsidiaries, if located in India. Listed company or a company which intends to get its securities listed, along with their promoters, directors, officers and designated employees would be required to obtain UIN. These changes will be implemented after the necessary amendments are made to the MAPIN Regulations Note : The aforesaid are policy announcements based on decisions of the Board and do not reflect change in the existing legal framework until the relevant amendments are effected through issue of circulars.

It has also been provided that the outgoing shareholder (promoter) can sell entire stake to incoming acquirer in case of takeover. Further, shareholders holding more than 55% would be able to make further acquisitions subject to making open offer. Amendment to <mark>SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its Board meeting held today has approved amendment to SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark>, 2003 (MAPIN), after considering the recommendations of the Committee set up by SEBI to examine the issues related to MAPIN. The registration process will be resumed in a phased manner. To begin with, the cut off limit for obtaining UIN with biometric impressions for natural persons has been raised from the existing limit of trade order value of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.5.00 lakh or more. The limit will be reduced progressively. Agencies capable of providing such facilities in a cost effective manner will be assigned the responsibility of maintaining the databases. For trade order value of less than Rs.5.00 lakh, option will be available to investors to obtain either the Permanent Account Number of Income Tax Department or UIN obtained under MAPIN. Investors in mutual funds would be exempted from the requirement of obtaining UIN. The definition of promoter, which is a body corporate would be limited, to immediate holding company of the Indian entity and any of the subsidiaries, if located in India. Listed company or a company which intends to get its securities listed, along with their promoters, directors, officers and designated employees would be required to obtain UIN. These changes will be implemented after the necessary amendments are made to the MAPIN Regulations Note : The aforesaid are policy announcements based on decisions of the Board and do not reflect change in the existing legal framework until the relevant amendments are effected through issue of circulars.

        <td>Though the various parties involved in the different stages of the entire chain of events might claim their part as genuine, the same cannot be countenanced at this juncture of the proceedings, where the materiality of circumstances and the manner in which the entire modus operandi was executed have the ingredients of a manipulative assemblage to scupper the process of IPO allotment. It appears that unfair gain has been made by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani, Manojdev Seksaria and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Purshottam Budhwani would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants. The entire gameplan, craftily designed, masterminded and executed by a coterie of operators acting in concert, in a tout ensemble through the mechanism of front entities of name-lenders seeking to impart a veneer of acceptability to a deal which is otherwise sham in an agonistic aggression in the market through predatory cornering is a clear abuse of the very process of IPO, meant to shore up the participation of retail investors. What is equally reprehensible is the unjust enrichment by a few masquerading in the retail category at the cost of genuine retail investors, who have been crowded out by the "hyperplasia" engineered and induced by the machinations of a few to monopolise the retail segment through colorable devices and make-believe arrangements. The entire gamut of elaborate game-plan of queering the pitch in the market is driven by base cupidity to wangle a patently unfair gain. Further probe is required for examining the systemic fault, if any, of the registrar Karvy-RTI i.e. Karvy Computer Shares P Ltd. and the lead managers Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd., DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. in identifying and weeding out the benami applications.

        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a recognised stock exchange. iii.      The corpus of any stock exchange is made up of (1) the contribution of the members, (2) the income of the exchange, and (3) the fiscal incentives which had helped the accumulation of reserves. In addition, it may include an adventitious factor by way of appreciation in the value of the assets over a period of time. The net worth of the exchange after revaluation of the assets and liabilities based on market value could be apportioned on the basis of the three components of the corpus mentioned above. The share relating to the members’ contribution should be made available to the members. The balance will be transferred to an escrow account and then to a fund earmarked for the purpose of investor protection managed by SEBI. This scheme will need a proper methodology for valuation of the assets and liabilities as well as for determining the proportion mentioned above and should be carried out by an independent entity. A Task Force may be constituted by SEBI comprising a chartered accountant, an approved valuer and a representative of SEBI for the purpose. iv.     In the absence of any specific provision for distribution of assets, no RSE would seek a voluntary exit option and one would have to live with a situation in which RSEs would continue to exist nearly in perpetuity and continue to remain a burden on the investor and the regulatory system. v.       The entity which remains after withdrawal of recognition must immediately change its name and style and cannot continue in any business as a stock exchange. In case a stock exchange whose recognition is withdrawn has a subsidiary, such an entity would also have to change its name and style to avoid any representation of any present or past affiliation with an exchange. It would be upto the subsidiary to carry on broking operations as any other broking entity registered with SEBI subject to the same rights and duties. vi.     The impact, on account of withdrawal of recognition either on request or on compulsory direction, on the companies exclusively listed on the RSEs and their shareholders would also need to be suitably addressed. An analysis of the compliance status of these companies indicates that only about 500 companies are compliant with the continuous listing requirements. It is felt that such compliant companies, in an exchange which will no longer remain recognized, should be allowed to migrate to any other exchange with minimum procedure and hassle to the company. SEBI can prescribe that files of such compliant companies be moved inter-exchange with minimum burden on such companies. vii.    Before seeking voluntary withdrawal of recognition, the RSEs would have to compulsorily delist all non-compliant companies. viii.  In the event of some of the remaining RSEs which have already been corporatised and are unable to demutualise within the stipulated time such RSEs will also attract the consequences of withdrawal of recognition under sec. 5(2) of the SCRA and their recognition will be compulsorily withdrawn and accordingly, they would have recourse to the same mechanism of asset distribution as recommended supra. ix.     All the RSEs whose recognition has not been withdrawn either voluntarily or compulsorily must collectively choose (in order for it to succeed) either the BSE model or in the alternative, the Inter-Connected Stock Exchange (ICSE) model. The Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges (FISE) will have to take the initiative of evolving a consensus amongst the RSEs. In order that the Public Representative (PR) Directors are able to discharge their responsibilities, it is important that they are conversant with the governance of the RSEs, have a reasonable knowledge of the securities market and are aware of their own functions as PR Directors.  SEBI should work out an appropriate training programme for the PR Directors. x.       In case of both of these models (i.e. proposals of BSE and ICSE) fail for whatever reasons, there would be no merit in the continuation of the RSEs and the recognition of all the RSEs will, therefore, have to be compulsorily withdrawn. Once the RSEs have chosen a particular model, such of the RSEs which are unwilling to accept that model will have to face compulsory withdrawal of recognition in the future as they provide neither a trading platform nor serve any public interest. xi.     The future of the subsidiaries is inter-linked with the survival of their parent RSEs. In case a stock exchange whose recognition is withdrawn has a subsidiary, such an entity would also have to change its name and style to avoid any representation of any present or past affiliation with an exchange. It would be upto the subsidiary to carry on broking operations as any other broking entity registered with SEBI. The subsidiaries’ demand of level playing field could then easily be recommended as they become brokers (or other registered financial intermediaries) simplicitor. This would necessitate the NSE to modify suitably its norms relating to dominant holdings in the case of these entities. SEBI should consider extending turnover fee continuity benefit to such entities. xii.    In case of the subsidiaries of the RSEs whose recognition is not withdrawn, the RSEs should preferably cease to have any shareholding in the subsidiary within a period of three years. However, the RSEs may be allowed to retain less than 15% of the shareholding in the spun-off entity. xiii.  Any entity other than exchange, multilateral agency, insurance company, bank, <mark>depository</mark><mark>depository</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in.

To this end, several investor protection measures and regulatory reforms have been initiated by SEBI from time to time for the benefit of investors and to make the Indian securities market a more transparent and safer place for their investments. 2.      In the recent past, SEBI has been receiving representations from various investors requesting for a direct and quicker forum for enabling them to register their complaints expeditiously with the intermediaries/listed companies/stock exchanges. It has also been observed in several cases that pursuant to registering a complaint, the investors do not have any mode for a follow-up or monitoring the processing of their complaints. 3.      In order to address the aforesaid representations, it is felt desirable to designate an exclusive e-mail ID of the grievance redressel division / compliance officer in which the investors would be able to register their complaints and also take necessary follow-up actions as necessary. Such a process would not only expedite the redressal of the complaints of the investors but also enable several investors across the country to register their complaints through a single, centralized, exclusive e-mail ID that is designated for the purpose. 4.      Accordingly, all the stock exchanges/registered brokers/registered sub- brokers/listed companies/<mark>depositories</mark><mark>depository</mark><mark>participants</mark><mark>amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulation</mark><mark>depositories</mark><mark>depositories</mark> and also to disseminate the same on their websites; 6.2 include the details of the e-mail ID in the advertisement campaigns released by them from time to time for better understanding of the investors; 6.3 make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws and business rules for the implementation of the above decision immediately, as may be applicable/necessary; and 6.4 communicate to SEBI, the status of the implementation of the provisions of this circular in the Monthly Development Report 7.      This circular is being issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 11 (1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.</td>

        <td>Considering the important role played by Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) in fulfilling the social objective of increased home ownership and supporting the economy by creating demand for construction of new homes, it has been decided that an additional exposure to financial services sector (over and above the existing 30%) not exceeding 10% of the net assets of the scheme in debt oriented mutual fund schemes will be allowed by way of increase in exposure to HFCs only, subject to the condition that such securities issued by HFCs are rated AA and above and these HFCs are registered with National Housing Bank (NHB). However, the total investment in HFCs cannot exceed 30% of the net assets of the scheme. II.          Review of the Debt Limit Allocation Mechanism for FIIs Regarding the review of the debt limit allocation mechanism for FIIs, the Board took note of the following: (i)    With effect from January 01, 2014, the FIIs shall be allowed to re-invest during the calendar year to the extent of 50% of their debt holdings at the end of the previous calendar year. (ii)  The utilization period for Government Debt and Corporate Debt limits will be reduced to 30 days and 60 days respectively. (iii)  In the FII Debt limit, the unutilised limit in respect of Corporate Debt infra long term bonds category may be availed by the FIIs/Sub Accounts without obtaining prior SEBI approval till the overall FII investments reaches 90% of the limit, after which the auction mechanism shall be initiated for allocation of remaining limits. III.          Suggestions to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for Foreign Portfolio   Investments such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. With a view to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for foreign portfolio investments, SEBI will prepare a draft guideline based on the guidance of the Working Group on Foreign Investment in India (WGFII), for consideration of the Government so that uniform guidelines are made for various categories of investors such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. IV.          Expansion of asset classes which can be held in <mark>demat</mark><mark>demat</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>depositories</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>depository</mark><mark>participants</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>demat</mark>erialization of shares, maintaining proper records etc. It has been seen in the past that there are instances of non compliance such as lack of reconciliation of issued or listed capital and actual share capital by the Issuer company and its appointed RTA. (ii) In order to enable appropriate action by SEBI in such cases (currently possible under the Depositories Act), the Board approved proposal to suitably amend the D&P Regulations to enable SEBI to take appropriate action against non-compliant issuers or their agents under the D&P Regulations and to empower Depositories to take appropriate action against such issuer or agent as per their Bye-laws.</td>

In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required.

However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience.

        <td>IV. Expanding the framework of Offer for Sale (OFS) of shares through stock exchange mechanism In order to encourage retail participation in OFS, to enable all large shareholders including non-promoter shareholders to use the OFS mechanism and also to expand the universe of companies to whom OFS mechanism is available, presently being 100 top companies only, the Board has approved the following modifications to the existing OFS mechanism: (1)  Reservation for retail individual investors (i)  Minimum 10% of the issue size shall be reserved for retail investors i.e. for the investors bidding for amounts less than Rs. two lakhs. In case this percentage is not fully utilized, the unutilized portion may be offered to other investors. (ii)  Seller of shares may offer a discount to retail investors in accordance with the framework specified from time to time. (2) Allowing non-promoter shareholders to offer shares through OFS Non-promoter shareholders having (shareholding) more thatn 10% or such percentage as specified by SEBI from time to time shall be eligible to use OFS. (3)  Expanding the list of eligible companies OFS mechanism shall be made available for shareholders of top 200 companies by market capitalization. V.   Common KYC in Financial Sector The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors. Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the <mark>amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector. This will  not only reduce the paper-work and bring down cost of operations for the investors as well as for the intermediaries, but will also save the investors from the hassle of getting KYC done again by the intermediaries regulated by other financial sector regulators.

        <td>IV. Expanding the framework of Offer for Sale (OFS) of shares through stock exchange mechanism In order to encourage retail participation in OFS, to enable all large shareholders including non-promoter shareholders to use the OFS mechanism and also to expand the universe of companies to whom OFS mechanism is available, presently being 100 top companies only, the Board has approved the following modifications to the existing OFS mechanism: (1)  Reservation for retail individual investors (i)  Minimum 10% of the issue size shall be reserved for retail investors i.e. for the investors bidding for amounts less than Rs. two lakhs. In case this percentage is not fully utilized, the unutilized portion may be offered to other investors. (ii)  Seller of shares may offer a discount to retail investors in accordance with the framework specified from time to time. (2) Allowing non-promoter shareholders to offer shares through OFS Non-promoter shareholders having (shareholding) more thatn 10% or such percentage as specified by SEBI from time to time shall be eligible to use OFS. (3)  Expanding the list of eligible companies OFS mechanism shall be made available for shareholders of top 200 companies by market capitalization. V.   Common KYC in Financial Sector The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors. Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the <mark>amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector. This will  not only reduce the paper-work and bring down cost of operations for the investors as well as for the intermediaries, but will also save the investors from the hassle of getting KYC done again by the intermediaries regulated by other financial sector regulators.

        <td>Creating a core fund (called Core Settlement Guarantee Fund), within the SGF, against which no exposure is given and which is readily and unconditionally available to meet settlement obligations of clearing corporation in case of clearing member(s) failing to honour settlement obligation. Aligning stress testing practices of clearing corporations with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). Capturing in stress testing, the risk due to possible default in institutional trades. Harmonising default waterfalls across clearing corporations. Limiting the liability of non-defaulting members in view of the Basel capital adequacy requirements for exposure towards Central Counterparties (CCPs). Ring-fencing each segment of clearing corporation from defaults in other segments. Bringing in uniformity in the stress testing and the risk management practices of different clearing corporations especially with regard to the default of members. SEBI has from time to time put in place various risk containment measures to address the risks involved in the securities market. One such measure prescribed was norms for Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) at Stock Exchanges including corpus, contribution, management, usage and recoupment of the fund corpus (vide circular no SMD/POLICY/SGF/CIR-13/97). In order to promote and sustain an efficient and robust global financial infrastructure, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) updated the standards applicable for systemically important financial market infrastructures (central counterparties, payment systems, trade repositories and securities settlement systems) with the PFMIs. SEBI as a member of IOSCO is committed to the adoption and implementation of the new CPSS-IOSCO standards of PFMIs. As required under PFMIs, to provide greater legal basis for settlement finality, netting and rights of FMIs over collateral, Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges And Clearing Corporations) (Amendment) Regulations, 2013 were notified on September 02, 2013. Vide circular dated September 04, 2013, SEBI required FMIs under its regulatory purview to comply with the PFMIs applicable to them. These new guidelines will align stress testing practices of clearing corporations with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) (norms for stress testing for credit risk, stress testing for liquidity risk and reverse stress testing including frequency and scenarios). The new stress testing norms will also capture the risk posed due to possible default in institutional trades. The stress test, which will be conducted every day, will determine the Minimum Required Corpus (MRC) of Core SGF. This will be a dynamic process which will form the basis for replenishing the Core SGF every month. PFMIs require CCs to maintain sufficient resources to cover losses due to major defaults in the market so as to avoid any systemic risk. While margins of defaulting member/s form primary layer of defence for CC against default of a member, a next layer of defence by way of a dedicated pool of resources is generally maintained by CCs to effect settlement guarantee. The current practice followed by CCs in India for quantifying such resources is to also include margins of all members. As margins are against positions, there are difficulties felt in estimating the correct value of resources readily available to meet settlement shortages in case of default by member/s. The new guidelines will remove these difficulties by creating the Core SGF as a second layer of defence, against which no exposure is allowed and thus will always be available in sufficiently liquid form.  Availability of such a liquid fund will make the whole risk management system much safer as the CCs will have better capability to deal with extreme stress situations where the defaulters' funds are not sufficient to meet their obligations. The new system will substantially reduce the possibility of such stresses leading to systemic risk. Broadly the contribution to Core SGF will be from the following sources: At least 50% of MRC from CC At least 25% of MRC from Stock Exchange (SE) Upto 25% of MRC from clearing members (CMs) Penalties levied by CC will also be credited to Core SGF. As per the present default waterfall of CCs, residual losses after exhausting resources available in other layers of the waterfall are to be allocated to the non-defaulting clearing members. Thus, effectively under such circumstances there is no limit to the liability of non-defaulting members in the event of extreme loss. As per Basel capital adequacy requirements, many members are required to make capital provisions towards counterparty exposure including towards CCPs which becomes difficult to quantify in case of an unlimited liability. The circular has provisions regarding manner for limiting the liability of non-defaulting members. The new guidelines will also harmonise default waterfall across CCs and will adequately ring-fence each segment of CC from defaults in other segments. The default waterfall in case of default in any segment will generally follow the following order - 1- Monies of defaulting member 2- Insurance, if any 3- CC resources (equal to 5% of MRC) 4- Core SGF 5- CC resources 6- CC/Stock Exchange contribution to Core SGFs of other segments 7- Capped contribution of non defaulting members 8- Pro-rata haircut to pay-outs (for details refer to circular) Norms for contribution to Core SGF as well as default waterfall have been specified with a view that all the stakeholders (CC, SE and CMs) are incentivised to adequately monitor the risks brought into the system. Based on deliberations in the Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI and further discussions with CCs, SEs and market <mark>participants</mark>, it has been decided to issue these norms related to core settlement guarantee fund, stress testing and default procedures specified in the present Circular which would bring greater clarity and uniformity as well as align the same with international best practices.

        <td>Sep 01, 2015 PR No.: 225/2015 The Report of the Committee on Clearing Corporations, chaired by Shri K V Kamath, was placed before the SEBI Board in its meeting held on August 24, 2015. The Board took note of the report and approved the proposal to seek public comments on the recommendations of the Committee. The “Committee on Clearing Corporations” was constituted in November 2012 with the following broad terms of reference: a)    The viability of introducing a single Clearing Corporation (CC) or interoperability between different CCs b)   Investment by a recognized CC and the manner of utilization of profits of CCs c)    To examine and review the existing <mark>regulation of transfer of profits every year by the recognized Stock Exchanges to the fund of recognized CC d)   To define ‘the liquid assets’ of CCs for the purpose of calculation of Net worth of a clearing corporation e)    Any other matter that Committee considers relevant or incidental thereto - The issue of Transfer of Depositories’ profits to their Investor Protection Fund (IPF) was referred to the Committee. The main recommendations of the Committee are as follows: On interoperability / viability of single Clearing Corporation, the committee recommended that at this juncture, maintaining separate clearing corporations for each exchange would be prudent. However, SEBI may keep the interoperability option open and consider the proposal for implementation when ground conditions are met, which, inter alia, include clear intent of the participants coming together and having  a suitable  framework in place to the satisfaction of SEBI. On investments by Clearing Corporations, the committee recommended that Clearing Corporations may be permitted to invest in Fixed Deposits and Central Government Securities. However, Clearing Corporations may not be permitted to invest in instruments like Non-convertible debentures (NCDs), Commercial Papers (CPs), Money Market Mutual Funds, etc as these instruments may carry credit/liquidity risks. As the requirement of Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) has already been met, it was recommended that the requirement, under Regulation 33 of SECC Regulations, 2012, to transfer twenty five per cent of its profits by every recognised stock exchange to the Fund, as specified in Regulation 39, of the recognised clearing corporation, may no longer be required. However, Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI may review the stress test model used to determine the Minimum Required Corpus of Core SGF before making such departure. The ‘liquid assets’ of clearing corporations for the purpose of calculation of its Net worth, shall comprise Fixed Deposits/Central Government Securities. Other instruments like NCDs, CPs, money market mutual funds, etc. may carry credit/liquidity risks and hence, may not be considered towards calculation of liquid assets in net worth of CC. With regard to transfer of profits by Depositories, it was recommended that  Depositories may transfer five per cent or such percentage as may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time, of their profits from depository operations every year to the IPF since the date of amendment</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories and Participants) (Amendment) Regulations</mark>, 2012 requiring transfer of profits. The report of the Committee is placed on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in Public comments are invited on the recommendations made in the report. Comments may be emailed to Ms. Yogita Jadhav, Assistant General Manager, at yogitag@sebi.gov.in and to Mr. Ramaneesh Goyal, Assistant Manager, at ramaneeshg@sebi.gov.in by September 24, 2015</td>

The Board has approved that in respect of the cases involving issuance of securities to more than 49 persons but up to 200 persons in a financial year, the companies may avoid penal action if they had provided the investors with an option to surrender the securities and get the refund amount at a price not less than the amount of subscription money paid along with 15% interest p.a. thereon. The exit may be provided by the company itself or by the promoters or by such persons as arranged by the company / promoters. The companies may adjust the amounts already paid to the allottees either as interest / dividend or otherwise from the amount of refund to be paid to the investors. In case of transfer of securities by the original allottees, option for refund may be provided to the current holders of the securities. The refunds made by the company following the option for refund exercised by investors would be certified by independent practicing Chartered Accountants / practicing Company Secretaries / practicing Cost Accountants. The proposal has taken into account the interest of investors while recognising their right to stay invested in case they feel it is beneficial to them. 7) Business Responsibility Reporting by Listed Entities SEBI has, vide circular dated August 13, 2012, mandated Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) requirement for top 100 listed entities based on market capitalization in their annual reports.

The Board has approved that in respect of the cases involving issuance of securities to more than 49 persons but up to 200 persons in a financial year, the companies may avoid penal action if they had provided the investors with an option to surrender the securities and get the refund amount at a price not less than the amount of subscription money paid along with 15% interest p.a. thereon. The exit may be provided by the company itself or by the promoters or by such persons as arranged by the company / promoters. The companies may adjust the amounts already paid to the allottees either as interest / dividend or otherwise from the amount of refund to be paid to the investors. In case of transfer of securities by the original allottees, option for refund may be provided to the current holders of the securities. The refunds made by the company following the option for refund exercised by investors would be certified by independent practicing Chartered Accountants / practicing Company Secretaries / practicing Cost Accountants. The proposal has taken into account the interest of investors while recognising their right to stay invested in case they feel it is beneficial to them. 7) Business Responsibility Reporting by Listed Entities SEBI has, vide circular dated August 13, 2012, mandated Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) requirement for top 100 listed entities based on market capitalization in their annual reports. The key principles which are required to be reported by the entities include the areas such as environment, social, governance, stakeholder’s relationships, etc. SEBI Board has now approved that present applicability of BRR be extended to top five hundred listed entities based on market capitalization as on March 31st of every year. As a green initiative, the business responsibility reports can be given on the websites of the companies providing website link for the same in their annual reports. 8)Exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process regarding exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders under Companies Act, 2013 in case of change in objects or varying the term of contracts referred to in the prospectus. 9) Public issuance of convertible securities The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process for revival of public issuance of convertible securities by listed entities. 10) Delisting of Small Companies Delisting Regulations provide for simplified procedure of delisting for small companies and exempt them from the requirements of Chapter IV of the Delisting Regulations subject to certain conditions. Currently, one of such conditions is that the shares of the company have not been traded for the preceding one year. Based on suggestion receive from Investor Association, Board has approved the proposal that the condition of no trading for preceding one year may be relaxed and the small companies, whose trading of equity shares during the twelve calendar months is less than 10% of the total number of shares of such company, would also be eligible for simplified procedure of delisting. However, to protect the interest of investors, the exit price shall not be less than the floor price determined for the purpose of Reverse Book Building for not frequently traded securities in terms of Delisting Regulations read with SEBI Takeover Regulations.</td>

Minor Amendments in the AIF Regulations, 2012 It is recommended that the definition of “venture capital fund” in Category I AIF is amended  to  include  funds  that  invest  in  growth  stage  ventures.  The  rationale  and justification  for  including  growth  stage  venture  funds  in  the  definition  of  “venture capital fund” in Category I  is as follows: 2.1 The trend has now become for a private equity fund to invest in companies at various stages ranging from early stage to further developmental stages of  growth.  Funds  are  mandated  to  operate  flexibly  from  early  stage  to growth and back. Hence some fund managers may find it appropriate to categorise  the  fund  as  a  “venture  capital  fund”  while  still  investing  in growth, if they accept all the restrictions as specified for Category I AIFs.</td>
