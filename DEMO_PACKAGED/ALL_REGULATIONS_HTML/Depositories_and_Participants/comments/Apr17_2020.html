Acquirer was not entitled to  acquire  or  enter  into  any  agreement  to acquire exceeding such  number  of  shares  as  would  take  the aggregate  shareholding  pursuant the acquisition  above  the  maximum  permissible non-public  shareholding.  This  <mark>amendment exempts acquisition under IBC plan from this prohibition. rights to Amendment  Notification  dated  September 11, 2018: Amendment to grant additional time for upward revision of open offer price till one working day before the commencement of the tendering  period.  Further,  the  definition  of “fugitive economic offender”, “list regulations” and “postal ballot” have been inserted in the regulations, and the word “listing agreement” wherever occurring has been replaced by the word “listing regulations”. Rationale: SEBI had earlier issued a discussion paper  on  March  28,  2018  soliciting  public comments  for  reviewing  the  SEBI  Takeover Regulations.  The  amendments  are  mainly aimed at simplifying the language, removing redundant  provisions  and inconsistencies, updating the references to the Companies Act, 2013  and  other  new  SEBI  Regulations,  and incorporating  the  relevant  circulars,  FAQs, informal guidance in the regulations. 5. Amendment  Notification  dated  December 31,  2018:  Amendment  to  regulation  29(4)  of the Regulations to extend the exemption from disclosure to deposit taking Housing Finance 3. 182 Securities and Exchange Board of India Annual Report : 2018-19 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA 6.

Rationale:  Under the  regulations,  shares taken  by  way  of  encumbrance  are  treated  as an acquisition and shares given upon release of  encumbrance  are  treated  as  a  disposal. Such  acquisition  and  disposal  are  required to  be  disclosed.  However,  such  disclosure requirements  were  not  applicable to  a scheduled commercial bank or public financial institution  as  pledgee  in  connection  with  a pledge  of  shares  for  securing  indebtedness in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Pursuant to  the  amendment,  shares  taken  by  way  of encumbrance (or shares given upon release of encumbrance)  by  the  said  HFCs  and  NBFCs shall not be treated as acquisition (or disposal) for  the  purpose  of  disclosure  requirements under Regulation 29 of Takeover Regulations. Amendment  Notification  dated  March 29,  2019:  The  exemptions  available  to  debt restructuring  approved  by  a  “competent authority”  other  than  a  Court  or  Tribunal have  been  removed.  Further,  the  exemption available to new investors who purchase equity from  lenders  pursuant  to  debt  restructuring has been removed. Rationale:  The  amendment  inter  alia  takes into  account  the  changes  brought  in  by  the Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code,  2016  and the  revisions  made  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of India in its debt restructuring guidelines and confines the exemption from open offer only to lenders converting their debt to equity under such revised guidelines or to a resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

For this purpose, it was decided that  instead  of  levying  regulatory  fee  at  the prescribed turn-over based slab rates discussed above, a nominal regulatory fee at a flat rate of INR  1,00,000  per  stock  exchange,  irrespective of  the  aggregate  value  of  the  transactions  on agricultural  commodity  derivatives  shall  be levied.

Further,  the  definition  of “fugitive economic offender”, “list regulations” and “postal ballot” have been inserted in the regulations, and the word “listing agreement” wherever occurring has been replaced by the word “listing regulations”. Rationale: SEBI had earlier issued a discussion paper  on  March  28,  2018  soliciting  public comments  for  reviewing  the  SEBI  Takeover Regulations.  The  amendments  are  mainly aimed at simplifying the language, removing redundant  provisions  and inconsistencies, updating the references to the Companies Act, 2013  and  other  new  SEBI  Regulations,  and incorporating  the  relevant  circulars,  FAQs, informal guidance in the regulations. 5.

Rationale:  In  order  to  ease  the  cost  and compliance  burden  on  the  issuer  in  case of  public  issue,  it  was  decided  that  the requirement of 1 per cent security deposit may be deleted from the regulations. (19)    Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments and Security Receipts) (Second Amendment) Regulations,  2018,  notified  on  October  09, 2018 Details: Regulation 35B on the requirement of 1 per cent security deposit to be deposited by the issuer with the stock exchange prior to the opening of subscription list has been omitted. Rationale:  In  order  to  ease  the  cost  and compliance  burden  on  the  issuer  in  case of  public  issue,  it  was  decided  that  the requirement of 1 per cent security deposit may be deleted from the regulations. (20)  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India (Regulatory  Fee  on  Stock  Exchanges) (Amendment)  Regulations,  2018,  notified  on October 23, 2018 Details:  Amendment  to  the  Explanation  to sub-regulation (1) of Regulation 4. Rationale: It was decided to give relaxation in charging regulatory fees on the trading turnover 184 Securities and Exchange Board of India Annual Report : 2018-19 PART THREE A: FUNCTIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA of  agricultural  commodity  derivatives  in  a manner  that  would  help  the  stock  exchanges to reduce the cost burden on the farmers/FPOs under different cost heads such as transaction charges,  delivery  fees,  warehouse  charges, assaying  charges  etc.  by  way  of  subsidizing these costs from the amount that will be saved by  them  from  the  reduction  of  regulatory fees by SEBI. For this purpose, it was decided that  instead  of  levying  regulatory  fee  at  the prescribed turn-over based slab rates discussed above, a nominal regulatory fee at a flat rate of INR  1,00,000  per  stock  exchange,  irrespective of  the  aggregate  value  of  the  transactions  on agricultural  commodity  derivatives  shall  be levied. (21)    Amendments to  SEBI (Prohibition  of Insider  Trading)  Regulations,  2015  and SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 Pursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the Committee  on  Fair  Market  Conduct  which was  set  up  under  Chairmanship  of  Shri  T.K.
