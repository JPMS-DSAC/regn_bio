The SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 specify a maximum period of 30 days for allotment after the closure of the issue. In the case of book built issues the allotment is required to be done within 15 days of closure of issue.

        <td>Dear Sirs, As you are aware that in terms of sub-Regulation (2) of Regulation 14 of the <mark>SEBI (Bankers to an Issue) Regulations</mark><mark>banker to an issue</mark> and the body corporate shall inter alia contain the clauses stipulating the time within which the statement regarding the application and application monies received from the investors will be forwarded to the Registrar to an Issue or the body corporate, as the case may be. Further, the agreement shall also stipulate that a daily statement will be sent by the designated controlling branch of the Bankers to the Issue, to the Registrar to the Issue indicating the number of applications received on that date and the amount of the application monies received. In the interest of the investors it has been the endeavour of SEBI to reduce the time period involved between closure of the issue and listing of the securities. The SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 specify a maximum period of 30 days for allotment after the closure of the issue. In the case of book built issues the allotment is required to be done within 15 days of closure of issue. The Registrar to the Issue may be able to finalize the basis of allotment of securities only on timely receipt of details of collection figures, the applications and the application monies received.</td>
