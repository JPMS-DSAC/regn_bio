        <td>7.1.2 For  venture  capital  funds  which  deal  in  high  risk  investments  structuring flexibility  is  very  important  to  meet  their  business  strategies.  In  India,  such structures like LP, LLP and LLC are not recognised under the Indian Partnership Act and the Indian Companies Act. For development of VC industry in India on global  lines  and  also  to  facilitate  and  attract  the  foreign  investment  in  venture capital  industry,  such  alternative  structures  need  to  be  provided  by  bringing appropriate changes in legislation. 7.1.3 Under the SEBI Regulations a VCF can be registered in the form of a Trust, a Company  or  a  Body  Corporate(with  a  recent  <mark>amendment  dated  November  17, 1999  under  the  Regulations).  A  company  or  a  body  corporate  registered  with SEBI  may  float  multiple  schemes  for  investment  in  different  categories  of companies  and  the  fund  set  up  as  trust  may  also  establish  one  or  more  funds under it. SEBI Regulations however, do not specifically provide for registration of a scheme floated by a body corporate or a company, as like mutual fund schemes and  multiple  funds  set  up  by  a  venture  capital  fund  incorporated  as  a  trust.  At present, the LP, LLP and LLC structure are also not permitted under the statutes ie.  the  Indian  Partnership  Act  and  the  Indian  Companies  Act  However,  as  and when  permitted,  these  should  be  eligible  to  be  registered  under  the  SEBI Regulations. The SEBI regulation</mark> therefore needs to be amended to provide for registration  of  other  entities  such  as  LP,  LLP,  LLC,  etc  as  well  as  the  scheme Report of K B Chandrasekhar Committee on Venture Capital 26 27 Securities and Exchange Board of India</td>

Avoid making negative statements about any AMC or scheme and ensure that comparisons if any, are made with similar and comparable products. 11. Ensure that all investor related statutory communications (such as changes in fundamental attributes, exit/entry load, exit options, and other material aspects) are sent to investors reliably and on time. 12. Maintain confidentiality of all investor deals and transactions. 13. When marketing various schemes, remember that a client’s interest and suitability to their financial needs is paramount, and that extra commission or incentive earned should never form the basis for recommending a scheme to the client. 14. Intermediaries will not rebate commission back to investors and avoid attracting clients through temptation of rebate/gifts etc. 15.

This results in multiple disclosures/filings for the companies that are listed on more than one exchange. SEBI, in consultation with NSE and BSE, is in the process of brining a common electronic platform maintained / run by Stock Exchanges. A listed company would be required to file only on this platform for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of listing agreement. The proposed platform would introduce single window filing and would also serve as a one stop shop for corporate information of listed companies. Introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Funds in India: Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his speech presenting the Budget 2005-06 had announced the introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Fund (GETF) in India and creation of a market for such units. Consequent upon the announcement by the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Chairman, SEBI constituted a committee to look into all aspects of facilitating the setting up of GETF in India. After considering various issues involved in the matter, the Committee recommended that the GETF may be implemented in India based on two models- (i) Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model and (ii) Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt Model. The two models are briefly as follows:- Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model- In this model, the physical gold is held by a custodian bank on behalf of the Mutual Fund. The Mutual Fund sells/buys units to/from a wholesale intermediary based on the value of the gold with the custodian bank and the wholesale intermediary in turn sells/buys the units to the retail investors on the Stock Exchange. Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt model- In this model, gold warehouse receipts are held by a custodian bank on behalf of the <mark>mutual fund</mark><mark>SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its Board meeting held today has approved amendment to SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market.

        <td>In the case of trading in repos in corporate bonds, SEBI will need to write to RBI for framing the guidelines . 13 Order Matching Trading System As market participants gain experience with trade reporting and the first phase of clearing and settlement systems, efforts should be made to develop online order matching platforms for corporate bonds. Such trading platforms can be set up by the stock exchanges or jointly by regulated institutions like banks, financial institutions, <mark>mutual funds</mark><mark>regulations may be reviewed and appropriate amendment</mark>s made thereto, if necessary, for the purpose. As it is necessary to avoid multiplicity of regulators for entities taking limited purpose membership for trading on their own behalf in the proposed trading and clearing platforms, the responsibility of regulating their activity in corporate bonds through trading platforms will vest with SEBI while the primary regulation of these institutions will continue to vest with their respective primary regulators. Appropriate approvals may be considered by concerned regulators to enable free participation on the trading platform through limited membership by the concerned entities for the purpose of their proprietary trading. The major holders of corporate bonds like banks, FIs, PDs, PFs, Insurance companies are not regulated by SEBI. Hence, SEBI will have to write to all concerned regulators who will advise their regulated agencies to trade on the designated order matching system. SEBI can in the interest of market will mandate a particular exchange to begin with to set up an order matching system. The same exchange which provides the centralized data base should ideally have order matching system. This system or platform should be separate from that of equity and derivative platforms already existing. The trades should be settled through novation and settlement guarantee fund, and as in the case of equities, the clearing agency of the exchange should be connected to the depositories for electronic transfer of bonds. At a later date when trading picks up and the market deepens, SEBI can examine whether there is a scope for other trading platforms to be set up. Also the chosen exchange should examine the scope of introducing T+1 settlement only for corporate debt, if it has to compete effectively with the OTC/telephone market. In the case of NDS also settlement is mostly on T+1 basis, if not on T+0 (i.e same day). SEBI can announce the plan through a comprehensive press release first, to put the market on notice. 14</td>

Foreign Institutional Investors: The Honourable Union Finance Minister in his budget speech for 2005-06, announced the enhancement of the sub-ceiling for FII investment in debt securities within the overall limit of External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). While such limit for Government securities (including Treasury Bills) was raised from US$ 1.75 billion to US$ 2 billion, the same for the corporate debt had been increased from US$0.5 billion to US$1.5 billion. The sub-ceilings continued to remain separate and not fungible. Corporate Restructuring: The <mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>amendments, inter alia, include removal of restrictions on market purchases and preferential allotments. SEBI amended provisions of compulsory delisting in the SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines thereby providing a mechanism for determining fair value of shares, in case of compulsory delisting, by an expert group appointed by the stock exchanges. Surveillance Activities: In order to further enhance efficacy of the surveillance function, SEBI decided to put in place a world-class comprehensive Integrated Market Surveillance System (IMSS) across stock exchanges and across market segments (cash and derivatives markets).The Integrated Surveillance Department of SEBI monitored market movements, analysed trading pattern in scrips and indices and initiated appropriate actions in co-ordination with stock exchanges and depositories. Investor Awareness, Assistance and Investor Education / Protection: During 2005-06, 1000 workshops were conducted by different agencies under the aegis of the Securities Market Awareness campaign. These workshops were arranged throughout the country to reach the common investors and educate them about the functioning of the capital market. An investors' complaint status module on the SEBI website, is being implemented in a phased manner. SEBI proposes to conduct an investors’ survey, shortly.

        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

        <td>ANNUAL REPORT 2008-09 m) The type of securities in which FIIs are permitted to invest has been widened to  include  schemes  floated  by  a Collective Investment Scheme. iii. Amendments to the <mark>SEBI (Custodian of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment regulations to provide custodial services in respect of title deeds of real estate assets held by a real estate mutual fund scheme with the prior approval of the Board. iv. Amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 The  SEBI  (Depositories  and  Participants) Regulations, 1996 has been amended on August 08, 2008. Earlier regulation 32 envisaged that the depository shall satisfy the Board that it has a mechanism in place to ensure that the interest of the persons buying and selling securities held in the depository are adequately protected and shall  register  the  transfer  of  a  security  in  the name of the transferee only after the depository is satisfied that payment for such transfer has been made. Amendment to regulation 32 of the Depositories and Participants Regulations has done  away  with  the  requirement  of  the depositories to ensure payments before effecting the  transfer  in  the  demat  system  as  the Depositories Act does not cast an obligation on the  depositories  to  ensure  that  payment  has been  made  in  respect  of  transfer  of  security. However,  depository  is  expected  to  effect  the transfer of securities diligently. v. Amendments  to  the  SEBI  (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 The SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993  has  been  amended  on  August  11,  2008. The key features of the captioned amendment regulations are as under: a) Criteria for considering the application for registration as Portfolio Manager have been  relaxed  by  providing  that  two persons  who  should  be in  the employment of Portfolio Manager should have experience in “related activities” in portfolio management or stock broking or investment management. b) Networth for  carrying  portfolio management service has been increased from Rs.50 lakh to Rs.2 crore. c) Capital  adequacy  requirement  for portfolio  manager  shall  have  to  be fulfilled separately and independently of any other intermediary activity. d) e) In  order  to  ensure  that  portfolio management activities do not partake the  character  of  a  mutual  fund, amendment  has  further  clarified  that portfolio  manager  shall  not  hold  the securities  of  clients  in  its  own  name either  by  virtue  of  contracts  or otherwise. The word ‘scheme’ wherever occurring  in  the  regulation  has  also been deleted to ensure the aforesaid. Since  the  registration  as  portfolio manager  can  be  sought  by  only  a company reference to partner or sole proprietor has also been removed from the regulation. vi. Amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 The SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations,  1992  has  been  amended  on November  19,  2008.

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience.
