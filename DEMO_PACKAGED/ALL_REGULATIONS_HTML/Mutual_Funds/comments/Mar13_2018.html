        <td>Sep 01, 2015 PR No.: 225/2015 The Report of the Committee on Clearing Corporations, chaired by Shri K V Kamath, was placed before the SEBI Board in its meeting held on August 24, 2015. The Board took note of the report and approved the proposal to seek public comments on the recommendations of the Committee. The “Committee on Clearing Corporations” was constituted in November 2012 with the following broad terms of reference: a)    The viability of introducing a single Clearing Corporation (CC) or interoperability between different CCs b)   Investment by a recognized CC and the manner of utilization of profits of CCs c)    To examine and review the existing <mark>regulation of transfer of profits every year by the recognized Stock Exchanges to the fund of recognized CC d)   To define ‘the liquid assets’ of CCs for the purpose of calculation of Net worth of a clearing corporation e)    Any other matter that Committee considers relevant or incidental thereto - The issue of Transfer of Depositories’ profits to their Investor Protection Fund (IPF) was referred to the Committee. The main recommendations of the Committee are as follows: On interoperability / viability of single Clearing Corporation, the committee recommended that at this juncture, maintaining separate clearing corporations for each exchange would be prudent. However, SEBI may keep the interoperability option open and consider the proposal for implementation when ground conditions are met, which, inter alia, include clear intent of the participants coming together and having  a suitable  framework in place to the satisfaction of SEBI. On investments by Clearing Corporations, the committee recommended that Clearing Corporations may be permitted to invest in Fixed Deposits and Central Government Securities. However, Clearing Corporations may not be permitted to invest in instruments like Non-convertible debentures (NCDs), Commercial Papers (CPs), Money Market Mutual Funds, etc as these instruments may carry credit/liquidity risks. As the requirement of Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) has already been met, it was recommended that the requirement, under Regulation 33 of SECC Regulations, 2012, to transfer twenty five per cent of its profits by every recognised stock exchange to the Fund, as specified in Regulation 39, of the recognised clearing corporation, may no longer be required. However, Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI may review the stress test model used to determine the Minimum Required Corpus of Core SGF before making such departure. The ‘liquid assets’ of clearing corporations for the purpose of calculation of its Net worth, shall comprise Fixed Deposits/Central Government Securities. Other instruments like NCDs, CPs, money market mutual funds, etc. may carry credit/liquidity risks and hence, may not be considered towards calculation of liquid assets in net worth of CC.

The report of the Committee is placed on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in Public comments are invited on the recommendations made in the report.

The Board has approved that in respect of the cases involving issuance of securities to more than 49 persons but up to 200 persons in a financial year, the companies may avoid penal action if they had provided the investors with an option to surrender the securities and get the refund amount at a price not less than the amount of subscription money paid along with 15% interest p.a. thereon. The exit may be provided by the company itself or by the promoters or by such persons as arranged by the company / promoters. The companies may adjust the amounts already paid to the allottees either as interest / dividend or otherwise from the amount of refund to be paid to the investors. In case of transfer of securities by the original allottees, option for refund may be provided to the current holders of the securities. The refunds made by the company following the option for refund exercised by investors would be certified by independent practicing Chartered Accountants / practicing Company Secretaries / practicing Cost Accountants. The proposal has taken into account the interest of investors while recognising their right to stay invested in case they feel it is beneficial to them. 7) Business Responsibility Reporting by Listed Entities SEBI has, vide circular dated August 13, 2012, mandated Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) requirement for top 100 listed entities based on market capitalization in their annual reports. The key principles which are required to be reported by the entities include the areas such as environment, social, governance, stakeholder’s relationships, etc. SEBI Board has now approved that present applicability of BRR be extended to top five hundred listed entities based on market capitalization as on March 31st of every year. As a green initiative, the business responsibility reports can be given on the websites of the companies providing website link for the same in their annual reports. 8)Exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process regarding exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders under Companies Act, 2013 in case of change in objects or varying the term of contracts referred to in the prospectus. 9) Public issuance of convertible securities The Board approved the proposal to initiate public consultation process for revival of public issuance of convertible securities by listed entities. 10) Delisting of Small Companies Delisting Regulations provide for simplified procedure of delisting for small companies and exempt them from the requirements of Chapter IV of the Delisting Regulations subject to certain conditions. Currently, one of such conditions is that the shares of the company have not been traded for the preceding one year. Based on suggestion receive from Investor Association, Board has approved the proposal that the condition of no trading for preceding one year may be relaxed and the small companies, whose trading of equity shares during the twelve calendar months is less than 10% of the total number of shares of such company, would also be eligible for simplified procedure of delisting. However, to protect the interest of investors, the exit price shall not be less than the floor price determined for the purpose of Reverse Book Building for not frequently traded securities in terms of Delisting Regulations read with SEBI Takeover Regulations.</td>

With the objective of restricting access to capital markets for raising funds from public, by such wilful defaulters, following proposals have been approved by the Board: No issuer shall make a public issue of equity securities / debt securities / non-convertible redeemable preference shares, if the issuer company or its promoter or its director is in the list of the wilful defaulters. Any company or its promoter or its director categorized as wilful defaulter may not be allowed to take control over other listed entity.
