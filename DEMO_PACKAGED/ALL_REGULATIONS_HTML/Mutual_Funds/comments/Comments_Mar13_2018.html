PACL challenged these letters before the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan in December 1999, claiming inter alia therein that its scheme does not fall under the definition of CIS as defined under the CIS Regulation/ SEBI Act. PACL also challenged the constitutional validity of the CIS Regulations. The Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan vide its order dated November 28, 2003, held that PACL's schemes were not CIS as defined under Section 11AA of the SEBI Act and quashed SEBI's letters dated November 30, 1999 and December 10, 1999, issued to PACL. SEBI preferred an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India against the order of Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan. Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated February 26, 2013 while allowing the appeal upheld the constitutional validity of CIS Regulations, and directed SEBI to investigate the matter and take appropriate actions.  After conducting inquiry, SEBI passed the order dated August 22, 2014, wherein, inter-alia, PACL Limited, its promoters and directors were directed to wind up all the existing Collective Investment Schemes of PACL Limited and refund the monies collected by the said company under its schemes with returns which are due to its investors as per the terms of offer within a period of three months from the date of the said Order.</td>

        <td>The present study examined the actual trends in and possible influences on the allocation of household and individual savings to investment in financial instruments; the factors underlying the perceived inter-temporal volatility in retail investor presence in the equity market, and the implications this has for investor behavior; is there any basis for the expectation that participation of retail investors would transform equity markets and enable them to perform their presumed functions better? and the experience in other emerging and developed markets in this regard. The main findings of the study are: (a) Identify any impediments to retail investor entry and participation, taking into account the need of such investors to invest in small lots and their weakness relative to institutional and high net worth individuals when seeking to acquire shares.(b) Strengthen regulation aimed at guarding against market manipulation and price rigging. (c) There is need to ensure that information disclosure by issuers of equity and listed companies is comprehensive and clear. (d) It is necessary to educate investors not only on the potential savings opportunities in the market, but also on an evidence-based, investment strategy. (e) It is necessary to strengthen the <mark>mutual fund</mark> distribution network in order to attract retail investors to the Indian Capital markets. </td>
