        <td>“I am delighted to be here to inaugurate SEBI’s new permanent home.  My thoughts go back to 1992, when the Securities and Exchange Board of India came into its own as a statutory regulatory body. …..I had announced our government’s intentions to make SEBI a statutory body endowed with all the privileges that such institutions enjoy all over the world. And I am happy, that I was able to fulfil that commitment in time. SEBI has been fortunate to have had men of integrity and commitment at the top and competent professionals at all levels. This has greatly helped SEBI establish its credibility in the market and with investors and in the process has enhanced our country’s overall credit ratings in the world market. All modern economies, therefore, recognise the need for sound regulation of securities markets. This is needed not just for proper functioning of these markets, but also for their very survival. It is good regulation that will ensure that markets are safe and perceived to be safe by the public at large. It is good regulation that will ensure that necessary information is available to the public so that they can take informed decisions about investments. It is good regulation that will further ensure that while engines of growth are allowed to move at full speed, there is no space for manipulators in the system. Today securities market regulation has evolved to include three principal objectives: (a) Fair, efficient and transparent markets; (b) Investor protection; (c) Reduction of systemic risk. I am happy to say that SEBI is shouldering the responsibility in all these three areas with great deal of efficiency and commitment.  Today, India is experiencing rapid economic growth. If we want to share this prosperity with a large cross-section of our society, we must ensure that the ownership of equity is spread as widely as possible. Individual citizens can participate in the capital market, both directly and indirectly, through financial institutions, such as <mark>mutual funds</mark>, pension funds and insurance companies. It is the task of the securities regulator to look after the interests of the investor in our country. If the regulator is able to ensure that the price discovery process is both efficient and transparent, with high disclosure and regulatory standards and with sound liquidity and risk management in place, the concerns of individual investors will be adequately addressed.</td>
