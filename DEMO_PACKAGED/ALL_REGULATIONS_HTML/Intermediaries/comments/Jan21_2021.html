        <td>SUBJECT: STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN FOR THE YEAR 2003-04 ISSUED BY: OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN SEBI had devised a Strategic Action Plan for the year 2003-04 in order to make the "Indian Securities market, a Benchmark for the Globe’. The Strategic Action Plan has been drawn with four broad segments: a) Investors b) Market c) Intermediaries and d) Regulator in mind. The Plan designed after analysing the inadequacies in the existing structure and practices and bearing the market ethos in mind addresses major issues segregated into: Structural Issues Systemic Issues Operational Issues During the period April 2003 to November 2003, a number of initiatives have been taken with a view to achieve the targets under the Plan. The following are the significant developments ; T+2 rolling settlement was introduced in the Indian markets with effect from April 1, 2003. This would reduce the risk and would be beneficial to the investors. India joins a select group of six nations viz. South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, Chile and Mexico which are following a short settlement cycle. The Central Listing Authority (CLA) was constituted with Chief Justice of India (retd.) Shri. M. N. Venkatachaliah as the President. The Regulations have been notified and the CLA would become operational shortly. Trading in Interest Rate Derivatives was launched by the Hon’ble Minister of Finance and Department of Company Affairs. This instrument would provide a mechanism for banks and financial institutions to hedge their positions in a volatile interest rate regime. Mutual Funds were allowed to launch ‘ Fund of Funds’. This would provide an opportunity to a Mutual Fund to invest in the units of other Mutual Funds. Guidelines for Mutual Funds for investments in overseas equity markets have been issued. The disclosure regime for the Mutual Funds was further strengthened and in order to ensure that all important disclosures are made to the investors of the concerned schemes and their interests are protected in cases of consolidation of schemes by Mutual Funds. The entry norms for IPOs were strengthened to ensure better quality of issuers, the issue process was revamped to facilitate faster allotment, and quick listing. The notice period for book closure/record date has been reduced to 15 days (for demat shares) to facilitate corporate decision making and reduce time required for making rights offers. The arbitration mechanism at the exchanges has been revamped in order to expedite the process and ensure transparency. <mark>SEBI (Ombudsman) Regulations</mark><mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>intermediaries</mark> and individuals.

In terms of Notification issued by SEBI under sub regulations (1) and (3) of regulation 6 of the (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations, 2003 on September 28, 2004, in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, SEBI had inter alia notified "all resident investors not being bodies corporate who enter into any securities market transaction (including any transaction in units of mutual funds or collective investment schemes) of value of one lakh rupees or more" as "specified investors" under the relevant regulations and, as such will be required to obtain the UIN by March 31, 2005. SEBI has received representations and feed back from the above "specified investors" on the difficulties faced by them in adhering to the time line of March 31, 2005. In order to alleviate their difficulties, it has been decided to give some more time to them to obtain the UIN. Accordingly the "notified date" is being extended from March 31, 2005 to December 31, 2005. The necessary notification to this effect is being issued by SEBI. Based on the experience of SEBI on MAPIN registrations and the representations and feed back received by SEBI, it has also been decided to constitute a Committee to look into the coverage of MAPIN and other related matters. The constitution of the Committee will be announced shortly. Mumbai February 24, 2005</td>

It relates the registration fees to the volumes of transactions effected by a stock broker and provides that such fees shall be payable for first five years based on the annual turnover relating to the preceding financial year. The brokers, aggrieved by the prescribed fee structure, represented to SEBI that the demand was excessive and the collection of same based on turnover was unreasonable and arbitrary. On such representations, SEBI appointed an Expert Committee (R. S. Bhatt Committee) to look into the interpretation of ‘turnover’ in the context of fees payable by stock brokers. The committee submitted its report on 18th December 1992 and recommended concessional rates of fees for certain types of transactions.  It  observed  that  the  turnover  was  a  fair  basis  for  determination  of registration  fees  and  the  incidence  of  fees  prescribed  by  SEBI  was  not  unreasonable. The  Government  and  SEBI  accepted  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  in principle.  SEBI  advised  the  brokers  on  January  7,  1993  to  pay  fees  in  the  manner prescribed by the Bhatt Committee. In meantime several writ petitions challenging the registration fees based on turnover, SEBI’s competence to levy fees, etc. were filed by the brokers in various High Courts. All these petitions were transferred to the Supreme Court which dismissed the transfer petition (No. 502/2000) on February 1, 2001 and upheld SEBI's powers to levy fees for carrying out the purposes of the SEBI Act. It also held that turnover can be a measure of the levy of fees. It, however, directed SEBI to incorporate  the  R.  S.  Bhatt  Committee  recommendations  in  the  regulations.  The regulations were amended on February 20, 2002 to provide for concessional rates for various  transactions  and  exclude  some  transactions  from  turnover.  Two  circulars clarifying the various issues raised in the representations of the brokers were issued on March 28, 2002 and September 30, 2002.

        <td>Rationalizing disclosure requirements for further public offers and rights issues: Presently all companies irrespective of whether they are listed in any stock exchange or are approaching the markets for the first time with IPOs have to make identical disclosures in the prospectus / offer document. In the context of further public offers (FPO) and Rights Issues, some disclosures in the document are repetitive, as the same have been periodically disclosed to the exchanges by the listed companies. It is now proposed to do away with the repetitive disclosures in case of rights issues and FPOs by companies which have a satisfactory track record of filing disclosures with the stock exchanges, of redressing investors’ grievances etc. Common platform for electronic filing and dissemination of corporate information: In terms of the listing agreement, listed companies are required to disclose corporate information to the stock exchanges where they are listed and also on EDIFAR, a electronic filing platform currently maintained by SEBI. This results in multiple disclosures/filings for the companies that are listed on more than one exchange. SEBI, in consultation with NSE and BSE, is in the process of brining a common electronic platform maintained / run by Stock Exchanges. A listed company would be required to file only on this platform for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of listing agreement. The proposed platform would introduce single window filing and would also serve as a one stop shop for corporate information of listed companies. Introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Funds in India: Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in his speech presenting the Budget 2005-06 had announced the introduction of Gold Exchange Traded Fund (GETF) in India and creation of a market for such units. Consequent upon the announcement by the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Chairman, SEBI constituted a committee to look into all aspects of facilitating the setting up of GETF in India. After considering various issues involved in the matter, the Committee recommended that the GETF may be implemented in India based on two models- (i) Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model and (ii) Mutual Fund Warehouse Receipt Model. The two models are briefly as follows:- Mutual Fund Custodian Bank integrated model- In this model, the physical gold is held by a custodian bank on behalf of the Mutual Fund.

The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark>, 2003 (MAPIN), after considering the recommendations of the Committee set up by SEBI to examine the issues related to MAPIN. The registration process will be resumed in a phased manner. To begin with, the cut off limit for obtaining UIN with biometric impressions for natural persons has been raised from the existing limit of trade order value of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.5.00 lakh or more. The limit will be reduced progressively. Agencies capable of providing such facilities in a cost effective manner will be assigned the responsibility of maintaining the databases. For trade order value of less than Rs.5.00 lakh, option will be available to investors to obtain either the Permanent Account Number of Income Tax Department or UIN obtained under MAPIN. Investors in mutual funds would be exempted from the requirement of obtaining UIN. The definition of promoter, which is a body corporate would be limited, to immediate holding company of the Indian entity and any of the subsidiaries, if located in India. Listed company or a company which intends to get its securities listed, along with their promoters, directors, officers and designated employees would be required to obtain UIN. These changes will be implemented after the necessary amendments are made to the MAPIN Regulations Note : The aforesaid are policy announcements based on decisions of the Board and do not reflect change in the existing legal framework until the relevant amendments are effected through issue of circulars.

        <td>Though the various parties involved in the different stages of the entire chain of events might claim their part as genuine, the same cannot be countenanced at this juncture of the proceedings, where the materiality of circumstances and the manner in which the entire modus operandi was executed have the ingredients of a manipulative assemblage to scupper the process of IPO allotment. It appears that unfair gain has been made by abusing the IPO allotment process and cornering the shares meant for the retail applicants. It appears that Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani, Manojdev Seksaria and their respective associates have adopted the modus operandi of making applications in fictitious / benami names for cornering the retail of portion of IPO shares. The shares allotted in IPO to the benamis of Roopalben Panchal and Purshottam Budhwani would have otherwise gone to genuine retail applicants. The entire gameplan, craftily designed, masterminded and executed by a coterie of operators acting in concert, in a tout ensemble through the mechanism of front entities of name-lenders seeking to impart a veneer of acceptability to a deal which is otherwise sham in an agonistic aggression in the market through predatory cornering is a clear abuse of the very process of IPO, meant to shore up the participation of retail investors. What is equally reprehensible is the unjust enrichment by a few masquerading in the retail category at the cost of genuine retail investors, who have been crowded out by the "hyperplasia" engineered and induced by the machinations of a few to monopolise the retail segment through colorable devices and make-believe arrangements. The entire gamut of elaborate game-plan of queering the pitch in the market is driven by base cupidity to wangle a patently unfair gain. Further probe is required for examining the systemic fault, if any, of the registrar Karvy-RTI i.e. Karvy Computer Shares P Ltd. and the lead managers Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd., DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. in identifying and weeding out the benami applications. It appears that Karvy-DP relied on a sub-broker namely Deepak Panchal for the purpose of opening the above dematerialized accounts without conducting any due diligence of its own to verify the identity and address of thousands of dematerialized account-holders. The role of Karvy-DP and Pratik-DP in acting as facilitators for Roopalben Panchal, Sugandh, Purshottam Budhwani and Manojdev Seksaria needs further examination to ascertain whether it was gross negligence or blatant complicity that caused these SEBI registered <mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Markets) Regulations</mark>, 2003.

        <td>May 08, 2006 PR No.: 131/2006 PRESS RELEASE PR No.131/2006 SEBI SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE FUTURE OF REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES (RSES) – POST DEMUTUALISATION 1.       SEBI has, today, released the Report of the Committee to study the future of RSEs - post demutualisation. This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate trading platform may be continued. Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) sufficiently empower SEBI to withdraw recognition for both the category of exchanges whether an exchange is recognized permanently or from year to year. ii.       Withdrawal of recognition to the above two categories of RSEs (a and b above) would help clean up the system, besides reducing the regulatory hazard to the investors, various regulators including tax authorities and the government. The issue of distribution of assets would become relevant in the eventuality of withdrawal of recognition for any reason. There is at present no provision for such distribution either under the SCRA or within the regulatory framework of SEBI. As distribution of assets would be an impending consequence of any withdrawal of recognition of a stock exchange, there is an urgent need to formulate a permanent and appropriate scheme. Suitable rules would require to be formed under section 30 of the SCRA, for distribution of assets of any stock exchange which ceases to be a recognised stock exchange. iii.      The corpus of any stock exchange is made up of (1) the contribution of the members, (2) the income of the exchange, and (3) the fiscal incentives which had helped the accumulation of reserves. In addition, it may include an adventitious factor by way of appreciation in the value of the assets over a period of time. The net worth of the exchange after revaluation of the assets and liabilities based on market value could be apportioned on the basis of the three components of the corpus mentioned above. The share relating to the members’ contribution should be made available to the members. The balance will be transferred to an escrow account and then to a fund earmarked for the purpose of investor protection managed by SEBI. This scheme will need a proper methodology for valuation of the assets and liabilities as well as for determining the proportion mentioned above and should be carried out by an independent entity. A Task Force may be constituted by SEBI comprising a chartered accountant, an approved valuer and a representative of SEBI for the purpose. iv.     In the absence of any specific provision for distribution of assets, no RSE would seek a voluntary exit option and one would have to live with a situation in which RSEs would continue to exist nearly in perpetuity and continue to remain a burden on the investor and the regulatory system. v.       The entity which remains after withdrawal of recognition must immediately change its name and style and cannot continue in any business as a stock exchange. In case a stock exchange whose recognition is withdrawn has a subsidiary, such an entity would also have to change its name and style to avoid any representation of any present or past affiliation with an exchange. It would be upto the subsidiary to carry on broking operations as any other broking entity registered with SEBI subject to the same rights and duties. vi.     The impact, on account of withdrawal of recognition either on request or on compulsory direction, on the companies exclusively listed on the RSEs and their shareholders would also need to be suitably addressed. An analysis of the compliance status of these companies indicates that only about 500 companies are compliant with the continuous listing requirements. It is felt that such compliant companies, in an exchange which will no longer remain recognized, should be allowed to migrate to any other exchange with minimum procedure and hassle to the company. SEBI can prescribe that files of such compliant companies be moved inter-exchange with minimum burden on such companies. vii.    Before seeking voluntary withdrawal of recognition, the RSEs would have to compulsorily delist all non-compliant companies. viii.  In the event of some of the remaining RSEs which have already been corporatised and are unable to demutualise within the stipulated time such RSEs will also attract the consequences of withdrawal of recognition under sec. 5(2) of the SCRA and their recognition will be compulsorily withdrawn and accordingly, they would have recourse to the same mechanism of asset distribution as recommended supra. ix.     All the RSEs whose recognition has not been withdrawn either voluntarily or compulsorily must collectively choose (in order for it to succeed) either the BSE model or in the alternative, the Inter-Connected Stock Exchange (ICSE) model. The Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges (FISE) will have to take the initiative of evolving a consensus amongst the RSEs. In order that the Public Representative (PR) Directors are able to discharge their responsibilities, it is important that they are conversant with the governance of the RSEs, have a reasonable knowledge of the securities market and are aware of their own functions as PR Directors.  SEBI should work out an appropriate training programme for the PR Directors. x.       In case of both of these models (i.e. proposals of BSE and ICSE) fail for whatever reasons, there would be no merit in the continuation of the RSEs and the recognition of all the RSEs will, therefore, have to be compulsorily withdrawn. Once the RSEs have chosen a particular model, such of the RSEs which are unwilling to accept that model will have to face compulsory withdrawal of recognition in the future as they provide neither a trading platform nor serve any public interest. xi.     The future of the subsidiaries is inter-linked with the survival of their parent RSEs. In case a stock exchange whose recognition is withdrawn has a subsidiary, such an entity would also have to change its name and style to avoid any representation of any present or past affiliation with an exchange. It would be upto the subsidiary to carry on broking operations as any other broking entity registered with SEBI. The subsidiaries’ demand of level playing field could then easily be recommended as they become brokers (or other registered financial <mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in.

The certificate is to be obtained by passing an examination approved by SEBI. The certificate would be valid for three years. Subsequently, such persons would be required to complete an approved programme of Continuing Professional Education to maintain the validity of certificate. SEBI has also permitted grandfathering provisions in these regulations. National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) established by SEBI has been made responsible to coordinate the task of certification in Indian Securities Markets. NISM, in discussion with the market segments, would design the examinations and engage agencies to administer computer based multiple choice tests across the country. In addition, the NISM would put in place a comprehensive continuing professional education framework involving reputed institutions. A significant development in this context would be the maintenance of complete data base of all market participants who have been certified by NISM. This is the first time that such a comprehensive database is being created. SEBI’s new initiative is expected to result in the creation of a large pool of qualified workforce in the Indian Securities Industry and spur a set of new educational programmes catering to the market professionals over a period of time. This initiative is likely to result in a significantly enhanced market quality. Mumbai December 19, 2007</td>

        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

In continuation of the same and to  facilitate  listing  of  speciﬁ ed  securities  in  the  SME  exchange,  “Model Equity  Listing  Agreement”  to  be  executed  between  the  issuer  and  the Stock Exchange, to list/migrate the speciﬁ ed securities on SME Exchange, was speciﬁ ed. In order to lay down the framework for recognition and supervision of stock exchanges/platforms for issue, listing and trading of the securities issued  by  the  SMEs,  necessary  amendments  have  been  made  in  the SEBI  (Issue  of  Capital  and  Disclosure  Requirements)  Regulations,  2009, SEBI  (Merchant  Bankers)  Regulations,  1992,  SEBI  (Foreign  Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995, <mark>SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations</mark><mark>intermediaries</mark> with regard to Anti Money Laundering (AML) Standards/Combating  Financing  of  Terrorism  (CFT).  There  are  certain additional  requirements  to  be  fulﬁ lled  with  regard  to  role  of  internal audit. It is clariﬁ ed that the internal audit function should be independent, adequately  resourced  and  commensurate  with  the  size  of  business  and operations,  organization  structure,  number  of  clients  and  other  such factors. Earlier, the eﬀ ective date to implement valuation methodology pertaining to debt and money market instrument was July 1, 2010 but now the revised date is August 1, 2010. However, those mutual funds which voluntarily propose to implement the valuation before August 1, 2010 were permiĴ ed to do so. 159 Contd. Annual Report 2010-11 Date</td>

(ix)       Necessity to execute a  shortened version of Listing Agreement  within six months of notification of these regulations. (4)       In addition to the above, a number of changes which are in the nature of either providing clarity or maintaining consistency or removal of redundancies have been carried out in the Listing Regulations.  Such changes include removal of dichotomy regarding utilization of issue proceeds, manner of dealing with unclaimed shares, aligning connected provisions pertaining to disclosures on website and issuing advertisements,  disclosures  in Annual Report, documents and information to be provided to holders of securities, terms and structure of securities, and operational modalities in manner of review of audit reports with modified opinion, etc. (5)       There were certain provisions in the listing agreements related to issuance of securities and not in the nature of continuous obligations, such as, 1% security deposit, allotment, refund, payment of interest on account of delay in allotment / non-allotment, etc. They have been now incorporated in respective regulations, viz., ICDR Regulations, ILDS Regulations, etc. Similarly, requirements which are in the nature of continuous disclosure and obligations have been shifted and now incorporated in the Listing Regulations.

(VI)  Granting Single Registration to Depository Participants With a view to further simplify the registration requirements for Depository Participants (DPs), the Board has approved the policy of granting single registration for the application of initial registration as well as the permanent registration for operating with both the Depositories. Currently, the Depository participants are required to obtain separate registration for both the depositories. Further the applicants are granted initial registration for five years and then permanent registrations. As per the new policy SEBI would process the registration application only for the first time initial or permanent registration, as the case may be,  through one depository and subsequent permissions to act as a DP of other depository, shall be granted by the concerned Depository after complying with the prescribed requirements. Thus, there will be a single SEBI registration for DP to operate in both the Depositories in India.</td>

(VI)  Granting Single Registration to Depository Participants With a view to further simplify the registration requirements for Depository Participants (DPs), the Board has approved the policy of granting single registration for the application of initial registration as well as the permanent registration for operating with both the Depositories. Currently, the Depository participants are required to obtain separate registration for both the depositories. Further the applicants are granted initial registration for five years and then permanent registrations. As per the new policy SEBI would process the registration application only for the first time initial or permanent registration, as the case may be,  through one depository and subsequent permissions to act as a DP of other depository, shall be granted by the concerned Depository after complying with the prescribed requirements. Thus, there will be a single SEBI registration for DP to operate in both the Depositories in India.</td>

Reduction of Fees payable by brokers by 25% and Calibration of other fees SEBI has been following the practice of calibrating the fees either upwards or downwards as per SEBI's requirements from time to time so as to keep a balance between the financial resources required to ensure regulatory efficiency while maintaining reasonableness to avoid any undue burden on any particular class of <mark>intermediaries</mark><mark>SEBI (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>regulation of Listed Entities 1. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("LODR Regulations") specifically provide for imposition of fines, etc. by the stock exchanges. However, a similar provision is not available in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 ("ICDR Regulations"), which contain provisions for companies for raising fund through public / rights / preferential / bonus issue of securities. 2. In order to empower the stock exchanges for effective regulation of listed entities, the Board has approved insertion of a similar clause in the ICDR Regulations to enable actions such as imposition of fines, suspension of trading, etc. by stock exchanges for contravention of ICDR Regulations. Based on the amended Regulations, SEBI would issue appropriate circular/guidelines providing for standard operating procedure for imposing of fines, etc. on violation of certain provisions of ICDR Regulations in consultation with stock exchanges. 3. This will reduce cost of undertaking adjudication/quasi-judicial actions in case of minor violations for the listed entities. VI. SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 to provide for a criteria alternative to "Net Worth" for municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations The SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities) Regulations, 2015 (ILDM) provides that a municipality or a Corporate Municipal Entity (CME) making public issue of debt securities, under these regulations shall not have negative net worth in any of three immediately preceding financial years. In order to facilitate issuance of debt securities under these regulations by entities other than CME, the Board agreed that the Municipalities making public issue of debt securities under these regulations shall have surplus as per its Income and Expenditure Statement, in any of the three immediately preceding financial years or any other financial criteria as specified by SEBI from time to time. VII. SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 On the basis of experience gained and with the purpose of streamlining and strengthening the settlement process, Board approved amendments to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014.  The amendment</mark>s, inter alia, provide for charging of interest in case of excessive delays in filing of applications or payment of settlement amount;  settlement Notice before issuance of a formal show cause notice, except those which are excluded from settlement; re-application of rejected or withdrawn applications in deserving cases, subject to payment of additional fees and interest; situations when  joint and several liability is taken into account for determining settlement amount and Incentive for defaulters to come voluntarily on their own, before initiation of investigation or enforcement action. VIII. Enabling Payment by Digital Mode The Board approved the proposal to amend various Regulations to enable the market participants to make payments to SEBI through digital mode (such as NEFT/RTGS) as well.</td>

The  government  may  consider  the  following  recommendations  in  respect  of  CSR  and FCRA. On CSR regulations: 1.  Allow  funding  to  NPOs  on  SSE  to  count  towards  CSR  commitments  of companies.  According  to  the  Draft  CSR  Policy  Amendment  Rules  2020,  recently released  by  the  MCA,  only  contributions to Section 8 companies that are registered with the  MCA  can  count  towards  CSR  contributions33.  This  appears  to  be  too  restrictive, especially in light of the fact that the SSE  will mandate  a reporting standard for all NPOs and  will  facilitate  fund-raising  by  them  through  directly  listed  instruments  or  through <mark>intermediary</mark>  funding  structures.  The  association  of  a  particular NPO with SSE, either in form  of  direct  listing  or  as  a  beneficiary  NPO  being  placed  in  the  SSE  directory,will signal their credibility and legitimacy. Further, the  existing IRs and ICAI, would work out a  set  of  financial  reporting  standards  for  all  NPOs.  The  SSE  may  assist and coordinate this  process.  Given  these  requirements,  it  would  appear  that  all  NPOs    on  SSE  should qualify  to  receive  CSR  funds,  and  therefore  the  Draft  Amendment  Rules  2020  may reflect this  provision. 2.  Allow CSR contributions to fund outcomes in the SSE’s funding structure 3B (see Figure 4.1 of Chapter 4, and Annexure 4, for details on how this funding structure works). As argued above, there is a strong case also, for extending CSR contributions to NPOs  benefiting  from  the  SSE’s  structure  3B  in  the  form  of  outcome  funding.  To enable  this  to  happen,  the  SSE  must  increase  awareness  about  this  possibility  for  using CSR  among  all  corporates.  Also,  the  following  changes  may  be made in section 135 of the Companies Act, and reflected in the Draft Amendment Rules  2020:</td>

To encourage innovation with minimal regulatory burden, SEBI shall consider exemptions/ relaxations, if any, which could be either in the form of a comprehensive exemption from certain regulatory requirements or selective exemptions on a case-by- case basis, depending on the FinTech solution to be tested. 14. Within the overarching principles of market integrity and investor protection, no exemptions would be granted from the extant investor protection framework, Know- Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules. 15. Entities desirous of participating in sandbox shall make an application, including exemption / relaxation being sought from relevant provisions of the applicable regulatory framework. 16. The registration granted by SEBI to all entities registered with SEBI under Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 is activity based. An entity which is registered with SEBI for a particular activity is authorized to carry out activity in that domain.
