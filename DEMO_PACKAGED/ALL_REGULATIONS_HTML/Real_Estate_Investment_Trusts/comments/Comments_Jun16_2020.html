Hence,  it  is  amply  clear  from  the  text  of  aforesaid provision that the applicability to make disclosure as per Regulation 7(1A)  is only and only on the acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights pursuant to  Regulation 11(1) of Takeover Regulations. As already stated above in our submission,  we  did  not  acquire  a  single  share  pursuant  to  Regulation  11(1)  of  Takeover  Regulations. Therefore, as we did not qualify to be an Acquirer as per Regulation 11(1)  of Takeover Regulations, the obligation to make any disclosure under Regulation 7(1A)  does not fall upon us in any manner.  It is a general practice of law that the sections/ regulations connected to each other  shall be read together. Therefore, applicability of Regulation 7(1A) can only be defined  when it is read with Regulation 11(1) of Takeover Regulations, the fact that we did not  acquire any share under Regulation 11(1) of Takeover Regulations keeps us out of the  purview of disclosure obligation under Regulation 7(1A) of Takeover Regulations.  </td>
