With an objective to improve the standard of disclosures in advertisements, effective implementation of regulatory intent and to remove difficulties in the application of Regulations, the following guidelines are being issued after consultation with AMFI, in accordance with Regulation 77 of the <mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>reit</mark>eration. The remaining 20% space can be used for the name of the mutual fund or logo or name of scheme, etc. Advertisements through audio media like radio, cassettes, CDs etc. shall also read the above statement in a way that is easily understandable to the listeners. 3.      Promotional Activities, Sales Literature Section II of aforesaid SEBI Guidelines issued on June 5, 2000 prescribes standards for various forms of communications by the mutual funds. It is clarified that the same standards shall be followed in case of activities organized to promote mutual funds/schemes/asset management companies. The above guidelines are also applicable for sales literature. With a view to broaden the definition of sales literature as specified in the Guidelines, it is clarified that it shall also include fund fact sheets, research reports, newsletters, performance reports or summaries, telemarketing scripts, seminar texts, press releases and reprints or excerpts of any other advertisements or published article, etc. 4.      Performance Advertisements (i)                 Disclosure of Benchmarks in Advertisements: The earlier guidelines (Section III, Clause 3.7) prescribe the type of benchmark indices that can be used in performance advertisements of mutual funds schemes. Subsequently, the disclosure of benchmarks in the offer documents and comparison of returns with benchmarks while publishing half-yearly results were made mandatory. Henceforth, all performance advertisements disclosing return statistics shall also mention the returns on the benchmark indices, during the same time periods. (ii)               Performance of Money Market Schemes: Referring to Clause 3.4 (Section III) of the guidelines, considering that the investors in cash/liquid/money market schemes have very short investment horizon, the mutual funds while advertising simple annualized returns of such schemes based on a period of 30 days can also advertise simple annualized returns based on 15 day period. (iii)             Impact of Distribution Taxes: While advertising returns by assuming reinvestment of dividends, if distribution taxes are excluded while calculating the returns, this fact may also be disclosed. (iv)              Pay-out of Dividend: While advertising pay-out of dividends, it shall be disclosed that after the payment of the dividend, the NAV will fall to the extent of the payout and distribution taxes (if applicable), in the main body of advertisement. 5.      Ranking advertisements Clause 3.7 d (1) of the aforesaid Guidelines, shall be substituted as follows: “Any ranking set forth in an advertisement or sales literature must be current to the most recent quarter ended or such periodicity / frequency of ranking as may be applicable, in the case of advertising prior to the submission for publication or in the case of sales literature prior to use”. All mutual funds shall comply with the requirements pertaining to advertisements in letter and spirit.</td>

This is felt necessary in the interest of the efficacy of the market. With effect from 3rd February, 2004, overseas derivative instruments such as Participatory Notes (PNs) against underlying Indian securities can be issued only to regulated entities and further transfers, if any, of these instruments can also be to other regulated entities only. FIIs/sub accounts are required to ensure that no further down stream issuance of such derivative instruments is made. In order to give effect to this decision, necessary amendments to the Regulations are being notified. To discharge regulatory responsibilities, SEBI would need to be in a position to ascertain, if circumstances so warrant, details of the ultimate investors investing through PNs etc. in the Indian market. The FIIs issuing such derivative instruments are therefore required to exercise due diligence and maintain complete details of the investors, based strictly on "know your client" principles. To facilitate the process of transition, derivative instruments already issued and outstanding against un-regulated entities will not be required to be terminated immediately. It has been decided that the said contracts will be permitted to expire or to be wound – down on maturity, or within a period of 5 years, whichever is earlier. Circular to this effect is also being issued.</td>

The  Group  <mark>reit</mark><mark>amendments may be carried out in FEMA regulations accordingly. 2.2.1.1  Investment  by  FPIs  in  corporate  bond  is  subject  to  overall  limit  prescribed  by  RBI from time to time. The current limit is Rs. 2443.23 billion. Limit monitoring is done through reporting  of  daily  utilisation  of  limits  by  each  FPI  through  their  custodian  banks  to  the depositories (NSDL and CDSL). In view of availability of a robust mechanism for capture of limits utilised by FPIs, FPIs may be permitted to transact in corporate bonds both in the OTC segment  and  in  the  Request  for  Quote  (RFQ)  platform  of  a  recognized  stock  exchange, subject to certain safeguards. This will also enable FPIs to trade directly on electronic trading platforms and thereby help in enhancing liquidity in the corporate bond market.
