Short Sale for this purpose would mean selling the shares without having the physical possession of the shares unless it is for squaring up of an earlier purchase in the same <mark>settlement</mark> and in the same Stock Exchange. This information would be required in respect of 60 actively traded scrips as per the enclosure. Â  Â  The Stock Exchanges would compile the scripwise cumulative Short Sale position and would make it public latest by the next day. The Exchanges which are computerised would give this information both on the notice boards and on the screen before opening of the next trading session and the Exchanges which are not yet computerised would display this information on the notice boards before commencement of the trading on the next day. This information would also be made available to the media.</td>

However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Governmentâs economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Governmentâs economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters.

The top 10 OEMâs account for about 70% of the total Companyâs sales. Accordingly, the Company is also dependent on a few distributors/dealers for a large part of offtake.Management Perception: The Company has long association with the existing OEMâs and Distributors. The Company is proposing to acquire new technology from M/s Hella KG Hueck & Co., Germany to further increase the share of Business with the OEMâs and to provide good quality products for being exported to various countries thus widening the supply base. 5.Trading Suspended at BSE Trading in Equity Shares of the Company was suspended at BSE in 1998 due to non-compliance of the Listing Agreement.

However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Governmentâs economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in Indiaâs economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors Â  lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.
