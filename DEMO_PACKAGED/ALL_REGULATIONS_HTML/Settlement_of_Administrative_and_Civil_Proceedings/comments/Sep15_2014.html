        <td>It was agreed that in these processes, certain participants were already enjoying a fair degree of automation especially in case of cross border/FII trades. The Committee studied a few international experiences in achieving STP.  It was observed that most  organizations  develop  their  own  front  and  back  office  systems  which  communicate  in  a particular manner. Also, some firms are highly automated while others are not so automated. This will  affect  achieving  higher  levels  of  STP.  Further  complicating  the  issue  is  the  availability  and proliferation of message standards like FIX, ISO7775, etc. Thus, as there is no standard for the industry as a whole, there is no interoperability between disparate systems which have made it very difficult to get complete and satisfactory connectivity. Here the committee was unanimous that  in  an  industry  wherein  there  are  no  solutions  already  in  place,  it  would  be  worthwhile  to mandate  messaging  standards  so  that  interoperability  can  be  achieved  leading  to  better connectivity between participants. An analogy that can be drawn here is that almost all people know to speak but proper communication is possible only if they speak the same or a common language.  A  common  messaging  standard  like  ISO15022  will  go  a  long  way  in  overcoming  this problem.  Message  templates  based  on  ISO  15022  formats  are  appended  to  this  report  in Annexure  IV.  The  proposed  ISO  15022  XML  standards  will  also  address  derivatives  and enhancement of scope of STP to this product suite will follow migration to XML. Recommendations: 1. On-line Connectivity between the depositories to permit easier <mark>settlement</mark><mark>regulations/bye-laws etc. to provide for recognition of paperless form of data and records. The Committee has already identified and made a list of bye-laws/regulations etc. that need to be changed in order to move to a paperless environment. The list is given as Annexure III.

        <td>"This is a key component in devising a regulatory system which is both effective in pursuit of its objectives, and also which wins the respect and perhaps even the approval of the regulated community", Sir Davies said. Skilled regulatory resources are scarce anywhere, and particularly in developing countries. It is therefore absolutely crucial that those resources are deployed where they can make most impact, and where the need is greatest. Stressing the need for international regulatory cooperation, Sir Davies said that "it is no longer adequate for a regulator in any country to focus on domestic standards only. Any regulator must ensure that its practices are compatible with internationally agreed codes." The Governor of Maharashtra, His Excellency Shri Mohammed Fazal, said that "the role of SEBI is of prime importance to safeguard the interests of the common investor who is totally ignorant about the business environment and global trends and hence cannot assess the future of the industries". Appreciating the "metamorphosis from physical to electronic transactions", as a "welcome development", the Governor said that "this is a healthy step towards gaining the confidence of small investors for which SEBI needs to be congratulated". Tracing the growth of the securities market in India in general and SEBI in particular, Chairman, SEBI, Shri G.N. Bajpai said that "we need <mark>regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures". Explaining further on the need for regulation, Shri Bajpai said "regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combined the elements of regulation and development. ." On liberalization versus regulation, the Chairman said that " there is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalization does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. ". "Reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI", Shri Bajpai said. "These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated", he added. Shri Bajpai also highlighted the reforms in the securities market in India viz. the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992 and issuance of Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines by SEBI, thereby the market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation, establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities and introduction of nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS). "A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the participants are safe and market integrity is protected", Shri Bajpai said and gave examples of Reduction of Trading Cycle to T+2, dematerialization of stocks, introduction of derivatives, establishment of Settlement Guarantee Fund, setting up of the Central Listing Authority etc. On the future initiatives of SEBI, Shri Bajpai spoke about the setting up of a national institute to build a cadre of professionals to man the specialized functions in the securities market, corporatisation and demutualization of exchanges, introduction if market wide straight through processing from trade initiation to settlement, migration to T+1 rolling settlement, continuous review and upgradation of accounting standards, disclosures, corporate governance practices in the interest of investors, continuous review and amendment</mark> of various regulations to bring them in tune with dynamics of market requirements and introduction of new products in the market to meet all kinds of needs of market participants. Concluding his speech, Shri Bajpai said that "SEBI is working continuously and in close co-ordination with the regulated and the government, to improve market design to bring in further efficiency and transparency to market and make available newer and newer products to meet the varying needs of market participants, while protecting investors in securities. The aim is to make Indian securities market a model for other jurisdictions to follow and make SEBI the most dynamic and respected regulator globally."</td>

April 01, 2003 and Para No. 6 of the circular relating to client code. As agreed, in the meeting with stock exchanges, depositories, market participants and RBI held on March 24, 2003 to take stock of the preparedness of the exchanges, depositories and the market participants in implementing the T+2 rolling settlement, it has been decided that the exchanges would generate a unique code for Mutual Funds and each scheme of a Mutual Fund, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their sub-accounts. As this would require the exchanges to put in place adequate systems and carry out software changes the exchanges are provided with three months time to implement the system. Till such time the present practice of putting client IDs at the time of order entry in case of FIIs and mutual funds shall continue. The exchanges are directed to make necessary amendment</mark>s to the bye-laws, rules and regulations for the implementation of the above decision immediately.

Vs UNION OF INDIA & Ors. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has passed an order dated January 27, 2005 pursuant to the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi’s direction in  C W P 6884 of 2003, disposing of the complaint dated August 27, 2003 lodged by Shri Sanjay Soni and Shri Sumeet Soni with SEBI.  It is held that there has been no violation of SEBI’s order dated October 28, 1998 and hence no further <mark>proceeding</mark><mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark>, 1997.  Pursuant to the passing of the order of SEBI, SIIL went in appeal to Appellate Authority in the Government of India which upheld SEBI order. On further appeal to Hon’ble High Court of Delhi, SEBI’s order was upheld subject to certain modification. SIIL on September 24, 2002 made the final payment to the eligible shareholders of Indal in terms of SEBI’s order and subsequent directions by the courts. However, while making the said payment, dividends declared (Rs.19.50 per share) by Indal on or after July 02, 1998 were deducted. SEBI received a complaint dated August 08, 2003 from Shri Sanjay Soni and Shri Sumeet Soni to direct SIIL to pay all the shareholders of Indal the said sum of  Rs. 19.50  per  share  with  interest  from September 26, 2002 till the date of payment. They filed a writ petition filed in the Hon’ble Delhi High Court by them (CWP  No. 6884/2003 - Sanjay Kumar Soni and Ors Vs UOI). While disposing the PIL, the Delhi High Court vide its Order dated October 29, 2003 held that it had no jurisdiction and that the matter did not involve public interest.  The Hon’ble Court directed SEBI to examine the letter dated August 27, 2003 and to record a finding. SEBI considered that while making the payment SIIL deducted the amount of dividend already paid by Indal on the shares held by the shareholders, since the shares had continued to remain in the name of the shareholders and could not be transferred to the acquirers for the interim period due to protracted litigation. SIIL paid interest to eligible Indal shareholders for the said period thereby complying with SEBI’s direction and Hon’ble High Court’s order. This also resulted in SIIL being entitled to ownership of the said shares during the interim period for which shareholders were compensated for loss of interest, entitling SIIL to the receipt of the benefits accrued on the said shares during the said period. Based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in Clariant International Ltd. and after thorough deliberation and examining the letter dated August 27, 2003, SEBI held that SIIL has complied with the order dated October 28, 1998 and the subsequent modification of the same vide order dated May 31, 2002 by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in Civil Petition No. 1598/99.

Further, the dealings by DKM as an unregistered sub-broker is prima facie in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of SEBI (Stockbroker and Sub Brokers) Rules, 1992. Furthermore, even GFPL was not registered with SEBI as a sub-broker and was thus acting as unregistered sub-broker in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Rule 3 of SEBI (Stockbrokers and Sub brokers) Rules, 1992. Apart from the above, brokers SAM Global Securities Ltd. and SMC Securities Ltd. have also prima facie violated SEBI circular SMDRP/Policy/Cir/49/2001 dated 22.10.01 by giving trading terminals at places other than registered office, branch office or registered sub-broker offices. It was prima facie seen that SMC/SAM has installed their terminals at various places in and around Sri Ganganagar (including Abohar). SMC/ SAM have a franchise agreement with GFPL, specifically for Sri Ganganagar location and their terminals at other places were also being managed by GFPL . Under the facts and circumstances as stated above, it is therefore incumbent upon the regulator to take emergent and remedial steps to safeguard the interests of the investors and the orderly development of the securities market. In view of the aforesaid and with a view to protect the interest of investors, Shri G. Anantharaman, Whole Time Member, SEBI has passed the above order.

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India.

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience.
