(b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

The Board took note of the report and approved the proposal to seek public comments on the recommendations of the Committee. The “Committee on Clearing Corporations” was constituted in November 2012 with the following broad terms of reference: a)    The viability of introducing a single Clearing Corporation (CC) or interoperability between different CCs b)   Investment by a recognized CC and the manner of utilization of profits of CCs c)    To examine and review the existing <mark>regulation of transfer of profits every year by the recognized Stock Exchanges to the fund of recognized CC d)   To define ‘the liquid assets’ of CCs for the purpose of calculation of Net worth of a clearing corporation e)    Any other matter that Committee considers relevant or incidental thereto - The issue of Transfer of Depositories’ profits to their Investor Protection Fund (IPF) was referred to the Committee. The main recommendations of the Committee are as follows: On interoperability / viability of single Clearing Corporation, the committee recommended that at this juncture, maintaining separate clearing corporations for each exchange would be prudent. However, SEBI may keep the interoperability option open and consider the proposal for implementation when ground conditions are met, which, inter alia, include clear intent of the participants coming together and having  a suitable  framework in place to the satisfaction of SEBI. On investments by Clearing Corporations, the committee recommended that Clearing Corporations may be permitted to invest in Fixed Deposits and Central Government Securities. However, Clearing Corporations may not be permitted to invest in instruments like Non-convertible debentures (NCDs), Commercial Papers (CPs), Money Market Mutual Funds, etc as these instruments may carry credit/liquidity risks. As the requirement of Core Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) has already been met, it was recommended that the requirement, under Regulation 33 of SECC Regulations, 2012, to transfer twenty five per cent of its profits by every recognised stock exchange to the Fund, as specified in Regulation 39, of the recognised clearing corporation, may no longer be required. However, Risk Management Review Committee of SEBI may review the stress test model used to determine the Minimum Required Corpus of Core SGF before making such departure. The ‘liquid assets’ of clearing corporations for the purpose of calculation of its Net worth, shall comprise Fixed Deposits/Central Government Securities. Other instruments like NCDs, CPs, money market mutual funds, etc. may carry credit/liquidity risks and hence, may not be considered towards calculation of liquid assets in net worth of CC.
