(b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

The applications from sub-brokers were <mark>invit</mark>ed in May, 1992 through recognised Stock Exchanges for registration with SEBI. A large number of applications were received and registration granted to approximately 1200 applicants fulfilling the requirements. It is felt that a large number of sub-brokers still are not registered with SEBI and therefore carrying out their activities without any valid legal sanction. SEBI at its end has started returning all incomplete applications directly to the applicants. Those who were already in the business of sub-broking and had applied for registration before 21st May, 1992 are being advised to re-submit their applications complete in all respects within two months failing which it shall be construed that they are acting as sub-brokers without holding certificates of registration in violation of section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992.

The Board approved certain amendments to the said Guidelines. Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines. Therefore, pre- issue share capital of an unlisted company held by Venture Capital Funds and Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board shall not be subject to lock in as per the Guidelines. However, the provisions of the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors), Regulations 2000 and any amendment thereto, in this regard, shall be applicable. Section C : This section lays down the revised requirements for filing the post issue monitoring reports with the Board for both book built portion and fixed price portion. Section D : Clause (b) to sub-rule (2) of Rule 19 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 has been amended vide Government notification no. G.S.R. 415(E) dated June 7, 2001, providing for public offer of atleast 10% instead of 25% subject to certain conditions. Hence clause 8.3.4 granting sector wise exemption stands deleted. Further, unlisted companies which have allotted shares to holders of securities in a listed company pursuant to a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation sanctioned by the appropriate High Court, have been approaching the Board for seeking exemption from making a public offer for listing their shares. Exemptions, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions are already being granted by way of communication to the Stock Exchanges. For the sake of greater transparency, the requirements in this regard are stated in this section. Section E The requirements related to issue of research reports by an issuer company in respect of public issues and rights issues have been laid down. Section F : The restriction of a minimum public issue size of Rs 25 crore in case of an Initial Public Offer through the book building route has been removed. It is again clarified that in terms of clause 11.3.5 (iv) of the Guidelines, for the under-subscribed portion of the fixed price portion in a book building issue, the issuer company has the option to allocate it to any category as it deems fit. Alternately, the issuer company has the option to let the under-subscribed portion lapse.

        <td>3.1 The Group held in all 10 meetings. The fundamental issues involved in the process of corporatisation and demutualisation of the stock exchanges were first identified. To obtain a better assessment and appreciation of these issues, the Group felt that it would be useful to first hear the different points of view of the major stakeholders in the process of corporatisation and demutualisation viz. the stock exchanges, brokers and investors. Accordingly, the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE), which had already done some work on the subject, and other stock exchanges were <mark>invit</mark><mark>invit</mark>ed the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to present their views. A questionnaire (Annexure 2) was also sent to all the stock exchanges for eliciting their views in writing. The responses to the questionnaire were compiled and analysed (Annexure 3). Delhi Stock exchange (DSE), the Federation of Indian Stock Exchange (FISE), representatives from the BSE Brokers’ Forum and Association of Members of National Stock Exchange of India (AMNI) also made presentations before the Group. Some of the investor association viz. Consumer Education and Research Centre (CERC), Ahmedabad, Jagrut Grahak Mandal and Investor Grievance Forum (IGF) were also given an opportunity to make presentations, but of these, only CERC made their submissions before the Group. 3.2 The Group studied the proposal of BSE on demutualisation submitted to SEBI. The Group also generally examined the existing articles of association, charters, trust deed, rules, regulations and bye laws of the various stock exchanges and in particular the peculiarities of the charter of BSE, for a better understanding and appreciation of the present legal structure and status of the stock exchanges in India. The present tax status of these stock exchanges in the light of the judgments given by the Income Tax Tribunal and the matters pending before the Income Tax Department, the tax implications of the process of corporatisation and demutualisation were also generally studied by the Group. The Group also took note of the experiences of other countries where the stock exchanges were already demutualised viz. Australia, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. In India the NSE stands out as one example of a demutualised stock exchange; the Group felt that it would be helpful if the capital, organizational and management structure of NSE, the shareholding pattern, could be compared with those of other demutualised international stock exchanges (Annexure 4). 4. Existing structure of the stock exchanges in India 4.1 In terms of the legal structure, the stock exchanges which are recognised under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act in India, could be segregated into two broad groups – 20 stock exchanges which were set up as companies, either limited by guarantees or by shares, and the 3 stock exchanges which are functioning as associations of persons (AOP) viz. BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange. The 20 stock exchanges which are companies are: the stock exchanges of Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Gauhati, Hyderabad, Interconnected SE, Jaipur, Ludhiana, Madras, Magadh, Managalore, NSE, Pune, OTCEI, Saurashtra-Kutch, Uttar Pradesh, and Vadodara. Of these, the stock exchanges of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, BSE, Calcutta, Delhi, Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh, Madras and Gauhati were given permanent recognition by the Central Government at the time of setting up of these stock exchanges. Apart from NSE, all stock exchanges whether established as corporate bodies or Association of Persons (AOPs), are non-profit making organizations. 4.2 It is thus clear that BSE, ASE and Indore Stock Exchange will have to be both corporatised and demutualised, while of the balance 20 stock exchanges, 18 stock exchanges which are already corporate entities, will only have to be demutualised. Two stock exchanges, NSE and OTCEI, are not only corporatised but also demutualised with segregation of ownership and trading rights of members. Further, NSEIL is a for-profit company and the Board of NSEIL comprises of representatives of shareholders, (some of whom have 100% stock broking subsidiaries) and outside non-shareholder directors. But even these two stock exchanges may if necessary, have to undergo changes in organizational structure consequential to the recommendations of the Group so that a common structural model is adopted by the all the stock exchanges.</td>
