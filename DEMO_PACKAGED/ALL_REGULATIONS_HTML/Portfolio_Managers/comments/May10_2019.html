        <td>IV. Expanding the framework of Offer for Sale (OFS) of shares through stock exchange mechanism In order to encourage retail participation in OFS, to enable all large shareholders including non-promoter shareholders to use the OFS mechanism and also to expand the universe of companies to whom OFS mechanism is available, presently being 100 top companies only, the Board has approved the following modifications to the existing OFS mechanism: (1)  Reservation for retail individual investors (i)  Minimum 10% of the issue size shall be reserved for retail investors i.e. for the investors bidding for amounts less than Rs. two lakhs. In case this percentage is not fully utilized, the unutilized portion may be offered to other investors. (ii)  Seller of shares may offer a discount to retail investors in accordance with the framework specified from time to time. (2) Allowing non-promoter shareholders to offer shares through OFS Non-promoter shareholders having (shareholding) more thatn 10% or such percentage as specified by SEBI from time to time shall be eligible to use OFS. (3)  Expanding the list of eligible companies OFS mechanism shall be made available for shareholders of top 200 companies by market capitalization. V.   Common KYC in Financial Sector The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors. Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the <mark>amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector. This will  not only reduce the paper-work and bring down cost of operations for the investors as well as for the intermediaries, but will also save the investors from the hassle of getting KYC done again by the intermediaries regulated by other financial sector regulators.
