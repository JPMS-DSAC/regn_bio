        <td>Some of the inspection reports of mutual funds indicate substantial depletion of assets of some of the schemes. We have also come across instances wherein the companies have never paid interest and principal amount to mutual funds particularly when the securities were bought on private placement basis. While going through the portfolio statements of the mutual funds, we find non-performing assets (NPAs) and some of the scrips valued at a negligible amount. All this is reflected in the NAVs of the mutual funds.

Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines.

        <td>All Mutual Funds registered with SEBI Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) Dear Sirs, Advertisements by Mutual Funds As you are aware, SEBI had earlier issued a set of guidelines on the captioned subject vide Circular No. MFD/CIR/4/51/2000 dated June 05, 2000. With an objective to improve the standard of disclosures in advertisements, effective implementation of regulatory intent and to remove difficulties in the application of Regulations, the following guidelines are being issued after consultation with AMFI, in accordance with Regulation 77 of the <mark>SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations</mark><mark>research report</mark>s, newsletters, performance reports or summaries, telemarketing scripts, seminar texts, press releases and reprints or excerpts of any other advertisements or published article, etc. 4.      Performance Advertisements (i)                 Disclosure of Benchmarks in Advertisements: The earlier guidelines (Section III, Clause 3.7) prescribe the type of benchmark indices that can be used in performance advertisements of mutual funds schemes. Subsequently, the disclosure of benchmarks in the offer documents and comparison of returns with benchmarks while publishing half-yearly results were made mandatory. Henceforth, all performance advertisements disclosing return statistics shall also mention the returns on the benchmark indices, during the same time periods. (ii)               Performance of Money Market Schemes: Referring to Clause 3.4 (Section III) of the guidelines, considering that the investors in cash/liquid/money market schemes have very short investment horizon, the mutual funds while advertising simple annualized returns of such schemes based on a period of 30 days can also advertise simple annualized returns based on 15 day period. (iii)             Impact of Distribution Taxes: While advertising returns by assuming reinvestment of dividends, if distribution taxes are excluded while calculating the returns, this fact may also be disclosed. (iv)              Pay-out of Dividend: While advertising pay-out of dividends, it shall be disclosed that after the payment of the dividend, the NAV will fall to the extent of the payout and distribution taxes (if applicable), in the main body of advertisement. 5.      Ranking advertisements Clause 3.7 d (1) of the aforesaid Guidelines, shall be substituted as follows: “Any ranking set forth in an advertisement or sales literature must be current to the most recent quarter ended or such periodicity / frequency of ranking as may be applicable, in the case of advertising prior to the submission for publication or in the case of sales literature prior to use”. All mutual funds shall comply with the requirements pertaining to advertisements in letter and spirit.</td>

        <td>IV. Expanding the framework of Offer for Sale (OFS) of shares through stock exchange mechanism In order to encourage retail participation in OFS, to enable all large shareholders including non-promoter shareholders to use the OFS mechanism and also to expand the universe of companies to whom OFS mechanism is available, presently being 100 top companies only, the Board has approved the following modifications to the existing OFS mechanism: (1)  Reservation for retail individual investors (i)  Minimum 10% of the issue size shall be reserved for retail investors i.e. for the investors bidding for amounts less than Rs. two lakhs. In case this percentage is not fully utilized, the unutilized portion may be offered to other investors. (ii)  Seller of shares may offer a discount to retail investors in accordance with the framework specified from time to time. (2) Allowing non-promoter shareholders to offer shares through OFS Non-promoter shareholders having (shareholding) more thatn 10% or such percentage as specified by SEBI from time to time shall be eligible to use OFS. (3)  Expanding the list of eligible companies OFS mechanism shall be made available for shareholders of top 200 companies by market capitalization. V.   Common KYC in Financial Sector The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors. Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the <mark>amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector. This will  not only reduce the paper-work and bring down cost of operations for the investors as well as for the intermediaries, but will also save the investors from the hassle of getting KYC done again by the intermediaries regulated by other financial sector regulators. VI.  SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 (1)  The Board considered and approved the draft SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014. (2)   The SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 have been framed based on consultation with market participants and comments received from the public on the consultation paper and draft regulations for research analysts disseminated for this purpose. (3)   The salient features of the SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 are as under: (i)   The Regulations seek to register and regulate individual research analysts and entities engaged in issuance of research reports or research analyses and/or publication of substance of research report or who provides research report or who makes 'buy/sell/hold’ recommendation of a security or who make recommendation on public offers such as Brokerage houses, merchant bankers, proxy advisors etc. (ii)  Investment Advisers, Credit Rating  Agencies, Portfolio Managers, Asset Management Companies, fund managers of Alternative Investment Funds or Venture Capital Funds shall not be required to be registered under these regulations. (iii)   Internal communications that are not given to current or prospective clients and periodic reports or other communications prepared for unit holders of Mutual Fund or Alternative Investment Fund or clients of Portfolio Managers and Investment Advisers are not included in the definition of research report. (iv)   Requirements relating to experience, qualification, certification and capital adequacy have been prescribed in the regulations for an individual person or an entity to act as research analyst.

(xii)   The regulations specify provisions in relation to disclosures to be made in research reports and disclosures to be made during the public appearance. (xiii)   The regulations specify restrictions on trading and on compensation of the persons who make comments or recommendations concerning securities or public offer through public media.

Expanding the framework of Offer for Sale (OFS) of shares through stock exchange mechanism In order to encourage retail participation in OFS, to enable all large shareholders including non-promoter shareholders to use the OFS mechanism and also to expand the universe of companies to whom OFS mechanism is available, presently being 100 top companies only, the Board has approved the following modifications to the existing OFS mechanism: (1)  Reservation for retail individual investors (i)  Minimum 10% of the issue size shall be reserved for retail investors i.e. for the investors bidding for amounts less than Rs. two lakhs. In case this percentage is not fully utilized, the unutilized portion may be offered to other investors. (ii)  Seller of shares may offer a discount to retail investors in accordance with the framework specified from time to time. (2) Allowing non-promoter shareholders to offer shares through OFS Non-promoter shareholders having (shareholding) more thatn 10% or such percentage as specified by SEBI from time to time shall be eligible to use OFS. (3)  Expanding the list of eligible companies OFS mechanism shall be made available for shareholders of top 200 companies by market capitalization. V.   Common KYC in Financial Sector The centralized KYC system introduced by SEBI has evolved and stabilized with data of about 1.95 crore KYCs of investors. The client who has already done the KYC with any SEBI registered intermediary need not undergo the same process again when he approaches another intermediary. The system has benefited the investors. Currently, the facility of sharing of KYC information is available only among SEBI registered intermediaries. Board has now approved the <mark>amendment to SEBI {KYC (Know Your Client) Registration Agency} Regulations, 2011 for sharing of KYC information available on the centralised system with the entities regulated by other financial sector regulators. This would further facilitate the KYC process for the investors in the entire financial sector. This will  not only reduce the paper-work and bring down cost of operations for the investors as well as for the intermediaries, but will also save the investors from the hassle of getting KYC done again by the intermediaries regulated by other financial sector regulators. VI.  SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 (1)  The Board considered and approved the draft SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014. (2)   The SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 have been framed based on consultation with market participants and comments received from the public on the consultation paper and draft regulations for research analysts disseminated for this purpose. (3)   The salient features of the SEBI (Research Analyst) Regulations, 2014 are as under: (i)   The Regulations seek to register and regulate individual research analysts and entities engaged in issuance of research reports or research analyses and/or publication of substance of research report or who provides research report or who makes 'buy/sell/hold’ recommendation of a security or who make recommendation on public offers such as Brokerage houses, merchant bankers, proxy advisors etc. (ii)  Investment Advisers, Credit Rating  Agencies, Portfolio Managers, Asset Management Companies, fund managers of Alternative Investment Funds or Venture Capital Funds shall not be required to be registered under these regulations. (iii)   Internal communications that are not given to current or prospective clients and periodic reports or other communications prepared for unit holders of Mutual Fund or Alternative Investment Fund or clients of Portfolio Managers and Investment Advisers are not included in the definition of research report.
