Any other factors considered relevant by SEBI REGULATORY EXEMPTIONS 13. To encourage innovation with minimal regulatory burden, SEBI shall consider exemptions/ relaxations, if any, which could be either in the form of a comprehensive exemption from certain regulatory requirements or selective exemptions on a case-by- case basis, depending on the FinTech solution to be tested. 14. Within the overarching principles of market integrity and investor protection, no exemptions would be granted from the extant investor protection framework, Know- Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules. 15. Entities desirous of participating in sandbox shall make an application, including exemption / relaxation being sought from relevant provisions of the applicable regulatory framework. 16. The registration granted by SEBI to all entities registered with SEBI under Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 is activity based. An entity which is registered with SEBI for a particular activity is authorized to carry out activity in that domain. In order to enable the cross domain testing of FinTech solutions, an existing registered entity would be required to first obtain a limited certificate of registration for the category of intermediary for which it seeks to test the FinTech solution(s).This concept of limited 6 | P a g e registration shall facilitate the entities to operate in a Regulatory Sandbox without being subjected to the entire set of regulatory requirements to carry out that activity. 17. Accordingly, regulatory relaxations from various SEBI regulations may be provided after analyzing specific sandbox testing applications. A reference list is given at Annexure-3 with examples of the regulatory requirements that will be mandatory and those for which SEBI may consider granting relaxation during the sandbox testing. 18. SEBI has notified SEBI Regulatory Sandbox (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 so as to enable the respective department(s) to grant relaxation(s)/exemption(s), as may be deemed fit, while granting such limited certificate of registration.
