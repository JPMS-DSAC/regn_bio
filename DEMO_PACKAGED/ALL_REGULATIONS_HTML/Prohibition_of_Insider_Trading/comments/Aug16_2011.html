        <td>Pursuant	 to	 the	 recommendations	 made	 by	 the	 Secondary	 Market Advisory	 Committee	 of	 SEBI,	 it	 was	 decided	 that	 in	 case	 of	 a	 buy transaction	 in	 cash	 market,	 VaR	 margins,	 extreme	 loss	 margins	 and mark	to	market	losses	together	should	not	exceed	the	purchase	value of	the	transaction.	Further,	in	case	of	a	sale	transaction	in	cash	market, the	existing	practice	will	continue. It	 was	 decided	 that,	 the	 mutual	 funds,	 while	 reporting	 their	 trades in	corporate	bonds	should	also	report	their	inter-scheme	transfers	on the	 BSE/NSE/FIMMDA	 reporting	 platforms.	 The	 mutual	 funds,	 or the	 brokers/intermediaries	 acting	 on	 their	 behalf	 should	 ensure	 that inter-scheme	 transfers	 are	 indicated	 separately	 while	 reporting	 the same.	The	authorised	stock	exchanges	and	FIMMDA	were	instructed to	put	in	place	suitable	systems	to	capture	the	aforesaid	inter-scheme transfers.	Such	trades	should	be	reported	distinctly	from	other	OTC trades. Instructions	 were	 issued	 to	 all	 registered	 merchant	 bankers	 for	 due compliance	 in	 case	 of	 changes	 in	 the	 draft	 offer	 documents	 due	 to developments	 before	 the	 offer	 document	 is	 filed	 with	 Registrar	 of Companies	 (RoC)	 or	 Designated	 Stock	 Exchange	 (DSE)	 which	 may result	 in	 major	 deviations	 from	 the	 draft	 offer	 document	 that	 was available	in	public	domain.	Accordingly,	it	was	decided	to	classify	the changes	 in	 offer	 documents	 which	 may	 call	 for	 (i)	 filing	 of	 updated offer	 document,	 with	 the	 Board	 along	 with	 fees	 and	 (ii)	 filing	 of updated	offer	document,	with	the	Board,	without	fees. Pursuant	 to	 amendment	 of	 SEBI	 (Portfolio	 Managers)	 Regulations 1993 vide	notification	dated	11	August,	2008,	the	Circular	No.	SEBI/ RPM	circular	No.	2	(2002-2003)	dated	January	14,	2003	specifying	the additional	<mark>information</mark>	required	for	registration/renewal	of	registration as	Portfolio	Managers	circular	was	amended. In	 order	 to	 align	 the	 disclosure	 requirements	 pertaining	 to	 issuance of	 Indian	 Depository	 Receipts	 (IDRs)	 with	 the	 recent	 amendments 168 Contd.</td>
