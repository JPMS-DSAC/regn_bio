The committee has figures of turnover in the Bombay Stock Exchange, however, the break-up of the turnover related to different categories enumerated above is not available from all over the country. The committees had therefore, to rely on empirical methods. For example, while brokerage scales are fixed by stock exchanges and brokers are required to pass on the price paid by a broker on the floor of the exchange to the client , frequent complaints are received from investors that these norms are not followed. Reliable data are not available as to the magnitude of the difference between the price paid by a broker and the price charged to a client. Maximum brokerage chargeable is 2.5 percent. No data on actual brokerage is available because a <mark>trading</mark><mark>trading</mark> turnover but would contribute to income. However, taking into account different factors the committee has, therefore, assumed that even at a conservative estimate gross income of one percent on the turnover (as defined in the Regulations and as mentioned above) would not be an unfair assumption. 3. The committee has worked out examples to illustrate the extent of incidence of registration fees payable by brokers with a turnover of Rs.1 crore, Rs. 10 crores and Rs. 100 crores. The table below illustrates the figures.</td>

Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9.

Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each.

(For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13.

The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

(Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

        <td>Upon being mandated to regulate collective investment schemes, SEBI had directed all the existing entities which were operating such schemes, to file <mark>information</mark><mark>information</mark><mark>information</mark><mark>information</mark> filed with SEBI, a substantially large number of schemes are operating on a small level and it is possible that they would not be in a position to comply with the regulatory requirement and restructure their operations in accordance with these regulation. Moreover, they are unlikely to have reached minimum economic levels required to carry out commercial plantations. These schemes should therefore be given the option of winding up and repaying the investors, or merge with some other schemes so that they satisfy the regulations. They would be given reasonable time to restructure themselves, grow larger or wind up. These schemes thus would be given adequate time to restructure their operations and capitalise to the required extent. The committee has recommended that a period of 3 years should be allowed for these schemes for transition to the new regulations. However, during the transitory period, issues of investor protection need to be addressed. In this regard, it is recommended that these schemes should be asked to form a compliance committee with a minimum of 60% representation of outside persons including representatives of the investors. The role of this compliance committee would be to identify and separate the scheme assets and appoint third party custodians to take charge of the assets of the scheme. The compliance committee would also be responsible to ensure implementation of adequate controls and maintenance of statutory records and books of accounts. The committee should take steps to communicate with the investors who have invested in these schemes and ensure adequate disclosures and reporting to them about the progress of the scheme. The compliance committee would also cause the accounts of the scheme to be audited and a technical appraisal to be undertaken every year. In case the compliance committee is of the opinion that it is not possible to continue the scheme on a viable basis, it would take steps to wind up the scheme and repay the investors from the realisation of the proceeds of the assets. CONCLUSION: In accordance with the press release issued by the Central Government on 18th November, 1997, the committee requests SEBI to make these draft regulations available for public discussion. The investors who have invested in such schemes as well as entities running such schemes should be requested to give their comments on the regulations to SEBI. The report will be finalised in light of the comments received from public.     (S.A. DAVE)</td>

These schemes thus would be given adequate time to restructure their operations and capitalise to the required extent. The committee has recommended that a period of 3 years should be allowed for these schemes for transition to the new regulations. However, during the transitory period, issues of investor protection need to be addressed. In this regard, it is recommended that these schemes should be asked to form a compliance committee with a minimum of 60% representation of outside persons including representatives of the investors. The role of this compliance committee would be to identify and separate the scheme assets and appoint third party custodians to take charge of the assets of the scheme. The compliance committee would also be responsible to ensure implementation of adequate controls and maintenance of statutory records and books of accounts. The committee should take steps to communicate with the investors who have invested in these schemes and ensure adequate disclosures and reporting to them about the progress of the scheme. The compliance committee would also cause the accounts of the scheme to be audited and a technical appraisal to be undertaken every year. In case the compliance committee is of the opinion that it is not possible to continue the scheme on a viable basis, it would take steps to wind up the scheme and repay the investors from the realisation of the proceeds of the assets. CONCLUSION: In accordance with the press release issued by the Central Government on 18th November, 1997, the committee requests SEBI to make these draft regulations available for public discussion. The investors who have invested in such schemes as well as entities running such schemes should be requested to give their comments on the regulations to SEBI. The report will be finalised in light of the comments received from public.     (S.A. DAVE)</td>

The Board approved certain amendments to the said Guidelines. Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines. Therefore, pre- issue share capital of an unlisted company held by Venture Capital Funds and Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board shall not be subject to lock in as per the Guidelines.

G.S.R. 415(E) dated June 7, 2001, providing for public offer of atleast 10% instead of 25% subject to certain conditions. Hence clause 8.3.4 granting sector wise exemption stands deleted. Further, unlisted companies which have allotted shares to holders of securities in a listed company pursuant to a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation sanctioned by the appropriate High Court, have been approaching the Board for seeking exemption from making a public offer for listing their shares. Exemptions, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions are already being granted by way of communication to the Stock Exchanges.

Section F : The restriction of a minimum public issue size of Rs 25 crore in case of an Initial Public Offer through the book building route has been removed.

For all practical purposes, as in the case of any other corporate body, the CEO would be solely responsible for the day to day functioning of the stock exchange which would also include compliance with various regulations and risk management practices. To strengthen the management of the stock exchange, the stock exchanges should also appoint a professionally qualified Whole time Director on the Board of the stock exchange. It is important that both the CEO and the Whole time Director should be permanent members of the Board of the stock exchange. In addition to the above-mentioned posts, the stock exchanges may appoint a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) who need not be a member of the stock exchange Board. In the view of the Committee, once the demutualisation exercise is carried out and the twin rights of ownership and <mark>trading</mark> now embedded in a membership card are segregated and the representation of the brokers reduced in the governing boards, the scope of interference by the brokers in the day to day functioning of the stock exchange would be greatly diminished.

        <td> In 1980s and 19990s, it was increasingly realized that an efficient and well developed securities market is essential for sustained economic growth. Without venturing into a detailed discussion, it would suffice if I just say that the securities market fosters economic growth to the extent it augments the quantities of real savings and capital formation from a given level of national income and it raises productivity of investment by improving allocation of investible funds. The extent depends on the quality of the securities market. In order to improve the quality of the market, that is, to improve market efficiency, enhance transparency, preventunfair trade practices and bring the Indian market up to international standards, a package of reforms consisting of measures to liberalise, regulate and develop the securities market is being implemented since early 1990s. Let me sound a little academic, in presence of Sir Davies, to explain why the package included liberalization, regulation and development? Why liberalization? I strongly believe that the more liberalised a securities market is, the better is its impact on economic growth. Interventions in the securities market were originally designed to help governments expropriate much of the seigniorage and control and direct the flow of funds for favoured uses. These helped governments to tap savings on a low or even no-cost basis. Besides, government used to allocate funds from the securities market to competing enterprises and decide the terms of allocation. The result was channelisation of resources to favoured uses rather than sound projects. In such circumstances accumulation of capital per se meant little, where rate of return on some investments were negative while extremely remunerative investment opportunities were foregone. This kept the average rate of return from investment lower than it would otherwise have been and, given the cost of savings, the resulting investment was less than optimum. Hence, it was necessary to do away interventions hindering optimum allocation of resources. Why Regulation? Do you know what a ‘security’ is? Our laws provide an inclusive definition of ‘securities’. It says that ‘securities’ include shares, bonds, debentures, units of CIS, etc. It does not define in terms of ingredients an instrument must have to be considered as ‘securities’. I have not seen an ingredient type definition of ‘securities’ in any other jurisdiction. It is precisely because ‘securities’ are most insecure instruments. The only ingredient common to all types of securities is its associated ‘insecurity’. It is like a blind man named padmalochan. If it is a market for such insecure instruments, market would collapse if some body does not regulate away the insecurities. We need regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures. In the absence of regulation by a specialized agency, each participant would do its own due diligence before undertaking any transaction in the market. This imposes huge social costs. Besides, regulations signal minimum standards of quality and hence enhance confidence in markets. With a known asymmetric <mark>information</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>price sensitive</mark><mark>information</mark><mark>information</mark>al efficiency of markets. It enabled market participants to see the full market on real-time, making the market transparent. It allowed a large number of participants, irrespective of their geographical locations, to trade with one another simultaneously, improving the depth and liquidity of the market – over 10,000 terminals creating waves by clicks from over 400 towns / cities in India. It provided full anonymity by accepting orders, big or small, from members without revealing their identity, thus providing equal access to everybody. It also provided a perfect audit trail, which helps to resolve disputes by logging in the trade execution process in entirety.</td>

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

If there is any change in the Exim Policy of the Govt. of India, which has the effect of reducing the basic custom duty on Auto Components, it may result in lower sales realization of components manufactured by the Company. 2.Risk of exchange rate fluctuations Foreign exchange fluctuations could have an impact on prices of products manufactured by the Company, which are being made by using some of the imported components and raw materials. The Company has an External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to the extent of Euro 19,22,583.76 and any fluctuation in Exchange Rate would increase/decrease the ultimate liability under this head. However, the Company has been providing for this contingency on yearly basis in the Books of Accounts. 3.Risk of political instability The performance of the Company may be affected by a number of factors beyond its control including political and economic developments both in India and worldwide.4.Risk of Regulatory uncertainty The business of the Company is subject to the regulations of Government of India. Changes in the fiscal policies adopted by the Government could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company. A significant change in the Government’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could affect business and economic conditions in India and the business of the Company, in particular, changes in other regulations the environmental norms may affect the operations of the Company. (vii)____________________________________________________________5.Risk of economic slowdown The overall demand for the products manufactured by the company are closely linked to number of Commercial Vehicles manufactured in India which in turn linked to macro parameters like GDP growth, increase in population overall growth of the economy and other related matters. The slowdown in India’s economic growth will have an adverse impact on the demand for products manufactured by the Company.Notes to risk factors   lNet worth before the issue (as on 31st December, 2003) is Rs.(1418.72lacs) and the issue size is Rs. 634.28 lakhs.

        <td>“I am delighted to be here to inaugurate SEBI’s new permanent home.  My thoughts go back to 1992, when the Securities and Exchange Board of India came into its own as a statutory regulatory body. …..I had announced our government’s intentions to make SEBI a statutory body endowed with all the privileges that such institutions enjoy all over the world. And I am happy, that I was able to fulfil that commitment in time. SEBI has been fortunate to have had men of integrity and commitment at the top and competent professionals at all levels. This has greatly helped SEBI establish its credibility in the market and with investors and in the process has enhanced our country’s overall credit ratings in the world market. All modern economies, therefore, recognise the need for sound regulation of securities markets. This is needed not just for proper functioning of these markets, but also for their very survival. It is good regulation that will ensure that markets are safe and perceived to be safe by the public at large. It is good regulation that will ensure that necessary <mark>information</mark> is available to the public so that they can take informed decisions about investments. It is good regulation that will further ensure that while engines of growth are allowed to move at full speed, there is no space for manipulators in the system. Today securities market regulation has evolved to include three principal objectives: (a) Fair, efficient and transparent markets; (b) Investor protection; (c) Reduction of systemic risk. I am happy to say that SEBI is shouldering the responsibility in all these three areas with great deal of efficiency and commitment.  Today, India is experiencing rapid economic growth. If we want to share this prosperity with a large cross-section of our society, we must ensure that the ownership of equity is spread as widely as possible. Individual citizens can participate in the capital market, both directly and indirectly, through financial institutions, such as mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies. It is the task of the securities regulator to look after the interests of the investor in our country. If the regulator is able to ensure that the price discovery process is both efficient and transparent, with high disclosure and regulatory standards and with sound liquidity and risk management in place, the concerns of individual investors will be adequately addressed.</td>
