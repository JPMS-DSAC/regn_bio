Registrars shall give in-house number on the reverse of the stockinvest as indicated in the applications and thereafter detach the stockinvest and keep them in safe custody. The in-house number should bear distinctive character.3. Registrars shall process applications with stockinvest simultaneously with other applications for working out the basis of allotment and despatch of appropriate advice. For the purpose of allotment, applications received with stockinvest should invariably be given the same treatment as applications received with other modes of payment. Any deviation from this will be viewed seriously. 4. Registrars shall generate report for non-allottees and all successful/partially successful allottees. Only stockinvests of such successful applicants shall be segregated, while other stockinvests shall be cancelled. 5. In case of non-allottees / partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest, the cancelled stockinvests shall be returned to the applicants alongwith the relative advice. The stockinvest should bear stamps such as -"CANCELLED" and "NOT ALLOTTED" across the face of the instrument. 6. In case of full or partial allotment, the right hand portion of the stockinvest shall be filled in for the amount payable on the shares/debentures etc. 'allotted and the stockinvests shall be discharged on behalf of the Issuer company for collection of proceeds. 7. The Registrars shall arrange to obtain authorisations from the Issuer companies to sign on their behalf and- for realising the proceeds of stockinvest from the Issuing banks or for affixing "non-allotment" advice on the instrument, or cancelling the instrument of non-allottees or partially successful allottees with more than one stockinvest. 8. Registrars shall deposit stockinvest, duly filled in and sorted out "issuer bank branch-wise" (except at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras as in the case of cheques/drafts), with the company's banker whose name shall be intimated to him in advance by the company and who will take further steps to realise the amount of the stockinvest from the issuing bank through banking channel and credit the company's account. 9. Registrars shall advise the investors of the outcome of allotment by issuing allotment advice/ despatching of share./ debenture certificates etc. without loss of time.  10. Registrars shall reject multiple applications received with a single stockinvest. 11. Registrars shall ensure that the stockinvest is utilised by the purchaser(s) and the purchaser's name/ name of one of the purchasers is invariably indicated as the first applicant in the share application form. Thus, if the signature of the purchaser on the stockinvest and the Annexure to Annexure "B"Size of public offer - 2,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each at a premium of Rs. 40/- No. of times Oversubscribed - 3 times Total Number of shares applied for - 6,00,000 equity shares  NOTE(A) In the above example the number of shares allocable to each category of the applicants have been arrived at in Column No, 5 in proportion to the number of times the issue has been oversubscribed.(B) * In the case of category No. 4 number of shares actually allotted is less than the number of shares available for allotment in that category on proportionate basis. Further, in category 5, shares allotted to the successful applicants in that category is more than the shares available for allocation in that category. This is on account of rounding off to the nearest hundred. With the result after making adjustment, 3300 shares remain to be allotted from the offering. This number has been included in the category 1 i.e. the applicants who had applied for minimum number of shares. (C) In the case of applicant in categories 1 & 2 who have applied for 100 and 200 shares respectively, the applicants in each of the above categories shall be entitled to 33 and 66 equity shares respectively which have been rounded off to marketable lots of 100 each. As a result the successful applicants shall be getting 100 shares. In the case of applicants in category 3, 4, 5 and 6, they should be respectively entitled to allotment of 100, 133, 166 and 200 equity shares respectively. However, the actual entitlement would be rounded off to 100 shares each for categories 3 & 4 and 200 shares for categories 5 & 6 respectively. S.

(For the purpose, the last day for use of the stockinvest for submitting share application to the bank is indicated on the face of the stockinvest with a notation 'To be used before ..........".) 13.

Registrars shall regularly maintain a proper record of applications received with stockinvests, giving, inter-alia, the name of the investor, station code, number and value of stockinvest attached, utilised and returned to enable the Registrars to reply to the Investors' queries promptly. The Registrars are advised to follow the procedure detailed above meticulously. Non-compliance of any aspect would invite penal action by SEBI.  ***************************ANNEXURE "B"Basis of Allotment on OversubscriptionThe allotment shall be subject to allotment in marketable lots, on a proportionate basis as explained below: (a) Applicants will be categorised according to the number of securities applied for.  (b) The total number of securities to be allotted to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. the total number of securities applied for in that category (number of applicants in the category x number of securities applied for) multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio as illustrated below.   Total number of applicants In category of 100s - 1,500 Total number of securities applied for - 1,50,000 Number of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to category - 1,50,000 x 1/3 = 50,000(c) Number of the securities to be allotted to the successful allottees will be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e. total number of securities applied for by each applicant in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio. (Please see Annexure).  Number of securities applied for by - 100 each applicantNumber of times oversubscribed - 3 Proportionate allotment to eachsuccessful applicant - 100 x 1/3 = 33 (to be rounded off to 100)(Please see clause'd' below)(d) All the applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than 100 securities per applicant (say for example which may arise in issues of shares with a premium of Rs. 40/- per share) the allotment shall be made as follows: (i) Each successful applicant shall be allotted a minimum of 100 securities; and(ii) The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by drawal of lots in such a manner that the total number of securities allotted in that category is equal to the number of securities worked out as per (b) above. (e) If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is more than 100 but is not a multiple of 100 (which is the marketable lot), the number in excess of the multiple of 100 would be rounded off to the higher multiple of 100 if that number is 50 or higher. If that number is lower than 50, it would be rounded off to the lower multiple of 100. (As an illustration, if the proportionate allotment works out to 250, the applicant would be allotted 300 securities. If however the proportionate allotment works out to 240, the applicant would be allotted 200 securities). All applicants in such categories would be allotted securities arrived at after such rounding off. (f) If the securities allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the securities allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available securities for allotment shall be first adjusted against any other category, where the allocated securities are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category. The balance securities if any, remaining after such adjustment will be, added to the category comprising of applicants applying for minimum number of securities. By way of illustration a reference may be made to category No. 5 in the Annexure i.e. the applicants applying for 500 securities. These applicants are entitled on proportionate basis to be allotted 40,000 securities at 200 securities per applicant. However, the number of securities allocated to that category on proportionate basis is only 33,300. The deficit of 6,700 securities will be taken from the surplus securities, available in category 4. In that category as against total number of 30,000 securities to be allotted, the actual securities allocated on proportionate basis is 40,000 securities leaving the surplus of 10,000 securities. After adding 6,700 securities to the category No. 5, the balance of 3,300 securities will be added back to the category No. 1, which comprises the applicants applying for minimum number of securities. As a result, the number of successful allottees in that category will increase by 33 from 500 to 533. The above principle is illustrated in the Annexure.(g) As the process of rounding off to the nearer multiple of.100 may result in the actual allotment being higher than the securities offered, it would be necessary to allow a 10% margin i.e. the final allotment may be higher upto 110% of the size of the actual offering.</td>

The Board approved certain amendments to the said Guidelines. Earlier, in the meeting held on September 14, 2000, the Board had also decided to include the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board, in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers" under the Guidelines. The Board, in its meeting held on July 9, 2001 approved inclusion of State Industrial Development Corporations in the definition of "Qualified Institutional Buyers". Accordingly, the following amendments have been made in the Guidelines, which are : Section A : Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations have been included in the definition of Qualified Institutional Buyers in Explanation 2 (ii) to clause 2.2.2 of Chapter II. Thus the Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board and State Industrial Development Corporations shall also be eligible to participate in public issues through the book building route as Qualified Institutional Buyers. Section B : This section provides for the exemption to Foreign Venture Capital Investors registered with the Board from lock -in requirements as specified in clause 4.14 of the Guidelines.

Abstain from indicating or assuring returns in any type of scheme, unless the offer document is explicit in this regard. 7. Maintain necessary infrastructure to support the AMCs in maintaining high service standards to investors, and ensure that critical operations such as forwarding forms and cheques to AMCs/registrars and despatch of statement of account and redemption cheques to investors are done within the time frame prescribed in the offer document and SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations. 8. Avoid colluding with clients in faulty business practices such as bouncing cheques, wrong claiming of dividend/redemption cheques, etc. 9. Avoid commission driven malpractices such as: (a) recommending inappropriate products solely because the intermediary is getting higher commissions therefrom. (b) encouraging over transacting and churning of mutual fund investments to earn higher commissions, even if they mean higher transaction costs and tax for investors. 10. Avoid making negative statements about any AMC or scheme and ensure that comparisons if any, are made with similar and comparable products. 11. Ensure that all investor related statutory communications (such as changes in fundamental attributes, exit/entry load, exit options, and other material aspects) are sent to investors reliably and on time. 12. Maintain confidentiality of all investor deals and transactions. 13. When marketing various schemes, remember that a client’s interest and suitability to their financial needs is paramount, and that extra commission or incentive earned should never form the basis for recommending a scheme to the client. 14. Intermediaries will not rebate commission back to investors and avoid attracting clients through temptation of rebate/gifts etc. 15. A focus on financial planning and advisory services ensures correct selling, and also reduces the trend towards investors asking for passback of commission. 16. All employees engaged in sales and marketing should obtain AMFI certification. Employees in other functional areas should also be encouraged to obtain the same certification.</td>

        <td>Efficiency improvement in data transfer requires the following: ?  Delivery of contract note <mark>information</mark><mark>amendment to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1891), SEBI permitted use of electronic contract notes (ECN) in the market as per circular dated December 15, 2000. Further,  SEBI  is  already  recommending  to  its  Board  to  allow  maintenance  of  records  in electronic form which would cover all the Regulations of SEBI. Market participants may be permitted to use electronic contract notes subject to them carrying the same details as a physical contract note. Also, the new ECN may include features/fields for Form  A  and  Form  B  type  of  contract  notes  to  differentiate  between  client  and  proprietary trades. The Committee is aware that under the current scenario there is a lack of adequate Certifying Agencies (CA) to digitally certify contract notes. However, as implementation of STP gets underway, we expect the market to come up with more CAs. An observation made here was that there were a few international players having the expertise of generating contract notes in electronic form. However, these ECNs were certified by CAs not registered in India. In this regard, a reference may also be made to the government to grant legal recognition to ECNs certified by an overseas CA as existing players related to capital market are global and do  not  have  an  existence  in  India.  The  Committee  has  listed  in  Annexure  III  the  various rules and regulation</mark>s as well as other statutes that require amendment. The Committee is of the  opinion  that  SEBI  should  take  steps  to  make  a  reference  to  the  respective  legislative authorities so that amendments, if any required, may be done at the earliest. The members of the committee were of the view that Stamp-duty payable on Contracts may need to be waived as a result of the conversion of the Contract Notes to Electronic form. This matter  comes  under  the  purview  of  respective  State  Governments  in  which  the  contract  is executed / initiated. Keeping in view the fact that issuance and maintenance of contract notes in  electronic  form  requires  a  considerable  one  time  and  recurring  investment,  imposition  of stamp duty would push up the transaction cost which is not desirable and may defeat the very purpose of introducing STP. SEBI may, therefore, consider writing to all State Governments for relaxing this Stamp-duty so as to reduce the transaction cost.</td>

        <td>The Group felt that if three stock exchanges in different regulatory regimes could be merged may be such a merger could be explored even in India by some of the stock exchanges. The Inter Connected Stock Exchange of India (ICSEI) had attempted such an exercise but could not succeed mainly because the order book remained split between the stock exchanges which are the 14 constituent stock exchanges of ICSEI and the order book of ICSEI. The splitting of the order book fragmented the market. Also, the clearing for the same security took place in multiple stock exchanges, which added to the cost. The Group therefore felt that some of the stock exchanges could undertake a more meaningful exercise following the example of a single order book and setting up of single clearing corporation at the national level or using the services of either Clearing Corporation / Clearing House of BSE and NSE. This exercise could serve another important economic purpose as the markets grow, as it is possible that the two large stock exchanges may raise the minimum capital requirement for an issue to be listed on these stock exchanges. Further in a competitive environment, there is a possibility of abolishing of concept of multiple listing and leaving the choice of listing in more than one stock exchange to the issuer. This would not leave any avenue for raising capital for a medium size company, which may have smaller issues. A stock exchange modeled on the Euronext could play an important economic role for the listing and <mark>trading</mark> of such issues. 9.43 The Group therefore was of the view that some of the stock exchanges could explore the possibility of merger on the lines of Euronext. The Group does not recommend any specific route as being mandatory as the choice should be dictated on commercial considerations. The Group however feels that it would be in national interest that the infrastructure available with the stock exchanges be put to best economic use. In case the stock exchanges adopt the Euronext model, SEBI will have to work out the eligibility criteria for the brokers, model rules and bye-laws for such an stock exchange, the risk containment measures, and the listing guidelines.    9.44 In sum, the Group is of the view that – a uniform model for corporatisation and demutualisation would have to be adopted by all the stock exchanges. This model should not be made applicable selectively only for a few stock exchanges; if the recommendations are adopted and suitable legislative changes carried out to implement the recommendations, the stock exchanges will be required to submit a scheme of demutualisation to SEBI by an appointed date, and non-compliance in this regard would result in lapse of recognition granted to an existing stock exchange, whether permanent or temporary; merger of stock exchanges, before or after demutualisation is a commercial decision and the choice should be left to the concerned stock exchanges and it is not within the purview of the Group to recommend a specific course of action. However, the Group strongly feels that corporatisation and demutualisation will facilitate the process of consolidation of stock exchanges; and while the Group does not wish to recommend measures which may provide an exit route to the members of the stock exchanges, any stock exchange which fails to comply with the requirement of corporatisation and demutualisation by the appointed date and is accordingly derecognised, will have to distribute its assets in accordance with the provisions of the respective articles/ rules of the stock exchange and the relevant tax laws shall become applicable. Legal changes required 9.45 The Group felt that some of the provisions in the various relevant statutes would have to be amended to implement the recommendations. Without these amendments it would be difficult to enforce the recommendations. The Group noted that the stock exchanges and the representatives of brokers have also suggested similar changes. The Group also noted that in several countries such as Australia and Singapore, a separate Act was passed to give effect to demutualisation. Among the statutes which require changes here are the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956, the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899. The Group therefore recommends that - the relevant provisions of the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956, the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899 be suitably amended to facilitate corporatisation and demutualisation of the stock exchanges and to grant fiscal exemptions to encourage this process. Acknowledgement The Group records its appreciation of the assistance received during its deliberations from the representatives of the various stock exchanges, broker associations, investor associations and the concerned officials of SEBI.    M.

The Strategic Action Plan has been drawn with four broad segments: a) Investors b) Market c) Intermediaries and d) Regulator in mind. The Plan designed after analysing the inadequacies in the existing structure and practices and bearing the market ethos in mind addresses major issues segregated into: Structural Issues Systemic Issues Operational Issues During the period April 2003 to November 2003, a number of initiatives have been taken with a view to achieve the targets under the Plan. The following are the significant developments ; T+2 rolling settlement was introduced in the Indian markets with effect from April 1, 2003. This would reduce the risk and would be beneficial to the investors. India joins a select group of six nations viz. South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, Chile and Mexico which are following a short settlement cycle. The Central Listing Authority (CLA) was constituted with Chief Justice of India (retd.) Shri. M. N. Venkatachaliah as the President. The Regulations have been notified and the CLA would become operational shortly. Trading in Interest Rate Derivatives was launched by the Hon’ble Minister of Finance and Department of Company Affairs. This instrument would provide a mechanism for banks and financial institutions to hedge their positions in a volatile interest rate regime. Mutual Funds were allowed to launch ‘ Fund of Funds’. This would provide an opportunity to a Mutual Fund to invest in the units of other Mutual Funds. Guidelines for Mutual Funds for investments in overseas equity markets have been issued. The disclosure regime for the Mutual Funds was further strengthened and in order to ensure that all important disclosures are made to the investors of the concerned schemes and their interests are protected in cases of consolidation of schemes by Mutual Funds. The entry norms for IPOs were strengthened to ensure better quality of issuers, the issue process was revamped to facilitate faster allotment, and quick listing. The notice period for book closure/record date has been reduced to 15 days (for demat shares) to facilitate corporate decision making and reduce time required for making rights offers. The arbitration mechanism at the exchanges has been revamped in order to expedite the process and ensure transparency. <mark>SEBI (Ombudsman) Regulations</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>trading</mark>.)

        <td>"This is a key component in devising a regulatory system which is both effective in pursuit of its objectives, and also which wins the respect and perhaps even the approval of the regulated community", Sir Davies said. Skilled regulatory resources are scarce anywhere, and particularly in developing countries. It is therefore absolutely crucial that those resources are deployed where they can make most impact, and where the need is greatest. Stressing the need for international regulatory cooperation, Sir Davies said that "it is no longer adequate for a regulator in any country to focus on domestic standards only. Any regulator must ensure that its practices are compatible with internationally agreed codes." The Governor of Maharashtra, His Excellency Shri Mohammed Fazal, said that "the role of SEBI is of prime importance to safeguard the interests of the common investor who is totally ignorant about the business environment and global trends and hence cannot assess the future of the industries". Appreciating the "metamorphosis from physical to electronic transactions", as a "welcome development", the Governor said that "this is a healthy step towards gaining the confidence of small investors for which SEBI needs to be congratulated". Tracing the growth of the securities market in India in general and SEBI in particular, Chairman, SEBI, Shri G.N. Bajpai said that "we need <mark>regulations to correct for identified market imperfections which produce sub-optimal outcomes and to prevent market failures". Explaining further on the need for regulation, Shri Bajpai said "regulation is necessary to develop market and once the market develops, it needs to be regulated. That is why many of the reform initiatives combined the elements of regulation and development. ." On liberalization versus regulation, the Chairman said that " there is an apparent contradiction that the reforms aim at liberalization while regulations appear to restrict liberalization. Liberalization does not mean scrapping of all codes and statutes, as some market participants may wish. It rather means replacement of one set by another set of more liberal code / statute, which allow full freedom to economic agents, but influence or prescribe the way they should carry out their activities, so that the liberalized markets operate in an efficient and fair manner and the risks of systemic failure are minimized. It is, however, desirable to keep in mind the contradiction to ensure that we do not resort to excessive regulation and regulations are designed and implemented properly. Otherwise the costs of regulation would exceed the benefits from regulation. ". "Reforms in true sense happened since early 1990s, that is, since the establishment of SEBI", Shri Bajpai said. "These reforms have been designed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders, including the government, the regulator, and the regulated", he added. Shri Bajpai also highlighted the reforms in the securities market in India viz. the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992 and issuance of Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) guidelines by SEBI, thereby the market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation, establishment of a statutory autonomous agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities and introduction of nation-wide on-line fully-automated screen based trading system (SBTS). "A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the participants are safe and market integrity is protected", Shri Bajpai said and gave examples of Reduction of Trading Cycle to T+2, dematerialization of stocks, introduction of derivatives, establishment of Settlement Guarantee Fund, setting up of the Central Listing Authority etc. On the future initiatives of SEBI, Shri Bajpai spoke about the setting up of a national institute to build a cadre of professionals to man the specialized functions in the securities market, corporatisation and demutualization of exchanges, introduction if market wide straight through processing from trade initiation to settlement, migration to T+1 rolling settlement, continuous review and upgradation of accounting standards, disclosures, corporate governance practices in the interest of investors, continuous review and amendment</mark> of various regulations to bring them in tune with dynamics of market requirements and introduction of new products in the market to meet all kinds of needs of market participants. Concluding his speech, Shri Bajpai said that "SEBI is working continuously and in close co-ordination with the regulated and the government, to improve market design to bring in further efficiency and transparency to market and make available newer and newer products to meet the varying needs of market participants, while protecting investors in securities. The aim is to make Indian securities market a model for other jurisdictions to follow and make SEBI the most dynamic and respected regulator globally."</td>

The  liberalized  scheme  will  allow  Indian individual  investors  to  explore  the  possibility  of  investing  in  offshore financial products.

The amendment seeks to simplify the existing framework by amending certain procedural anomalies that are prevailing in the provisions relating to Compulsory Delisting making it possible for stock exchanges to delist errant companies that are non-compliant with the provisions of listing agreement. Clarifications on the revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement SEBI has been receiving a number of requests/suggestions to bring about certain clarifications on few issues pertaining to the revised Clause 49 of the Listing agreement on corporate governance, the compliance date of which has been extended till December 31, 2005. After examination of the suggestions received, it is now proposed to bring about the following clarifications in Clause 49: The maximum time gap between two Board meetings has been increased from three months to four months. Sitting fees paid to non-executive directors as authorized by the Companies Act, 1956 would not require the approval of shareholders. Certification of internal controls and internal control systems by CEO/ CFO would be for the purpose for financial reporting. Revision of trading member position limits for stock based derivatives The current trading member position limit for stock based derivatives has been revised, based on the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee. The new limits are as follows For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit of Rs. 500 crore or more, the combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 300 crore, whichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 150 crore, whichever is lower. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit less than Rs. 500 crore, the combined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable market-wide position limit and futures position cannot exceed 20% of applicable market-wide position limit or Rs. 50 crore which ever is lower. The market-wide position limit and client level position limits however would remain the same as prescribed. The enhanced limits will enable participants, to hedge their positions more effectively, especially for stocks with large market capitalization and higher liquidity. Separate position limits have been built in for stock options in order to provide an impetus for the options market. Unique Identification Number (UIN) The Board decided to resume fresh registrations for obtaining Unique Identification Number (UIN) under SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations</mark>, 2003 (MAPIN), after considering the recommendations of the Committee set up by SEBI to examine the issues related to MAPIN.

This Report traces the historical background of the RSEs, discusses the present status of the RSEs, delineates the various regulatory initiatives taken from time to time for the revival of the RSEs along with the causes for their failure, details the meetings held with the representatives of the RSEs, BSE and NSE, outlines the various suggestions made by the representatives of the RSEs for their and their subsidiaries as well as the specific proposals submitted by BSE, NSE and ICSE to the Committee, summary of the deliberations of the Committee and  the recommendations of the Committee. It also discusses the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding of the stock exchanges and the recommendations of the Committee in this regard. 2.       The major recommendations of the Committee are as under :- i.         It does not serve either the interest of trade or public interest, to forcibly keep alive the recognition of an exchange which does not have any potential for survival and is keen for an exit option or is posing to be regulatory burden.  The RSEs may be classified into three categories, viz., (a)  Such of the RSEs which do not want to continue as an exchange, should be given an exit option by withdrawing their recognition upon a specific request or application made by them; (b) recognition should be withdrawn compulsorily for  such of the RSEs which are notorious for their rank indiscipline besides giving rise to serious regulatory concerns and (c) the recognition of those RSEs which have the potential and the willingness to participate in any alternate <mark>trading</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>SEBI (Criteria for Fit and Proper Person) Regulations</mark>, 2004. The holding by any foreign entity including FIIs would be subject to the overall policy of the Government on FDI. These recommendations would have to be incorporated suitably in the divestment regulations to be framed and notified by SEBI. xiv.  Self-listing should be permitted, either through the IPO route or by way of listing with appropriate exemptions from Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation)  Rules, 1957 (SCRR) in case a stock exchange does not make a public offer. The regulatory conflicts which are likely to arise will have to be dealt with by suitable provisions in the listing agreement of the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges will have to fully comply with the provisions of corporate governance incorporated in clause 49 of the listing agreement. Overseas listing will also be permitted after the exchange has been listed on the domestic exchange. 3.         The full text of the Report is available on SEBI’s website – www.sebi.gov.in. Comments, if any, on the aforesaid Report may be sent by email to rses@sebi.gov.in or by post so as to reach the following address by May 31, 2006:- Shri V.S.

(acquirer) and United Breweries (Holdings) Ltd., UB Overseas Ltd.(PACs) -<mark>SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations</mark><mark>information</mark> received from the acquirer and you, inter alia, mentions that though SEBI has not raised any queries about the open offer, it was yet to clear the offer document and therefore, as per notice sent to BSE, the schedule of activities shall be required to be revised. 3.         Your attention is drawn to regulation 16(xiv) of the captioned Regulations in terms of which the Public Announcement (PA) for the open offer should contain the disclosure to the effect that firm arrangement for financial resources required to implement the offer is already in place, including details regarding the sources of the funds whether domestic i.e from banks, financial institutions, or otherwise or foreign i.e., from Non-Resident Indians or otherwise. 4.         In the PA dated 05.06.07 in respect of the captioned offer, it was, inter alia, stated that “Acquirers have confirmed adequate financial resources will be made available to fulfill the financial obligations arising out of the open offer. Acquirers have agreed to make available the requisite funds to meet the obligation”. This shows that firm arrangements for adequate financial resources were not in place at the time of the public announcement. Similar disclosures were also made in the draft letter of offer submitted to SEBI vide your letter dated 19.06.07. However, till date, details of firm financial arrangements made by the acquirer to fulfill their obligations arising out of the open offer have not been furnished by you despite repeated reminders by SEBI in this regard. 5.         Under the circumstances, your sending notice to the BSE with the claim that the offer document is pending with SEBI and therefore the schedule of activities needs to be revised is not justified on your part, considering the fact that you have not complied with the above mentioned provisions of the Regulations. 6.         Regarding the statement that SEBI has not raised any queries about the open offer, we would like to point out that we had been constantly following up with your office vide email and telephone calls on various occasions for clarification on the details of the financial arrangements made for the open offer. Therefore, the aforesaid statement appearing in the news item implying that SEBI has not raised any queries is factually incorrect.</td>

        <td>Jan 30, 2008 PR No.: 24/2008 PR No.24/2008 SEBI Board Meeting The SEBI Board at its meeting held in Mumbai today,  approved the following: 1) <mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>regulations pertain to issue and listing of debt securities which are not convertible, either in whole or in part into equity instruments. They provide for a rationalized disclosure requirements and a reduction of certain onerous obligations erstwhile attached to an issue of debt securities. Regulations have been aimed at reducing time and unnecessary burden of issuance of these securities and according flexibility to issuers to structure their instruments, without diluting areas of regulatory concern. Key features of the Regulations are: Due diligence, proper disclosures and credit rating, the key elements of corporate debt issuances will be ensured by SEBI mainly through due diligence exercise by the merchant bankers. Where the equity of a company is listed, and such company wishes to issue debt instruments (whether by way of public offering or private placement), as large amount of company related information is already in public domain and material developments are available as per the equity listing agreement on a nearly continuous basis minimal incremental disclosures are sufficient. Where the equity of the issuer is not listed, and such a company raises debt capital (whether by way of public offering or private placement) detailed disclosures, are required. Offer to fifty or more persons shall require mandatory listing and specific disclosures in terms of the Regulations and a simplified listing agreement where the equity securities of such entity are listed. (2) SEBI (Public Offer and Listing of Securitized Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2008 The SCRA was amended in 2007 enabling SEBI to provide for disclosure based regulation for public issue of or listing of securitized debt instruments on the recognized stock exchanges. Accordingly, SEBI has made regulations in this regard. The regulations are principle based and have been made taking into account the market needs, cost of the transactions, competition policy, the professional expertise of credit rating agencies, disclosures and obligations of the parties involved in the transaction. Salient features of the regulations are as follows: (a) The special purpose distinct entity (the issuer) will be a trust and the.trustees thereof will require registration from SEBI. The instrument issued by the issuer to the investor shall acknowledge the beneficial interest of such investor in underlying debt or receivables assigned to the issuer. The issuer can undertake only the activities permitted by the regulations. (b) The regulations permit securitization of both existing as well as future receivables. (c) The regulations provide flexibility in terms of pay through / pass through structures. (d) In case of public issuances listing will be mandatory. The instruments issued on private placement basis may also be listed subject to the compliance of simplified provisions of the regulations. (e) Regulations require strict segregation of assets of each scheme. (3) Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of such regulations is similar to one another. The new regulations seek to consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/regulation process of intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below­ :- > 1.                  Permanent Registration Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent. 2. Registration for multiple activities The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified. 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts Part 1 of the form will be disclosed and available to the public and Part II will contain such information which will be retained with the Board as regulatory filing. 4. Fit and Proper person requirements The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based. 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the regulations. Consequently the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty) Regulations, 2002 will be repealed. The procedure for suspension/cancellation has been simplified and the time taken in this regard is sought to be reduced. 4) Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 for removal of  initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes The SEBI Board approved the proposal for removal of charging and amortization of initial issue expense in close-ended mutual fund schemes. Accordingly, henceforth, all mutual fund schemes shall meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load. Consequently, waiver of load for direct applicants will also be available in close-ended schemes. This would bring in more transparency and better upfront disclosures to the investors in terms of the expenses charged in close-ended schemes. Necessary amendment</mark>s to the respective regulation are being issued. Mumbai January 30, 2008</td>

        <td>Securities  and Exchange Board of India Consultative Paper <mark>amendments to SEBI on (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 1.   On  1st  January  2008,  SEBI  came  out  with  a  consultative  paper  to  introduce “short swing profit” regulations by amendment to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 and sought public comments on the same. In addition to the proposal of 1st January, public comment is being sought on several other proposed amendments to the regulations. 2.  Amendments were carried out in 2002 to the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992 (the regulations) to introduce a wide range of prophylactics and corporate governance norms. 3.  Over the course of the past few years since the amendment, there have been some new learnings in terms of the way the regulations have played out in the market.  The  key  amendments  brought  in  processes  which  would  reduce  the possibilities of insider trading by means of an institutionalized methodology e.g. pre-clearance of trades, black-out  windows  of  trading,  disclosure  of  buy/sell  by certain  insiders,  appointment  of  compliance  officer  and  a  catena  of  other provisions. 4.  There  have  been  several  instances  of  persons  of  high  integrity  committing unintended violations of these provisions. Thus, we need to be sensitive to the -1- Securities and Exchange Board of India fact that perhaps the norms have been set so high that even experts are unable to  keep  track  and  be  in  compliance  with  these  standards.  This  is  an  important issue as criminal jeopardy is attached to such corporate governance violations. In addition, there is a need to move towards a more principle based approach to regulations rather than a rule based approach, particularly in matters of corporate governance. 5.  In addition, some regulations are also proposed to be introduced. Background 6.  The  2002  amendments  to  the  Regulations  provide  extensive  suggestions  and regulations.  Most  of  the  good  governance  provisions  are  provided  for  as mandatory provisions. Briefly, the good governance regulations provide for: a) Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. b) Appointment of a compliance officer. c) Setting forth policies and procedure to restrict the possibility of abuse of insider trading. d) Monitoring and pre-clearance of trades by the designated persons. e) Restrict trading by such insiders within a certain period of time i.e. before corporate announcements, buybacks etc. are made. f) The company has to convey all the significant insider activity and corporate disclosure in a uniform publicly accessible means to the public – and to the stock exchange. g) Chinese walls within a firm to prevent one part of the firm which deals in sensitive information from going to other parts of the firm which have an inherent conflict of interest with such other parts. h) Minimum holding period of securities by insiders. i) No selective disclosure to analysts. Wide dissemination of information. -2- Securities and Exchange Board of India 7.  Provided  below  is  an  analysis  of  some  of  the  provisions  of  good  governance regulations and proposals for amendments. Officer, director and substantial shareholder to disclose their holding on certain events or at certain intervals. 8.  There should be some coordination between the requirements of acquisition/sale of  shares  reported  in  these  regulations  with  the  requirements  of  the  takeover regulations. In fact the takeover reporting is broader since it mandates reporting by any person over certain thresholds and also requires reporting by a group – a concept  not  introduced  in  these  Regulations.  However,  the  insider  trading Regulations  provide  for  disclosure  of  smaller  amounts  and  provides  for disclosure  on  selling  shares  (something  which  the  takeover  code  does  not mandate). Proposal:  It  is  suggested  that  a  purchase  disclosure  made  under  either regulations (with the same or higher level of disclosure) should be deemed to be is  also  proposed good  disclosure  under the harmonization between the two in terms of threshold limits set.
