        <td>Considering the important role played by Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) in fulfilling the social objective of increased home ownership and supporting the economy by creating demand for construction of new homes, it has been decided that an additional exposure to financial services sector (over and above the existing 30%) not exceeding 10% of the net assets of the scheme in debt oriented mutual fund schemes will be allowed by way of increase in exposure to HFCs only, subject to the condition that such securities issued by HFCs are rated AA and above and these HFCs are registered with National Housing Bank (NHB). However, the total investment in HFCs cannot exceed 30% of the net assets of the scheme. II.          Review of the Debt Limit Allocation Mechanism for FIIs Regarding the review of the debt limit allocation mechanism for FIIs, the Board took note of the following: (i)    With effect from January 01, 2014, the FIIs shall be allowed to re-invest during the calendar year to the extent of 50% of their debt holdings at the end of the previous calendar year. (ii)  The utilization period for Government Debt and Corporate Debt limits will be reduced to 30 days and 60 days respectively. (iii)  In the FII Debt limit, the unutilised limit in respect of Corporate Debt infra long term bonds category may be availed by the FIIs/Sub Accounts without obtaining prior SEBI approval till the overall FII investments reaches 90% of the limit, after which the auction mechanism shall be initiated for allocation of remaining limits. III.          Suggestions to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for Foreign Portfolio   Investments such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. With a view to rationalise/ harmonise different routes for foreign portfolio investments, SEBI will prepare a draft guideline based on the guidance of the Working Group on Foreign Investment in India (WGFII), for consideration of the Government so that uniform guidelines are made for various categories of investors such as FII, FVCI, NRI, QFI etc. IV.          Expansion of asset classes which can be held in demat form (i)  There have been demands for dematerialization of assets/records other than securities, such as, Warehouse receipts, Fixed Deposits with banks and corporates, Insurance Policies, Investment products of Post Office, etc. (ii) Under Regulation 7(c) of <mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories & Participants) Regulations</mark><mark>information</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations</mark>, 1996 (D&P Regulations) lay down various obligations on the part of Issuers or their agents such as entering into agreement with the Depositories, carrying out reconciliation of share capital, carrying out timely dematerialization of shares, maintaining proper records etc. It has been seen in the past that there are instances of non compliance such as lack of reconciliation of issued or listed capital and actual share capital by the Issuer company and its appointed RTA. (ii) In order to enable appropriate action by SEBI in such cases (currently possible under the Depositories Act), the Board approved proposal to suitably amend the D&P Regulations to enable SEBI to take appropriate action against non-compliant issuers or their agents under the D&P Regulations and to empower Depositories to take appropriate action against such issuer or agent as per their Bye-laws.</td>

        <td>Jun 25, 2013 PR No.: 60/2013 The SEBI Board met in Mumbai today and took the following main decisions: 1. Amendments to <mark>SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>SEBI (ICDR) Regulations</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>trading</mark><mark>amendment in Securities and Exchange Board of India(Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 with respect to debt segment on stock exchanges i.         Pursuant to SEBI circular dated January 24, 2013, Debt Segment has been  introduced on NSE and MCX-SX to provide for trading, clearing, settlement,           reporting etc of trades in debt instruments. ii.         After introduction of Debt Segment on exchanges, market feedback indicated  need for further clarity and ease of participation as the debt segment is in  nascent stage of evolution and needs further impetus to bring it at par with the other segments of the Exchange. In view of market this, the Board considered and approved the following proposals: (a)  For membership of debt segment, the net worth of regulated entities shall be computed as specified by  their sectoral regulator. (b)  In respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no additional deposit shall be required. For those entities who are not already a stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member and seek to be clearing members/ self clearing members of the debt segment, the deposit requirement shall be Rs.10 lakhs. This requirement may be reviewed after a period of five years. (c) Similarly, in respect of stockbrokers or clearing members/ self clearing members who are already members of clearing corporation, no annual fee shall be payable for taking membership of debt segment of clearing corporation. Any new entity which does not have membership as stock broker/ clearing member/ self clearing member in any segment and seeks membership on debt segment of clearing corporation for the first time,  annual fee of rupees fifty thousand shall be applicable every financial year till its registration  is in force. 6.  Single Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products The Board approved the proposal to have single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products after following a fair and transparent procedure. Further, in order to facilitate the recognition of single SRO for Distributors of Mutual Fund Products and to avoid delay, it has been decided to have a cut off time for accepting applications for being recognized as SRO. 7. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding direct trading in debt segment of Stock Exchanges The Board has approved the proposal to permit the asset management companies managing schemes of mutual funds to take membership of debt segment of stock exchanges under 'Proprietary Trading Member' (PTM) category. However, this will be only to undertake trades directly on behalf of such schemes managed by them. 8. Amendment to SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, regarding appointment of custodian belonging to the same group Presently, mutual funds are not allowed to appoint a custodian belonging to the same group, if the sponsor of the mutual fund or its associates hold 50 per cent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of such a custodian or where 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates. The Board has decided that the custodian in which the sponsor of a mutual fund or its associates are holding 50 percent or more of the voting rights of the share capital of the custodian, would be allowed to act as custodian subject to fulfilling the following conditions i.e. (a) the sponsor should have net worth of atleast Rs.20,000 crore at all points of time, (b) 50 per cent or more of the directors of the custodian shall be those who do not represent the interests of the sponsor or its associates, (c) neither the custodian nor the asset management company of a mutual fund shall be a subsidiary of each other, (d) no person shall be a director of both the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund and (e) the custodian and the asset management company of a mutual fund shall sign an undertaking that they will act independently of each other in their dealings with the schemes. 9.  Limited purpose membership to mutual fund distributors The Board decided to allow Mutual fund distributors to take limited purpose membership of Stock Exchange with lesser financial and compliance burden to use infrastructure of Stock Exchanges for distribution & redemption of Mutual Fund Units. To reduce the financial and compliance burden on these limited purpose members requirements such as SEBI registration, compliance as member of stock exchange, paid up capital and Base Minimum Capital etc, would not be applicable. However stock exchanges may prescribe suitable eligibility criteria in this regard including net worth requirements, membership fee etc. This limited purpose membership would be granted on the basis of ARNs, granted to Mutual Fund Distributor by AMFI. Further to address the possible risk of default by these limited purpose members, they will not be allowed to handle pay in and pay out of funds as well as units on behalf of investor. Pay in & payout of funds & units would be directly from/ to the account of the investors. 10.  Amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012 The CPSS-IOSCO (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – International Organisation of Securities Commissions) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) require that there should be a clear legal basis regarding (i) when settlement finality (defined as point of time after which a settlement is final and irrevocable) occurs, (ii) netting and (iii) the right of an FMI to use and dispose of, collateral, notwithstanding bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants or their clients. The same has been identified as gaps in the legal framework governing operations of Clearing Corporations in India by the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of India. In order to address the same and to provide sound legal basis for netting, settlement finality and right of Clearing Corporations over collaterals, the Board approved the proposal to appropriately amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012.  The Board also decided to propose to the Government amendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to further strengthen the clearing and settlement framework. 11.       Amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 I.          Giving effect to the announcement in Budget for FY 2013-14 by  Union Finance Minister on angel investor pools, the Board approved amendments to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) thereby  providing a framework for registration and regulation</mark><mark>SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations</mark>, 2012. ii.   Individual angel investors shall be required to have early stage investment experience/ experience as a serial entrepreneur/ be a senior management professional with 10 years experience. They shall also be required to have net tangible assets of atleast Rs. 2 crore. Corporate angel investors shall be required to have Rs. 10 crore net worth or be a registered AIF/VCF. iii.   Angel Funds shall have a corpus of atleast Rs.10 crore (as against Rs. 20 crore for other AIFs) and minimum investment by an investor shall be Rs. 25 lakh (may be accepted over a period of maximum 3 years) as against Rs. 1 crore for other AIFs. Further, the continuing interest by sponsor/manager in the Angel Fund shall be not less than 2.5% of the corpus or Rs. 50 lakh, whichever is lesser. iv.  For ensuring investments are genuine angel investments, angel funds shall invest only in investee companies which: a. are incorporated in India and are not more than 3 years old; and b. have a turnover not exceeding Rs.25 crore; and c.  are unlisted, and d.  are not promoted, sponsored or related to an Industrial Group whose group turnover is in excess of Rs.300 crore, and e. has no family connection with the investors proposing to invest in the company. v.  Further, investment in an investee company by an angel fund shall be not less than Rs.50 lakh and not more than Rs.5 crore and shall be required to be held for a period of at least 3 years.</td>

(V)  Risk based supervision of market intermediaries The Board took note of the recommendations viz. simple, formalized and risk based supervision approach for the market intermediaries as suggested by M/s. Oliver Wyman, the Consultant appointed by SEBI to study and make recommendations, inter-alia with the objective of designing best practice regulatory approach, and the report of the internal taskforce of SEBI formed to implement the  recommendations. Based on above, SEBI is in the process of formalizing its risk based approach towards supervision of market intermediaries which will be in alignment with the global best practices. The system will be implemented in a phased manner. (VI)  Granting Single Registration to Depository Participants With a view to further simplify the registration requirements for Depository Participants (DPs), the Board has approved the policy of granting single registration for the application of initial registration as well as the permanent registration for operating with both the Depositories. Currently, the Depository participants are required to obtain separate registration for both the depositories. Further the applicants are granted initial registration for five years and then permanent registrations. As per the new policy SEBI would process the registration application only for the first time initial or permanent registration, as the case may be,  through one depository and subsequent permissions to act as a DP of other depository, shall be granted by the concerned Depository after complying with the prescribed requirements. Thus, there will be a single SEBI registration for DP to operate in both the Depositories in India.</td>

(VI)  Granting Single Registration to Depository Participants With a view to further simplify the registration requirements for Depository Participants (DPs), the Board has approved the policy of granting single registration for the application of initial registration as well as the permanent registration for operating with both the Depositories. Currently, the Depository participants are required to obtain separate registration for both the depositories. Further the applicants are granted initial registration for five years and then permanent registrations. As per the new policy SEBI would process the registration application only for the first time initial or permanent registration, as the case may be,  through one depository and subsequent permissions to act as a DP of other depository, shall be granted by the concerned Depository after complying with the prescribed requirements. Thus, there will be a single SEBI registration for DP to operate in both the Depositories in India.</td>
