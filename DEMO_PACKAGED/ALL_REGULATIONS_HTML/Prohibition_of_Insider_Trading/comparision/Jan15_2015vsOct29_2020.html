This  provision  would  enable  the  formulation  of  a  trading  plan  by  aninsider to enable him to plan for trades to be executed in future.  By doing so, the possession ofunpublished price sensitive information when a trade under a  trading plan is actually executedwould  not  prohibit  the  execution  of  such  trades  that  he  had  pre-decided  even  before  theunpublished price sensitive information came into being.(2)Such trading plan shall:–(i)not  entail  commencement  of  trading  on  behalf  of  the  insider  earlier  than  sixmonths from the public disclosure of the plan;It is intended that to get the benefit of a trading plan, a cool-off period ofsix  months  is  necessary.  Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublishedprice  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  thetrading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonableperiod for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come intobeing  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  itshould  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grantimmunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublishedprice sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementationof the same.(ii)not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the lastday of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer ofthe securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results;Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general ruleprohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitiveinformation, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonableperiod  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublishedprice sensitive information.(iii)entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months;It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcementsof  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  areasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is feltthat a reasonable time would be twelve months.(iv)not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  inexistence;It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plansoperating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to timethe  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generallyavailable  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiatemore than one plan covering the same time period.(v)set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to betraded  along  with  the  nature  of  the  trade  and  the  intervals  at,  or  dates  on  which  suchtrades shall be effected; andIt  is  intended  that  while  regulations  should  not  be  too  prescriptive  andrigid  about  what  a  trading  plan  should  entail,  they  should  stipulate  certain  basicparameters  that  a  trading  plan  should  conform  to  and  within  which,  the  plan  may  beformulated with full flexibility.  The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e.acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.  The  trading  plan  may  set  out  the  value  ofsecurities or the number of securities to be invested or divested.  Specific dates or specifictime intervals may be set out in the plan.(vi)not entail trading in securities for market abuse.from bringing proceedings  for  market abuse. For instance, in  the event of manipulativetiming  of  the  release  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  ensure  that  tradingunder a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected,it  would  be  open  to  initiate  proceedings  for  alleged  breach  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of</p></td>
